1
00:00:00,42 --> 00:00:00,42


2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,98
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

3
00:00:56,98 --> 00:00:58,392
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,685
Let me drive.

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,104
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

6
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,608
Are you coming or not?

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,381
It's too crowded.

8
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,300
I thought you were starving.

9
00:01:33,93 --> 00:01:35,304
Let's go someplace quiet.

10
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,15
Okay.

11
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,195
What are we doing?

12
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:57,117
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

13
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,997
- You seem weird. Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,591
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

15
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,802
- I'm cold.
- You're cold on the Fourth of July?

16
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,392
Fuck off and die!

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,818
- What?
- "Fuck off and die"?

18
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,613
Shut up.

19
00:03:00,97 --> 00:03:02,182
Was that car at the drive-in?

20
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,895
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

21
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,488
- Do you want me to tell him to leave?
- Stay in the car.

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,06
- Was that your husband?
- No.

23
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,95
Who was that, Darlene?

24
00:03:41,13 --> 00:03:43,98
Don't worry about it.

25
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,602
- Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
- It's nothing.

26
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,789
Oh, shit.

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,419
Let's go.

28
00:04:16,06 --> 00:04:17,216
Now, D.

29
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,979
Get your wallet.

30
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,615
Man, you really creeped us out.

31
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,889
{Y:i}- Vallejo Police Department.
- I want to report a double murder.

32
00:05:47,14 --> 00:05:48,599
{Y:i}May I have your name
and where you are calling...

33
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,18
{Y:i}If you go one mile east
on Columbus Parkway,

34
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,396
{Y:i}a public park,
you'll find kids in a brown car.

35
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,108
{Y:i}They were shot with a 9mm Luger.

36
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,320
{Y:i}I also killed those kids last year.

37
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,489
{Y:i}Goodbye.

38
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,509
Spit.

39
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,94
Come on, buddy.

40
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,181
- I swallowed it.
- Why?

41
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,682
It was minty.

42
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,186
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

43
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,605
Lunch box.

44
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,608
- Why am I not going on the bus?
- Because we're late.

45
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,905
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.

46
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,783
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?

47
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,203
- No, not really.
- Oh, that's honest.

48
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,207
Learn a lot.

49
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,295
There will be a test tonight!

50
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,582
Morning.

51
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,03
- Morning.
- Morning.

52
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,984
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

53
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,115
Editorial in two.

54
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,188
Good morning, gentlemen.

55
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,481
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

56
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,608
Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe

57
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,194
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.

58
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,905
Mr. Graysmith.

59
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,783
Horrid.

60
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,993
Horrid.

61
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,287
Not so horrid.

62
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,81
All right.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

63
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,503
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

64
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:50,716
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

65
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,92
That's a crime.

66
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,803
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

67
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,181
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

68
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,17
You need to see this.

69
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,191
Go get the publisher.

70
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,400
"Dear Editor,

71
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,610
"This is the murderer

74

"To prove I killed them,

00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,995
"I shall state some facts
which only I and the police know.

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,415
"Christmas,

77
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,792
"Ten shots were fired.

00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,712
"The boy was on his back

79
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,88
"The girl..."

80
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,302
Would you read that, please?

81
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,97
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

82
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,891
"Fourth of July.

"One, girl was

"The boy was also shot in the knee.

85

"Brand name of ammo was Western.

"Here is part of a cipher.

"The other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to the editors of

88
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,407
{Y:i}"the Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.

89
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,286
"I want you to print this cipher

90
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,789
"In this cipher is my identity.

00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,416
"If you do not print this cipher

00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:12,506
F-R-Y, "First of Aug '69
I will go on a kill rampage Fry night.

00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:17,10
"I will cruise around all weekend

"then move on to kill again

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,307
"until I end up with
a dozen people over the weekend."

96
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,518
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

97
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,398
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

98
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,693
Today's August first.

99
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,403
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.

100
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,197
{Y:i}If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.

101
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,408
AI, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.

102
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,285
And not running this
might make him do that.

103
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,912
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.

104
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,581
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

105
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,708
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,

106
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,917
what does that say to people?

107
00:11:49,01 --> 00:11:52,212
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

108
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,299
- Paul?
- What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

109
00:11:56,91 --> 00:11:58,385
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.

110
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,804
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.

111
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,183
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

112
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,393
All right.

113
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,605
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?

114
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,898
Oh, yeah.

115
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,698
{Y:i}Hi, this is Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

116
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,784
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.

117
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,703
Thank you.

118
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,288
Sergeant Mulanax.

119
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,81
{Y:i}Sergeant, Paul Avery from
the San Francisco Chronicle.

120
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,291
I just wanted to check

121
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,418
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide

122
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,213
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.

123
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,380
Shit.

124
00:12:36,06 --> 00:12:37,299
You guys got one, too?

125
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,595
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.

126
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,679
{Y:i}AI's on the phone with the Examiner.

127
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,181
They got the same letter
with a different code.

128
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,390
{Y:i}So did Times-Herald.

129
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,809
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.

130
00:12:48,18 --> 00:12:49,603
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

131
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,189
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...

132
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,191
I think it's "Mayhew."
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.

133
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,400
The murder weapons?

134
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,403
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.

135
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,615
{Y:i}I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

136
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,493
{Y:i}The Examiner's going,
but won't go front page.

137
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,789
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

138
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,00
Robert! We need the cartoon.

139
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,05
- You're not finished?
- No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

140
00:13:17,89 --> 00:13:18,799
Thieriot's still here.

141
00:13:19,07 --> 00:13:20,92
Really?

142
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,720
The first edition
is off the floor in 10, Charles.

143
00:13:27,99 --> 00:13:28,600
Give us a sec.

144
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,188
Okay, re-plate.

145
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,191
We'll go on page four.

146
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,196
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?

147
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,198
He won't give his name.

148
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,201
Morti's? Anyone?

149
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,495
- That's where I'm heading.
- All right.

150
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,482
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

151
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,412
Grab your book.

152
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,501
Now go get your jammies on.

153
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,588
{Y:i}All right, people, listen up.

154
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:45,219
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.

155
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,888
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

156
00:14:48,13 --> 00:14:50,390
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

157
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,18
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

158
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,607
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

159
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,616
- Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
- Okay.

160
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,498
You wanna give it a go?

161
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,586
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

162
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,06
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

163
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,884
Paul Avery.

164
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,305
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

165
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,602
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

166
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,812
Who cracked it?

167
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,981
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

168
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,317
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

169
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,405
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

170
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,784
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

171
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,787
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

172
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,916
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

173
00:15:57,1000 --> 00:16:01,587
"The best part of it is that when I die,

174
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,715
"I will be reborn in paradise.

175
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,93
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

176
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,181
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

177
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,309
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife."

178
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,311
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

179
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,607
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.

180
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,984
- What is that at the bottom?
- Leftovers.

181
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,694
Maybe an anagram.

182
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,713
How does one do that?

183
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,883
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

184
00:16:49,09 --> 00:16:52,95
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

185
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,306
Dangerous animal.

186
00:16:55,98 --> 00:16:56,683
Dangerous animal.

187
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,521
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

188
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,488
- Paul.
- Yes, Templeton.

189
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,698
- Editorial, now.
- Very well.

190
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,410
Another letter.

191
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,789
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

192
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,919
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

193
00:17:24,02 --> 00:17:26,04
And he gave himself a name.

194
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,320
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

195
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,697
But at some point,

196
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,992
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

197
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,785
So they flooded it.

198
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,790
- But there's an entire...
- Hidden city under the water.

199
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,209
We were here last spring, remember?

200
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,711
Oh, yeah.

201
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,719
Somebody else is here.

202
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,512
It is a public park.

203
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,309
I think he's watching us.

204
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,519
Well, we're very good-looking.

205
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,818
Where'd he go?

206
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,198
He went behind that tree.

207
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,617
All right. So he's taking a leak.

208
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,501
He's coming towards us.

209
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,505
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

210
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,798
Don't move.

211
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,801
- I want your money and your car keys.
- Okay.

212
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,95
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

213
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,682
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

214
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,687
Here.

215
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,484
You're welcome to everything I have.

216
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,490
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

217
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,909
Maybe I could write you a check?

218
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,81
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

219
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,417
You know, I might be able to help you.

220
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,586
Even more than you might think.

221
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,797
He's a sociology major.

222
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,884
Pre-law, actually.

223
00:19:38,95 --> 00:19:39,513
Oh, keys.

224
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,807
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.

225
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,810
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

226
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,191
Here's the keys.

227
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,486
Don't get up.

228
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,613
I want her to tie you up.

229
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:01,785
Okay.

230
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,600
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.

231
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,894
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'm not.

232
00:20:27,19 --> 00:20:29,605
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

233
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,690
I'm not doing anything, okay?

234
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,984
I'm not afraid to kill again.

235
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,820
Look away.

236
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,413
What was the name of that prison?

237
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,794
Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

238
00:20:54,04 --> 00:20:55,589
I'm taking your car.

239
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,591
I'm going to Mexico.

240
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,801
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

241
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,887
Okay, you have everything that I have.

242
00:21:02,12 --> 00:21:04,806
We have done everything
that you've asked.

243
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,183
It's okay. It's okay.

244
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,602
She tied you loose, didn't she?

245
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,899
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

246
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,485
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

247
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,111
We could freeze.

248
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,205
Okay, you all done?

249
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,00
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,

250
00:21:32,84 --> 00:21:34,86
was that thing even loaded?

251
00:21:45,97 --> 00:21:47,15
It's okay.

252
00:21:47,99 --> 00:21:49,101
This is all gonna be okay.

253
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,800
{Y:i}Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.

254
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:25,596
{Y:i}I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann-Ghia...

255
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,486
{Y:i}Napa Police Department.

256
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,782
{Y:i}I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.

257
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,704
{Y:i}They are two miles north
of park headquarters.

258
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:54,291
{Y:i}They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.

259
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,03
{Y:i}I'm the one that did it.

260
00:22:58,86 --> 00:23:00,214
{Y:i}43L2 has a male victim with him.

261
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,883
{Y:i}Piner's ambulance
has been dispatched.

262
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,11
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

263
00:23:06,94 --> 00:23:08,514
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?

264
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,15
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

265
00:23:10,98 --> 00:23:13,185
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

266
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,187
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

267
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,690
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?

268
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,317
Kid at the lake.

269
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,194
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

270
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,612
God, that's a hell of a get-up.

271
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,114
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.

272
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,491
Now I just got to type it up.

273
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,493
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

274
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,411
We've got to read it.

275
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,00
- What's that?
- That's the Zodiac at the lake.

276
00:23:37,84 --> 00:23:38,502
What's the story with the kid?

277
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,04
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

278
00:23:41,88 --> 00:23:42,214
- Graysmith?
- Yeah, what is it?

279
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,799
He's a fucking boy scout.

280
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,93
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

281
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,719
- And he's back.
- I knew it.

282
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,96
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all."

283
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,305
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

284
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,683
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game.

285
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,811
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

286
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:56,895
People.

287
00:23:57,20 --> 00:23:58,981
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game.

288
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,192
- Who's that?
- That's Count Zaroff.

289
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,403
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

290
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,782
{Y:i}And that will be
all for the news on the 20.

291
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,201
{Y:i}We've got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties:

292
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:15,414
{Y:i}Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.

293
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,708
{Y:i}So please, everyone, stay safe.

294
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,86
{Y:i}Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?

295
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,214
{Y:i}Heck no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.

296
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,884
{Y:i}What scares me
is those hippies out in the Haight

297
00:24:27,92 --> 00:24:28,886
{Y:i}with their free love and weird clothes.

298
00:24:29,11 --> 00:24:31,13
{Y:i}We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

299
00:24:31,96 --> 00:24:33,390
{Y:i}You know, I think
that was really offensive.

300
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,100
{Y:i}It's not just farm kids.

301
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,102
{Y:i}These are nice, clean-cut young people.

302
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,605
{Y:i}Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here, Alfred.

303
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,690
{Y:i}Well, that last guy was.

304
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,693
{Y:i}We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay.

305
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,280
{Y:i}Unlike in the city where you have
Satanists running around.

306
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,909
{Y:i}Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

307
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,702
{Y:i}Amber from Oakland,
what do you think?

308
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,995
{Y:i}I don't really know,

309
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,207
{Y:i}but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.

310
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,01
{Y:i}But I think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldn't have printed

311
00:25:01,84 --> 00:25:02,920
{Y:i}anything that the Zodiac
has been doing.

312
00:25:03,03 --> 00:25:06,89
{Y:i}That they're just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers.

313
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,383
{Y:i}Well, the Zodiac did demand
they print his letters

314
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,93
{Y:i}or he'd kill more people.

315
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,512
{Y:i}Yeah, but he would have
done it anyway,

316
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,180
{Y:i}whether they printed it or not, I think.

317
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,681
{Y:i}An interesting point.

318
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,808
{Y:i}So, what do you think he'll do next?

319
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:41,83
{Y:i}- San Francisco Police Department.
- Yes. There's a fight in a cab!

320
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,417
{Y:i}What is your location?

321
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,504
{Y:i}3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.

322
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,297
{Y:i}One's drunk and
we think he's robbing him.

323
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,592
{Y:i}- Is the crime still in progress?
- Yes, please hurry.

324
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,720
Oh, my God, look!

325
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,995
Nuts!

326
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,83
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

327
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,794
{Y:i}Cabbie's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.

328
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,88
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.

329
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,216
- She can vouch.
- Go put on the Folgers.

330
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,718
{Y:i}You'll pick me up?

331
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,595
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

332
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,398
- I just got to sleep.
- Suspect's Negro, male adult.

333
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,984
WaIt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.

334
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,987
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

335
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,405
Crackers.

336
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,286
You ever try Japanese food?

337
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,80
What do you mean, like teriyaki?
No, like the urchin.

338
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,499
- Raw fish.
- I'm eating here, Bill.

339
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:08,921
- I always wanted to try it.
- So, why don't you?

340
00:27:09,04 --> 00:27:10,881
Haven't got around to it.

341
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,691
Evening, gents.
A lovely night for a botched robbery.

342
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,402
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.

343
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,614
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.

344
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,993
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

345
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,204
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

346
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,206
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

347
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,290
How'd you know his name?

348
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,418
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.

349
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,03
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,

350
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,381
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

351
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,882
- Coroner's here.
- Any witnesses?

352
00:27:54,07 --> 00:27:57,511
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

353
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,96
- Did they hear a shot?
- No.

354
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,514
They first saw him in the front seat,

355
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,307
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

356
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:05,310
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,

357
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,187
described him as a white male, glasses,

358
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,481
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

359
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,400
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.

360
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,402
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

361
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,488
- We already corrected it.
- Oh, well, that's good.

362
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,907
- You guys need anything else?
- No. Get out of here.

363
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,993
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

364
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,787
- Wait, it's your birthday?
- Yep.

365
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,998
- That's great. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

366
00:28:26,81 --> 00:28:29,84
- Body or scene?
- It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

367
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,795
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.

368
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,881
- We got some blood over here.
- Prints?

369
00:28:34,06 --> 00:28:35,799
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

370
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:38,719
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

371
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,180
- Suspect's?
- There's blood on them.

372
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,807
- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah, Dave.

373
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,100
You through over there,
can I get in there?

374
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,810
Yeah, I'm all set.

375
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,605
- Who rolled him?
- Stewarts.

376
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,697
I got a single 9mm casing.

377
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,120
Yeah, Luger.

378
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,997
Nothing from the crowd.

379
00:29:07,80 --> 00:29:10,00
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

380
00:29:10,83 --> 00:29:13,420
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

381
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,06
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

382
00:29:16,89 --> 00:29:18,884
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

383
00:29:19,09 --> 00:29:20,302
Right here.

384
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,516
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

385
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,788
Lighting's the same over here,

386
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,415
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

387
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,293
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

388
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,503
He pulls over.

389
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,380
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

390
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:57,881
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

391
00:29:58,06 --> 00:29:59,299
when I shoot him. May I?

392
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,718
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

393
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,513
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

394
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,598
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

395
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:07,891
All right. So, either way,

396
00:30:08,16 --> 00:30:09,685
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

397
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,980
- So, why do you get in the front seat?
- For the money.

398
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,106
But he's dead.

399
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,899
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

400
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,193
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

401
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,696
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

402
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,906
- I'm an idiot.
- But you're not an idiot.

403
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,700
You waited for him to put it in park.

404
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,994
- Right. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

405
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,581
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.

406
00:30:31,81 --> 00:30:34,418
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

407
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,797
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

408
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,508
- Animal crackers?
- They're in the car.

409
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,802
I'm saving those for later.

410
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,95
Fine.

411
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,312
- Are you a reporter?
- No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

412
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,898
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,

413
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,192
one at a time and preferably alone?

414
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,194
They just saw a man murdered.

415
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,196
I understand.

416
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,780
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

417
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,199
Yeah, and he had a rag.

418
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,701
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

419
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:11,205
- Did you get a chance to see his face?
- I did.

420
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,706
Well, sort of.

421
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,502
Did you remember what he looked like?

422
00:31:18,03 --> 00:31:20,05
- Normal.
- Yeah.

423
00:31:20,88 --> 00:31:21,298
"Normal"?

424
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,697
{Y:i}"This is the Zodiac speaking.

425
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,699
{Y:i}"I am the murderer of the taxi driver

426
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,703
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

427
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,289
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

428
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:59,294
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

429
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,05
"The S.F. Police could have
caught me last night

430
00:32:02,89 --> 00:32:03,590
"if they had searched the park properly

431
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,10
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles."

432
00:32:07,94 --> 00:32:08,595
- Gentlemen.
- Dave.

433
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,597
Paul. Where's the shirt?

434
00:32:12,15 --> 00:32:13,600
Right there, boss.

435
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,395
There's your rag the kids talked about.

436
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,480
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

437
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,983
- Is this on the record?
- Well, what do you think?

438
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:23,110
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

439
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,820
Gets worse.

440
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,989
Robert, do you have a deadline?

441
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,199
What does he mean, it gets worse?

442
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,701
Read the last part.

443
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,995
"School children make nice targets.

444
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,414
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

445
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,207
"Just shoot out the front tire

446
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,710
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

447
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,296
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?

448
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,298
- School board.
- All right.

449
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,717
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

450
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,303
Anyone here didn't touch this letter?

451
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:56,18
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.

452
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,686
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.

453
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:58,896
I'll call Napa and Vallejo,

454
00:32:59,21 --> 00:33:00,814
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.

455
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:04,318
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

456
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,820
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

457
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,782
- But that is not for publication.
- Hey, hey, come on.

458
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,118
Hey, it's me.

459
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,287
Did he say they got a print?

460
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,581
Partial.

461
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,708
Whoa.

462
00:33:21,84 --> 00:33:22,503
Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.

463
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,05
No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

464
00:33:25,88 --> 00:33:26,882
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

465
00:33:27,07 --> 00:33:28,800
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

466
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,886
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.

467
00:33:31,11 --> 00:33:32,95
What are you doing?

468
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,514
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,

469
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,99
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

470
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,101
- Oh, looming.
- Yeah.

471
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,104
In cooperation with SFPD,
we will run the Zodiac letter

472
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,815
without including the threat
on school children.

473
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,609
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

474
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:49,196
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

475
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,490
Just go about your daily business.

476
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,908
Thank you.

477
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,718
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

478
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,680
- Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
- I know.

479
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:25,899
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

480
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,609
Come on.

481
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,296
What's that?

482
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:50,07
Similarities in the lowercase "r's."

483
00:34:59,99 --> 00:35:00,309
And that?

484
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,394
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

485
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,313
I have to concentrate.

486
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:05,814
Sorry.

487
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,900
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

488
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,705
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's."

489
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,212
We have to release the bus threat.

490
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,507
- It'll screw us.
- We're already screwed.

491
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,800
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

492
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,94
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

493
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,980
{Y:i}The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.

494
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,108
{Y:i}Confirmation tonight, from the
San Francisco Police Department

495
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:52,110
{Y:i}that in his latest haunting letter,

496
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,405
{Y:i}which takes credit for the murder
of cab driver Paul Stine,

497
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,909
{Y:i}the Zodiac has threatened to,
"Wipe out a school bus

498
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:02,287
{Y:i}"and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

499
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,502
{Y:i}If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is,

500
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:12,214
{Y:i}you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.

501
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:38,782
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.

502
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,492
We're coordinating
with the school board,

503
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,619
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

504
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,496
- What do we really got?
- We're swamped.

505
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,998
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

506
00:36:46,81 --> 00:36:47,791
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

507
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:48,792
You got any hard suspects?

508
00:36:49,01 --> 00:36:51,712
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

509
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,880
Well, can't you narrow it down?

510
00:36:53,05 --> 00:36:55,215
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...

511
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,802
- Homicide, please hold.
- Yeah, hold, please.

512
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,721
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

513
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,14
How many men can you give me?

514
00:37:02,97 --> 00:37:04,99
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.

515
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,101
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.

516
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,103
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?

517
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,688
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

518
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,690
We're playing catch up, Jack.

519
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,318
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

520
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,986
I can't. He skipped town.

521
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,697
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

522
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,992
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

523
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,493
As soon as he got out, he split.

524
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,620
{Y:i}Really? Why?

525
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,997
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

526
00:37:27,80 --> 00:37:29,82
{Y:i}Can you send us everything
that you have?

527
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,02
Well, the road goes both ways.

528
00:37:32,85 --> 00:37:35,297
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab

529
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,299
{Y:i}and we should have been in
on the handwriting.

530
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,718
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

531
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:42,513
{Y:i}Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?

532
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:43,680
Talk to Ken Narlow.

533
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,682
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

534
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,310
{Y:i}I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

535
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,811
{Y:i}Listen, we're gonna need
your scene photos.

536
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:50,896
Can't help you.

537
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,981
{Y:i}Ken, I don't want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here.

538
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,692
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.

539
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,987
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

540
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,781
{Y:i}All we have are the Wing Walker prints.

541
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:01,990
The what?

542
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,784
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

543
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,203
were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

544
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,289
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

545
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,583
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

546
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,211
{Y:i}And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID,

547
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,296
so our suspect could be military.

548
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,90
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

549
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,300
{Y:i}- Yeah.
- Did Vallejo?

550
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,511
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

551
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,805
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

552
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,890
{Y:i}Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

553
00:38:27,15 --> 00:38:28,517
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

554
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:30,102
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

555
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,312
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

556
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,314
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

557
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:35,816
We don't have telefax yet.

558
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,485
{Y:i}- Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
- We'll mail ours, too.

559
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,320
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

560
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,489
- Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
- Right.

561
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,992
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

562
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:47,202
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.

563
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,704
{Y:i}We don't have a fax, either.

564
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,497
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.

565
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,82
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

566
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,792
Why would I call Solano?

567
00:38:54,01 --> 00:38:57,504
{Y:i}Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.

568
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:58,797
I thought they were Vallejo.

569
00:38:59,06 --> 00:39:00,299
No, they were over the county line

570
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,593
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.

571
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,94
Okay.

572
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,304
Bill.

573
00:39:06,13 --> 00:39:07,890
Can I have a word with you?

574
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,895
Where did you see this guy?

575
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,106
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

576
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,691
Where was he?

577
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,194
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

578
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,404
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

579
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,614
Give or take. Yeah.

580
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,991
- And you were heading east or west?
- We were going west.

581
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,285
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.

582
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,496
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

583
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,290
- Correct.
- Did you slow down?

584
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,83
- Of course we slowed down.
- All right.

585
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,503
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

586
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,921
That was corrected.

587
00:39:39,04 --> 00:39:41,590
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

588
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,800
This guy was white.

589
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,719
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...

590
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,388
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

591
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,392
- Shuffling.
- Stocky? Had a crew cut?

592
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,604
Yeah, that's all correct.

593
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,481
Listen, it was dark.

594
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,400
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

595
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,986
He would have been covered in blood.

596
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,198
Did you stop him?

597
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,118
Did you talk to him?

598
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,579
- Yes? No?
- No.

599
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:14,998
You need to get with a sketch artist.

600
00:40:15,82 --> 00:40:18,85
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

601
00:40:21,04 --> 00:40:24,91
{Y:i}Five persons have been murdered
in the San Francisco area,

602
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,717
{Y:i}and in each case the killer...

603
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,303
{Y:i}"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning..."

604
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:30,13
{Y:i}San Francisco police...

605
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,601
{Y:i}...to see the Stones in concert
this Sunday.

606
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,812
{Y:i}The new letters
from the Zodiac Killer were sent to

607
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,814
{Y:i}the City room of the
San Francisco Chronicle.

608
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,818
Looming. No looming.

609
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,988
- Have you considered the water theory?
- What?

610
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,782
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water

611
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,200
- or a water-based name.
- This is your water theory?

612
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:52,703
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.
Lake Herman.

613
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,997
Wash-ington and Cherry?

614
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,584
You think?

615
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,710
No.

616
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,211
I'm reading this book,

617
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,880
{Y:i}Homicide Investigation
by Lemoyne Snyder...

618
00:41:03,05 --> 00:41:04,381
- "Leymone."
- ...and he says you look for patterns,

619
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,592
- so I'm looking for patterns.
- No.

620
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,94
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

621
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,305
- Why not?
- You got four crime scenes:

622
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,391
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

623
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:18,520
Not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters?

624
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:22,107
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

625
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,818
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

626
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,612
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

627
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:27,779
{Y:i}So it's not his print?

628
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,698
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.

629
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,409
- The point is the first attack...
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

630
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,119
They both die.

631
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,580
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

632
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,707
- Not for lack of trying.
- Not for lack of trying.

633
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,294
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

634
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,797
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

635
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,217
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.

636
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,219
- Paul Stine is not.
- Exactly.

637
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,387
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

638
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:53,889
Doesn't fit.

639
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,100
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

640
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,897
He's breaking the pattern.

641
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,199
Yeah?

642
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,494
{Y:i}Someone claiming to be Zodiac
called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.

643
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,206
{Y:i}He says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

644
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,499
On television?

645
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,709
{Y:i}He wants Melvin Belli on
to counsel him.

646
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,920
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

647
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,216
Animal crackers?

648
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:30,592
Glove box.

649
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,386
Are these windows bulletproof?

650
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:35,97
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

651
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,390
This man is a marksman,

652
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,309
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

653
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,811
Are you sure you're up for this?

654
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:45,315
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

655
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,109
This man has asked for my help.

656
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,319
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

657
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,405
What are these, cookies?

658
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:55,117
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

659
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,620
- Shit.
- KGO must have tipped other stations.

660
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,300
{Y:i}Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.

661
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,885
If you see an opportunity,

662
00:43:13,10 --> 00:43:15,721
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

663
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:16,889
You'll be tracing the call?

664
00:43:17,14 --> 00:43:20,100
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

665
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:22,519
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

666
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:27,191
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

667
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,782
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

668
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:39,703
{Y:i}We interrupt our regular program
to bring you this news bulletin.

669
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,705
{Y:i}Welcome to this special edition
of our show

670
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,707
{Y:i}in which we are joined
by attorney Melvin Belli

671
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,211
{Y:i}who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.

672
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,87
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

673
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:52,07
{Y:i}- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Jim.

674
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:55,511
{Y:i}So, the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.

675
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:56,720
{Y:i}Here to help, Jim.

676
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,597
{Y:i}Yes. Here to help.

677
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,393
{Y:i}And we ask the public not to call in,
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

678
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:15,906
{Y:i}I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

679
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,908
A shame about the show.

680
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,493
Good people.

681
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:23,205
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.

682
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:24,706
What was your character's name?

683
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,00
{Y:i}- Gorgon.
- Gorgon. That's right.

684
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,504
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

685
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,798
Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

686
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,509
Hello?

687
00:44:39,96 --> 00:44:41,306
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

688
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,309
Who am I speaking with?

689
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,104
{Y:i}This is the Zodiac speaking.

690
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,986
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

691
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:57,406
{Y:i}Sam.

692
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:59,700
{Y:i}- Sam.
- Yes.

693
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:03,287
Sam, do you think
you need medical care?

694
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:05,289
{Y:i}Medical, not mental.

695
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,708
Do you have health problems?

696
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,501
{Y:i}I'm sick. I have headaches.

697
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,295
Headaches?

698
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,796
I have headaches, too,

699
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,591
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

700
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,509
I think I can help you, Sam.

701
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,180
Sam?

702
00:45:23,98 --> 00:45:25,601
He knows they're tracing his calls.

703
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:33,317
{Y:i}Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.

704
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,613
{Y:i}It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.

705
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,203
Sam?

706
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:49,583
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

707
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,585
{Y:i}Okay.

708
00:45:52,85 --> 00:45:55,380
{Y:i}Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.

709
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:57,382
{Y:i}I don't want to go to the gas chamber.

710
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,10
{Y:i}I have headaches.
I kill, I don't get them.

711
00:46:00,93 --> 00:46:01,386
That is fucked up!

712
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:05,15
{Y:i}You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.

713
00:46:05,98 --> 00:46:06,892
{Y:i}How long have you been
having these headaches?

714
00:46:07,17 --> 00:46:08,810
{Y:i}Since I killed a kid.

715
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,605
{Y:i}I don't want to be hurt.

716
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,899
- Why is he calling?
- Hey, just a second, buddy.

717
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,692
{Y:i}You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

718
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:18,820
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

719
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,490
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

720
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,492
{Y:i}We should ask the District Attorney.

721
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,702
{Y:i}Do you want me to do that, Sam?

722
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:28,497
{Y:i}Do you want me to talk
to the District Attorney?

723
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,86
What was that, Sam?

724
00:46:35,87 --> 00:46:37,214
{Y:i}I did not say anything.

725
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,216
{Y:i}We heard a scream.

726
00:46:40,08 --> 00:46:42,94
{Y:i}That was my headache.

727
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:45,889
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

728
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,685
{Y:i}My head aches. I'm so sick.

729
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,105
{Y:i}I'm gonna kill them.

730
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,983
{Y:i}- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna kill those kids!

731
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:57,693
Fantastic.

732
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,697
{Y:i}Sam?

733
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:07,411
{Y:i}- Let's meet and talk. Just us.
- Okay.

734
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,205
How about Old St. Mary's Church
in Chinatown?

735
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,582
{Y:i}No.

736
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:15,586
{Y:i}In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.

737
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,421
I'll see you there.

738
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,216
Take care of yourself, Sam.

739
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:46,700
My, my, my.

740
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:49,995
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

741
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:57,294
{Y:i}I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches.

742
00:47:57,419 --> 00:47:59,379
{Y:i}I kill, I don't get them.

743
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:01,215
No, it's not him.

744
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:05,385
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

745
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,180
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

746
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,16
That's okay. I got it.

747
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:18,398
They pulled off the trace.

748
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:21,610
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

749
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,612
Oakland PD's operator is sure

750
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,198
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

751
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,407
Calmer.

752
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,410
Might have actually been him.

753
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,586
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

754
00:48:40,03 --> 00:48:43,382
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

755
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,718
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger

756
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:49,805
"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

757
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,181
"The police shall never catch me

758
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,684
"because I have been
too clever for them.

759
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,187
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

760
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,399
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

761
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:05,404
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

762
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,990
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,

763
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,617
"contrary to what the police say.

764
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,120
"I wear transparent fingertips.

765
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:18,792
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

766
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:23,297
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

767
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,886
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

768
00:49:29,11 --> 00:49:30,512
"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up

769
00:49:30,596 --> 00:49:33,599
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

770
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,810
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,

771
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:40,105
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads."

772
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,318
And you need to look at this.

773
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,489
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

774
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,283
"one gallon of stove oil,

775
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,493
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top..."

776
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,287
- Okay.
- It's a bomb.

777
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:57,206
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

778
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:00,00
science experiment could actually work.

779
00:50:00,83 --> 00:50:01,710
Another cipher.

780
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,590
- When did these arrive?
- They arrived this morning.

781
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,91
Are you planning to publish?

782
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:09,384
Robert.

783
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:12,679
We should have a drink.

784
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,101
Thank you.

785
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,397
So, tell me about yourself.

786
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:25,692
- You married?
- Divorced. Two kids.

787
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,904
What do you do for fun?

788
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,115
I love to read.

789
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,494
- I enjoy books.
- Those are the same things.

790
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:38,80
Why you been going through my trash?

791
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,709
I'll come back to that.

792
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,87
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

793
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,880
I just guessed.

794
00:50:47,05 --> 00:50:49,216
- Just guessed.
- The first one seemed too easy.

795
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,593
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

796
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:55,305
- What is that you're drinking?
- It's an Aqua Velva.

797
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:58,308
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

798
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:10,195
But who actually cracked the code?

799
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,282
A married couple who like puzzles.

800
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,492
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

801
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:16,910
- He's no expert.
- Right.

802
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,704
It's just a simple substitution code

803
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,998
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

804
00:51:21,81 --> 00:51:22,583
"A" is one, "B" is two.

805
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,209
We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

806
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:27,796
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.

807
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,715
In the first cipher...

808
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,08
You actually carry that around with you?

809
00:51:31,91 --> 00:51:32,801
- Why?
- No reason.

810
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:37,389
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

811
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:38,599
Consonant?

812
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,17
- The double "L."
- Double "L."

813
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,896
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

814
00:51:44,21 --> 00:51:45,189
- "Kill."
- Right, "kill."

815
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,690
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,

816
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,692
which they find here, here, and here.

817
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,320
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

818
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,280
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

819
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,616
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

820
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,284
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

821
00:51:57,409 --> 00:52:00,287
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.

822
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,414
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

823
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,916
to figuring out this whole code?

824
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,793
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

825
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,90
In this book,

826
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:16,303
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

827
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:19,181
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

828
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:20,807
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols

829
00:52:21,16 --> 00:52:22,184
because there's all
these medieval ones.

830
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,19
I thought they looked medieval, too.

831
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,481
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

832
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:28,690
Guess what it's called?

833
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,401
The Zodiac Alphabet.

834
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:34,404
Jesus.

835
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,990
What do you want out of this?

836
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:38,617
- What?
- What's your angle?

837
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,286
This is good business
for everyone but you.

838
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:46,583
How do you mean "business"?

839
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:51,880
Hey. Come to bed.

840
00:52:52,05 --> 00:52:55,300
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

841
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,480
{Y:i}- Hello?
- Bill?

842
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,108
There's not many basements
in California.

843
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,986
{Y:i}"Basement for future use."

844
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,612
That's right.

845
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:19,408
{Y:i}I'll have Vallejo and Napa
check with their city planners.

846
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,702
{Y:i}- Get some sleep.
- Yeah, sure.

847
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,509
{Y:i}"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.

848
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:39,720
{Y:i}"I wish you a happy Christmas.

849
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:43,307
{Y:i}"The one thing I ask of you is this.
Please help me.

850
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,810
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me."

851
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,187
Thank you.

852
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,398
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

853
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,193
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

854
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:57,112
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim."

855
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,615
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

856
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:00,991
Absolutely.

857
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:04,620
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.

858
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,789
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqué.

859
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,00
{Y:i}Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.

860
00:54:10,83 --> 00:54:13,86
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

861
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:16,507
- When did the letter arrive?
- In the middle of last week.

862
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,509
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

863
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,595
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

864
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,306
- He tried to contact you here?
- Several times.

865
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,517
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

866
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,809
Didn't leave a number.

867
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:30,312
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

868
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,482
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

869
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,400
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.

870
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:36,902
She's right this way.

871
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:42,407
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.

872
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:44,201
Killing is his compulsion.

873
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,912
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.

874
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:47,996
It's in his blood.

875
00:54:48,80 --> 00:54:51,208
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

876
00:55:35,02 --> 00:55:40,507
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

877
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:41,800
Really?

878
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:45,12
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

879
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,807
If you don't mind.

880
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,310
Well, you can't be too careful.

881
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,180
- All done.
- Thank you.

882
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,516
No problem. Have a good night.

883
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:36,688
It's okay.

884
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:32,703
Are you okay?

885
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,915
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

886
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,210
Must have been worse than I thought.

887
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:43,213
I can give you a lift to a service station.

888
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:46,383
Okay.

889
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:54,683
It's okay. Come on.

890
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:04,818
I didn't know you had a baby.

891
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,113
Oh, is that okay?

892
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:11,408
The more the merrier.

893
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,795
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

894
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:33,805
- I think we just passed a filling station.
- It was closed.

895
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,314
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

896
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,692
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

897
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,780
It's okay.

898
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:52,407
Before I kill you,

899
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:55,118
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

900
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:12,219
No! Help! Please! No!

901
00:59:19,17 --> 00:59:21,895
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.

902
00:59:22,20 --> 00:59:23,605
- What happened to her?
- She said she jumped from a car.

903
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:25,607
I found her like this.

904
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,610
- What is it?
- Please, he said...

905
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:31,488
- It'll be okay.
- Tried to kill me.

906
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,115
My baby!

907
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:36,618
- Where's her baby?
- She didn't have one when I stopped.

908
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,412
Where's your baby?

909
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,86
Jesus.

910
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:56,180
- You hid it?
- In case he came back.

911
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,613
{Y:i}"This is the Zodiac speaking.

912
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:16,116
{Y:i}"By the way, have you cracked
the last cipher I sent you?

913
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,204
{Y:i}"I'm mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now.

914
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:23,999
{Y:i}"I hope you do not think I was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie

915
01:00:24,82 --> 01:00:26,210
{Y:i}"with a bomb at the cop station,

916
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,712
{Y:i}"even though I talked about
killing children with one."

917
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,297
{Y:i}"This is the Zodiac speaking.

918
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,592
{Y:i}"I'd like to see some nice Zodiac
buttons wandering around town.

919
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,886
{Y:i}"Everyone else has these buttons

920
01:00:36,94 --> 01:00:39,598
{Y:i}"like peace, black power,
and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera.

921
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:41,99
{Y:i}"It would cheer me up considerably

922
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:43,185
{Y:i}"if I saw a lot of people
wearing my button.

923
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,188
{Y:i}- "Please no nasty ones."
- "This is the Zodiac speaking.

924
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,399
{Y:i}"I shot a man
sitting in a parked car with a .38.

925
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:52,694
{Y:i}"Zodiac 12, SFPD zero."

926
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:56,198
{Y:i}"The map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set.

927
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,992
{Y:i}"You have until next fall to dig it up."

928
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,996
{Y:i}"This is the Zodiac speaking.

929
01:01:03,80 --> 01:01:04,706
{Y:i}"I'm rather unhappy because you people

930
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,416
{Y:i}"will not wear
some nice Zodiac buttons.

931
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,919
"So, I now have a little list,
starting with the woman and her baby

932
01:01:09,86 --> 01:01:10,796
"that I gave a rather interesting ride

933
01:01:11,04 --> 01:01:13,90
"for a couple of hours one evening,
a few months back,

934
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:15,509
"that ended in my burning her car
where I found them."

935
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,803
We're really not gonna run
any more of his letters?

936
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:20,389
The new policy. Our brothers in blue
want us to hold back

937
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:22,99
and see how he reacts.

938
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:24,309
Four letters in three months,

939
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:27,312
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.

940
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,691
That's because he's full of shit.

941
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:33,694
What do you mean?

942
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,405
You don't know?

943
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:42,619
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

944
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:45,289
{Y:i}Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

945
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,500
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

946
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:50,586
- Left.
- Left.

947
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:54,89
- What am I looking for?
- Kathleen Johns.

948
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,507
{Y:i}Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...

949
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,802
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

950
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:02,181
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.

951
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:04,99
Tell me what facts he gives.

952
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:07,394
- A woman and her baby abducted.
- Fact.

953
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:11,815
- The car on fire.
- Okay, now,

954
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:15,402
{Y:i}look at the article from the Bee.

955
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,905
Seen it yet?

956
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:19,907
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.

957
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,992
And he's done it before.

958
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:25,787
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

959
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:28,81
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.

960
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:31,418
Couple days after this article came out.

961
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,420
The police already had somebody
in custody.

962
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:36,89
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway

963
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,509
because he's in it for the press.

964
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,10
He even stole his symbol.

965
01:02:40,93 --> 01:02:42,304
- What?
- Yeah. Shit.

966
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,97
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

967
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:47,518
- Who would I tell?
- Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

968
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,985
That's the only place
that word and that symbol

969
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,613
ever appeared together
before the letters.

970
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:01,198
The guy stole his logo off a watch.

971
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,616
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...

972
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:03,909
He claims he's killed 13 people,

973
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,702
but which ones
can we actually confirm?

974
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:09,915
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

975
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,794
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

976
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:17,214
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

977
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:19,383
Business as usual.

978
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,93
Something'll shake loose.

979
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,387
Not a peep in four months.

980
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:26,14
First he won't shut up and now...

981
01:03:26,98 --> 01:03:28,392
Maybe we drove him underground.

982
01:03:29,17 --> 01:03:30,602
Maybe he's gone.

983
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,690
{Y:i}311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore.
There's a male...

984
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:36,984
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thanks.

985
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,496
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

986
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,82
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

987
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,02
- Nobody calls me that.
- Right.

988
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,589
{Y:i}As governor,
I pledge to use all my influence

989
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:02,801
{Y:i}to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer
is brought to justice.

990
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:08,98
{Y:i}I believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

991
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,100
{Y:i}- I believe her murder was premeditated.
- Who is that?

992
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:13,187
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
She's running for governor.

993
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,315
{Y:i}I believe that the police department
either did not have the money, the time

994
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:18,192
{Y:i}or, yes, the inclination...

995
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:21,695
{Y:i}Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

996
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,406
Does anyone ever call me names, or...

997
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,409
You mean like retard?

998
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:28,702
Yeah.

999
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:30,704
No.

1000
01:04:35,83 --> 01:04:39,87
Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

1001
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,10
Tell me that's not a piece
of bloody shirt!

1002
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:46,887
Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

1003
01:04:47,12 --> 01:04:49,598
"I feel it in my bones,
you ache to know my name

1004
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:51,808
"and so I'll clue you in.

1005
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:55,20
"But then, why spoil the game?
Happy Halloween."

1006
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,983
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual

1007
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:01,693
in at least one of your articles.

1008
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:04,112
Dave. I want a gun.

1009
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:08,200
A gun?

1010
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:14,498
You're in Herb Caen.

1011
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,00
"Paul Avery's investigation
has won him the accolade

1012
01:05:17,84 --> 01:05:20,212
"of a message from the Zodiac warning,
'You are doomed.'

1013
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:23,590
"As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading,

1014
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:25,801
"'I am not Paul Avery."'

1015
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:28,11
You should sell these.
You could do well.

1016
01:05:28,95 --> 01:05:30,806
It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.

1017
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:32,599
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.

1018
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:35,102
There's one guy down in Riverside.

1019
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:36,812
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.

1020
01:05:37,20 --> 01:05:40,607
- You wanna tag along?
- No, I have a date.

1021
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,610
- Really?
- Who is this guy?

1022
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:47,281
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

1023
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:51,702
So we're going to get along great.

1024
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,86
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.

1025
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,88
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.

1026
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,506
Thank you.

1027
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:12,181
You must be Melanie.

1028
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:14,183
- Which would make you Robert.
- It would.

1029
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:17,519
Glynnis told me lots about you.

1030
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:19,313
- And you have wine, great.
- I do.

1031
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:21,315
Great. How late am I?

1032
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:25,694
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

1033
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,906
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.

1034
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,117
- Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
- Oh, yeah.

1035
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,994
Well, what're you doing at a gun range?

1036
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,704
Reading.

1037
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,707
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

1038
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:42,211
So, you work with Glynnis.

1039
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,213
- For her, actually.
- For her?

1040
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:45,881
Oh, well...

1041
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,885
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1042
01:06:50,10 --> 01:06:51,303
Me, too.

1043
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:55,807
So, the gun range?

1044
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:58,894
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1045
01:06:59,19 --> 01:07:00,312
- Yeah.
- I'm working with...

1046
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,814
- Do you know who Paul Avery is?
- Sounds kind of familiar.

1047
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:04,691
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1048
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,193
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.

1049
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:09,196
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight

1050
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:12,491
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1051
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:15,702
Where is Riverside?

1052
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:17,287
It's near L.A.

1053
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,999
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

1054
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,212
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1055
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:29,383
Yeah. How do you mean?

1056
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,885
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

1057
01:07:32,10 --> 01:07:33,387
Yeah.

1058
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:37,15
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1059
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,19
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1060
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:43,689
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1061
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,987
So, do you know what's good here?

1062
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:53,991
I've never been here before.

1063
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:58,120
The pasta, spaghetti?

1064
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:01,915
Are you ready to order yet?

1065
01:08:02,1000 --> 01:08:05,794
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1066
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:07,212
Of course.

1067
01:08:12,92 --> 01:08:14,303
Maybe give us another minute?

1068
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,98
Do you have any change?

1069
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,392
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1070
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,19
Nope. That's a penny.

1071
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:23,520
Do you have to make a phone call?

1072
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:27,107
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1073
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,401
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought

1074
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:31,486
- that it is dangerous, and it's...
- Stupid?

1075
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:32,905
Stupid. And I just thought

1076
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:36,992
that I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1077
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,787
I have some change.

1078
01:09:00,15 --> 01:09:03,310
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.

1079
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:04,895
- Good.
- Yeah.

1080
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:09,691
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

1081
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:16,281
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1082
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,492
What? No.

1083
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,913
I'll get the food to go.

1084
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:25,791
Hello!

1085
01:09:42,15 --> 01:09:44,810
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1086
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,496
Anything?

1087
01:10:08,83 --> 01:10:09,418
You don't have to stay.

1088
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,919
Are you kidding?

1089
01:10:11,03 --> 01:10:14,89
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1090
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:19,511
{Y:i}- Paul?
- Robert?

1091
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,180
- Yes.
- You sitting down?

1092
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:22,389
{Y:i}Yes.

1093
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,308
You're not gonna believe this.

1094
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:25,392
Dave!

1095
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:28,103
{Y:i}In a bizarre twist,
the hunted has become hunter.

1096
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:31,899
{Y:i}San Francisco Chronicle reporter
and Zodiac target Paul Avery

1097
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:34,109
{Y:i}claims to have uncovered
new information

1098
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:38,697
{Y:i}regarding the only unsolved homicide
in Riverside County's history,

1099
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,992
{Y:i}a 1966 Southern California murder,

1100
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:45,120
{Y:i}that Avery now believes
was the Zodiac's first victim.

1101
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,288
What?

1102
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,581
- He didn't call you about this?
- Hang on!

1103
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:49,208
{Y:i}The Riverside killer
wrote to the press letters

1104
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:52,920
{Y:i}that I then took personally to
the Office of Questioned Documents.

1105
01:10:53,03 --> 01:10:55,214
{Y:i}And what did this expert tell you?

1106
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:56,798
{Y:i}What I knew in my gut, Ron.

1107
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:59,384
{Y:i}The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

1108
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,803
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1109
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,97
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1110
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,390
You know how bad this looks?

1111
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:07,684
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?

1112
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:10,103
It's very real. You know how I know?

1113
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,105
Because I saw it on TV.

1114
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,280
Dave.

1115
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:21,782
Hi.

1116
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,992
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.

1117
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:25,285
Good to see you, Mel.

1118
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,287
All due respect,
can someone explain to me

1119
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:28,997
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case

1120
01:11:29,81 --> 01:11:30,916
{Y:i}in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?

1121
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:32,84
We got screwed.

1122
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:33,418
Dave, come on.

1123
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,420
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

1124
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:38,507
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1125
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,301
Dave? Hey. Hi.

1126
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,96
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1127
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:46,14
Not a good idea, Paul.

1128
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:49,518
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1129
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:52,312
{Y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for choosing PSA.

1130
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,481
{Y:i}- Fair enough. Fair enough.
- Please take your seats at this time.

1131
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:57,484
{Y:i}Remember, smoking is
in the last six aisles only.

1132
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:59,319
{Y:i}Enjoy your flight.

1133
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:05,492
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1134
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:09,913
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1135
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:13,417
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p.m.

1136
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:17,588
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1137
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:21,300
{Y:i}A typewritten confession was sent
to the Riverside Press Enterprise

1138
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:24,11
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.

1139
01:12:24,94 --> 01:12:25,512
They ran it.

1140
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:30,517
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1141
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,811
"This letter should be published
for all to read."

1142
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,188
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

1143
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:35,689
I mean, this could be our boy.

1144
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:39,109
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,

1145
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,111
they all received these.

1146
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:47,784
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1147
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,997
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?

1148
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:54,208
These and the desktop. Don.

1149
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:58,795
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1150
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,390
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1151
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,311
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1152
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:15,812
To be honest with you,

1153
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:18,315
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.

1154
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,901
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1155
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:22,402
I gave them to him.

1156
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,279
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1157
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:25,906
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1158
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:27,699
- You told him we were meeting?
- Yeah.

1159
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,993
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1160
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:32,204
Okay, wait a minute.

1161
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:35,290
- You don't think this is Zodiac?
- We got a guy we like for it.

1162
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:37,00
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,

1163
01:13:37,84 --> 01:13:38,293
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1164
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:41,296
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?

1165
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,06
I'm trying to cooperate.

1166
01:13:43,90 --> 01:13:45,884
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?

1167
01:13:46,09 --> 01:13:47,594
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,

1168
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:48,887
but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1169
01:13:49,12 --> 01:13:51,390
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.

1170
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:52,599
He types the confession.

1171
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,894
Zodiac reads it in the paper,
and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1172
01:13:56,19 --> 01:13:57,479
Now, that's something he's done before.

1173
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:00,190
Look, now you have everything we have.

1174
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:03,694
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1175
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,821
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1176
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:08,699
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1177
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:11,994
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1178
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:15,414
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1179
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,918
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1180
01:14:20,02 --> 01:14:21,920
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.

1181
01:14:22,04 --> 01:14:25,716
- Just trying to do my job.
- Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1182
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:28,93
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,

1183
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,220
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1184
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:33,599
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways

1185
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,602
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1186
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:39,188
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1187
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:40,981
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1188
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,317
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1189
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,818
- What if it is?
- Does it matter that Riverside may not

1190
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:46,904
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1191
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,906
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,

1192
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,616
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1193
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:51,992
No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1194
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:53,994
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1195
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,997
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.

1196
01:14:57,80 --> 01:14:58,707
Hey, Bullitt!

1197
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:02,294
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1198
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,216
- Go fuck yourself.
- Happily.

1199
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:09,301
You should have called me, Paul.

1200
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,99
Thank you.

1201
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:31,114
- Did you see this?
- Unfortunately, yes.

1202
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,909
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1203
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,119
I'm the Zodiac.

1204
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,704
And how did you kill your victims?

1205
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,499
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1206
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:41,917
All I'm authorized to tell you

1207
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:43,502
is that he's still under
government employment.

1208
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,713
- And who authorized you to tell me this?
- That's all I'm authorized to say.

1209
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:49,07
Only a little rat bastard like Andre

1210
01:15:49,91 --> 01:15:51,593
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1211
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:54,96
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1212
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,889
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1213
01:15:56,14 --> 01:15:58,600
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1214
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:02,688
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1215
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,314
- Coincidence?
- I don't know.

1216
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,316
You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1217
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:13,907
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1218
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:15,284
Frequently.

1219
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:17,202
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1220
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,914
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1221
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:23,709
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1222
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,294
to use as a sight in the dark.

1223
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,212
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1224
01:16:28,88 --> 01:16:30,215
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"

1225
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,92
And he said, "It would be easy

1226
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,720
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing."

1227
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:36,597
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1228
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,515
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1229
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,184
Leigh liked messing with people.

1230
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,312
- You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
- Yeah.

1231
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,481
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1232
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,110
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1233
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:52,779
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use."

1234
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:56,283
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1235
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:59,620
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1236
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:02,706
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1237
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:05,83
and picking off the little darlings.

1238
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:09,296
- He actually used those words?
- That's what made me remember.

1239
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,798
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.

1240
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:13,592
And I haven't since.

1241
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:16,220
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1242
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,388
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1243
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,891
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1244
01:17:21,16 --> 01:17:24,895
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1245
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:26,480
Tell him when you put it together.

1246
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:31,318
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.

1247
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,488
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1248
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,198
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1249
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:40,118
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1250
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:43,997
took place on January 1st, 1968?

1251
01:17:44,81 --> 01:17:45,791
It couldn't have been any later.

1252
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:48,794
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th.

1253
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:50,796
I had to move.

1254
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:53,382
{Y:i}- This is my problem. This guy...
- Arthur Leigh Allen?

1255
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:56,93
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan

1256
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:57,719
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1257
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:00,597
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,

1258
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:02,891
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1259
01:18:03,16 --> 01:18:05,310
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1260
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,812
I checked. He did.

1261
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,898
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1262
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:12,818
was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970.

1263
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:13,986
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1264
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:15,821
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1265
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,197
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1266
01:18:17,281 --> 01:18:18,991
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1267
01:18:19,116 --> 01:18:21,785
But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1268
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:24,705
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.

1269
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,418
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1270
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,420
- What are you having?
- BLT.

1271
01:18:34,06 --> 01:18:36,592
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1272
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:39,219
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,

1273
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,597
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.

1274
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,600
- Well, that's vague.
- He needs more samples.

1275
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:47,686
Also, our guy is a pervert.

1276
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,689
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,

1277
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:52,983
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1278
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,319
- Touching?
- Polite euphemism.

1279
01:18:56,904 --> 01:19:00,115
- So what do you want to do?
- Make some phone calls.

1280
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,618
- Are you done with the fries?
- Go ahead.

1281
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,286
{Y:i}Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance

1282
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,705
{Y:i}to look at the copies
of the Zodiac letters we sent you?

1283
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:09,499
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1284
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:12,711
{Y:i}- Yeah, we know that.
- I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1285
01:19:13,03 --> 01:19:15,506
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1286
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:17,382
What about the handwriting?

1287
01:19:17,508 --> 01:19:20,511
{Y:i}I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1288
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:23,680
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1289
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:25,599
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1290
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:27,17
{Y:i}The letters are a little too neat

1291
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,520
{Y:i}for someone to have written
with the wrong hand.

1292
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,313
But not for Leigh, right.

1293
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,315
{Y:i}- What do you mean?
- He's ambidextrous.

1294
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:36,818
{Y:i}He can write with either hand.
Didn't you guys know that?

1295
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,696
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1296
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,282
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.

1297
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:44,993
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1298
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:48,914
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1299
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,707
We got to see this guy, Chief.

1300
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,00
- Where is he?
- Vallejo.

1301
01:19:52,84 --> 01:19:55,87
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.

1302
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:56,713
See them both.

1303
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:59,216
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1304
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:02,511
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.

1305
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:05,180
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1306
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:18,819
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1307
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:21,905
I'll go get him for you.

1308
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:25,617
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1309
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:29,288
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1310
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:30,998
It's okay by me.

1311
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:47,514
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1312
01:20:47,598 --> 01:20:50,684
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1313
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:54,980
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1314
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:56,690
Please, sit down.

1315
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,993
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1316
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:10,787
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1317
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:13,916
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1318
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,84
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1319
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:17,586
- No.
- Have you ever read

1320
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,379
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1321
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:20,797
When it was first in the paper.

1322
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:22,883
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1323
01:21:23,08 --> 01:21:26,386
- Why not?
- Too morbid. I...

1324
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,306
I told all this to the other officer.

1325
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:31,892
- Which other officer?
- From Vallejo.

1326
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,811
Do you remember his name?

1327
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:38,607
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1328
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,109
And what did you tell this officer?

1329
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:46,907
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1330
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:49,910
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1331
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,205
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1332
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:54,915
That would be great, Arthur.

1333
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:56,917
- Leigh.
- What?

1334
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:00,295
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1335
01:22:02,89 --> 01:22:05,509
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1336
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:09,304
It was around 4:00.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1337
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:11,598
- Neighbor's name?
- Bill White.

1338
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:15,185
He died a week or so afterwards.

1339
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,313
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1340
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:22,985
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,

1341
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:26,613
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1342
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:32,202
- What?
- I had knives in my car that weekend.

1343
01:22:32,286 --> 01:22:36,582
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1344
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,918
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1345
01:22:40,02 --> 01:22:41,795
Well, let me ask you something else.

1346
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,300
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1347
01:22:46,884 --> 01:22:49,386
- Is this about the Riverside killing?
- Yes.

1348
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:52,806
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.

1349
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:56,185
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1350
01:23:00,606 --> 01:23:02,983
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1351
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,985
No, that's untrue.

1352
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,404
You can't write with both hands?

1353
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:11,700
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.

1354
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,911
I'm left-handed.

1355
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:18,81
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1356
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,292
That is...

1357
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:23,712
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1358
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:27,90
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs

1359
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:29,301
for touching your students?

1360
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:40,312
I'm not the Zodiac.

1361
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:44,107
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1362
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:48,320
That's a nice watch.

1363
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:51,198
Thank you.

1364
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,699
May I see it?

1365
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:56,119
May I see it?

1366
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:09,07
Where'd you get it?

1367
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:11,385
It was a Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1368
01:24:12,10 --> 01:24:14,179
That's very sweet.

1369
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:16,807
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1370
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,16
You don't remember anyone

1371
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,603
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1372
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:28,485
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1373
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,613
But I couldn't be positive.

1374
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,615
I used to work there when...

1375
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:39,580
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game.

1376
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:41,999
What?

1377
01:24:42,82 --> 01:24:45,294
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1378
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,87
It was my favorite book in high school.

1379
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:50,716
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1380
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,217
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,

1381
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,886
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1382
01:24:54,11 --> 01:24:58,98
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1383
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:00,684
That's the whole point of the story.

1384
01:25:01,393 --> 01:25:02,811
Great book.

1385
01:25:04,21 --> 01:25:06,607
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1386
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:13,614
May I go?

1387
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:18,285
Sure.

1388
01:25:23,81 --> 01:25:27,294
- Thanks for your time.
- I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1389
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:29,505
I look forward to the day

1390
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:33,91
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1391
01:25:34,92 --> 01:25:35,219
Thanks.

1392
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,13
We'll be in touch.

1393
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:53,695
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1394
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,990
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1395
01:25:57,783 --> 01:26:00,702
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1396
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:02,788
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1397
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,790
Well, we're looking at him.

1398
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,291
Are you going to arrest him?

1399
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:10,295
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1400
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,880
Well, Leigh's always been troubled.

1401
01:26:12,05 --> 01:26:14,216
Is it true about the children?

1402
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,218
Unfortunately.

1403
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:19,12
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1404
01:26:19,96 --> 01:26:21,14
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1405
01:26:21,98 --> 01:26:23,517
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1406
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,520
- Was he the one who contacted you?
- That's confidential.

1407
01:26:26,603 --> 01:26:28,105
Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1408
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:31,316
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1409
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,609
- This one.
- What about it?

1410
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:34,695
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's."

1411
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,114
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1412
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,992
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1413
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:42,494
- Would you still have that?
- I can look for it.

1414
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:44,997
Thank you. That'd be great.

1415
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:48,208
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1416
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,918
{Y:i}The brother said
he would search Leigh's apartment

1417
01:26:50,02 --> 01:26:51,211
next time he went out of town.

1418
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,589
- That gets you around a warrant.
- For the time being.

1419
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:56,884
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,

1420
01:26:57,09 --> 01:26:58,802
and we could search the place properly.

1421
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:00,304
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1422
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:03,307
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1423
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,100
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,

1424
01:27:05,184 --> 01:27:08,187
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1425
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:11,106
- But you do?
- I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1426
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,193
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.

1427
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:16,320
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1428
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:19,489
- Avery's on two.
- Tell him to screw.

1429
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:23,911
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1430
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:33,587
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1431
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:38,217
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1432
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,301
Perfectly.

1433
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:42,596
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1434
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:46,16
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1435
01:27:46,99 --> 01:27:48,602
Both hands would have commonalities.

1436
01:27:48,894 --> 01:27:50,187
I'm sorry.

1437
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:52,397
Just not gonna work.

1438
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,818
{Y:i}- Homicide, Toschi.
- Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1439
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:58,987
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1440
01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:00,489
{Y:i}We struck out with the judge.

1441
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:02,199
{Y:i}He won't sign off on a warrant
for Allen's house.

1442
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:04,409
- Why not?
- Said it wasn't enough.

1443
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:06,787
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...

1444
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,289
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1445
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:10,791
{Y:i}I don't know.

1446
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:14,294
{Y:i}- I truly am sorry.
- No, no. Thank you, Jack.

1447
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:17,297
What do you wanna do?

1448
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:18,715
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1449
01:28:18,799 --> 01:28:21,593
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1450
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:23,804
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1451
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,889
Only, what?

1452
01:28:26,14 --> 01:28:27,891
Twenty-three hundred?

1453
01:28:28,16 --> 01:28:29,309
Okay, then.

1454
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:33,814
Okay, then.

1455
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:04,386
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1456
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:07,890
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1457
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:11,810
I merely suggested...

1458
01:29:11,894 --> 01:29:13,103
On our letterhead?

1459
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:15,189
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1460
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,316
create an information clearinghouse

1461
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,484
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1462
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:22,696
- And that you run it.
- Well, who better than me?

1463
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:25,282
The marked man.

1464
01:29:25,991 --> 01:29:27,910
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.

1465
01:29:27,993 --> 01:29:29,494
One, stop boozing.

1466
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:32,789
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.

1467
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:36,418
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1468
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:39,505
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1469
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:44,885
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1470
01:29:45,10 --> 01:29:46,595
I'll more than happily...

1471
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,182
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1472
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:51,600
Paul, I mean it!

1473
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,987
- Paul?
- Yep.

1474
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:07,282
- What was that?
- An editorial tęte-ŕ-tęte.

1475
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,494
- Wanna grab a drink?
- It's 10:00 in the morning.

1476
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,412
Late breakfast?

1477
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:15,582
- Early lunch, or...
- Paul.

1478
01:30:18,85 --> 01:30:19,503
Are you okay?

1479
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,380
No.

1480
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:26,718
Thank you for asking.

1481
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:31,14
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1482
01:30:31,98 --> 01:30:33,100
Paul, where are you going?

1483
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,688
{Y:i}So, you moved off my brother-in-law?

1484
01:30:37,813 --> 01:30:39,815
We couldn't get a warrant.

1485
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,903
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1486
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:46,613
He only went twice.

1487
01:30:46,697 --> 01:30:49,700
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1488
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:52,786
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1489
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:56,206
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1490
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:59,710
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out

1491
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,920
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1492
01:31:02,04 --> 01:31:05,299
- Because of patient confidentiality...
- The man said yes.

1493
01:31:07,92 --> 01:31:09,303
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1494
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:11,305
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1495
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:14,683
- Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
- In his trailer.

1496
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,810
- In Santa Rosa?
- Sonoma County.

1497
01:31:17,19 --> 01:31:19,104
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1498
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:20,689
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,

1499
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,399
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1500
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:24,318
If we find something, great.

1501
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:27,487
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.

1502
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:29,990
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1503
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:33,202
What if I can get a second opinion?

1504
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,580
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1505
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:39,208
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1506
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:43,295
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1507
01:31:45,05 --> 01:31:46,381
Between you and me?

1508
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:49,885
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1509
01:31:51,94 --> 01:31:55,599
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1510
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:58,185
{Y:i}That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.

1511
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:01,605
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify

1512
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:04,691
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1513
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:07,694
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1514
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:11,406
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1515
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,700
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,

1516
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,202
coupled with Cheney...

1517
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,703
It could be enough for a warrant.

1518
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:17,996
Get Cheney on the record.

1519
01:32:18,80 --> 01:32:20,582
"And shoot the kiddies
as they came bouncing out.

1520
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,794
"And that he would call himself Zodiac."

1521
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:25,796
Yes.

1522
01:32:26,04 --> 01:32:29,508
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?

1523
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,09
Without any hesitation.

1524
01:32:31,93 --> 01:32:33,887
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1525
01:32:34,12 --> 01:32:35,305
Thank you.

1526
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:39,518
Well, looks like you got your man.

1527
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:01,498
Mr. Allen?

1528
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:03,500
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1529
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:06,420
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1530
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:18,599
Hello?

1531
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:29,401
I'll check with the neighbors.

1532
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:31,904
Close the door.

1533
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:34,990
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.

1534
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:49,880
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1535
01:33:50,05 --> 01:33:53,800
- You think somebody tipped him?
- We're not leaving till he comes back.

1536
01:34:00,98 --> 01:34:01,892
I'll check the back.

1537
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:15,697
Jesus.

1538
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:17,407
- What?
- Squirrels.

1539
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:21,495
Piece of work, this guy.

1540
01:34:28,293 --> 01:34:31,88
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1541
01:34:31,213 --> 01:34:34,883
- Like the Stine scene?
- We'll have those checked for blood.

1542
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:38,303
And a pair of black gloves.

1543
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:42,808
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.

1544
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:45,602
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1545
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:47,896
Probably just a coincidence.

1546
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:51,900
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1547
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:56,488
They're both .22s.
One automatic, one revolver.

1548
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:58,115
Well, that's interesting.

1549
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:01,285
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1550
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:03,996
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1551
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:06,915
Someone's here.

1552
01:35:14,06 --> 01:35:16,383
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1553
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:39,990
No.

1554
01:35:40,115 --> 01:35:41,200
On the handwriting?

1555
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:44,786
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1556
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:46,705
On both hands, right?

1557
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:48,582
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1558
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:50,00
And neither hand matches.

1559
01:35:50,83 --> 01:35:51,793
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1560
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:53,921
Fellas, he's not your guy.

1561
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:01,512
Damn it.

1562
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:09,895
Hey.

1563
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:13,315
What do you want? Time off?

1564
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:16,693
A hug?

1565
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:19,613
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1566
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:21,615
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1567
01:36:21,698 --> 01:36:24,993
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.

1568
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:26,995
It's because you thought it was him.

1569
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,580
And I did, too.

1570
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,793
You know what? Take some time off.

1571
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:36,213
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1572
01:36:36,296 --> 01:36:38,799
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1573
01:36:40,92 --> 01:36:44,888
{Y:i}"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day

1574
01:36:45,514 --> 01:36:47,891
{Y:i}"until you pay me $100,000.

1575
01:36:48,809 --> 01:36:51,520
{Y:i}"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning

1576
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:55,399
{Y:i}"in the personal column
San Francisco Chronicle,

1577
01:36:55,482 --> 01:36:57,484
{Y:i}"and I will set up meeting.

1578
01:36:57,609 --> 01:36:59,194
{Y:i}"If I do not hear from you,

1579
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:02,614
{Y:i}"it will be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a...

1580
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:06,994
{Y:i}"...Scorpio."

1581
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:10,998
{Y:i}Who's out of their minds?

1582
01:37:11,81 --> 01:37:13,208
I've got to get out of here.

1583
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:16,503
{Y:i}Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?

1584
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:19,06
{Y:i}You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

1585
01:37:19,89 --> 01:37:23,385
{Y:i}The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime.

1586
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:48,785
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1587
01:37:48,911 --> 01:37:51,205
That's how it ends.

1588
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:52,789
Do I know you?

1589
01:37:52,915 --> 01:37:56,84
{Y:i}I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1590
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:57,794
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1591
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,380
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1592
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:03,91
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1593
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:09,598
{Y:i}- What do you do at the Chronicle?
- I'm a cartoonist.

1594
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:10,807
That's nice.

1595
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:12,809
You're gonna catch him.

1596
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,314
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1597
01:38:49,12 --> 01:38:51,181
Hi. We haven't met.

1598
01:38:51,306 --> 01:38:53,100
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1599
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:55,102
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1600
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:58,313
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.

1601
01:38:58,397 --> 01:38:59,606
You got a great desk.

1602
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,817
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1603
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,110
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.

1604
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:05,696
{Y:i}I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle

1605
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:08,615
{Y:i}and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1606
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,909
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1607
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:17,416
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1608
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:19,585
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1609
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:22,212
- if you need anything, Duffy.
- Yeah.

1610
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:28,385
- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.

1611
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:31,680
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1612
01:39:31,805 --> 01:39:33,682
You should keep the car.

1613
01:39:34,516 --> 01:39:35,517
Yeah?

1614
01:39:36,18 --> 01:39:38,103
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1615
01:39:40,105 --> 01:39:41,481
Why? What's up?

1616
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,984
I'm done.

1617
01:39:45,611 --> 01:39:47,487
I put in for a transfer.

1618
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,620
Where?

1619
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:56,788
Looking at Fraud.

1620
01:39:59,82 --> 01:40:01,210
I can't be on call anymore.

1621
01:40:03,921 --> 01:40:06,215
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1622
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:09,593
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1623
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:14,14
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1624
01:40:16,183 --> 01:40:17,184
Hey,

1625
01:40:18,185 --> 01:40:21,605
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?

1626
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:24,316
No.

1627
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:27,819
Okay.

1628
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:30,197
Hey, you know what?

1629
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:34,618
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1630
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:36,995
Yeah.

1631
01:41:09,111 --> 01:41:10,779
I'm not Paul Avery.

1632
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:16,702
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.

1633
01:41:16,785 --> 01:41:19,121
- I'll flip you for it.
- You wish.

1634
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:25,210
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1635
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,90
- Are you kidding me?
- Hi, Paul.

1636
01:42:13,884 --> 01:42:16,303
- Permission to come aboard.
- It's right there.

1637
01:42:16,386 --> 01:42:19,97
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1638
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:21,99
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1639
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:25,687
- See that? Mesmerizing.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1640
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:28,398
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1641
01:42:30,317 --> 01:42:32,486
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

1642
01:42:32,611 --> 01:42:34,780
I mean, admittedly,

1643
01:42:34,905 --> 01:42:37,115
{Y:i}the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1644
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:40,202
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1645
01:42:40,285 --> 01:42:42,287
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1646
01:42:42,412 --> 01:42:45,916
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1647
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:47,417
Cheers.

1648
01:42:48,85 --> 01:42:50,295
To your health and mine.

1649
01:42:52,214 --> 01:42:53,507
Mostly mine.

1650
01:42:58,804 --> 01:43:00,305
So,

1651
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:03,684
what's new?

1652
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:07,688
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah.

1653
01:43:07,813 --> 01:43:08,981
Somebody should write a book.

1654
01:43:09,106 --> 01:43:11,984
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1655
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:14,319
- About what?
- About Zodiac.

1656
01:43:15,904 --> 01:43:17,281
It's not new.

1657
01:43:17,406 --> 01:43:21,994
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,

1658
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:23,704
maybe you could jog something loose.

1659
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:26,290
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1660
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:27,416
Yeah. That's true.

1661
01:43:27,499 --> 01:43:30,502
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.

1662
01:43:30,711 --> 01:43:31,920
Lost them.

1663
01:43:32,296 --> 01:43:33,297
You lost them?

1664
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:36,717
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1665
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:39,219
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?

1666
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:40,596
As in, today.

1667
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:43,515
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1668
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,602
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1669
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:49,21
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1670
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:50,314
He offed a few citizens,

1671
01:43:50,397 --> 01:43:53,692
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.

1672
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,201
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1673
01:44:02,284 --> 01:44:06,288
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1674
01:44:08,582 --> 01:44:11,793
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1675
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:14,588
You're wrong. It was important.

1676
01:44:15,797 --> 01:44:18,300
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1677
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,303
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?

1678
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:24,306
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1679
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:26,16
Am I being unkind?

1680
01:44:27,184 --> 01:44:30,395
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1681
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,192
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1682
01:44:57,297 --> 01:44:59,383
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

1683
01:44:59,508 --> 01:45:01,885
- Where you been?
- The library.

1684
01:45:33,584 --> 01:45:34,918
Thank you!

1685
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:54,21
- Inspector Toschi?
- Yeah? One moment, please.

1686
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,610
- Hi.
- Hi.

1687
01:46:00,903 --> 01:46:02,905
We met at the movies once.

1688
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:04,698
It must have been magical.

1689
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:06,617
{Y:i}I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.

1690
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:09,411
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1691
01:46:11,205 --> 01:46:12,789
Sure, why not?

1692
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:15,292
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1693
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:17,794
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1694
01:46:19,588 --> 01:46:21,882
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1695
01:46:22,382 --> 01:46:25,594
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1696
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:28,305
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?

1697
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:30,15
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1698
01:46:30,98 --> 01:46:32,684
And you're the only one on it, right?

1699
01:46:33,894 --> 01:46:35,312
Mr. Graysmith,

1700
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,398
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1701
01:46:38,482 --> 01:46:41,318
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1702
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:42,903
- No.
- Over 200.

1703
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:46,281
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1704
01:46:46,406 --> 01:46:47,991
So, nobody cares.

1705
01:46:48,116 --> 01:46:50,494
Excuse me? I care.

1706
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:55,499
Okay. Can I show you something?

1707
01:46:58,418 --> 01:47:01,588
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1708
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:03,507
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1709
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:06,510
can be found in these books.

1710
01:47:06,593 --> 01:47:10,13
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,

1711
01:47:10,97 --> 01:47:12,516
then maybe you can track the man.

1712
01:47:13,16 --> 01:47:15,811
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,

1713
01:47:15,894 --> 01:47:19,606
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1714
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:23,610
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1715
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:30,909
- Missing.
- It means they were stolen.

1716
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:35,289
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1717
01:47:35,414 --> 01:47:37,1000
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1718
01:47:40,794 --> 01:47:45,215
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1719
01:47:45,299 --> 01:47:46,884
Who are you again?

1720
01:47:49,11 --> 01:47:50,721
I just wanna help.

1721
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:56,101
I can't allow you to help.

1722
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,20
I can't discuss the case with you.

1723
01:47:58,103 --> 01:48:00,606
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you

1724
01:48:00,689 --> 01:48:02,816
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1725
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,818
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1726
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:19,499
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1727
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:22,294
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1728
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:25,506
- And Dave Toschi sent you?
- Yes.

1729
01:48:25,589 --> 01:48:27,508
- Why?
- Maybe he...

1730
01:48:27,591 --> 01:48:30,385
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1731
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:35,307
- What are you, some kind of boy scout?
- Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1732
01:48:36,308 --> 01:48:39,520
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1733
01:48:40,604 --> 01:48:43,106
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1734
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,609
I understand what you're trying to do.

1735
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:48,487
But this is an open police investigation.

1736
01:48:48,612 --> 01:48:50,697
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1737
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:54,117
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1738
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:57,120
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1739
01:48:57,996 --> 01:49:00,207
He's yesterday's news, right?

1740
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:03,01
That's what they say.

1741
01:49:04,02 --> 01:49:05,796
So, what's the harm?

1742
01:49:05,879 --> 01:49:07,381
{Y:i}No pens, no paper.

1743
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:10,592
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.

1744
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:11,718
Okay.

1745
01:49:14,12 --> 01:49:15,305
Okay, here we go.

1746
01:49:15,389 --> 01:49:17,516
- Which one?
- All of them.

1747
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:20,310
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1748
01:49:20,394 --> 01:49:21,603
243-146.

1749
01:49:21,687 --> 01:49:23,480
You don't smoke, do you?

1750
01:49:23,605 --> 01:49:25,691
Once. In high school.

1751
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:30,487
What's this?

1752
01:49:31,405 --> 01:49:32,698
Thank you.

1753
01:50:00,893 --> 01:50:02,895
{Y:i}Man, you really creeped us out.

1754
01:50:08,692 --> 01:50:10,110
{Y:i}"Nine millimeter.

1755
01:50:12,404 --> 01:50:14,907
{Y:i}"Said nothing and began firing."

1756
01:50:23,707 --> 01:50:25,00
"Most Dangerous Game.

1757
01:50:25,83 --> 01:50:27,920
{Y:i}"Do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting.

1758
01:50:28,03 --> 01:50:30,88
{Y:i}"Not because of handwriting.

1759
01:50:30,714 --> 01:50:32,591
"Darlene's sister, Linda.

1760
01:50:32,716 --> 01:50:35,385
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1761
01:50:36,11 --> 01:50:38,805
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man."

1762
01:50:39,806 --> 01:50:41,391
Thank you so much.

1763
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:45,312
Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.

1764
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:50,484
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Bawart.

1765
01:50:50,692 --> 01:50:52,486
- Who's that?
- That's Graysmith.

1766
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:55,906
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1767
01:50:57,491 --> 01:50:58,784
Well, good for him.

1768
01:51:29,314 --> 01:51:31,608
- Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
- No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1769
01:51:31,692 --> 01:51:33,193
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1770
01:51:33,318 --> 01:51:34,486
on the same bench at the same time.

1771
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:36,989
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1772
01:51:37,114 --> 01:51:39,783
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch

1773
01:51:39,908 --> 01:51:41,618
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1774
01:51:41,702 --> 01:51:44,204
- and show him suspect photos?
- Why?

1775
01:51:44,288 --> 01:51:46,707
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1776
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:48,208
No, I mean, why are you asking me?

1777
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:50,85
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.

1778
01:51:50,294 --> 01:51:53,05
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1779
01:51:53,88 --> 01:51:55,215
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1780
01:51:55,299 --> 01:51:57,301
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,

1781
01:51:57,384 --> 01:51:58,385
a George Waters?

1782
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:00,304
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1783
01:52:00,387 --> 01:52:02,14
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1784
01:52:02,97 --> 01:52:03,682
- She was popular.
- Very.

1785
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:05,517
Yeah. So...

1786
01:52:05,601 --> 01:52:07,519
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,

1787
01:52:07,603 --> 01:52:09,188
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1788
01:52:09,313 --> 01:52:10,397
And what's a painting party?

1789
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,482
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1790
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:13,692
Sounds like a terrible party.

1791
01:52:13,817 --> 01:52:17,613
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1792
01:52:17,696 --> 01:52:19,489
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1793
01:52:19,615 --> 01:52:21,408
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1794
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:25,913
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1795
01:52:26,79 --> 01:52:27,915
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1796
01:52:27,998 --> 01:52:29,583
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,

1797
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:31,84
you're gonna have to find another way.

1798
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:32,503
I have another way.

1799
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:34,213
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1800
01:52:34,296 --> 01:52:37,382
- Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
- No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1801
01:52:37,508 --> 01:52:39,801
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,

1802
01:52:39,885 --> 01:52:42,221
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1803
01:52:42,304 --> 01:52:44,181
They started around 1:30 a.m.,

1804
01:52:44,306 --> 01:52:47,893
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1805
01:52:48,18 --> 01:52:50,103
- This was in the Vallejo files?
- Yeah.

1806
01:52:50,187 --> 01:52:51,313
God damn it.

1807
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:53,106
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?

1808
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:56,109
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family

1809
01:52:56,193 --> 01:52:58,195
90 minutes after they were shot.

1810
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,405
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,

1811
01:53:00,489 --> 01:53:01,990
then he recognizes Darlene...

1812
01:53:02,115 --> 01:53:04,117
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1813
01:53:04,201 --> 01:53:07,412
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1814
01:53:09,289 --> 01:53:10,999
That's good, Robert.

1815
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:14,711
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1816
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:16,713
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1817
01:53:16,797 --> 01:53:19,591
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1818
01:53:23,512 --> 01:53:25,97
You know,

1819
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:28,517
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1820
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,18
He did that in San Francisco once.

1821
01:53:30,185 --> 01:53:31,603
What? Who did he call?

1822
01:53:31,812 --> 01:53:34,815
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1823
01:53:35,482 --> 01:53:37,609
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1824
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:41,780
Melvin Belli.

1825
01:53:42,781 --> 01:53:44,992
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1826
01:53:45,117 --> 01:53:48,120
- He should be along soon.
- Oh, that's all right.

1827
01:53:48,203 --> 01:53:50,581
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...

1828
01:53:50,706 --> 01:53:52,499
He's usually not this late.

1829
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:55,419
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1830
01:53:56,211 --> 01:54:00,90
- You are here on business?
- I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1831
01:54:00,215 --> 01:54:03,218
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1832
01:54:03,302 --> 01:54:07,890
- You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
- No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1833
01:54:08,15 --> 01:54:11,310
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1834
01:54:11,393 --> 01:54:14,605
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1835
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:17,316
Yes. You want something to drink?

1836
01:54:18,317 --> 01:54:22,321
- When was this?
- Oh, so many years ago.

1837
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:26,617
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1838
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:27,910
Gone for a week.

1839
01:54:27,993 --> 01:54:30,287
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1840
01:54:30,412 --> 01:54:32,80
I said, "He is not here."

1841
01:54:32,206 --> 01:54:35,83
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1842
01:54:35,209 --> 01:54:37,211
And then he hangs up.

1843
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:38,795
Then the letter arrived.

1844
01:54:38,921 --> 01:54:42,883
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.

1845
01:54:43,08 --> 01:54:45,10
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1846
01:54:45,93 --> 01:54:48,805
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1847
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:50,807
So, he left on the 18th.

1848
01:54:52,17 --> 01:54:53,519
Is that helpful?

1849
01:54:53,602 --> 01:54:55,20
She said it was his birthday.

1850
01:54:55,103 --> 01:54:58,899
{Y:i}Well, you'd have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?

1851
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:00,400
How?

1852
01:55:00,484 --> 01:55:03,612
{Y:i}Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.

1853
01:55:03,695 --> 01:55:06,615
{Y:i}- How do I get a hold of him?
- You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1854
01:55:06,698 --> 01:55:08,909
{Y:i}As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.

1855
01:55:08,992 --> 01:55:10,285
How do I confirm it?

1856
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:12,913
{Y:i}Well, if my partner
did talk to someone from Justice,

1857
01:55:13,80 --> 01:55:14,581
{Y:i}then they would've had
to put that in a report.

1858
01:55:14,706 --> 01:55:17,00
{Y:i}That's standard procedure.

1859
01:55:17,84 --> 01:55:19,211
{Y:i}- Okay.
- Mel Nicolai.

1860
01:55:19,294 --> 01:55:21,213
{Y:i}- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1861
01:55:21,296 --> 01:55:23,507
I just need to confirm a date.

1862
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:24,883
- Mr. Graysmith...
- I've narrowed it down

1863
01:55:25,08 --> 01:55:27,302
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...

1864
01:55:27,386 --> 01:55:30,681
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1865
01:55:30,806 --> 01:55:32,182
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

1866
01:55:32,307 --> 01:55:35,102
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

1867
01:55:35,185 --> 01:55:37,312
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

1868
01:55:37,396 --> 01:55:40,190
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

1869
01:55:40,315 --> 01:55:42,693
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1870
01:55:42,818 --> 01:55:44,111
He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.

1871
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:45,904
What if he made a mistake?

1872
01:55:45,988 --> 01:55:47,990
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

1873
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:50,492
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.

1874
01:55:50,617 --> 01:55:51,994
What if? What if? What if?

1875
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:55,414
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1876
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:58,83
We took this very seriously.

1877
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:01,420
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

1878
01:56:01,503 --> 01:56:03,714
Bill Armstrong.

1879
01:56:09,303 --> 01:56:11,180
Can I give you a piece of advice?

1880
01:56:11,305 --> 01:56:12,890
You're looking in the wrong place.

1881
01:56:13,15 --> 01:56:16,18
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.

1882
01:56:16,101 --> 01:56:17,519
Stick to the evidence.

1883
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:19,605
Hi.

1884
01:56:27,905 --> 01:56:30,991
- Hey. How was your day?
- Long.

1885
01:56:36,496 --> 01:56:37,915
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

1886
01:56:37,998 --> 01:56:40,709
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

1887
01:56:40,792 --> 01:56:41,919
He called.

1888
01:56:42,02 --> 01:56:44,87
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

1889
01:56:44,213 --> 01:56:45,506
Oh, great.

1890
01:56:45,589 --> 01:56:48,383
- So you're taking off work?
- Just an hour.

1891
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:52,304
Sacramento's two hours away.

1892
01:56:53,514 --> 01:56:55,98
- Really?
- Yes.

1893
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:57,392
What's this?

1894
01:56:57,518 --> 01:57:00,103
Oh, that's that article.

1895
01:57:00,187 --> 01:57:03,815
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

1896
01:57:03,899 --> 01:57:04,983
Yeah.

1897
01:57:05,108 --> 01:57:07,694
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

1898
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:09,196
Well, that's what the article's about.

1899
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:11,782
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

1900
01:57:11,907 --> 01:57:12,908
Why? Are you embarrassed?

1901
01:57:12,991 --> 01:57:16,203
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

1902
01:57:16,912 --> 01:57:18,80
{Y:i}He reads the Chronicle.

1903
01:57:18,205 --> 01:57:20,707
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

1904
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:27,589
{Y:i}- Hello.
- Mr. Graysmith?

1905
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:30,300
{Y:i}The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?

1906
01:57:30,384 --> 01:57:33,512
{Y:i}- Yeah?
- I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1907
01:57:37,307 --> 01:57:38,392
Who is this?

1908
01:57:38,517 --> 01:57:40,602
{Y:i}The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.

1909
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:43,397
{Y:i}He recorded his murders on film.

1910
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:46,900
{Y:i}I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1911
01:57:46,984 --> 01:57:49,903
{Y:i}There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.

1912
01:57:49,987 --> 01:57:52,489
{Y:i}- Pen, pen.
- V-A-U-G-H-N.

1913
01:57:52,614 --> 01:57:54,783
{Y:i}He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1914
01:57:54,908 --> 01:57:56,994
{Y:i}Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer,

1915
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,705
{Y:i}and he is storing
some film canisters for him.

1916
01:57:59,788 --> 01:58:01,498
{Y:i}In these canisters is the evidence.

1917
01:58:01,582 --> 01:58:05,02
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

1918
01:58:05,85 --> 01:58:06,712
{Y:i}You have quite enough to get started.

1919
01:58:06,795 --> 01:58:08,380
Oh, please.

1920
01:58:08,505 --> 01:58:11,800
{Y:i}The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1921
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:17,514
Your toast is burning.

1922
01:58:18,682 --> 01:58:23,687
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

1923
01:58:24,396 --> 01:58:26,690
Once we lock that into our brains,

1924
01:58:26,815 --> 01:58:29,109
our handwriting may change
over the years,

1925
01:58:29,193 --> 01:58:31,904
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

1926
01:58:31,987 --> 01:58:33,488
- Understand?
- Yes.

1927
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:36,909
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1928
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:40,621
Specifically with his "K."

1929
01:58:41,705 --> 01:58:44,583
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.

1930
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:46,293
Later letters, he did them with three.

1931
01:58:46,418 --> 01:58:48,504
- Why?
- We don't know.

1932
01:58:48,587 --> 01:58:50,714
Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

1933
01:58:50,797 --> 01:58:53,884
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

1934
01:58:54,09 --> 01:58:55,385
All of them.

1935
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:59,14
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

1936
01:58:59,97 --> 01:59:03,18
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

1937
01:59:03,101 --> 01:59:04,186
No.

1938
01:59:04,394 --> 01:59:07,481
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

1939
01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:11,902
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

1940
01:59:11,985 --> 01:59:14,112
His name was Wallace Penny.

1941
01:59:14,905 --> 01:59:17,199
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

1942
01:59:17,282 --> 01:59:19,409
Gave me a name.

1943
01:59:19,493 --> 01:59:21,620
Rick. Rick somebody.

1944
01:59:21,703 --> 01:59:24,81
- Rick Marshall?
- Yeah.

1945
01:59:24,206 --> 01:59:26,792
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.

1946
01:59:26,917 --> 01:59:29,503
After he left, then I checked my files.

1947
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:31,380
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

1948
01:59:38,595 --> 01:59:39,680
Hello?

1949
01:59:44,893 --> 01:59:46,603
Hello? Who is this?

1950
01:59:56,697 --> 01:59:58,407
It's the wrong number.

1951
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:07,708
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

1952
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:10,919
What are you after?

1953
02:00:11,03 --> 02:00:12,87
What do you got?

1954
02:00:12,212 --> 02:00:17,301
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

1955
02:00:17,384 --> 02:00:18,886
This is off the record.

1956
02:00:19,94 --> 02:00:21,513
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

1957
02:00:21,597 --> 02:00:23,307
I handed him a photo.

1958
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:25,809
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,

1959
02:00:25,893 --> 02:00:28,312
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

1960
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:30,314
And he wipes them off.

1961
02:00:30,898 --> 02:00:32,691
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1962
02:00:32,816 --> 02:00:35,402
Because when they finally
did run his prints,

1963
02:00:35,485 --> 02:00:37,779
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

1964
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:39,907
- So, then, it's not him.
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

1965
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:42,117
No. What do you mean?

1966
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,620
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

1967
02:00:44,703 --> 02:00:46,705
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him,

1968
02:00:46,914 --> 02:00:48,790
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

1969
02:00:48,999 --> 02:00:50,918
But it was in the victim's blood.

1970
02:00:51,84 --> 02:00:52,419
Could have been one of the bystanders,

1971
02:00:52,503 --> 02:00:54,880
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.

1972
02:00:55,05 --> 02:00:57,299
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.

1973
02:00:57,382 --> 02:00:58,717
Which is why we also used handwriting.

1974
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,93
But not for Rick Marshall.

1975
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:03,305
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

1976
02:01:03,388 --> 02:01:07,184
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

1977
02:01:07,309 --> 02:01:09,603
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

1978
02:01:09,686 --> 02:01:10,687
My thoughts exactly.

1979
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:15,609
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

1980
02:01:15,692 --> 02:01:18,111
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

1981
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,280
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

1982
02:01:20,489 --> 02:01:24,284
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.

1983
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:26,620
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.

1984
02:01:26,703 --> 02:01:28,580
Yeah, and three?

1985
02:01:28,705 --> 02:01:30,290
Get creative.

1986
02:01:30,415 --> 02:01:33,85
{Y:i}I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.

1987
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:34,586
{Y:i}Beyond that, you're on your own.

1988
02:01:34,711 --> 02:01:37,89
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,

1989
02:01:37,214 --> 02:01:38,590
the one who called me?

1990
02:01:38,715 --> 02:01:41,218
{Y:i}You mean Wallace Penny?

1991
02:01:41,301 --> 02:01:43,387
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

1992
02:01:52,813 --> 02:01:55,983
{Y:i}- Hello?
- Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1993
02:01:56,108 --> 02:01:57,109
{Y:i}How did you find me?

1994
02:01:57,192 --> 02:01:59,194
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

1995
02:01:59,403 --> 02:02:00,696
{Y:i}I told you. Vaughn is who...

1996
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:03,699
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

1997
02:02:03,782 --> 02:02:06,285
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

1998
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:07,995
Can you help me or not?

1999
02:02:09,705 --> 02:02:14,418
{Y:i}Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.

2000
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:16,420
{Y:i}- I'll send one down.
- Thank you.

2001
02:02:26,388 --> 02:02:28,807
- I'll need to see more samples.
- Yeah, but is it...

2002
02:02:28,891 --> 02:02:31,393
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2003
02:02:31,518 --> 02:02:33,896
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2004
02:02:34,21 --> 02:02:36,982
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2005
02:02:37,107 --> 02:02:39,109
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.

2006
02:02:39,193 --> 02:02:41,904
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,

2007
02:02:41,987 --> 02:02:45,115
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.

2008
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:49,703
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

2009
02:02:49,786 --> 02:02:52,789
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.

2010
02:02:52,915 --> 02:02:55,292
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the poster,

2011
02:02:55,417 --> 02:02:58,504
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match

2012
02:02:58,587 --> 02:03:00,214
is the letter "K."

2013
02:03:02,216 --> 02:03:06,94
You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?

2014
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:09,681
{Y:i}Unit Five.
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.

2015
02:03:21,693 --> 02:03:24,112
{Y:i}- Dispatch.
- Hey. Dave Toschi.

2016
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:25,781
{Y:i}I'll connect you.

2017
02:03:26,615 --> 02:03:27,991
{Y:i}- Dave?
- Yeah. What's up?

2018
02:03:28,116 --> 02:03:30,494
{Y:i}Jennings here from the Chronicle.

2019
02:03:30,619 --> 02:03:32,579
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.

2020
02:03:32,704 --> 02:03:33,705
See what?

2021
02:03:33,914 --> 02:03:36,583
{Y:i}The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.

2022
02:03:36,708 --> 02:03:37,709
Okay, okay.

2023
02:03:40,87 --> 02:03:42,297
Shit. All right, come on.

2024
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:44,383
Hall of Justice!

2025
02:03:44,508 --> 02:03:47,511
Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

2026
02:03:53,809 --> 02:03:54,810
Dave!

2027
02:03:56,19 --> 02:03:57,896
Do you have it with you?

2028
02:04:00,983 --> 02:04:03,485
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

2029
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:06,613
"Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.

2030
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:09,783
"That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

2031
02:04:09,908 --> 02:04:12,619
"He will get tired, then leave me alone.

2032
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:16,81
"I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?

2033
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:18,292
"I'm now in control of all things."

2034
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:20,919
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

2035
02:04:22,796 --> 02:04:24,590
We need to talk.

2036
02:04:24,715 --> 02:04:26,383
{Y:i}Good evening. Our top story tonight,

2037
02:04:26,508 --> 02:04:29,11
{Y:i}the San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed

2038
02:04:29,94 --> 02:04:31,597
{Y:i}that the man
who calls himself the Zodiac

2039
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:36,101
{Y:i}and terrorized the Bay Area
has broken his silence of 51 months.

2040
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:38,687
{Y:i}In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you,"

2041
02:04:38,812 --> 02:04:42,191
{Y:i}the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry,

2042
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:45,485
{Y:i}and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet.

2043
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:47,112
These carrots are perfect.

2044
02:04:47,196 --> 02:04:48,614
{Y:i}The terse 66 word message
also manages...

2045
02:04:48,697 --> 02:04:49,698
Just go.

2046
02:04:49,781 --> 02:04:52,784
{Y:i}...to mention San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen

2047
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:55,787
{Y:i}and the Department's own
David Toschi by name.

2048
02:04:55,913 --> 02:04:57,497
{Y:i}- May I be excused?
- Are they targets?

2049
02:04:57,581 --> 02:04:58,582
Fine, but you have to come back

2050
02:04:58,707 --> 02:05:00,417
and finish at least half
of what's on that plate.

2051
02:05:00,501 --> 02:05:02,711
{Y:i}More team coverage
on the cipher slayer's return

2052
02:05:02,794 --> 02:05:05,214
{Y:i}begins as Alan Freeman has more.

2053
02:05:05,297 --> 02:05:06,507
{Y:i}Thank you, Eric.

2054
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:09,09
{Y:i}San Francisco Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin says

2055
02:05:09,92 --> 02:05:11,720
{Y:i}that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery,

2056
02:05:11,887 --> 02:05:13,805
{Y:i}but it was written by the very man

2057
02:05:13,889 --> 02:05:17,518
{Y:i}trusted to hunt down this killer,
David Toschi.

2058
02:05:17,601 --> 02:05:21,396
{Y:i}Maupin, a very well-respected author,
has gone on record saying

2059
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:26,109
{Y:i}that he believes Toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself.

2060
02:05:26,193 --> 02:05:29,279
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2061
02:05:29,404 --> 02:05:31,281
David got a kick out of it

2062
02:05:31,406 --> 02:05:33,408
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2063
02:05:33,492 --> 02:05:35,410
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2064
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:38,497
{Y:i}It was like
writing fan mail to himself. That's all.

2065
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:40,791
{Y:i}But David did not write that letter.

2066
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:44,02
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2067
02:05:44,86 --> 02:05:45,420
{Y:i}Blow over?

2068
02:05:45,587 --> 02:05:47,589
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2069
02:05:47,714 --> 02:05:51,09
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

2070
02:05:51,93 --> 02:05:53,512
{Y:i}- May I talk to him?
- No.

2071
02:05:54,596 --> 02:05:55,806
Okay, can you just ask him

2072
02:05:55,889 --> 02:05:58,308
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2073
02:05:58,392 --> 02:06:00,102
Is that all you can think about?

2074
02:06:00,185 --> 02:06:03,605
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2075
02:06:09,319 --> 02:06:10,779
This girl, she wants music lessons?

2076
02:06:10,904 --> 02:06:12,406
Dave! Dave!

2077
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,119
I'll catch up to you.

2078
02:06:17,202 --> 02:06:19,413
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

2079
02:06:19,496 --> 02:06:21,206
I just need your help to find Linda.

2080
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:23,208
- Jesus.
- Look, two seconds.

2081
02:06:25,294 --> 02:06:27,588
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.

2082
02:06:27,713 --> 02:06:30,90
- Who's we?
- Sherwood and I.

2083
02:06:30,215 --> 02:06:31,300
Sherwood?

2084
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:33,510
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2085
02:06:33,594 --> 02:06:35,95
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2086
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,598
- He retired.
- Is that what he told you?

2087
02:06:37,681 --> 02:06:41,518
- What, are you saying he's wrong?
- I'm saying stop calling my house.

2088
02:06:42,519 --> 02:06:44,104
- We ran them on Rick Marshall.
- No, Robert.

2089
02:06:44,188 --> 02:06:45,480
No, I know you don't think it's him.

2090
02:06:45,606 --> 02:06:47,107
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.

2091
02:06:47,191 --> 02:06:49,902
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,

2092
02:06:49,985 --> 02:06:51,111
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2093
02:06:51,195 --> 02:06:52,404
- Robert. Robert, stop it!
- What?

2094
02:06:52,613 --> 02:06:54,781
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.

2095
02:06:54,907 --> 02:06:55,908
They're blind alleys.

2096
02:06:55,991 --> 02:06:58,410
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.

2097
02:06:58,493 --> 02:06:59,620
He was just gonna do them.

2098
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:02,581
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?

2099
02:07:02,706 --> 02:07:06,793
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

2100
02:07:06,919 --> 02:07:09,880
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2101
02:07:10,05 --> 02:07:14,301
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

2102
02:07:14,384 --> 02:07:16,720
- What do you do for a living?
- You know what I do for a living.

2103
02:07:16,803 --> 02:07:19,97
- You're a cartoonist.
- So what are you saying?

2104
02:07:19,181 --> 02:07:22,309
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

2105
02:07:25,312 --> 02:07:27,898
- He's still out there, Dave.
- No, Robert. I am through with this.

2106
02:07:27,981 --> 02:07:29,900
I am through with you.

2107
02:07:36,198 --> 02:07:38,700
What about September 26, 1970?

2108
02:07:38,784 --> 02:07:42,412
- Okay, which one was that?
- The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2109
02:07:45,207 --> 02:07:46,708
One day before the vernal equinox.

2110
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:48,585
- Dad?
- Yeah. Mark that.

2111
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:52,89
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2112
02:07:52,214 --> 02:07:54,883
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.

2113
02:07:57,511 --> 02:07:58,804
Oh, guys.

2114
02:07:59,12 --> 02:08:02,15
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?

2115
02:08:02,599 --> 02:08:06,103
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2116
02:08:09,606 --> 02:08:10,607
Hello.

2117
02:08:10,691 --> 02:08:12,901
{Y:i}Mr. Graysmith,
it's Ken Narlow from Napa.

2118
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:16,697
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

2119
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:18,407
{Y:i}Yeah. How can I help?

2120
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:21,994
I called you because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles

2121
02:08:22,119 --> 02:08:23,704
with the Zodiac's timeline.

2122
02:08:23,787 --> 02:08:27,1000
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack

2123
02:08:28,83 --> 02:08:30,919
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.

2124
02:08:31,86 --> 02:08:34,06
{Y:i}- Who's working with you on this?
- Some colleagues.

2125
02:08:34,89 --> 02:08:35,90
Dad?

2126
02:08:36,91 --> 02:08:38,510
- Ken, can you hold on one second?
- Dad?

2127
02:08:38,594 --> 02:08:40,512
- What is it?
- What's this?

2128
02:08:44,683 --> 02:08:48,20
{Y:i}In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received,

2129
02:08:48,103 --> 02:08:51,481
{Y:i}every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.

2130
02:08:51,607 --> 02:08:54,401
{Y:i}But today,
where those agencies had failed,

2131
02:08:54,484 --> 02:08:57,196
{Y:i}a cartoonist has succeeded.

2132
02:08:57,321 --> 02:08:58,780
{Y:i}How did you do it?

2133
02:08:58,906 --> 02:09:04,286
{Y:i}Oh, just a lot of books from the library,
and I love puzzles, so I just...

2134
02:09:06,413 --> 02:09:08,582
Yeah. The fucking library.

2135
02:09:08,707 --> 02:09:11,793
{Y:i}I believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind...

2136
02:09:14,713 --> 02:09:17,508
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?

2137
02:09:19,218 --> 02:09:20,802
Thank you so much.

2138
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:25,15
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2139
02:09:25,98 --> 02:09:26,308
Why'd you do it?

2140
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:27,809
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2141
02:09:27,893 --> 02:09:30,604
- What are you talking about?
- You went on TV.

2142
02:09:31,188 --> 02:09:32,898
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

2143
02:09:32,981 --> 02:09:34,483
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2144
02:09:34,608 --> 02:09:36,610
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night

2145
02:09:36,693 --> 02:09:37,694
at least once a week?

2146
02:09:37,819 --> 02:09:38,904
Nobody.

2147
02:09:40,697 --> 02:09:42,616
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2148
02:09:42,699 --> 02:09:45,619
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2149
02:09:45,702 --> 02:09:48,914
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

2150
02:09:48,997 --> 02:09:51,291
And when is it gonna be finished?

2151
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:53,418
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2152
02:09:53,502 --> 02:09:55,712
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

2153
02:09:57,589 --> 02:10:01,93
I need to know who he is.

2154
02:10:01,218 --> 02:10:04,304
I need to stand there,

2155
02:10:04,388 --> 02:10:08,308
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2156
02:10:10,102 --> 02:10:12,479
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2157
02:10:12,604 --> 02:10:14,106
Of course not.

2158
02:10:15,983 --> 02:10:18,402
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2159
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,405
Why?

2160
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:25,409
Because nobody else will.

2161
02:10:25,492 --> 02:10:27,411
That's not good enough.

2162
02:10:27,494 --> 02:10:29,413
Are you done? Can I go?

2163
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,680
- Mr. Vaughn?
- Mr. Graysmith?

2164
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:47,806
- Yes.
- Hi.

2165
02:10:48,15 --> 02:10:49,308
You needed to speak to me?

2166
02:10:49,391 --> 02:10:51,810
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2167
02:10:51,894 --> 02:10:54,980
- Why don't we just go to my home?
- Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2168
02:10:55,105 --> 02:10:56,982
It's no trouble at all.

2169
02:10:57,107 --> 02:10:59,484
- Where are you parked?
- Just right there.

2170
02:10:59,610 --> 02:11:02,988
- You can follow me.
- Oh. Okay.

2171
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:23,91
Watch your step.

2172
02:11:24,301 --> 02:11:25,886
Come in.

2173
02:11:27,804 --> 02:11:31,16
- Very nice house.
- Oh, thank you.

2174
02:11:31,99 --> 02:11:32,893
It's very rustic.

2175
02:11:33,18 --> 02:11:36,188
- Can I take your jacket?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

2176
02:11:36,313 --> 02:11:38,315
Okay. This way, please.

2177
02:11:40,901 --> 02:11:42,819
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

2178
02:11:42,903 --> 02:11:45,405
- How about some tea?
- Oh, no, I'm all right.

2179
02:11:45,489 --> 02:11:46,990
- You sure?
- Yes.

2180
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:51,620
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2181
02:11:51,703 --> 02:11:53,580
while you were the organist there.

2182
02:11:53,705 --> 02:11:55,999
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game?

2183
02:11:56,83 --> 02:11:59,419
Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2184
02:11:59,503 --> 02:12:04,216
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2185
02:12:04,299 --> 02:12:05,801
In '68, '69?

2186
02:12:07,511 --> 02:12:09,680
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2187
02:12:09,805 --> 02:12:11,807
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2188
02:12:14,101 --> 02:12:16,311
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2189
02:12:16,395 --> 02:12:19,815
- He was a projectionist there, right?
- For a time, yes.

2190
02:12:19,898 --> 02:12:23,986
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2191
02:12:24,111 --> 02:12:26,613
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2192
02:12:26,697 --> 02:12:29,408
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2193
02:12:29,491 --> 02:12:31,285
You mean the symbol?

2194
02:12:32,494 --> 02:12:33,704
Hold on.

2195
02:12:34,288 --> 02:12:38,417
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2196
02:12:42,296 --> 02:12:44,882
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2197
02:12:45,07 --> 02:12:47,509
but it always arrives with it.

2198
02:12:47,593 --> 02:12:49,11
Right there.

2199
02:12:49,595 --> 02:12:53,307
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2200
02:12:54,183 --> 02:12:55,684
We got a tip

2201
02:12:55,809 --> 02:12:59,813
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2202
02:12:59,897 --> 02:13:02,983
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2203
02:13:03,901 --> 02:13:05,194
Is it true?

2204
02:13:07,196 --> 02:13:08,280
Yes.

2205
02:13:08,989 --> 02:13:11,283
- Did you open it?
- No.

2206
02:13:11,408 --> 02:13:15,704
- May I see it?
- Rick took it back in 1972.

2207
02:13:17,414 --> 02:13:22,211
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2208
02:13:22,294 --> 02:13:24,04
That and the poster.

2209
02:13:24,87 --> 02:13:25,380
The poster?

2210
02:13:27,382 --> 02:13:29,92
The poster that Rick drew.

2211
02:13:29,218 --> 02:13:32,387
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2212
02:13:32,596 --> 02:13:35,807
- Rick didn't draw any posters.
- No, he drew this one.

2213
02:13:35,891 --> 02:13:39,394
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2214
02:13:40,812 --> 02:13:42,606
That's my handwriting.

2215
02:13:50,906 --> 02:13:53,700
I won't take any more of your time.

2216
02:13:53,784 --> 02:13:59,206
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2217
02:13:59,289 --> 02:14:00,791
Oh, that's all right.

2218
02:14:00,916 --> 02:14:04,294
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2219
02:14:06,88 --> 02:14:09,07
Not many people
have basements in California.

2220
02:14:11,718 --> 02:14:12,803
I do.

2221
02:14:15,13 --> 02:14:17,15
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2222
02:14:28,318 --> 02:14:31,905
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2223
02:14:33,782 --> 02:14:36,410
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2224
02:14:36,493 --> 02:14:39,580
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2225
02:14:54,94 --> 02:14:55,596
'69.

2226
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:02,603
You live alone?

2227
02:15:02,686 --> 02:15:08,400
{Y:i}Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2228
02:15:08,483 --> 02:15:10,986
So, that would be about

2229
02:15:11,904 --> 02:15:15,199
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2230
02:15:18,118 --> 02:15:19,203
Yeah.

2231
02:15:23,707 --> 02:15:28,03
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2232
02:15:34,92 --> 02:15:36,887
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2233
02:15:38,597 --> 02:15:41,183
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2234
02:15:42,17 --> 02:15:43,18
No.

2235
02:15:46,104 --> 02:15:48,607
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2236
02:15:49,483 --> 02:15:50,984
You're welcome.

2237
02:16:12,297 --> 02:16:13,715
It's locked.

2238
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:25,894
Thank you.

2239
02:16:28,981 --> 02:16:30,983
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2240
02:16:50,502 --> 02:16:54,214
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2241
02:17:02,514 --> 02:17:03,682
Guys?

2242
02:17:37,216 --> 02:17:39,218
You've got five minutes.

2243
02:17:47,184 --> 02:17:48,310
Linda?

2244
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,979
Hi, I'm Robert.

2245
02:17:55,108 --> 02:17:56,818
Did you get my note?

2246
02:17:57,486 --> 02:17:59,488
- What's this about?
- Zodiac.

2247
02:18:01,198 --> 02:18:02,282
Figures.

2248
02:18:03,784 --> 02:18:05,911
- You got the look.
- What look?

2249
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:08,580
I didn't mean anything.

2250
02:18:09,998 --> 02:18:12,292
Tell me about this painting party.

2251
02:18:13,293 --> 02:18:15,879
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2252
02:18:19,383 --> 02:18:21,385
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,

2253
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:23,387
even though she was married.

2254
02:18:23,512 --> 02:18:25,514
And this one guy was weird, though.

2255
02:18:25,597 --> 02:18:28,892
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2256
02:18:30,18 --> 02:18:32,813
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2257
02:18:32,896 --> 02:18:35,399
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2258
02:18:35,482 --> 02:18:36,900
Really?

2259
02:18:36,984 --> 02:18:39,319
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2260
02:18:39,403 --> 02:18:41,405
- Navy?
- I think so.

2261
02:18:41,488 --> 02:18:43,699
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2262
02:18:43,782 --> 02:18:46,702
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2263
02:18:46,785 --> 02:18:48,120
The party Darlene threw,

2264
02:18:48,203 --> 02:18:51,81
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.

2265
02:18:51,206 --> 02:18:53,417
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2266
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:56,503
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2267
02:18:56,587 --> 02:18:58,05
Didn't talk to anyone.

2268
02:18:58,88 --> 02:18:59,882
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2269
02:19:00,07 --> 02:19:01,884
She was scared of him.

2270
02:19:04,94 --> 02:19:06,597
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.

2271
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:09,183
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2272
02:19:10,184 --> 02:19:14,104
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.

2273
02:19:14,188 --> 02:19:16,481
- Rick?
- No, I don't think so.

2274
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:19,610
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

2275
02:19:19,693 --> 02:19:22,196
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2276
02:19:22,321 --> 02:19:24,281
I am thinking hard.

2277
02:19:24,406 --> 02:19:25,782
It was Rick.

2278
02:19:26,783 --> 02:19:27,910
No, it wasn't.

2279
02:19:27,993 --> 02:19:30,412
- It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
- No.

2280
02:19:30,495 --> 02:19:32,206
Just say it!

2281
02:19:32,289 --> 02:19:34,82
It wasn't Rick.

2282
02:19:42,07 --> 02:19:43,300
It was Leigh.

2283
02:19:46,512 --> 02:19:49,14
- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.

2284
02:19:50,307 --> 02:19:51,600
Sounds right.

2285
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:59,316
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2286
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:01,485
- Is this an emergency?
- No, I just need to see one file.

2287
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:03,320
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.

2288
02:20:03,403 --> 02:20:05,614
- One file, just for one second.
- 8:00 a.m., when we're open.

2289
02:20:05,697 --> 02:20:07,282
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2290
02:20:07,407 --> 02:20:09,785
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!

2291
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:13,288
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2292
02:20:14,414 --> 02:20:15,499
Please!

2293
02:20:28,887 --> 02:20:30,597
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2294
02:20:30,681 --> 02:20:32,683
- You got five minutes.
- Okay.

2295
02:20:34,893 --> 02:20:36,186
Here. Here.

2296
02:20:36,311 --> 02:20:39,982
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2297
02:20:40,107 --> 02:20:43,110
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2298
02:20:43,193 --> 02:20:45,112
- So what?
- He knew her.

2299
02:20:45,195 --> 02:20:46,905
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2300
02:20:46,989 --> 02:20:49,491
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2301
02:20:49,616 --> 02:20:50,993
It's nothing.

2302
02:20:51,702 --> 02:20:53,787
- Dave Toschi...
- Agrees with me.

2303
02:20:54,496 --> 02:20:57,291
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2304
02:21:00,294 --> 02:21:01,587
I'm sorry.

2305
02:21:10,804 --> 02:21:11,889
Hello.

2306
02:21:27,112 --> 02:21:28,488
Who's there?

2307
02:21:31,992 --> 02:21:35,495
- You didn't return my calls.
- Oh, I've been kind of busy.

2308
02:21:35,621 --> 02:21:37,414
Yeah. I can see that.

2309
02:21:39,583 --> 02:21:41,502
How's the book coming?

2310
02:21:44,505 --> 02:21:46,507
I tried to send you these.

2311
02:21:47,591 --> 02:21:49,384
{Y:i}I called the Chron.

2312
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:52,304
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

2313
02:21:53,889 --> 02:21:55,15
I heard.

2314
02:22:00,187 --> 02:22:02,814
When's the last time
you ate something?

2315
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:07,486
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2316
02:22:10,197 --> 02:22:12,407
- Did it ever?
- Yeah, it did.

2317
02:22:13,909 --> 02:22:16,787
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2318
02:22:17,287 --> 02:22:19,81
You don't mean that.

2319
02:22:20,499 --> 02:22:21,708
A little.

2320
02:22:24,586 --> 02:22:26,380
The kids miss you.

2321
02:22:26,505 --> 02:22:29,591
- I can't have them see me like this.
- Neither can I.

2322
02:22:30,384 --> 02:22:32,511
So, do whatever you have to,

2323
02:22:33,512 --> 02:22:35,13
but finish this.

2324
02:23:02,583 --> 02:23:03,584
Dave!

2325
02:23:04,418 --> 02:23:06,03
Dave! It's Robert!

2326
02:23:08,297 --> 02:23:09,882
- Dave!
- Is he actually here?

2327
02:23:10,07 --> 02:23:11,717
I'm gonna kill him.

2328
02:23:12,92 --> 02:23:14,720
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2329
02:23:17,306 --> 02:23:18,390
Dave!

2330
02:23:18,515 --> 02:23:20,184
Robert! Go away!

2331
02:23:20,309 --> 02:23:22,311
Dave! He made a mistake!

2332
02:23:22,394 --> 02:23:24,396
- Get away from the window.
- I'll meet you around front.

2333
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:25,898
No, you won't.

2334
02:23:27,107 --> 02:23:29,318
- You have to hear this!
- No, I don't, Robert!

2335
02:23:29,401 --> 02:23:31,904
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2336
02:23:31,987 --> 02:23:33,780
The one time
that he gave something away!

2337
02:23:33,906 --> 02:23:37,201
- Robert, I am calling the police.
- It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2338
02:23:42,206 --> 02:23:44,499
Where did you get that name?

2339
02:23:44,583 --> 02:23:46,84
He called the Bellis' house.

2340
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:48,504
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."

2341
02:23:48,587 --> 02:23:50,506
It was his birthday.

2342
02:23:50,589 --> 02:23:53,509
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2343
02:23:56,595 --> 02:23:58,13
Get in here.

2344
02:24:00,98 --> 02:24:02,309
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2345
02:24:05,312 --> 02:24:07,105
He wrote me, you know?

2346
02:24:07,814 --> 02:24:08,899
2,500 suspects,

2347
02:24:08,982 --> 02:24:12,486
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2348
02:24:13,487 --> 02:24:15,197
They like to help, you know, sometimes.

2349
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,782
Yes, Robert, I know.

2350
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:20,911
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2351
02:24:20,994 --> 02:24:22,913
He sent me that when he got out.

2352
02:24:22,996 --> 02:24:25,791
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.

2353
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:27,709
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man."

2354
02:24:27,793 --> 02:24:29,419
And it's typewritten.

2355
02:24:29,503 --> 02:24:31,797
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2356
02:24:33,298 --> 02:24:35,92
And he knew Darlene.

2357
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:38,512
It's in the Vallejo files.

2358
02:24:43,684 --> 02:24:47,20
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2359
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:51,108
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2360
02:24:54,194 --> 02:24:56,113
All the evidence said no.

2361
02:24:57,406 --> 02:24:59,700
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2362
02:24:59,783 --> 02:25:02,911
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2363
02:25:03,787 --> 02:25:05,706
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,

2364
02:25:05,789 --> 02:25:06,915
"I'm sorry, this just won't work."

2365
02:25:06,999 --> 02:25:08,709
- But you also have Terry Pascoe...
- His protégé.

2366
02:25:08,792 --> 02:25:09,918
Yeah, fine, it's his protégé,

2367
02:25:10,02 --> 02:25:11,795
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,

2368
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:14,590
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting."

2369
02:25:14,715 --> 02:25:16,717
- So the two cancel each other out.
- No, they don't.

2370
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,93
It was Sherwood's case.

2371
02:25:18,218 --> 02:25:19,595
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2372
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,96
If it went to trial,

2373
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:24,99
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2374
02:25:24,183 --> 02:25:26,894
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,

2375
02:25:27,19 --> 02:25:28,187
because there was no evidence, Robert.

2376
02:25:28,312 --> 02:25:29,479
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?

2377
02:25:29,605 --> 02:25:30,689
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2378
02:25:30,814 --> 02:25:32,983
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2379
02:25:33,108 --> 02:25:35,319
{Y:i}The Most Dangerous Game.
The Zodiac watch.

2380
02:25:35,402 --> 02:25:36,612
The background with school children.

2381
02:25:36,695 --> 02:25:38,488
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2382
02:25:38,614 --> 02:25:40,490
All circumstantial.

2383
02:25:40,616 --> 02:25:43,285
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2384
02:25:43,410 --> 02:25:45,204
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2385
02:25:45,287 --> 02:25:46,997
- We didn't.
- That's...

2386
02:25:49,499 --> 02:25:51,418
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2387
02:25:51,585 --> 02:25:53,712
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2388
02:25:53,795 --> 02:25:57,508
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."

2389
02:25:57,591 --> 02:25:59,593
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2390
02:25:59,718 --> 02:26:01,220
- Yeah.
- So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2391
02:26:01,303 --> 02:26:05,98
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2392
02:26:06,683 --> 02:26:09,686
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.

2393
02:26:09,811 --> 02:26:10,896
All right.

2394
02:26:10,979 --> 02:26:13,815
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2395
02:26:13,899 --> 02:26:16,610
- When was the first murder in Vallejo?
- Christmas, 1968.

2396
02:26:16,693 --> 02:26:19,279
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students

2397
02:26:19,404 --> 02:26:21,490
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2398
02:26:21,615 --> 02:26:23,909
- Now, when do the letters begin?
- July, '69.

2399
02:26:23,992 --> 02:26:25,619
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2400
02:26:25,786 --> 02:26:28,789
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2401
02:26:28,914 --> 02:26:32,209
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2402
02:26:32,292 --> 02:26:34,86
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.

2403
02:26:34,211 --> 02:26:35,879
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2404
02:26:36,04 --> 02:26:39,716
- So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
- Not until January of 1974.

2405
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:41,218
He is silent for three years.

2406
02:26:41,301 --> 02:26:43,95
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again

2407
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:45,97
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2408
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,181
And what do we get?

2409
02:26:46,306 --> 02:26:50,310
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.

2410
02:26:50,394 --> 02:26:53,480
- But then the letters stop.
- What happens to Allen?

2411
02:26:57,109 --> 02:26:58,485
He's arrested.

2412
02:26:59,486 --> 02:27:02,781
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2413
02:27:02,906 --> 02:27:05,784
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2414
02:27:05,909 --> 02:27:08,495
- When is he released?
- August, '77.

2415
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:12,416
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?

2416
02:27:12,499 --> 02:27:15,586
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2417
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:24,595
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2418
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:27,14
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2419
02:27:27,97 --> 02:27:29,892
Because of the Vallejo file,

2420
02:27:30,17 --> 02:27:32,19
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2421
02:27:32,102 --> 02:27:33,103
Yes.

2422
02:27:33,187 --> 02:27:34,980
So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2423
02:27:35,105 --> 02:27:37,900
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2424
02:27:37,983 --> 02:27:40,402
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.

2425
02:27:40,485 --> 02:27:41,820
How do you put
the two of them together?

2426
02:27:41,904 --> 02:27:45,115
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,

2427
02:27:45,199 --> 02:27:47,618
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2428
02:27:47,701 --> 02:27:49,411
- Would you agree?
- Yes.

2429
02:27:50,704 --> 02:27:53,498
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2430
02:27:53,582 --> 02:27:56,84
on the corner of Tennessee and Carol.

2431
02:27:58,921 --> 02:28:03,592
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2432
02:28:05,385 --> 02:28:08,805
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2433
02:28:12,184 --> 02:28:13,685
Is that true?

2434
02:28:14,686 --> 02:28:16,188
I've walked it.

2435
02:28:19,983 --> 02:28:21,485
Jesus Christ.

2436
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:29,201
So?

2437
02:28:33,80 --> 02:28:34,706
The prints, the handwriting...

2438
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:37,793
- I'm not asking you as a cop.
- But I am a cop.

2439
02:28:40,587 --> 02:28:42,714
I can't prove this.

2440
02:28:42,798 --> 02:28:45,717
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2441
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:47,386
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2442
02:28:51,14 --> 02:28:52,599
Finish the book.

2443
02:29:01,483 --> 02:29:03,902
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2444
02:30:12,221 --> 02:30:13,680
Can I help you?

2445
02:30:15,390 --> 02:30:16,391
No.

2446
02:31:37,598 --> 02:31:38,891
Mr. Mageau.

2447
02:31:39,808 --> 02:31:42,102
Thanks for coming to see me.

2448
02:31:42,186 --> 02:31:43,604
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2449
02:31:43,687 --> 02:31:47,191
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2450
02:31:48,192 --> 02:31:51,195
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2451
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:52,487
Well, this is just a formality.

2452
02:31:52,613 --> 02:31:53,989
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2453
02:31:54,114 --> 02:31:55,991
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be

2454
02:31:56,116 --> 02:31:58,118
among these photographs.

2455
02:31:58,202 --> 02:31:59,411
You don't have to pick anybody out

2456
02:31:59,494 --> 02:32:01,705
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?

2457
02:32:01,788 --> 02:32:03,290
Yes, sir, I do.

2458
02:32:04,208 --> 02:32:05,501
All right.

2459
02:32:06,585 --> 02:32:08,86
Take your time.

2460
02:32:08,587 --> 02:32:11,381
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2461
02:32:22,809 --> 02:32:24,186
That's him.

2462
02:32:25,687 --> 02:32:27,606
How sure are you?

2463
02:32:27,689 --> 02:32:29,483
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2464
02:32:32,319 --> 02:32:33,403
He had a round face like this guy.

2465
02:32:33,487 --> 02:32:34,696
Wait. Am I to understand

2466
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,615
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2467
02:32:36,698 --> 02:32:39,701
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.

2468
02:32:41,787 --> 02:32:43,288
It's this man.

2469
02:32:44,206 --> 02:32:45,499
All right.

2470
02:32:47,292 --> 02:32:50,420
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,

2471
02:32:54,508 --> 02:32:56,93
how sure are you?

2472
02:32:59,888 --> 02:33:01,515
At least an eight.

2473
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:08,188
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2474
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:14,111
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:41,457
A girl will never forget
the first boy she likes.

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,087
Even if things don't quite work out.

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,715
Why did you do that?

5
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,967
Because you smell like dog poo.

6
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,887
You're so stupid, just like dog poo.

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,472
You're made out of poo!

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,143
But usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom.

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,561
Made...

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,104
...of...

11
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,898
...dog...

12
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,399
...poo.

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,859
Honey...

14
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:14,281
...do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things?

15
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,283
It's because he likes you.

16
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,660
And there it is.

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,497
That's the beginning of our problem.

18
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:27,795
That little boy is doing those terrible things
because he's got a crush on you.

19
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,296
Do you know what this means?

20
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,589
We're all encouraged...

21
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,924
...no, programmed...

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,635
...to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk...

23
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,262
...that means he likes you.

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,351
He likes you too much.

25
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,394
You're too pretty and too awesome.

26
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,688
- Yes.
- He can't handle it.

27
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,777
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,154
I'm sure he just lost your number.

29
00:01:55,698 --> 00:02:00,285
He's not asking you out because he's
intimidated by your professional success.

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,049
Trust me. It's because he's just
getting out of a serious relationship.

31
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,220
Trust me. It's because he's never had
a serious relationship.

32
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,734
Why do we say this stuff to each other?

33
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,405
Is it possible that it's because
we're too scared...

34
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,741
...and it's too hard to say
the one obvious truth...

35
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,911
...that's staring everyone in the face?

36
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,805
So Janine says
you're a real-estate agent.

37
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,224
Yeah, but I'm not
one of those cheesy ones...

38
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,311
...that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts.

39
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,813
So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,023
Basically.

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,108
- It's much classier.
- My thoughts exactly.

42
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,448
Wonder why Janine never thought
to introduce us before.

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,408
I don't know. I don't know.

44
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,620
- Hey, guys. Want another round?
- You want one more?

45
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:30,959
Only if you do. I mean,
if you need to get going, I totally...

46
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,462
Uh...

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,256
Okay, well...

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,468
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,929
And a beer, please.

50
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,972
Be right back.

51
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,977
- Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
- It was really nice meeting you.

52
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,563
- Bye.
- See you.

53
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,822
Hey, it's me.

54
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,450
He's cute, and I think it went well.

55
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:08,163
And I think he might be leaving me
a message at home as we speak.

56
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,417
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.

57
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,504
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
Conor. Thanks.

58
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,674
Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to grab a late bite.

59
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,385
Tonight? I...

60
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,639
No, I was supposed to meet friends
but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

61
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,433
No, of course, I'm not mad.
Well, I'll be up for a while.

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,519
- Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- I'll be up.

63
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,937
- Oh, can you hold on?
- Okay.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,314
No, that's fine.
You just have one thing, so...

65
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,275
No, technically I have six...

66
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,028
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,
so I think you should go.

67
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,530
Okay.

68
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,990
Let me call you right back.

69
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,199
All right. Okay.

70
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,034
- Hi.
- Hey.

71
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,370
Just that and that, please.

72
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,372
Thank you.

73
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,044
Oh, my word.

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,339
Seriously? That's not possible.

75
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,551
I just deposited cash three days ago,
so it's just not possible.

76
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,512
Oh, it's not that.
Let me check something.

77
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,681
Congratulations, you won.

78
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,725
What?

79
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,937
Our Funky Fall promotion.
You're our 1000th customer this month.

80
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,689
What?

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,487
Are you kidding me?

82
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,823
I don't do kidding.

83
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this, it's so exciting.

84
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,914
Oh, my God.
I never won anything before.

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,543
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

86
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,629
Yea... No. I don't think so.

87
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,215
- Really?
- Yes.

88
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,426
Thank you! Come here.

89
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,928
Wow.

90
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,767
As the Terps move
to mid-ice, trying to...

91
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,769
- Hey.
- Hey.

92
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,938
- How was the date?
- It was fine. Whatever.

93
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,066
- Why are you here?
- My cable's out.

94
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,569
Come on, Spiewak,
it's not the Ice Capades.

95
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,489
You didn't hear the phone ring
by any chance, did you?

96
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,991
- No, I didn't.
- Shit.

97
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,869
Anna gave me the old,
"I'll call you right back."

98
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,121
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?

99
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,042
That was 22 minutes ago.

100
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,960
Do I call back?

101
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,213
Should you call back? No, absolutely not.

102
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,883
I'm gonna call back
and say I'm going to bed.

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,803
What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna...?

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,137
No, it's a great idea.

105
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,349
I'll call and say, "In case you were
gonna call me back, don't...

106
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,643
...because I'll be sleeping."
A genius idea.

107
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,103
Okay, no, that's brilliant.

108
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,481
When you wake up you can say, "I'm awake
now, I'm available to take your call."

109
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,692
Oh, gosh. A second.

110
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,320
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

111
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,656
I was...

112
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,616
Wait, what was I saying again?

113
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,744
You don't wanna be like your mother,
wake up one morning...

114
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,830
...and realize
you never pursued your dreams.

115
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,289
Is that what I was saying?

116
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,083
- You want some gum?
- No, thank you.

117
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,087
God, that's kind of heavy
for a grocery chat.

118
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,506
- No, that's okay.
- Isn't it?

119
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,092
- Sorry.
- I actually might be able to help.

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,513
Yeah, I know a guy at my office
who deals exclusively with music clients.

121
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,806
- Are you kidding?
- Uh-uh.

122
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,641
Oh, my God.

123
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,102
- Are you my savior or something?
- No.

124
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,105
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

125
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,358
Oh, this is so unexpected.

126
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,663
Okay...

127
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,873
I don't...

128
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,208
I'm married.

129
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,544
I don't do this.

130
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,047
You don't do what?
You don't help struggling singers?

131
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:53,221
Not hot yoga-instructing singers...

132
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,266
...who are incredibly charming.

133
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,604
Hm.

134
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,483
Well, you could...
You could give me your card.

135
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,068
That's legit, right? Is that allowed?

136
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,320
I could do that.

137
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,238
- Yeah.
- That'd be okay, right?

138
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,073
Yeah.

139
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,827
Great, thank you so much.

140
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,746
Course. Do you need help to your car?

141
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,165
- Where'd you park?
- No, I'm fine. It's okay.

142
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,585
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,420
Okay.

144
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,517
Who was that?

145
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,897
- Oh, that was a prospective client.
- Oh.

146
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,191
Okay.

147
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,403
I can talk to a woman.
It doesn't have to be like that.

148
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,447
No. Absolutely not.

149
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,909
- Just drive.
- Relax.

150
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,805
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,140
- How you doing?
- Good.

152
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,310
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just got off the phone.

153
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,479
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my little sister.

154
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,566
- How's she doing?
- She's getting married.

155
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,484
Really?

156
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,069
Yeah.

157
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,362
Great.

158
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,947
You really think that's great?

159
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,699
Yeah.

160
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,993
Devon seems like...

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,911
...a great guy.

162
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,792
Well, so you think it's great
that they're getting married...

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,381
...but you don't ever feel like
we're going against nature, or something...

164
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,883
...by not getting married?

165
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,595
No.

166
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,017
Going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

167
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,479
You and I are just two people
who happen not to be married.

168
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,191
Let me tell you something. People
who get married are not to be trusted.

169
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,569
You are so weird.

170
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,987
They're not. You know why?

171
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,865
Because if you are so legitimately happy,
honestly...

172
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,743
...you wouldn't feel the need
to make a big show out of it.

173
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,620
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

174
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,538
They do it because they're insecure...

175
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,958
...and they think getting married's
what they're supposed to be doing.

176
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,711
So they're lying to themselves
and to other people.

177
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,212
Seriously.

178
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,716
Think about you and your friends.
Okay?

179
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,093
These women you have
great relationships with...

180
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,138
...you're close to them,
some of them you've known for years.

181
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,723
But you don't feel the need...

182
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:47,354
...to write a $45 check to the state
of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

183
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,189
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Right?

184
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,400
Why should it be any different,
you know, with me and you?

185
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,196
We're very happy, I love you,
I'm committed to you...

186
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,573
...we have a great life, you know?

187
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,783
Yes, you're right.

188
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,078
Why can't we just be happy?

189
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,913
You're right.

190
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,666
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.
- Okay.

191
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,926
Please enter your pass...

192
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,594
You have no messages.

193
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,680
Main menu. To send a message...

194
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,727
Okay, so clearly he hasn't called.

195
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,688
Maybe he's away on business.

196
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,899
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

197
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,402
- Staying in town is his business.
- Right.

198
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,278
Well, look, let me tell you.

199
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,241
After I went out with Ben for the first
time, he didn't call me for 11 days.

200
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,952
Eleven days. And now
he's the world's best husband.

201
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,286
That happens all the time.

202
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,705
- Really?
- Really.

203
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,998
You want coffee?

204
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,626
- I got you 2 percent.
- Thanks.

205
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,757
This is all your fault.

206
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,759
What? Why?

207
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,469
You set us up.

208
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:07,475
No. You asked me if I know any guys,
and I gave Conor your phone number.

209
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,269
That's not a setup.

210
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,230
When I do a setup,
I weigh the pros and cons.

211
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,482
I do my due diligence.

212
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,112
All I know about Conor
is that he sold us this house.

213
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,160
Seriously, stop.

214
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,872
He said he always hangs out after work
at the City Supper Club.

215
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,291
Maybe I should do a little drive-by?

216
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,460
Please don't.

217
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,670
He'll call.

218
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,013
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

219
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,474
It's, like, who is this service helping?

220
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,517
I mean, for centuries...

221
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,772
Okay, well maybe not centuries,
but for, like, a lot and lot of years...

222
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,025
...people have been answering their phone,
not knowing who it is...

223
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,611
...and as far as I can tell,
no one's died from that.

224
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,491
And it's like if the police wanna know
who placed a call, they could trace it.

225
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,159
I mean, what am I, the police?

226
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,038
This constant obsession with needing
to know who's calling all the time...

227
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,498
...it's, like, so gross.

228
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,293
Like, you pick up the phone,
you find out who it is, then you know.

229
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,920
It's, like...

230
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,547
Look, all I'm saying...

231
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,344
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...

232
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,555
...to call him at 15-minute intervals
until he picks up.

233
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,849
But if he looks down
and sees my numbers...

234
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,311
...he's gonna think
I'm some kind of psycho or something.

235
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,605
Which I'm not.

236
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,482
Obviously.

237
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,115
Hello?

238
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,784
Mom.

239
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,911
I gotta call you back.

240
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,582
Inhale. Upward-facing dog.

241
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,046
Look up towards the ceiling.

242
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,966
He ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came.

243
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,093
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

244
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,762
He initiated the hug.
He said it was nice meeting me.

245
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,933
So wait. This was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date?

246
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,435
End. Why, does it matter?

247
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,939
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
of the date, that's normal.

248
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,358
"Nice meeting you"
at the end of the date...

249
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,443
It could be a blowoff.

250
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,445
Maybe it was at the beginning.

251
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,699
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

252
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,284
Or maybe it was at the end.

253
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,536
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

254
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,204
Help.

255
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,623
Hi. This is torture.

256
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,751
How am I supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic...

257
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,378
...to say about cinnamon blends?

258
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,005
It's hard to focus on nutmeg...

259
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,632
...when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams...

260
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,093
...refuses to call me.

261
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,846
After my first date with Neil...

262
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,055
...I called him.

263
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,017
There are no rules anymore.

264
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,812
And, I mean, why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass?

265
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,403
- It's ringing.
- That's pretty standard.

266
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,447
- Hey, you've reached Conor.
- Yes! Voicemail.

267
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,450
- Leave a message, I'll get back to you.
- Notes.

268
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,452
"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.

269
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,579
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...

270
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:20,001
...and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"

271
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,130
What does that say? What's that say?

272
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,300
Because we're all equal, right?

273
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,344
More than equal.

274
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,347
More women are accepted
into law school now than men.

275
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,933
And, I mean, I don't know
if you saw that Dateline...

276
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,769
...but women practically
have penises now, right? So...

277
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,896
Call me.

278
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,523
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.

279
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,863
Don't worry, he's totally gonna call.

280
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,882
What?

281
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,386
How can there not be a dial tone?
How can there not be a dial tone?

282
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,972
No dial tone. Come here, dial tone.

283
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,390
Gigi, are you there?

284
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,891
Hello, Gigi?

285
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,518
- Mom, is that you?
- Yes.

286
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,355
- I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
- Wait, I need you to...

287
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,572
Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.

288
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,157
Hi, Janine, it's me.

289
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,450
Conor never called...

290
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:39,372
...so I'm on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.

291
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,416
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

292
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,504
All right, I'm interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance. Bye.

293
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,385
- What's up, girl?
- Hey.

294
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,721
- How are you?
- Good.

295
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,853
Knock, knock.

296
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,396
Hey.

297
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,773
So...

298
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,110
...here we are. Same shift again.

299
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,531
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

300
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,118
Well, I figured it was no coincidence.

301
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,124
I had...

302
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,418
...a good time the other night.

303
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,086
Yeah.

304
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,797
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patrón will get you.

305
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,595
So I was thinking...

306
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,848
...after work we could...

307
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,933
You know...

308
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:47,648
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

309
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,983
It was definitely fun.

310
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,028
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

311
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,239
So that's why I scheduled you.

312
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,283
To work.

313
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,077
So...

314
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,164
Are we good?

315
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,667
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

316
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,044
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

317
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,630
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

318
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,976
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or?

319
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,478
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

320
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,105
- Why?
- Hm?

321
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,148
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

322
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,943
I'll wait at the bar.

323
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,029
That's a great idea.

324
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,789
What can I get you?

325
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,374
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

326
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,210
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

327
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,963
I don't know if you'd call it "hot."

328
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,382
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time...

329
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,175
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

330
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,635
Yeah.

331
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,804
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

332
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,557
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

333
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,561
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

334
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,771
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting."

335
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,023
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

336
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,360
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

337
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,822
Okay.

338
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,782
I just was actually in the area...

339
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,244
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

340
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,707
Because I had to return his pen.

341
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,959
Had to return this pen. He left this.

342
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:35,089
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

343
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,717
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

344
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,719
Thanks.

345
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,558

346
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,979
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

347
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,690
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

348
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,609
Oh, really. Who is?

349
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,069
My dad.

350
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,285
Oh.

351
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,833
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

352
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,419
And I just...

353
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,007
I thought if I just ran into him...

354
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,969
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

355
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,763
Wait.

356
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,972
Wait, just...

357
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,225
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

358
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,978
One drink. Okay?

359
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,066
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

360
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,821
Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

361
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,282
Conor's never gonna call you.

362
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,035
Oh, really. How do you know?

363
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,746
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

364
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,373
He said it was nice meeting me.

365
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,084
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

366
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,586
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

367
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,923
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

368
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,717
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

369
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,302
Or maybe he lost my number...

370
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,515
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

371
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,685
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

372
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,274
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

373
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,025
She totally wrote him off.

374
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,860
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

375
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,696
She ran into him,
and it ended up that...

376
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,532
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

377
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,701
...by the way.
The rare exception.

378
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,745
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

379
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,707
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

380
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:37,253
If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

381
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,046
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,048
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

383
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:45,219
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

384
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,888
I do it early, I do it often.

385
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:52,518
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

386
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,187
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

387
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,231
No exceptions.

388
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,118
Thank you.

389
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,413
Given me a lot to think about.

390
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,755
- Morning, morning.
- Excuse me.

391
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,549
Everything okay?

393
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,842
Oh, I was up all night.

394
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,053
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

395
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,348
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

396
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,391
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

397
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,895
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

398
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,730
Okay.

399
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,231
So...

400
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,570
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

401
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,865
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

402
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,327
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

403
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,622
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

404
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,625
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

405
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,753
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

406
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,880
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

407
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,133
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

408
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,513
Okay.

409
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,474
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

410
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,478
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

411
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,189
And then... Oh, there was Don...

412
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,943
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

413
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,986
I was delusional about that relationship.

414
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,656
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

415
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,117
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

416
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,911
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

417
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,872
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

418
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,999
...and that girl ended up getting married.

419
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,253
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

420
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,053
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

421
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,930
So what you're saying is...

422
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,392
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

423
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,103
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

424
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,896
Yes.

425
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,941
But the rule are guys like Neil...

426
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,028
...who are with girls like me...

427
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,739
...for seven years and aren't married...

428
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,491
...they're never getting married.

429
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,326
- No.
- No.

430
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,036
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

431
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,040
- It's not what she meant in that...
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

432
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,376
I absolutely was not talking about you.

433
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,464
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

434
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,216
Just me specifically, you know?

435
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,348
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

436
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,768
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

437
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,064
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

438
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,233
And then he tells me that he's married.

439
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,819
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

440
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,031
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

441
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,407
But he's married.

442
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,994
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

443
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,412
What's wrong with me?

444
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,457
Okay.

445
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,418
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

446
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:09,173
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

447
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:14,053
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

448
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:18,557
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

449
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,102
That he had finally met the one.

450
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,021
So he divorced his wife...

451
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,441
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

452
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,944
...and they're insanely happy.

453
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,696
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

454
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,949
...but you already married someone else?

455
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,284
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

456
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,040
You're right. Okay.

457
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,875
I'm gonna call him.

458
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,211
Okay.

459
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,062
- Hello?
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.

460
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,648
Hey, Anna. What's up?

461
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,901
Nothing, I was just...
I was taking you up on your offer.

462
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,489
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

463
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:20,953
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

464
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,375
Look, I just...

465
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,170
I can't, Anna.

466
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,841
You seemed great. I just... I don't know.

467
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,010
I should probably go.

468
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,845
Take care, though. Bye.

469
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,854
- Hey.
- Hey.

470
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,439
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

471
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,025
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

472
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,860
I was just thinking about you.

473
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,862
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

474
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,864
Okay, what were the categories again?

475
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,578
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

476
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,913
But you can only be two things.

477
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,418
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

478
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,545
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

479
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,547
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

480
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,257
Go. What am I?

481
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,592
Wait, what was I again?

482
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,594
You're smart and cute.

483
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,805
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

484
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,515
And cute.

485
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,185
No, you can't...

486
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,479
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

487
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,397
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

488
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,568
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,
which obviously you are.

489
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,904
Especially sexy.

490
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,906
You're the best.

491
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,663
I better go.

492
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,042
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

493
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,461
What? It's been a while.

494
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,380
No, I can't.

495
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,965
I can't stay, I'm totally...

496
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,759
I'm totally, totally fried.

497
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,094
Is that okay?

498
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,720
Yeah.

499
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,851
I'll see you later.

500
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,436
Bye.

501
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,407
Hey.

502
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,534
That look straight to you?

503
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,911
Why are you hanging that?

504
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,957
Because you asked me to
about three weeks ago.

505
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,292
I'm getting around to it.

506
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,503
Why? You don't want it here?

507
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,380
No, I love it there. But just stop.

508
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,007
Why? Is it the painting?

509
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:44,138
You know, I know, it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here.

510
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,639
Right? I know.

511
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,267
It's gonna be depressing.
Should I take it down?

512
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,312
No, I want you
to stop doing anything nice.

513
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,483
This feels like a trick.

514
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,110
- No.
- No?

515
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,281
No, I just... I just need you
to stop being nice to me...

516
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,450
...unless you're gonna marry me after.

517
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,162
Is that funny?

518
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,788
Do you think that's funny?

519
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,333
No, I guess it's not funny.

520
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,419
See, you can't keep being nice to me...

521
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,298
...and I can't keep pretending
that this is something that it's not.

522
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,760
We've been together
for over seven years.

523
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,470
You know me, you know who I am.

524
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,473
You either wanna marry me
or you don't.

525
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,352
Or there's the possibility...

526
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,856
...that I mean it when I say
I don't believe in marriage...

527
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,692
Bullshit.

528
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,195
Come on, it's bullshit for every woman...

529
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,948
...that has been told by some man
that he doesn't believe in marriage...

530
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:50,579
...and then six months later he's married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

531
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,664
It's just... It's bullshit.

532
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,291
Where is this coming from?

533
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,503
From the place I've been hiding
from you for about five years.

534
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,712
Okay.

535
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,465
Five years, because I haven't wanted
to seem demanding.

536
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,220
And I haven't wanted
to seem clingy or psycho.

537
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,555
Or whatever.

538
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,849
So I haven't asked you.

539
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,894
But I...

540
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,815
I have to.

541
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,109
I mean...

542
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,573
...are you ever gonna marry me?

543
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,261
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

544
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,239
I used to think that I had
never been dumped.

545
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,408
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.

546
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,620
Then we realized we've both been dumped
by every man we've ever been with.

547
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,414
- Every one.
- Yeah.

548
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,125
- But they do it so skillfully.
- Mm-hm.

549
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,628
They just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea.

550
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,006
Yeah. You're sitting back

551
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:28,051
"Oh, yeah. This my idea.
But wait a second, why am I alone?"

552
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,721
"Why am I unhappy?
Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

553
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,307
- They Jedi mind-trick you.
- Yes, they do.

554
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,892
- So they do a soft pass.
- Yeah.

555
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,144
They got little lines they like to tell you.

556
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,146
Like, "I don't wanna stand in your way."

557
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,733
Or, "You're perfect,
it's just I have to work on myself."

558
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,985
Right. "I'm just thinking
of your happiness."

559
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,738
"Oh, I don't deserve you."
That's my favorite one.

560
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,323
You know the other one I like?

561
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,950
"I am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you."

562
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,911
- Well, that could have been you.
- Yeah.

563
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,787
That's what I was leaning towards.

564
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,915
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

565
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,084
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream...

566
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,003
...because you have been dumped.

567
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,589
Hey Anna, it's Ben.

568
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,675
Listen, I know it's been a while
since you called.

569
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,929
It's just... It took me by surprise.

570
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,514
But I did offer to help you
with your career...

571
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,767
...and I don't see why
I can't do that, right?

572
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,518
So why don't you give me a call...

573
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,229
...and maybe you can
come by the office or something.

574
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,899
Okay? All right, take care. Bye.

575
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,192
Hey, you.

576
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,402
Oh, shit.

577
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,530
- What?
- You scared me.

578
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,532
- You okay?
- Yeah.

579
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,534
Everything's fine.

580
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,078
Are you smoking again?

581
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,330
No, sweetie, I'm not smoking.

582
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,539
Why?

583
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,208
You get jumpy when you smoke.

584
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm not smoking, I promise.

585
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,212
No, I was just sitting here...

586
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,049
...trying to picture what this room's
gonna look like when it's finished.

587
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,467
- I like that game.
- You do?

588
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,052
Yeah.

589
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,681
What color did you picture?

590
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,808
That's where I got stuck.

591
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,393
Yeah.

592
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,479
I was thinking...

593
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,774
...maybe yellow.

594
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,361
- Yellow? Okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.

595
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,365
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. So it could be whatever.

596
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,035
It could be an office,
it could be a guest room...

597
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,913
...a gym, a baby's room...

598
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,628
Wait, did you mean "neutral,"
or "gender-neutral"?

599
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,382
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

600
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,012
I know we said
we'd wait to talk about it.

601
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,930
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

602
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:43,520
But I think that we're almost ready
to start talking about it.

603
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,456
So that's the last time
I do anything pro bono.

604
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,754
Well, ladies, I guess
I have to get back to the office.

605
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,591
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?

606
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,301
I met you.

607
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,139
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?

608
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,142
- Of course.
- Oh, great.

609
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,479
Here is my info.

610
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,565
- Nice to meet you, Janine.
- Nice to meet you.

611
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,984
Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

612
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,654
Oh, wait.

613
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,407
So...

614
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,242
...how are we doing this?

615
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,412
Are you hearing from me
or am I getting a call?

616
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,622
What?

617
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,791
You said you'd love to call me...

618
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,835
...but then you said,
"Look forward to hearing from you," and...

619
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,921
You see how that's kind of confusing?

620
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,965
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

621
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,469
You did it again. Very vague.

622
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,305
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me...

623
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,058
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.

624
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,102
Goodbye, Gigi.

625
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,865
- He was cute.
- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.

626
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,869
What are you doing?

627
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,204
I'm not calling him.

628
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,706
If he wants to see me, he'll call.

629
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,166
Wow.

630
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,378
That guy Alex really
made an impression on you.

631
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,712
Was he hot?

632
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,423
No. He was just...

633
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,800
...right.

634
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,803
Morning.

635
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,555
Morning, Ryan.

636
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,599
A surprise mocha venti
just because you're so awesome.

637
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,227
- Love you.
- Love you.

638
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,479
Good morning.

639
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,908
Okay.

640
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
So?

641
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,707
Oh, hi.

642
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,506
- He asked me out.
- Oh, my God. He called?

643
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,218
- Well...
- He e-mailed?

644
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,887
- No.
- What?

645
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,097
Left his calling card
with your lady-in-waiting?

646
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,060
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.

647
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:33,607
- Oh.
- Oh, girl, I don't know about that.

648
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,402
My trampy little sister says
MySpace is the new booty call.

649
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,780
Well, what am I supposed to do?

650
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,616
I mean, things have changed.

651
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,118
People don't meet each other
organically anymore.

652
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,247
If I would like to make myself seem
more attractive to the opposite sex...

653
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,459
...I don't go and get a new haircut,
I update my profile.

654
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,544
That's just the way it is, you know?

655
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,130
Yeah, she's right.

656
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,549
Back, back, back, back.

657
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,636
Ad sales, this is Mary.

658
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,973
Hi, Mary, this is Conor,
Anna's friend, or whatever.

659
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,141
Hi.

660
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,061
So, what'd you think?

661
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,563
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.

662
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,981
Oh, you have to trust me.

663
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,734
It's a burgeoning market,
you're gonna make a fortune.

664
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,029
I know. Did you have to put me
with the massage ads?

665
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,783
Well, it was either that or the page
with the personals, so...

666
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,826
This page gets a lot of action.

667
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,828
Yeah, I guess you're right.

668
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,664
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?

669
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,457
Yeah.

670
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,002
Okay.

671
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,464
All right, Mary,
I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

672
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,049
Bye.

673
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,928
What I'm trying to show you is
that there's a difference.

674
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,888
There is a difference.

675
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,892
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda
to sew these dresses in two weeks?

676
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,310
She wanted to do it.

677
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,855
Really? She told me she felt like
an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

678
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,774
- Is that not right?
- No, she didn't.

679
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,025
No?

680
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:03,446
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?

681
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,951
Because I am not having my wedding
during a gross Baltimore winter...

682
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,995
...and I am not waiting till spring.

683
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,163
You are so pregnant.

684
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,873
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.

685
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,001
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

686
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,378
- Chug a beer then.
- No, I'm not chugging a beer.

687
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,546
Chug a beer.

688
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,464
We're in love, you assholes.

689
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,218
That's what people do
when they're in love, they get married.

690
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,641
But you know what?
Not everybody gets married, you know?

691
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,312
There are many people
who never get married.

692
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,106
Well, thanks
for the inspirational pep talk.

693
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,360
What she meant to say was that it's fine
that you broke up with Neil.

694
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,570
Right.

695
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,489
Tons of people make the choice
to be alone. They're happy.

696
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,075
Look at Al Pacino.

697
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,537
Never been married, happy as a clam.

698
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,333
Would that...? Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

699
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,585
No, Bethie, we just...
We want you to be happy.

700
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,088
Well, then you should have
rethought the coral.

701
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,132
Oh, her face.

702
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,759
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.

703
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,927
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

704
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,014
I know, you're sensitive.
Trust me, I get it.

705
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,768
Hey, why don't you have dinner
with me and Steven and the kids...

706
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,478
...then you can just stay over...?

707
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,022
Why'd she wanna hang out
with you and your husband?

708
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,774
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

709
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,859
If being in this wedding is too painful...

710
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,654
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it.
Relax, relax.

711
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,449
That's enough, okay?
Seriously, you guys, I'm f...

712
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,787
I've gone through breakups before.
If you remember, I handle them quite well.

713
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:38,291
You've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

714
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,043
I can do it again.

715
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,420
I want you to stop worrying about me.

716
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,464
I'm fine.

717
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,467
I know it's here somewhere.

718
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:52,680
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.

719
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,977
Well, that's okay.
You can just call me when you find it.

720
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,817
I swear I didn't lure you here
under false pretenses.

721
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,693
I know.

722
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,237
A girl can dream, though.

723
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,325
You're just too good a guy.

724
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,292
Why are you married again?

725
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,380
Seriously, why?

726
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,258
No, I really think
that it would be good for me to know...

727
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,302
...why you cannot live
without this other woman.

728
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,851
Well, we'd been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum.

729
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,646
She said, "Either we get married
or we break up."

730
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,189
So we got married.

731
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,317
Wow. You caved.

732
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,696
It's complicated.

733
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,573
Really?

734
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,162
What? You're a dick if you date a girl
for too long and don't marry her.

735
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,832
You marry her and you're an asshole
for marrying before you're ready.

736
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,419
I mean, shit, I don't know.

737
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,476
You're really hot.

738
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,188
And I am obviously attracted to you.

739
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,775
So I think the best I can do is...

740
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,530
...eventually find this piece of paper
and call you...

741
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,826
...and hope to just help you out in
your career in some small way.

742
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,880
Hi.

743
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,174
Hi. What's going on?

744
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,768
Javier.

745
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,106
Javier, I thought we talked
about tarping the furniture.

746
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,358
City Supper.

747
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,402
Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?

748
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,028
Hold on.

749
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,989
- Alex?
- Yo.

750
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,116
- Drinks are good?
- Yeah, one more.

751
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,285
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Gigi.

752
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,287
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.

753
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,081
- Huh?
- I, um...

754
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,749
...had the dentist pen.

755
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,085
Right. Hey. How you doing?

756
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,046
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.

757
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,425
You had some really good insights
and I wanted to ask you a question.

758
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,094
Okay, look, now I need
to be harsh with you.

759
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,805
Conor's never gonna be
interested in you, Geege.

760
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,017
No, I know. This is about Jarrad.

761
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,268
Jarrad.

762
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,354
So we meet at happy hour
and he's completely charming...

763
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,442
Hey, give me two seconds, okay?
Two seconds, hold on.

764
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,372
"The only thing happy
about this hour is you."

765
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,376
He might have used
some derivative of that.

766
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:57,216
So he says he's going to call, but then
he gives me his card and he says...

767
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,885
Oh, he's not interested.

768
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,888
- You don't even know if he's called.
- Oh, did he?

769
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,514
No.

770
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,060
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.

771
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:11,522
Gigi, he is not interested.

772
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,108
Alex, this is jacked.

773
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,070
The hostess is giving me shit
for not wearing a black shirt.

774
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,613
- It's not black.
- Look at it.

775
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,741
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

776
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,576
This shit is black.

777
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,708
If a guy gives you his phone number
instead of taking yours, he's not interested.

778
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,460
He took mine first. Then he gave...

779
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,089
And also, if a guy wants to see you,
believe me, he will see you.

780
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,095
I once called 55 Lauren Bells
until I got the right one.

781
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,930
That's cute.

782
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,181
What happened?

783
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,810
Oh, yeah, as it turns out,
her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

784
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,606
Is it your sensitivity that makes you
so popular with women?

785
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,275
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

786
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,444
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

787
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,239
- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know. Thank you.

788
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,824
Sure.

789
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,785
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.

790
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,745
Okay, bye.

791
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,376
Hey, buddy, you home?

792
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,795
Yeah. Come on in.

793
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,883
Hey, you want a beer?

794
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,679
Or an apple martini?

795
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,180
Oh, that's funny.

796
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,892
Have you told your parents?

797
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,603
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.

798
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,564
By pretending to be gay?

799
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,442
No, by being more gay-friendly.

800
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,652
Or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent."

801
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,446
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

802
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,031
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.

803
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,785
I don't know. Dressing like that,
seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

804
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,412
...I think you can pull it off.

805
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,789
It's not that she won't sleep with me,
douche bag.

806
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,417
I have slept with her.
It's just she, you know...

807
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,462
Won't sleep with you anymore.

808
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,839
Pretty much, yeah.

809
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,008
What do you think?

810
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,509
I think you got a problem...

811
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,764
...because you're gonna have to beat them
away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.

812
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,182
Holy shit.

813
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,893
Observe your breath.

814
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,480
Inhale, belly rise.

815
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,777
And exhale, belly fall.

816
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,781
Bring your hands together
in front of your chest.

817
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,117
Bow your head in gratitude.

818
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,208
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

819
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,460
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.

820
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,882
Great class.

821
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,813
We ran into each other.

822
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,148
You came to my class.

823
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,651
I had no idea this was your class.

824
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,655
You called to ask me
if this was my class.

825
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,198
No, you never called back.

826
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,284
Because you told me not to call you
if it was my class. It was.

827
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,745
- No. We just ran into each other.
- Okay.

828
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:17,583
We're just two innocent folks who happen
to be working out near each other.

829
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,710
Exactly.

830
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,047
Do you want a swim?

831
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,258
Sure.

832
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,683
You know, I was just thinking...

833
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,727
...why can't we be friends?

834
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,523
I mean, am I not allowed
to have friends anymore?

835
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,777
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends
with people that are hot?

836
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,655
I mean, what kind of
reverse prejudice is that?

837
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,031
I hear you.

838
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,700
I mean...

839
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,287
...am I not supposed to be friends
with a guy just because he's married?

840
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,454
Right.

841
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,540
Or has an insane smile?

842
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,084
Or an ass that makes me
wanna dry hump?

843
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,718
- Did you just say "dry hump"?
- Yeah.

844
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,723
Think I just fell in love.

845
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,106
So we're friends.

846
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,233
Yeah.

847
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,937
You wanna come in?

848
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,525
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.

849
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,946
That's okay. You can just watch.

850
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,493
You know, you may be
the best friend I've ever had.

851
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,256
- Hi.
- Hey.

852
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,974
- Take a shower. Hey.
- What? Hi.

853
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,142
- Honey?
- Yeah.

854
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,813
You smell weird.

855
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,065
- I smell weird?
- Yeah, different.

856
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,485
- Different how?
- I don't know.

857
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,738
Sort of an odd thing to say.

858
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,242
You know, maybe it was the ashtray
and cigarettes I found.

859
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,327
In the back yard.

860
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:02,498
What part of
"My dad died of lung cancer"...

861
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,668
...is so hard for you
to wrap your brain around?

862
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,877
What?

863
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,548
Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?

864
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,846
Are you serious?

865
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:25,563
We have, like, 8000 undocumented
workers here daily.

866
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:30,401
Okay, and you find an ashtray
with cigarettes in it and you think...

867
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,612
You automatically assume
that they're mine.

868
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,364
Oh, yeah.

869
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,616
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

870
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,373
I think...

871
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,376
...you are really freaking out.

872
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,547
This whole renovation thing's getting
to you because nothing's happening.

873
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,180
Just say no.

874
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,598
Get it out.

875
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,932
Gonna take a shower.

876
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,810
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

877
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,650
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

878
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,662
Who'd have thought that a random girl
from yoga...

879
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,750
...would fix me up with such a good kisser?
- Back at you, sister.

880
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,963
I can't wait to kiss you again.

881
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,174
But we're kissing right now.

882
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,509
I know, next time.

883
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,386
The second-date kiss
is way more intimate.

884
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,556
Well, listen...

885
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,227
...I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

886
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,607
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.

887
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,234
Okay.

888
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,628
Oh, yeah.

889
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,879
Yeah?

890
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,799
Hey, sorry to bug you again.
Quick question.

891
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,260
Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.

892
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,387
What's going on?

893
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,557
Okay, I'm making out with this guy...
PG stuff.

894
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:28,185
And he mentions that he's going
out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.

895
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,478
Run.

896
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,231
But maybe he is going out of town.

897
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,025
Where? Where's he going
that he's gonna be out of touch?

898
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,572
Where are you going
out of town to again?

899
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,991
Um... Uh... Pittsburgh.

900
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,702
Pittsburgh.

901
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,995
Run.

902
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,582
So, what, now I'm just supposed to run
from every guy who doesn't like me?

903
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,876
Yeah.

904
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,379
There's not gonna be anybody left.

905
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,674
I don't know why I'm saying this...

906
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,677
...but I think I know a nice guy
who might actually like you.

907
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,554
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

908
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,806
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.

909
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,517
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.

910
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,730
So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom
right now.

911
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,939
What do I do?

912
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,235
Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
But I'd take my time in there.

913
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,446
I'd let him sweat.

914
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,907
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

915
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,730
Yeah, the boat looks great.

916
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,440
You look like shit.

917
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,484
But your boat looks great.

918
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,488
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.

919
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,782
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

920
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,201
A lot of time to work on the place.

921
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,203
You should try working on a shower.

922
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,996
Yeah.

923
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,333
Hey, what can I tell you?

924
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,462
Standing on principle, man. It's all I got.

925
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,093
Cigarette?

926
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,469
No, I'm good.

927
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,972
That's right, you quit.

928
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,599
Good for you.

929
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,859
So did Janine send you out here
to check up on me?

930
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,279
Yeah, pretty much.

931
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,322
What are you gonna tell her?

932
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,326
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look
out here on the ocean.

933
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,663
Break.

934
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,623
Any word from Beth?

935
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,545
She's so busy organizing
her sister's funeral, I think she must be...

936
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,838
Sister's what?

937
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,007
Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.

938
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,801
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said "funeral."

939
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,553
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

940
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,346
Shit, did I really?

941
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,724
That's so weird.

942
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,393
I don't understand
why people wanna get married.

943
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,521
They don't.

944
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,231
- They don't?
- No.

945
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,735
No, no guy actually wants to get married.

946
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,113
And if they do,
all they're really thinking about?

947
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,490
All the women
they're gonna miss out on.

948
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,868
I don't wanna be with anybody else,
just Beth.

949
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,580
I don't know, man, I...

950
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,415
Why'd you get married?

951
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,586
I love Janine.

952
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,379
You're a happily married guy.

953
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,840
Yeah.

954
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,051
Yeah, I'd say so.

955
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,726
Now, I know I don't need
to tell any of you...

956
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,563
...that my cousin Paige is hot.

957
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,651
In high school, if I told the popular guys
that Paige was my cousin...

958
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,904
...it'd keep me
from getting my ass kicked...

959
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,782
...because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her.

960
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:16,038
And when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to Devon...

961
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,916
...there will be hearts breaking
all over the world.

962
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,959
- Hear, hear.
- That's sweet.

963
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:27,758
But, you know, keep in mind
that her sister Beth is still on the market.

964
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,637
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...

965
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,556
...but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank.

966
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,475
But don't stay on the lot too long...

967
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,561
...or next year's models are gonna
slip in there and steal all...

968
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,730
Okay, that's enough of the speeches.

969
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,940
Okay.

970
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,983
So enjoy the crab.

971
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:50,906
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,
it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

972
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,828
Bethie.

973
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,040
Your cousin Jay
has always been a jackass.

974
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,250
I know.

975
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,002
And somehow even he's married.

976
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh, honey, look.

977
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,468
Back when everyone
was just going to camp at the Y...

978
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,637
...you borrowed my New York Times...

979
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,181
...found some arts camp
in the Berkshires...

980
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,518
...wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own.

981
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,354
You never did things like everyone else.

982
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,814
Why not?

983
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,524
Because that's you.

984
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,861
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

985
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,947
You're not supposed to say that.

986
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,949
I don't give a shit.

987
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

988
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,829
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

989
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,748
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

990
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,792
It's true, though.

991
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,144
Hey.

992
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,231
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

993
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,820
Come on.

994
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,242
Sorry I'm late.

995
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,744
No, it's okay.

996
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,829
I like a little time before a blind date.

997
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,708
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

998
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,084
Gigi, he's not coming.

999
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,463
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1000
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,423
Hey.

1001
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,258
How could he already not like me?

1002
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,678
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1003
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,263
Hi. Are you good?

1004
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,516
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

1005
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:46,730
Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1006
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,984
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1007
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,611
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.

1008
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,279
Oh, God, no.

1009
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,657
How do you know?

1010
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,368
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1011
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,870
She's interested, he's clearly not.

1012
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,040
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

1013
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,876
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

1014
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,629
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

1015
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,048
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here."

1016
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,633
And look, how fortuitous.

1017
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,469
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

1018
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,888
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

1019
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,975
Man, you have a gift.

1020
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,269
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

1021
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:29,481
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1022
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,775
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1023
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,778
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

1024
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,530
- Really?
- Bullshit.

1025
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,031
Enlighten me.

1026
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,866
Guys invented the spark...

1027
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,870
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

1028
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:47,791
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

1029
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,543
...was actually just a spark.

1030
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,921
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

1031
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,300
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

1032
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,509
I don't.

1033
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,013
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

1034
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,056
...because secretly you love the drama...

1035
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,684
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

1036
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,020
Maybe.

1037
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,190
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

1038
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,526
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

1039
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,904
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

1040
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,574
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

1041
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,578
Okay. Yeah.

1042
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,414
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

1043
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,417
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

1044
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,795
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

1045
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,006
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

1046
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,009
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

1047
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,804
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

1048
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,806
I don't know, I like you.

1049
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,142
You do?

1050
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,814
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1051
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,027
I just mean... I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1052
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,988
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

1053
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,199
Again with the sensitivity.

1054
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,409
To sensitivity.

1055
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,669
It looks good.

1056
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,253
Yeah.

1057
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,963
Yeah.

1058
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,592
- He does good work.
- Yeah, he does.

1059
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,388
Very nice.

1060
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,102
Very nice.

1061
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,524
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1062
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,652
Javier...

1063
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,114
...if I asked you an honest question...

1064
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,700
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

1065
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,828
- I think so.
- Good, good.

1066
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:52,290
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

1067
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,793
Javier?

1068
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,753
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1069
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,464
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

1070
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,092
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1071
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,593
Javier...

1072
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,138
...have you guys been smoking...

1073
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,056
...or not?

1074
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:13,478
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

1075
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,148
Are you sure your guys haven't been...

1076
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,650
...sneaking around here?

1077
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,901
And smoking?

1078
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,071
And lying to me?

1079
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,489
And smoking?

1080
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,741
I'm pretty sure.

1081
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,326
I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

1082
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,871
Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

1083
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:34,499
To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

1084
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,418
That's a lot of prepositions.

1085
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:41,256
I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

1086
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,760
I mean, we made promises to each other.

1087
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,096
I mean, we have a contract.

1088
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,266
That's like making promises. Isn't it?

1089
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,187
Maybe I should get back to work.

1090
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,691
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

1091
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,194
That's great, yeah.

1092
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,030
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1093
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,533
We're good. Right? You and me.

1094
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,703
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.
- Oh, good.

1095
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,705
Okay, that's great.

1096
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,874
Yeah, he did great work.

1097
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,714
Hey.

1098
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,843
Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming. I'm Conor.

1099
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,554
Sign in when you get a second.
Make yourselves at home.

1100
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,891
We got some cookies over here,
some cold beverages. Help yourself.

1101
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,644
Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli
of real estate.

1102
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,564
- I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
- I know, she's so great.

1103
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:44,236
Well, I gotta go,
so I guess I'll see you later.

1104
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,737
What, you got a class, or?

1105
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,241
Yeah. No. No, just something.

1106
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,868
- Stuff I gotta do.
- Okay. Well...

1107
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,996
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

1108
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,415
Okay. Bye.

1109
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,501
- See you later.
- All right. Call me.

1110
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:04,923
What?

1111
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,718
She's holding out on you, isn't she?

1112
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,514
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1113
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,766
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1114
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,353
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.

1115
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,899
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

1116
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,484
No, I'm cool.

1117
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,320
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

1118
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,364
We used to sleep together all the time.

1119
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,452
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

1120
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,123
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

1121
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,126
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

1122
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,462
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

1123
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,132
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

1124
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,260
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

1125
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,388
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

1126
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,308
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

1127
01:04:56,475 --> 01:05:00,228
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you."

1128
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,815
One, two, three.

1129
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,318
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

1130
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,154
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you."

1131
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,822
One, two...

1132
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,658
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

1133
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,953
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

1134
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,167
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

1135
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,629
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

1136
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,842
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

1137
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,428
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

1138
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,808
If a girl's into you,
she's sleeping with you.

1139
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,437
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

1140
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,689
...she's not sleeping with you?

1141
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,192
She doesn't like you.

1142
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,444
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1143
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,531
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1144
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:57,535
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

1145
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,039
A girl will never sleep with you...

1146
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,292
...if she calls you "cuddly"
or "dependable."

1147
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,628
If she pops a zit in front of you...

1148
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:10,340
...if her name is Amber or Christine...

1149
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,717
...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

1150
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:16,471
...or she takes home leftovers
on dates one, two, or three.

1151
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,099
I know it's not scientific...

1152
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,559
...but I'm just saying,
you were warned.

1153
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:44,749
Wait, stop.

1154
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,087
What?

1155
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,506
Shit.

1156
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,341
What?

1157
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,387
I am so into you.

1158
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,432
Seriously, I've never felt like this before.

1159
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,269
I have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you.

1160
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,938
Like, all the time.

1161
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,860
Why stop?

1162
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,032
Because I don't do stuff like this.

1163
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,075
Stuff like what?

1164
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,871
Like sleep with women
that aren't my wife.

1165
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,459
First of all, I am not "women,"
I'm just one.

1166
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,461
And second of all?

1167
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,797
Oh, I didn't have a second of all.

1168
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,759
I was hoping "second of all"
would make me feel better.

1169
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,432
Second of all...

1170
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,478
...I can't stop thinking about you either.

1171
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,327
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.

1172
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,579
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

1173
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,831
I don't know. I mean, look at Becca.

1174
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,625
You know, my sister's friend.

1175
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,502
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

1176
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:14,005
...and by the end of the meal,
they both knew they had found the one.

1177
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,635
You're right. You're totally right.
I mean, it could happen, right?

1178
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,970
Not for me.

1179
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,847
What about texter?

1180
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,683
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

1181
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,854
I mean, this guy could've had surgery,
leaving him without a voice box...

1182
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,481
...breathing through a stoma...

1183
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:35,110
...and I would never know because
I've never actually heard his voice.

1184
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,195
Well, I doubt he has a stoma.

1185
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,448
That's not the point. I can't text.

1186
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,784
You know, I'm not charming via text.

1187
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,577
Maybe you should just stop texting.

1188
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:49,707
But it's not just texting, it's e-mail.
It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

1189
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,000
That's regular mail.

1190
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,877
Whatever. None of it's working.

1191
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:58,049
I had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work, so I called him at home.

1192
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:02,679
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

1193
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:07,767
Then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control.

1194
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:13,231
And I miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine.

1195
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,151
And that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape...

1196
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,988
...and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didn't.

1197
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,366
And now you have to go around
checking all these different portals...

1198
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,578
...just to get rejected
by seven different technologies.

1199
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,580
It's exhausting.

1200
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,249
What about that MySpace guy?

1201
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,960
- Jude. I like him.
- Good.

1202
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,046
Yeah, I felt like we connected.

1203
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,506
Great.

1204
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:41,551
What if she wants you to kiss her?

1205
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,430
Well, then I guess
I'm just gonna have to kiss her.

1206
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,348
"Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...

1207
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,560
...who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips."

1208
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,938
This babe has plenty of battle scars.

1209
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:55,440
Hello?

1210
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,109
Oh, hey, you're home.

1211
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,612
Where am I supposed to be?

1212
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,698
Out, maybe? It's Saturday night.

1213
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:07,619
You won't let me go out with guys
who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

1214
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,038
Right. Listen, I was just gonna
leave a message.

1215
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,707
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.

1216
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:17,378
Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
Might be kind of awkward.

1217
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:21,466
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C.
But there'll be a lot of single guys.

1218
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,219
So there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward.

1219
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,888
Don't worry, I'll be there.
I'll talk you through it.

1220
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,307
Okay, gotta go.

1221
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,560
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates.
Maybe I'll see you there.

1222
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,146
You're busy. I shouldn't have called.
You called me.

1223
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,398
- Yup, good.
- Bye.

1224
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,988
How...? How do you work on it?

1225
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,242
Pretend I'm a girl, okay?

1226
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,953
I mean...

1227
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:51,663
...pretend I'm her.

1228
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,207
Amanda.

1229
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,711
He's into me.

1230
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:01,047
Awesome. I knew it.

1231
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,174
- Who's this now?
- Alex.

1232
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,594
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

1233
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,931
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.

1234
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,141
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson
was Watts.

1235
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,519
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?

1236
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:16,688
I'm Eric Stoltz.

1237
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,359
Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones.

1238
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,361
Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

1239
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:26,197
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

1240
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:30,952
I guess. At first. Now men in general,
but that's not the point.

1241
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,996
The point is he's into me.

1242
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,624
I knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you.

1243
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,378
I know. It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.

1244
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:44,007
Signs. Love signs. You gotta
tell me about the signs. I love signs.

1245
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:48,094
First they were small. At first when I
called, he said, "Good to hear from you."

1246
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,721
- Totally good sign.
- Right?

1247
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,515
And then the next time I called
he was with a woman...

1248
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,393
...but he took the call
and we talked for a while.

1249
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,603
- You know it was a woman?
- Called her "babe."

1250
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:01,733
Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he's...

1251
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,234
And it gets more obvious.

1252
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:07,405
I mean, please. There was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with.

1253
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,032
The fix-up was him.

1254
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,325
No.

1255
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:14,412
Yes. He shows up
without this fictitious Bill character.

1256
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,331
The two of us basically have a date.

1257
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:21,419
And then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place.

1258
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,005
He so likes you.

1259
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,759
I'm so happy for you.

1260
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,845
Let's look up places
for your destination wedding.

1261
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,934
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

1262
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,270
I have really always wanted to go there.

1263
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,025
Oh, he's cute.

1264
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,611
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

1265
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:51,741
Oh. "All I have is my guitar, these chords,
and the truth."

1266
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,117
Bon Jovi.

1267
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,661
- That's hot.
- Yeah. I like him.

1268
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:59,916
I mean, he probably hasn't called yet
because we just had coffee last night.

1269
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,251
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

1270
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:05,630
I mean, we actually video
iChatted while holding coffee.

1271
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,465
But that's the same thing, right?

1272
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,801
- Right, right.
- Just call your voicemail.

1273
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:13,805
Yeah, but he had a gig last night
and he probably didn't get home till late.

1274
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,973
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.

1275
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,892
- Just call.
- Oh, honey, no, on speaker.

1276
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,812
I don't think so.
I'm sure he hasn't called.

1277
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,480
- Just call him.
- Okay.

1278
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,697
- You have two new messages.
- Oh.

1279
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,493
Mary

1280
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,539
Whoa, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

1281
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,042
Oh, my Mary

1282
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,253
I just got hard.

1283
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,921
Hey, Mary, it's Jude.

1284
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:51,008
I was just calling to tell you again
how special it was to meet you.

1285
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:54,762
So call me back. Bye-bye.

1286
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:57,932
Amazing.

1287
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,560
- This is good, this is good.
- This is...

1288
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:01,978
See, he called.

1289
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,855
Jenny

1290
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:07,942
Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny

1291
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,320
Hey, Jenny, it's Jude.
I was just calling to...

1292
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:15,533
Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?

1293
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,703
All messages erased.

1294
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,215
That one.

1295
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,467
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1296
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,053
No. It's a laminate.

1297
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,515
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.

1298
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:43,186
It looks exactly like it. But it is
like one one-hundredth of the cost.

1299
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:44,562
Oh.

1300
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,899
I still wanna go with the real wood.

1301
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,985
What? You can't even tell the difference.

1302
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,904
It's not the point.

1303
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,239
Well, what is the point?

1304
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,116
I just...

1305
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,286
I don't like the way
it's pretending to be wood.

1306
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,080
If you're not wood,
don't try and look like wood.

1307
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,917
I don't think that it's pretending.

1308
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,753
This is a lie, Ben.

1309
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,590
Just be up front
and tell people what you really are.

1310
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,511
Okay, you're right. You're right.

1311
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,304
I'm sorry.

1312
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,769
It's okay. Maybe we should just go
look at the grills and we'll come back.

1313
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,729
Okay.

1314
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,236
I slept with someone.

1315
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,955
- I said...
- I heard you.

1316
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,504
You tell me this in Home Depot
because you know I hate a public scene.

1317
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,382
No, that is not why I'm telling...

1318
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,427
I knew it.

1319
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,471
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.

1320
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,434
It is you that's been smoking too,
isn't it?

1321
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:08,479
Wha...? Wait, what does that
even matter?

1322
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,356
Have you...?!

1323
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,276
Have you been smoking?

1324
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,777
No. No, I haven't.

1325
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,327
I talked to Neil. I told him.

1326
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,329
He said I could stay
at his boat for a while.

1327
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:26,789
Excuse me?

1328
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,001
Now you're moving out?

1329
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:32,086
- You're, like, leaving me?
- No.

1330
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,464
No, I just assumed
that you wouldn't want me to...

1331
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:40,177
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

1332
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:44,348
Don't you wanna find some way...

1333
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,143
...for us to work through this?

1334
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:51,522
I assumed that when I told you,
you would want me...

1335
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,482
...out.

1336
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,945
Is that what you want?

1337
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,501
No.

1338
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:18,174
Okay.

1339
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,741
You're doing a great job.

1340
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,584
Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget. Hi!

1341
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,215
Oh, my goodness.

1342
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:04,929
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

1343
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:18,526
Seriously, Devon, I really did feel
just a moment, a splash, of hesitation.

1344
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,028
No, there wasn't.
There wasn't any hesitation at all.

1345
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,280
You just did it again. That was a pause.

1346
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,700
I did not pause.

1347
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,999
You must be Beth.

1348
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,504
Yeah. Yeah.

1349
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,965
Heard a lot about you from Paige.

1350
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,428
Actually been lobbying
to sit next to her single sister for weeks.

1351
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,888
Oh, yeah?

1352
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,309
"Dan."

1353
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,311
Sort of.

1354
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:58,524
- Sort of?
- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan.

1355
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,401
- A what?
- A Wiccan.

1356
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,153
Wiccan?

1357
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,904
- Male witch.
- Right. Oh.

1358
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,657
So I also have a magical name.

1359
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,326
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.

1360
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,830
But I didn't know if that would fit
on the card. Love that.

1361
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,666
I'm guessing that I'm gonna
hear a whole lot about you.

1362
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,335
Nature-based
pre-Christian paganism, yeah.

1363
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,504
Yeah. That's fantastic.

1364
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,089
Well, where to begin?

1365
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,259
Well, first off, it's not just a bunch
of nude farming. Dad.

1366
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,511
Let's look at Stonehenge.

1367
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:28,971
Obviously not a coincidence.

1368
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,141
They didn't have the machinery
to move those rocks. They're huge.

1369
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,018
- Yeah, they're heavy.
- Of course.

1370
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:06,383
- I'm Nathan. And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.

1371
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,053
- Gigi. Hi.
- Hey.

1372
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,474
So how do you guys know Alex?

1373
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:18,395
We don't. Our friend Mary heard
about this from some guy named Conor.

1374
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,609
And how do you know Alex?

1375
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,112
I hope...

1376
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:30,950
I'm pretty sure that something's
about to happen between us.

1377
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,660
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1378
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,580
So are you here as, like, a guest,
or, like, his date?

1379
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:40,459
Oh, I hate that.
When you don't know if you're a date.

1380
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,921
You don't know if you should bring
a friend, or are you co-hosting...

1381
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:46,757
...or should you stay to the end
to have some alone time?

1382
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,426
He didn't say.
I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

1383
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,096
- I mean, there have been signs.
- Cool.

1384
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,623
So where's Neil?

1385
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:20,875
We broke up.

1386
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,294
- No way.
- Yeah.

1387
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,963
You guys were together,
what, like 10 years?

1388
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,923
Seven. But still, it's a long time.

1389
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,216
Yeah.

1390
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:32,678
It's too bad cousins can't marry,
because then we could maybe...

1391
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,805
Oh, Dominic.

1392
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,224
- Gross.
- No.

1393
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,978
Ken, are you okay? What happened?

1394
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,315
Oh, my God.

1395
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,775
- Ken, are you all right?
- Just clutched his chest.

1396
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,903
He was standing there
and all of a sudden...

1397
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:51,113
- Ken, just try to breathe.
- Call 911.

1398
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,406
Dad. Excuse me.

1399
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,075
Daddy, what is it? What happened?
What happened?

1400
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,161
- Guys, come here!
- What happened?

1401
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,787
Daddy, lay down, okay?

1402
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,289
- Did he fall?
- You'll be fine.

1403
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:03,334
You guys, did anybody
see what happened?

1404
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,003
- Over there. Just go get it.
- Okay.

1405
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,674
Hey, hey. I had no idea
it'd be such a madhouse.

1406
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,134
Hey. Great party.

1407
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,678
Thanks. Did any guys hit on you?
A lot of them here.

1408
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:17,473
You need me to evaluate
any level of interest?

1409
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,893
They were gay. Even I know
their level of interest was probably low.

1410
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,102
Hey, Skilo!

1411
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,481
It's too bad Bill couldn't make it.
I know you guys would hit it off.

1412
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,024
Okay, right. "Bill."

1413
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,193
Right.

1414
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:37,785
Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run,
but the food needs some refreshing.

1415
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:41,205
- Would you mind helping and refilling...?
- Like co-hosting?

1416
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:44,708
Okay, yeah.

1417
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:45,918
Sure.

1418
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:48,420
Just refilling the chips.
They're on the fridge.

1419
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:49,713
Thanks.

1420
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,387
- Hey, sweetie, get me a beer?
- I'll get you another.

1421
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:59,014
- Hi, guys.
- Nice.

1422
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:01,183
Hey, Linda.

1423
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:19,201
- Really great party.
- Oh, thanks.

1424
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,747
You know, when Alex said he wanted
to throw a party, I was like, "Let's do it!"

1425
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:26,709
- Thanks for having us.
- No problem, any time.

1426
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,919
Can I help you find something?

1427
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,171
Oh, no, it's okay. I got it.

1428
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,756
Thanks for mixing that up.

1429
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:34,675
What?

1430
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,512
Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.

1431
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,557
It could use a little more dill.

1432
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,434
I'm on it, though, don't worry.

1433
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,356
Come on, my boy. Take it home.

1434
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,358
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

1435
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,152
- Fifteen seconds.
- Let's go.

1436
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,612
- Oh, a pass.
- You work too hard.

1437
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,116
Well, I think I've rounded up
the last of the beer bottles.

1438
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:03,579
- Oh, what game are we playing?
- Oh, sorry, Nash.

1439
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,956
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1440
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,793
- Nash, you piece of shit. Come on.
- Maybe I should just...

1441
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,670
- It's past 3, so...
- Okay, swat it.

1442
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:13,297
Watch this. Ready?

1443
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,007
- And...
- Oh, no, no, no!

1444
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,385
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

1445
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,471
Oh, you are... You're sensational.

1446
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:21,722
- Yeah, I know.
- Jesus.

1447
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:23,974
I don't know why I bother.

1448
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,143
- Did you say it's past 3?
- Yeah.

1449
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,605
- Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game.
- All right.

1450
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,815
- Bye.
- Bye.

1451
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,883
Hey, thanks for staying
and helping me clean up.

1452
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,011
I really gotta go to bed, though.

1453
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,679
Is that an invitation?

1454
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:04,598
What?

1455
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,185
Oh, God, that was cheesy.

1456
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,105
Oh, I'm not good at this.

1457
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,689
What?

1458
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:22,991
Hey.

1459
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,577
Oh, yes. I knew it.

1460
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:28,831
The best relationships
grow out of friendships.

1461
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:31,041
Wait, wait, wait. Gigi.

1462
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,877
Wait, wait, wait.

1463
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,379
What?

1464
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,381
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1465
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:41,426
Well, I'd say if we're not
at relationship station-ship...

1466
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:43,053
...we're at least on the track.

1467
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,474
And why exactly would you think that?

1468
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,393
Because of the signs.

1469
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,353
Really, like what?

1470
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,731
Like, it was good to hear from me...

1471
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:58,277
...and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl...

1472
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:01,155
...and I felt something.

1473
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,615
Oh, man.

1474
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,075
What are you talking about?

1475
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:08,537
Gigi, what have I been saying
since I met you?

1476
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:12,374
If a guy wants to date you, he will make
it happen, okay? He will ask you out.

1477
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,750
Did I ask you out?

1478
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,086
No.

1479
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,797
Why would you do this?

1480
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,091
Oh, shit.

1481
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,927
Why do women do this?
Build up this stuff in their minds...

1482
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:27,973
...take each little thing a guy does,
and then twist it into something else?

1483
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,850
It's insane.

1484
01:26:40,236 --> 01:26:43,280
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1485
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:46,617
Excuse me?

1486
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,785
What is that supposed to mean?

1487
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,832
I may dissect each little thing...

1488
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,085
...and put myself out there too much...

1489
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:59,588
...but at least that means I still care.

1490
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:05,636
Oh, you think you've won
because women are expendable to you?

1491
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:10,140
You may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way...

1492
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:12,976
...but you don't fall in love
that way either.

1493
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:14,895
You have not won.

1494
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,231
You're alone, Alex.

1495
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,323
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

1496
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:30,994
...but I know I'm a lot closer
to finding someone than you are.

1497
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,171
Do you want anything else?

1498
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:44,841
Yeah, less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food.

1499
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:49,596
Well, that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1500
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,517
Well, maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links.

1501
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,812
People who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised...

1502
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,440
...to have animal fat that's been stuffed
into a synthetic casing.

1503
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,830
Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen, okay?

1504
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,833
And a little plate of cold cuts,
if there are any left.

1505
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:21,545
Hey, would you guys please just turn
that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

1506
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,714
You think he wants
to hang on to this vinyl?

1507
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:25,882
My collection could use a lot of these.

1508
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,385
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

1509
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,182
Well, we're totally out of toilet paper...

1510
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:38,979
...and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

1511
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:43,817
And our new brother would like to co-opt
Dad's property before he's even dead.

1512
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,112
Laura, also your husband would
really like another beer...

1513
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,407
...to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network.

1514
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,994
Are you okay?

1515
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,165
Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine.

1516
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,418
- Do you know who it is?
- No.

1517
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,588
Doesn't matter.

1518
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:07,424
So are you gonna leave him?

1519
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,595
Gigi, he's my husband.

1520
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,931
He's not some guy
who didn't call me back.

1521
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:17,017
He did admit it to me.

1522
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:20,896
He didn't wait to get caught,
which takes courage, you know?

1523
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,191
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

1524
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,609
I didn't mean it.

1525
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,236
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

1526
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,614
Oh, it's okay.

1527
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:35,952
It's my fault, you know.

1528
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:37,537
What?

1529
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:43,960
Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole...

1530
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:46,713
...mess. You know?

1531
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,633
I forced him into getting married.

1532
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:53,261
- You know, he wasn't ready.
- Janine, this isn't your fault.

1533
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:56,473
No, it is. It is, I've changed.

1534
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,975
I was...

1535
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:02,145
...fun, you know?

1536
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:04,356
I was fun when we first met.

1537
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,649
You're still fun.

1538
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,826
We don't have sex anymore.

1539
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,417
Lots of couples go through lulls.

1540
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,085
No, I mean...

1541
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,382
...we never have sex.

1542
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:41,351
I mean, realistically,
what do I expect him to do, you know?

1543
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,812
I don't think that's really...

1544
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:48,191
God, this tile is too small.

1545
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,318
I have to tell Javier.

1546
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:53,947
- What?
- This tile is too small.

1547
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:58,076
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,
if anyone asks.

1548
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,713
Well, my first husband was unimpressive.

1549
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,674
I found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary...

1550
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,051
...when I came home early
from the Maldives.

1551
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:18,096
It was just so unoriginal.

1552
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:20,640
Made me feel sorry for him.

1553
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:24,478
My second husband
was a pinch more creative.

1554
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,438
Cheated on me with my sister...

1555
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:31,693
...but made me believe that I was insane
for being suspicious.

1556
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:35,322
So at least some mind games,
some intrigue.

1557
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,117
But my last husband, he was a gem.

1558
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:42,204
He was a veritable master
at covering his tracks.

1559
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:47,292
I mean, I pored over his phone records,
I intercepted his credit-card bills...

1560
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,586
...I had him followed
on numerous occasions...

1561
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,089
...and never found
a single shred of evidence.

1562
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:55,634
It wasn't until he died...

1563
01:31:55,801 --> 01:32:01,014
...that I found out about the property
he owned with his Austrian mistress.

1564
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:05,894
But the real master, I have to say, is me.

1565
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:11,733
Three husbands, countless boyfriends,
I haven't been caught yet.

1566
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,194
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1567
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,449
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't...
- Shh.

1568
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,123
It's over there.

1569
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:32,379
Oh, my God.

1570
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,297
He liked the demo. I can't believe it.

1571
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:35,549
It's unbelievable.

1572
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,426
Did you hear when he said
that it was hauntingly beautiful?

1573
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:40,595
Yeah, I was there. I was...

1574
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:42,472
I was there, baby.

1575
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,724
Thank you.

1576
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:20,844
Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over
some offering statements. You gotta...

1577
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,888
You gotta come back later.

1578
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,683
It's not Dana.

1579
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:30,854
Is that your...?

1580
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,106
- Is that your...?
- Shh.

1581
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,191
Can you get in the closet?

1582
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,528
- Get in the closet.
- What?

1583
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:41,197
Just go in the closet for a second.
Just for a second.

1584
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:42,365
Ben?

1585
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:48,371
I keep telling Dana
to get that damn lock fixed.

1586
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,916
- Why do you even bother locking it?
- What?

1587
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:54,502
Why do you bother locking it?

1588
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:58,590
Oh, you know I can't get any work done
if I don't.

1589
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:08,725
- Hey.
- Hi.

1590
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,811
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

1591
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:25,659
What are you doing?

1592
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,328
Sit down.

1593
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:30,121
Okay.

1594
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:43,843
Hon?

1595
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:49,766
What are you doing?

1596
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:52,435
I don't know. I just thought...

1597
01:34:52,603 --> 01:34:54,229
...maybe we could...

1598
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,315
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

1599
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:59,484
Maybe if you just go over there.

1600
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,945
Just trying to...

1601
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,572
...you know, re-light the fire.

1602
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,908
Oh, honey.

1603
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:11,287
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.

1604
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:14,874
Look...

1605
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,670
...I'm really trying here.

1606
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:24,092
Do you wanna save our marriage?

1607
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,932
Of course.

1608
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:33,101
Me too.

1609
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:01,045
Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in
with the bussers when you can.

1610
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:03,173
Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.

1611
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,843
Hey, I been working here 18 months,
8 through 10.

1612
01:36:08,053 --> 01:36:10,013
Minor oversight.

1613
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,559
Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then.

1614
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:18,188
Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago.

1615
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,441
Yeah, he quit.

1616
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:25,695
Is there any reason
we're even having this meeting?

1617
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,030
Not really.

1618
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,199
- No, not for me.
- Great. Good. Great.

1619
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,242
Meeting adjourned.

1620
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,203
Back to work.

1621
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,043
Hey, Kelli Ann.

1622
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,838
Did I get any calls?

1623
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:49,344
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no.
Not a lot of phone traffic.

1624
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,309
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1625
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:58,061
What's her name?

1626
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:01,272
Who?

1627
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,857
The girl, Alex.

1628
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,652
There's no girl.

1629
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,237
You can't hide it, man.

1630
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:10,824
I know strung out
and you are strung out.

1631
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:15,286
Okay, please.

1632
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,413
This is amazing.

1633
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,749
You can't focus, right?

1634
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:24,170
Jumping every time your phone rings,
checking your e-mail 100 times a day...

1635
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,089
...wishing you could write songs.

1636
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:30,927
No, feeling the need to bring up her name
in random conversations.

1637
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:35,431
It's always the same
and it has happened to you, my friend.

1638
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:40,770
Shit.

1639
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,732
Welcome to my world, asshole.

1640
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:48,653
Let me get the door.

1641
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:55,159
Sure I can't interest you
in a little beef and broccoli?

1642
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:57,203
I gotta finish this stuff.

1643
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:58,788
Okay.

1644
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,209
- Yeah. So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

1645
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:05,837
I love you.

1646
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:08,172
I love you too.

1647
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,263
- Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1648
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:25,315
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.

1649
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:28,276
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?

1650
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:30,653
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!

1651
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,197
You will never touch me again.

1652
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,830
Dino, thanks again for letting me
pay over the phone.

1653
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:45,043
I assure you this late-payment thing
will never happen again.

1654
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:47,795
Yep, just trying to trim
some of the drama out of my life.

1655
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:50,214
Oh, that's my other line.

1656
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:51,591
Okay, bye.

1657
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,801
- Hello?
- Hi, Gigi?

1658
01:38:53,969 --> 01:38:55,345
This is Bill.

1659
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:57,513
- Bill?
- Alex's friend.

1660
01:38:57,681 --> 01:39:01,809
We were supposed to meet up
but Alex told me the wrong day.

1661
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:04,520
Bill, so you do exist.

1662
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:06,022
I do.

1663
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,234
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime
if you're still game.

1664
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:12,612
Yes.

1665
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,906
Sure, why not?

1666
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:23,998
Hey.

1667
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:26,250
Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1668
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:28,836
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

1669
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:31,047
See, why did you
just call me "sweetie"?

1670
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:34,342
- We always call each other that.
- Why?

1671
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:37,512
All right, look,
I wanna say something, okay?

1672
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:40,056
We call each other "sweetie"
all the time.

1673
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:43,017
And we fall asleep on the phone
after talking for hours.

1674
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:46,562
I washed your hair for you after
you had shoulder surgery and everything.

1675
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:48,064
And it's like we're together.

1676
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,400
- I know that I've been...
- No, hold on a second.

1677
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,402
Let me finish.

1678
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:54,404
I think maybe this is my fault...

1679
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:58,282
...because maybe I wasn't clear
about exactly what I want.

1680
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:01,077
So let me... Let me be clear.

1681
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,162
I love hanging out.

1682
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,333
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just... I want both.

1683
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,253
I don't know what happened
or why we stopped. I don't care.

1684
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,879
Okay.

1685
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,716
- What?
- Okay.

1686
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:18,094
No, I'm talking about really doing this.
Like a full-on relationship.

1687
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,762
Right.

1688
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:21,264
With me.

1689
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:22,807
Yeah.

1690
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:26,185
A bunch of gay people
put you up to this?

1691
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:28,146
Stop talking.

1692
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:50,334
Stay home. It's an end-around.
No, no, it's not. He's still got it.

1693
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:51,961
He's still got it.

1694
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,714
- Shit.
- Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.

1695
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:58,676
- Argh!
- That is so embarrassing.

1696
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,094
What?

1697
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:03,890
Did any of you guys have a chance
to get to the store?

1698
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:06,642
Oh, yeah, no.
We're good, we got takeout.

1699
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:09,395
No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f...

1700
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,523
- All right, here we go.
- Come on, defense, wake up.

1701
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:16,903
You have to be kidding me.

1702
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:33,503
I just got a little bit more of this
I gotta finish.

1703
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,838
There's some laundry
I'm gonna put away...

1704
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:38,758
...then I had another load of clothes
in the dryer.

1705
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:42,512
I did get some of the food your dad likes,
but some healthy stuff too.

1706
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:44,514
Just, you know.

1707
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,560
It's gonna be okay.

1708
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:53,481
It'll be okay.

1709
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,677
Bend your knee a little bit more.
There you go.

1710
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:06,971
Inhale, reverse warrior, look up.

1711
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,264
Exhale.

1712
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,778
Hi, you've reached Ben's cell phone.
Please leave...

1713
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:55,686
You lying sack of shit!

1714
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,693
Lying!

1715
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:03,903
Sack!

1716
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,655
Shit!

1717
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:46,696
Okay.

1718
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,000
- Or call my cell, or try me at work...

1719
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:02,503
...but definitely leave a message
here first. Thanks.

1720
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:05,965
Hey, Gigi, it's Alex.

1721
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,342
How's it going?

1722
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,386
Just wondering how you're doing.

1723
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:14,390
I haven't talked to you in a little while...

1724
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,726
...and was just wondering
how you're doing.

1725
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:20,563
So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you.

1726
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,566
Obviously.

1727
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:26,027
But you're out, I guess.

1728
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:29,905
So just call me sometime.

1729
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,240
Or tonight.

1730
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:33,993
I'm around, I'll be...
Well, I'm in and around.

1731
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:37,413
So that's enough for now.

1732
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:40,624
It's Alex.

1733
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,418
Okay.

1734
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:47,089
Dude.

1735
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,759
I know.

1736
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:11,655
Hey.

1737
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:14,950
Welcome aboard.

1738
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:16,285
Might I come aboard?

1739
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,871
Yeah. You remember the boat.

1740
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:21,582
Well, you know, I thought I did.

1741
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,168
- Or, you know, little...
- But it's been a while.

1742
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:28,631
You know that dock? Over there,
there's a boat that looks just like yours.

1743
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:30,216
- Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.

1744
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,760
- No, that's not my boat.
- It's definitely not.

1745
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:36,347
But there's a very nice gentleman...

1746
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:37,807
...living on the boat...

1747
01:46:37,974 --> 01:46:41,102
...who invited me in
for a white-wine spritzer.

1748
01:46:41,269 --> 01:46:42,395
Oh, good.

1749
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:46,565
Wasn't expecting visitors.

1750
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:50,736
That's all right. I just wanted
to just come by and say thanks...

1751
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:52,822
...for helping yesterday.

1752
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:57,034
Beth, you know, I'm the same person.

1753
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,662
I would do anything for you.

1754
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,248
I just can't give you...

1755
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,166
I just can't give you what you want.

1756
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:06,127
You're what I want.

1757
01:47:06,294 --> 01:47:09,422
Our life together is what I want.

1758
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:10,673
I miss it.

1759
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,174
I miss you.

1760
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:14,844
You see those guys my sisters
are married to...

1761
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:17,596
You're more of a husband to me,
not being married...

1762
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:21,225
...than those real husbands
are ever gonna be, and...

1763
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:25,521
It's enough. It's really enough for me.

1764
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:30,359
And you would be willing...

1765
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:35,030
...to take the whole marriage thing
off the table completely?

1766
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:39,160
If you promise to commit to me
and to love me, and...

1767
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:41,454
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.

1768
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,706
Okay. All right.

1769
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:47,418
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.

1770
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:49,170
Okay.

1771
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:54,216
You have to snake the drain
when my hair gets clogged.

1772
01:47:54,384 --> 01:47:56,385
You know that happens. Okay?

1773
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:57,970
Okay. Yeah.

1774
01:47:58,138 --> 01:47:59,889
And also...

1775
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:05,519
...you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins
in bed. You gotta give me that.

1776
01:48:05,687 --> 01:48:07,688
- Okay, fine. All right.
- Okay?

1777
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,649
And...

1778
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:12,568
- Yeah.
- And?

1779
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,196
- That's it.
- Okay.

1780
01:48:19,075 --> 01:48:20,493
Do I get to come home now?

1781
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,537
I guess you can.

1782
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:28,918
But these cannot come.

1783
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:31,003
- What, my pants...?
- That's correct.

1784
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,380
- Can't come home? Why?
- No.

1785
01:48:33,548 --> 01:48:36,800
You just won a really big battle,
my friend. Come on.

1786
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:44,099
So we're not gonna get married,
but I have to get rid of my pants.

1787
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:47,102
Mm-hm. And we both win.

1788
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:50,439
All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

1789
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:52,608
You're getting
a lot of bids on this place?

1790
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:56,028
Yeah. I know it's crazy,
but it's a neighborhood in transition.

1791
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:59,198
Is that like young, hip, gay couples
or something like that?

1792
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:03,452
Yeah. Hip gay people,
young couples, young families.

1793
01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:07,915
Wow.

1794
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:11,460
God, this reminds me of where I grew up.

1795
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:14,129
I bet it's got one of the...

1796
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,174
Wait a minute.

1797
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:19,927
Oh, yeah.

1798
01:49:20,303 --> 01:49:23,389
Yeah, that's it.

1799
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:26,475
We used to have the exact same one...

1800
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:29,979
...except my mom used it as a desk.

1801
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:34,024
So...

1802
01:49:34,526 --> 01:49:37,278
...when do all the fabulous people arrive?

1803
01:49:37,445 --> 01:49:39,613
Well, actually,
the open house is tomorrow.

1804
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:42,032
But I have this one buyer...

1805
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,786
...and I wanted to make sure
his girlfriend likes it first.

1806
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:48,664
Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?

1807
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,167
Yeah, I have an idea.

1808
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:53,586
For this house.

1809
01:49:53,753 --> 01:49:54,878
For me.

1810
01:49:55,046 --> 01:49:57,840
And hopefully, if you like it...

1811
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:00,593
...and things continue to, you know...

1812
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:03,596
Anna...

1813
01:50:03,763 --> 01:50:05,848
...I have a plan, okay?

1814
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,976
I know where my life is going,
and I want you to go with me.

1815
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:11,395
I'm not saying I want you
to move in right now...

1816
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:15,524
...but I don't want to buy this place
unless, at some point...

1817
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,943
...you could see yourself moving in.

1818
01:50:18,528 --> 01:50:20,195
So, what do you think?

1819
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:24,033
I can't do this.

1820
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,660
Okay.

1821
01:50:27,746 --> 01:50:30,706
Well, if it's too fast,
I guess we can always just...

1822
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:33,125
I can't do any of this.

1823
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:35,169
I mean...

1824
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:39,757
...what you're saying
and what you're offering...

1825
01:50:39,924 --> 01:50:43,010
...is what every girl wants.

1826
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:45,512
It's what I always wanted.

1827
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,681
It's just...

1828
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:55,731
You don't want it with me.

1829
01:51:16,586 --> 01:51:17,586
Okay.

1830
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:20,923
I have a question.

1831
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,635
Is there any way we could...

1832
01:51:25,595 --> 01:51:28,597
...dial it back to before,
when we were just sleeping together...

1833
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:32,851
...because I don't know,
I felt like that gelled.

1834
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:48,325
Babe?

1835
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,236
It was nice meeting you.

1836
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:26,655
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.

1837
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:28,657
You too.

1838
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:35,998
Good night.

1839
01:52:55,059 --> 01:52:57,186
You forget something?

1840
01:52:58,146 --> 01:53:00,147
Yeah, I did.

1841
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,192
Really? What did you forget?

1842
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:08,363
This.

1843
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:17,664
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen?

1844
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:18,916
Yeah.

1845
01:53:19,083 --> 01:53:24,421
I thought I should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here.

1846
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:26,715
That's how it's done, isn't it?

1847
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,468
Sometimes.

1848
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:32,221
Look, I can't stop thinking about you.

1849
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,889
It's a problem.

1850
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:38,268
I drive by your place, I call and hang up.

1851
01:53:38,436 --> 01:53:39,478
I'm turning into...

1852
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:41,146
Me.

1853
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:43,732
Yeah.

1854
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:49,196
A wise person once told me...

1855
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:54,159
...that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen, no matter what.

1856
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:55,410
That's true.

1857
01:53:55,578 --> 01:53:58,622
But when I was hurling my body
onto yours...

1858
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,916
...you did not seem
to want to make it happen.

1859
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:04,419
Yeah, all right.

1860
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:06,046
You were right.

1861
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:09,925
I've gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women...

1862
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:11,426
...and having the power...

1863
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:13,762
...that I didn't know what it felt like...

1864
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:16,098
...when I actually fell...

1865
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:18,433
...for one of them.

1866
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:23,438
I didn't know.

1867
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:34,867
Look, I just went out
with your friend Bill and...

1868
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:36,118
Yeah.

1869
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:38,829
He might be just exactly what I need.

1870
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:40,747
No drama.

1871
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:43,208
He calls, he does what he says.

1872
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:45,502
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.

1873
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:48,213
And that same wise person told me
that I am the rule.

1874
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:51,967
That I have to stop thinking
that every guy will change.

1875
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:54,428
That I have to stop thinking that...

1876
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,488
I'm the exception.

1877
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:19,161
You are my exception.

1878
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:03,538
Conor Barry.

1879
01:56:03,706 --> 01:56:06,166
Hi, it's Mary at the Blade.

1880
01:56:06,334 --> 01:56:08,627
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

1881
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:12,130
Really? You don't think the muscle T
is too much?

1882
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:16,551
I think the shirt you're wearing now
is probably more you.

1883
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:19,805
What, you here?

1884
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:22,182
I'm sitting right in front of you.

1885
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:25,394
Wow, this is you. Mary.

1886
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:26,645
It's me.

1887
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:28,063
I'm me.

1888
01:56:31,901 --> 01:56:33,235
Should I...?

1889
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:34,861
- Please. Please.
- Okay.

1890
01:56:35,029 --> 01:56:37,072
- Talk to you in a minute.
- See you in a second.

1891
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,074
Okay.

1892
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:42,411
Hey.

1893
01:56:42,578 --> 01:56:43,912
- Hi.
- How are you?

1894
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,455
It's nice to finally meet you.

1895
01:56:45,623 --> 01:56:46,707
- You too.
- In person.

1896
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,459
This is a pleasant surprise.

1897
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:50,877
- You...
- What?

1898
01:56:51,045 --> 01:56:54,172
- I don't know. Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?

1899
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:56,717
Your voice does not match
your face in a good way.

1900
01:56:56,884 --> 01:56:59,928
In a... Yeah, I mean...
That sounded terrible.

1901
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:06,268
Amazing.

1902
01:57:06,436 --> 01:57:08,770
I don't know how all this stuff
fit in here before.

1903
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:11,857
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

1904
01:57:20,783 --> 01:57:25,120
You are not trying
to get these back in here.

1905
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:28,248
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
- We had a deal, mister.

1906
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:29,791
These are not staying.

1907
01:57:29,959 --> 01:57:34,296
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

1908
01:57:34,464 --> 01:57:36,923
They could be pressed,
flattened, you can...

1909
01:57:37,091 --> 01:57:40,552
If you're gonna throw them out,
at least check the pockets, all right?

1910
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:44,347
So you don't throw away
some personal items.

1911
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:04,826
I love you so much.

1912
01:58:05,578 --> 01:58:07,162
So much.

1913
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:09,998
And I wanna make you happy.

1914
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:12,542
I need to make you happy...

1915
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:17,005
...for me to even have a shot
at being happy.

1916
01:58:18,299 --> 01:58:23,512
Will you marry me?

1917
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:32,687
Yes, of course I will. Yes.

1918
01:58:32,855 --> 01:58:34,439
Yes.

1919
01:58:39,028 --> 01:58:40,862
Thank God.

1920
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:49,746
If a guy punches you, he likes you.

1921
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:52,165
Never try to trim your own bangs.

1922
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:57,295
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending.

1923
01:58:57,463 --> 01:58:59,131
- And your commitment to each other.

1924
01:59:00,716 --> 01:59:04,052
Every movie we see,
every story we're told...

1925
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,887
...implores us to wait for it.

1926
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:12,561
The unexpected declaration of love.

1927
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,647
The exception to the rule.

1928
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:19,401
But sometimes we're so focused
on finding our happy ending...

1929
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:22,237
...we don't learn how to read the signs.

1930
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:25,365
How to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who don't.

1931
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:28,827
The ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave.

1932
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,254
- Hi.
- Hi.

1933
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:44,176
And maybe this happy ending
doesn't include a wonderful guy.

1934
01:59:45,511 --> 01:59:48,513
Maybe it's you...

1935
01:59:50,057 --> 01:59:51,933
...on your own...

1936
01:59:52,101 --> 01:59:55,187
...picking up the pieces and starting over.

1937
01:59:56,522 --> 02:00:00,483
Freeing yourself up
for something better in the future.

1938
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:05,197
Maybe the happy ending is just...

1939
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:07,699
...moving on.

1940
02:00:11,495 --> 02:00:14,956
Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn.
Forget the dip. Come on, come on.

1941
02:00:15,124 --> 02:00:17,167
Let's go, Alex.

1942
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,960
Come on, Alex, your turn.

1943
02:00:19,128 --> 02:00:20,378
Ready? LOL.

1944
02:00:20,546 --> 02:00:22,923
Laugh out loud! We won!

1945
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:28,970
Knowing that through all the unreturned
phone calls and broken hearts...

1946
02:00:29,138 --> 02:00:32,641
...through all the blunders
and misread signals...

1947
02:00:32,808 --> 02:00:35,810
...through all of the pain
and embarrassment...

1948
02:00:35,978 --> 02:00:39,814
...you never, ever gave up hope.

1949
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:48,657
Now that we are married...

1950
02:00:48,824 --> 02:00:50,075
We're gonna move.

1951
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,202
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.

1952
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:56,373
Another thing we're gonna do
is move a little further away from...

1953
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:59,334
- Baltimore?
- Your sisters.

1954
02:01:00,002 --> 02:01:01,878
I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

1955
02:01:02,046 --> 02:01:07,050
I've started trying to figure out what
I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?

1956
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:10,845
Probably seems the wrong time to do that,
but why not? You know, why not?

1957
02:01:11,013 --> 02:01:12,347
Better later than never.

1958
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:14,224
I'm dating now.

1959
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:19,145
What do you miss most about marriage?

1960
02:01:19,313 --> 02:01:20,772
Have you been married?

1961
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,023
Yes, I'm married.

1962
02:01:22,191 --> 02:01:23,817
- You are married?
- I am married.

1963
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,819
And what's your question?

1964
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:29,823
- We're heading there, is that fair?
- It's moving fast. Just on our way.

1965
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:32,742
I like him, I'll say that L word.

1966
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:35,870
That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah.

1967
02:01:36,038 --> 02:01:39,207
- I like her a lot, so...
- Good, I'm glad.

1968
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:41,209
I love her. I love her.

1969
02:01:41,877 --> 02:01:44,379
You know, what I've been focusing
my energy on...

1970
02:01:44,547 --> 02:01:48,383
...is like a self-discovery,
as opposed to dating.

1971
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,969
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.

1972
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:55,890
Good friend of mine and I
are going to India for a few months.

1973
02:01:56,058 --> 02:01:57,475
We're going on a yoga retreat.

1974
02:01:57,643 --> 02:01:59,894
I really genuinely love this person...

1975
02:02:00,062 --> 02:02:01,938
He had asked me to co-host this party...

1976
02:02:02,106 --> 02:02:03,356
...and I stayed after.

1977
02:02:03,524 --> 02:02:07,235
I was trying to help you out because there
was this girl who would not leave...

1978
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:10,113
...that tall girl.
- Right. She was gross.

1979
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:11,656
I was trying to...

1980
02:02:11,824 --> 02:02:13,658
She was... come on.

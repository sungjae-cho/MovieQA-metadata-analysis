00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,436
<i>I always believed
it was the things you don't choose</i>

3
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,601
<i>that makes you who you are.</i>

4
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,276
<i>Your city.</i>

5
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,247
<i>Your neighborhood.</i>

6
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,608
<i>Your family.</i>

7
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,719
<i>People here take pride in these things.</i>

8
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,659
<i>Like it was something
they'd accomplished.</i>

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,290
<i>The bodies around their souls.</i>

10
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,267
<i>The cities wrapped around those.</i>

11
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,955
<i>I lived on this block my whole life.</i>

12
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,425
<i>Most of these people have.</i>

13
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,834
<i>When your job is to find people
who are missing,</i>

14
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,535
<i>it helps to know where they started.</i>

15
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,373
<i>I find the people
who started in the cracks,</i>

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,313
<i>and then fell through.</i>

17
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>This city can be hard.</i>

18
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,022
<i>When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven</i>

19
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,293
<i>and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.</i>

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,540
<i>He told me what God said
to his children.</i>

21
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,909
<i>"You are sheep among wolves,</i>

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,143
<i>"be wise as serpents,</i>

23
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,151
<i>"yet innocent as doves."</i>

24
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,816
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

25
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,289
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

26
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,924
You know, to get Annette
in high school, you have...

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,591
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

28
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,402
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,710
That was her.
She was always smiling.

30
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,947
I mean, who would take my little girl?

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,782
She never hurt anybody,
never caused...

32
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,382
Whoever you are,
if you have her,

33
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,688
you just let her go.

34
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,229
Now, we won't charge you,

35
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,899
<i>but if you're out there,
just let her come home.</i>

36
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,732
<i>All right?
Let her come home.</i>

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,968
<i>I mean, who would take
my little girl?</i>

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,406
- You fucking cops.
- <i>She never caused no trouble,</i>

39
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,943
<i>she never got in any fights,
she's a sweetheart.</i>

40
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,174
- This is just unbelievable.
- <i>She was a good kid.</i>

41
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,341
The whole force standing outside the house,

42
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,318
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

43
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,149
I mean, are the kidnappers
coming back?

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,249
<i>Amanda McCready was taken
from her home</i>

45
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,090
<i>between 8:00 and 8:30
Wednesday night.</i>

46
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,858
<i>She's four years old,
has blond hair and green eyes...</i>

47
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,955
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,024
<i>weighs 35 pounds
and is 40 inches tall.</i>

49
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,468
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I know.

50
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,369
<i>A beleaguered police force
and a weary citizenry</i>

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,772
<i>have been left
with so little to cling to.</i>

52
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,801
<i>A blanket, a back door,
and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,676
The neighborhood's
really coming together.

54
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,840
We're gonna have a rally.

55
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,443
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

56
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,248
You know, the neighborhood's all alert,

57
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,620
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that...

58
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:23,185
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

59
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,232
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

60
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,696
<i>In related news,
the Boston police captain</i>

61
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,430
<i>responsible for preventing

62

00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,597

<i>I know the pain of losing a daughter.

65
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,315
<i>We will pursue every avenue.</i>

66
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,611
Do you know the mother?

67
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,584
<i>Captain Jack Doyle on details
of the missing Dorchester girl...</i>

68
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,987
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

69
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,752
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

70
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,226
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

71
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,894
I don't know about innocent.

72
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,526
<i>Her mother says Amanda may be carrying
a little girl of her own.</i>

73
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,901
<i>Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.
It's her favorite doll.</i>

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,267
This is horrible.

75
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,212
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

76
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,411
Good night.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,627
- Hey, Angie. Get the door?
- I'm in the bathroom.

78
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,496
It's 7:00!
Seven in the fucking morning!

79
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,697
What?

80
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,700
Are you Patrick Kenzie?

81
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,509
- Yeah.
- Bea and Lionel McCready.

82
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,638
Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

83
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,173
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologize.

84
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,913
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighborhood,

85
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,478
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

86
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,922
So that's the reason for the language.

87
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,356
- Oh.
- Well, we can come back later.

88
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,950
No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

89
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,757
Here, we're just...
I'm sorry about the mess.

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,958
We've been...
I had a late case, and a lot of cases.

91
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,694
We've just been...
We've just been working a lot,

92
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,965
we worked on a case last night,
you know, so we just...

93
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,972
Please sit down, though.

94
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,775
Or...

95
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,710
My associate'll be in in just a minute.
She's in the other room.

96
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,545
How can we help you?

97
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,613
Do you know people
in the neighborhood

98
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,086
who don't talk to the police?

99
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,782
Yeah, one or two.

100
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,950
We wanna hire you to augment
the investigation of Amanda.

101
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,188
Is that right?

102
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,324
You know how in JonBenet Ramsey
the family hired investigators?

103
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,165
So... Are the police all right
with youse hiring outside help?

104
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,705
The police need to worry
about finding my niece.

105
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,970
Hi. I'm Angie Gennaro.
I work with Patrick.

106
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,135
Hello. I'm Bea McCready.
This is my husband, Lionel.

107
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,542
- How do you do?
- They wanna hire us

108
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,673
to augment the investigation.

109
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,183
You should talk to Precision Investigators.

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,879
- Who? I...
- I don't know, I meant...

111
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,147
Well, let's hear them out, Ange.

112
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,849
Well, aren't you
missing persons detectives?

113
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,653
Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

114
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,126
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

115
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,823
I'm sorry, she...
I think that what Angie means to say is,

116
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,696
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

117
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,534
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

118
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,505
who've gone missing that they...

119
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,474
You know, they just stop payments
on their Jet Ski

120
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,567
and they went to New Hampshire...

121
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,944
Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

122
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,915
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

123
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,450
Well, you're not gonna do
any harm, are you?

124
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,976
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

125
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,454
- So, that's collateral, if...
- No. It's not that.

126
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,322
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

127
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,725
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

128
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,229
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,790
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

130
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,496
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

131
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,665
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

132
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,106
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

133
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,609
She was watching <i>Wife Swap.</i>

134
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,873
She remembers, 'cause
that's her favorite show.

135
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,209
And do youse two live upstairs?

136
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,375
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

137
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,113
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

138
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,381
And with the acoustics in the apartment,

139
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,479
you can't get away from it.

140
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,387
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

141
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,484
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- Lionel, talk to Helene?

142
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,756
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

143
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,424
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,094
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

145
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,332
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

146
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,839
My sister Helene has not had that.

147
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,701
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

148
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,871
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

149
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,346
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

150
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,645
Oh, you'll find us
in that brown three-decker by the park.

151
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,152
- You know where it is.
- Be hard to miss today.

152
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,074
Look at this. Jesus.

153
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,169
Fucking block party here.

154
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,545
Four Cape Verdeans
got killed here last year.

155
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,552
No one gave a shit.

156
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,688
We have a good life, right?

157
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,789
Is that a trick question?

158
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,200
I don't wanna find their little kid
in a dumpster.

159
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,795
Maybe she's not in a dumpster, babe.

160
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,500
I don't wanna find a little kid
after they've been abused for three days.

161
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,282
Hon, nobody does.

162
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,053
All right.

163
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,081
Listen, we'll just go up
and we'll talk to them,

164
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,061
and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

165
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,255
Okay.

166
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,941
Hi. Please, come on in.

167
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,305
Helene.

168
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,872
This is Patrick Kenzie,
Angela Gennaro.

169
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,886
- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

170
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,388
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

171
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,824
Would you excuse us, Dottie?

172
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,023
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

173
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,360
Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

174
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,558
We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

175
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,397
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

176
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,199
- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

177
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,035
I already talked to the cops forty times.

178
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,133
- We're sorry to take up your time.
- Listen, we're not the cops.

179
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,507
Beatrice asked us to come over here

180
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,206
and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

181
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,681
Why don't Bea mind her business?
It's my kid.

182
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,878
'Cause everyone gotta
have their moment, now.

183
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:54,977
- Right?
- Right.

184
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,387
Beatrice hired these people to help
find Amanda with her own money,

185
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,391
so you had better show them
the goddamn courtesy

186
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,484
- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

187
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,960
She could grieve how she wants, Dottie.

188
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,292
- You don't live here!
- Asshole.

189
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,128
Don't you fucking yell at her, Lionel.
You ain't her father!

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,191
Fuck you, Lionel.

191
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,669
Go fuck yourself. Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

192
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,433
Get the fuck outta here.

193
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,136
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,801
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe we should go.

195
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,346
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

196
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,405
Maybe we should go?

197
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,984
Look. Can we all just have a few words
in the hallway, please?

198
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,283
Excuse us, Helene.

199
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,032
- Helene's got emotional problems.
- It's not that, Lionel.

200
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,867
- What is it, then?
- She's a cunt!

201
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,375
- Beatrice, don't use that word.
- God help me, it's true.

202
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:02,652
This is a child.
And I don't know where she is.

203
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,497
Well...

204
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,334
We can't do any harm, right?

205
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,253
It's all right, Bea.
It's all right, Bea. Huh?

206
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,089
Thank you.

207
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,552
Now...

208
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,027
Well, she's quiet.
She tries very hard to be a good girl.

209
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,431
What about Helene? Her friends?
People she hangs out with?

210
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,869
She got a lot of people
come by the house?

211
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,101
I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

212
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,909
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

213
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,969
Yeah, she drinks every day.

214
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,346
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

215
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,383
She use drugs?

216
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,217
I think she does a little coke.

217
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,450
How much is a little?

218
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:18,293
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

219
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,798
Few times a week's a lot.

220
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,960
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

221
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:28,439
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

222
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,806
Congratulations.

223
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,049
Do you mind if we see her room?

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,864
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

225
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,251
<i>10-7 investigation.</i>

226
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,152
Solved it yet?

227
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,660
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

228
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,095
Mmm-hmm?

229
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,026
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

230
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,136
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

231
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,432
It was not.

232
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,500
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

233
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,670
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

234
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:44,045
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

235
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,607
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

236
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,849
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

237
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,391
I think Mrs. McCready was hoping
we could help

238
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,656
with the neighborhood aspect of this investigation,
the people, you know.

239
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,321
How old are you?

240
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,263
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

241
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,135
A four-year-old child is on the street.

242
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,804
It's 76 hours and counting.

243
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,574
And the prospects for where she might be

244
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,048
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

245
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:22,076
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

246
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,452
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

247
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,321
only about 10% are ever solved.

248
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,327
This is day three.

249
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,065
He may look young,

250
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,228
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

251
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,967
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

252
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,339
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

253
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,402
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

254
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,037
So he expects to be.

255
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,242
And he will be.

256
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,822
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

257
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,658
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

258
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,290
We're just trying to help, Captain.

259
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:16,398
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

260
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,070
Good afternoon.

261
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,376
Ready to get started?

262
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,959
All I'm saying is that
we heard Helene comes in here.

263
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,899
We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

264
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,632
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

265
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,901
All right.

266
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,375
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

267
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,605
Big Dave. All right.

268
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,945
I'm Medium Patrick.
Nice to meet you.

269
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,316
You're a little fucking light in the ass
to be talking shit, ain't ya?

270
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,446
Jesus, pal, I'm just playing.

271
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,616
Listen, buy a couple
of fucking drinks or screw.

272
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,989
Okay, we'll take a couple tonics.

273
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,861
Jesus Christ.

274
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,231
Steve Penteroudakis!
The Grecian Formula!

275
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,826
Oh, shit!
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,270
Look at this little motherfucker
at the Fillmore, what's up?

277
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,534
Gyro!

278
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,735
Beers and keno, 2:00 in the afternoon.

279
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,072
- What up?
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,645
Yeah, listen,
I been fucking everywhere

281
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,740
putting up posters, man, you know?

282
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,719
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

283
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,812
You know?
I mean, it's a real tragedy.

284
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,789
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

285
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,054
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

286
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,995
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

287
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,623
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,135
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

289
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,694
So how often Helene come down here?

290
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,137
Five nights a week.

291
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,074
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

292
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,338
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

293
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,380
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so...

294
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,315
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

295
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,079
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

296
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,882
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

297
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:10,979
You saw her on the news, right?

298
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,787
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbor's house for a half hour."

299
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,921
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

300
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,489
- What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

301
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,695
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

302
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,864
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

303
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,498
and I was banging on the fucking door.

304
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,770
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

305
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,607
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

306
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,668
I was banging on the door.

307
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,804
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

308
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,473
but I know he's fucking in there.

309
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,575
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

310
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,611
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

311
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,783
Don't talk about people you don't know.

312
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,121
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

313
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,354
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

314
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,660
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

315
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,427
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

316
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,332
Why don't you mind your business?

317
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,768
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

318
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,204
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

319
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,573
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

320
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,444
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

321
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,177
Trying to help Helene find her daughter.
Is that all right?

322
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,616
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

323
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,380
thinking you're better than me.

324
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,615
I'm not the fucking one.

325
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,589
- All right, just cool it.
- Cool it.

326
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,525
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

327
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,757
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you guys?

328
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,128
You, you punk fucking jackass.

329
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,169
We're leaving, all right?

330
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,316
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

331
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,649
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

332
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,563
Open that door, rummy.

333
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,565
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

334
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,941
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

335
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,385
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

336
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,427
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

337
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,359
What, you wanna say some shit,
Fat Dave?

338
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,454
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

339
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,795
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

340
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,890
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

341
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,233
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

342
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,497
Fucking unbelievable.

343
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,877
- Can I help you?
- You Detective Bressant?

344
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,971
- That's right.
- Patrick Kenzie. Did you just call me?

345
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,506
Oh, sorry.
Sergeant Detective Remy Bressant.

346
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,553
How you doing?

347
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,755
- Should we... Sit down?
- Something wrong?

348
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,447
No! I just...

349
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,460
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

350
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,028
Life's full of surprises.

351
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,694
Corwin Earle.
Serial molester, recently work-released.

352
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,265
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

353
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,702
Known associates, Leon Trett

354
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,974
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

355
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,645
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

356
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,875
They have drug habits.

357
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,713
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

358
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,381
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

359
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,119
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

360
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,887
Apparently the three of them

361
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,930
have some kind of
<i>Addams Family</i> deal going on.

362
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,365
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

363
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,871
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

364
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,235
Do you think this is
who has Amanda?

365
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,739
Well, there's a lot of holes in our theory.

366
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,003
I mean, Corwin likes little boys,
you know?

367
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,944
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

368
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,282
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

369
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,410
No, we got more.

370
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,046
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

371
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,817
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

372
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,551
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

373
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,354
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

374
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,122
who just happened to cut off
his ankle bracelet.

375
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,254
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

376
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,321
Who the fuck is this guy?

377
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,965
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

378
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,765
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

379
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,237
Otherwise, hey, you...

380
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,639
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

381
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,603
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

382
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,978
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

383
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,348
that are capable of doing this.

384
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,021
So then you probably talked
to Ray Likanski.

385
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,284
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

386
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,852
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

387
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,365
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

388
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,601
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

389
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,830
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

390
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,499
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

391
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,098
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

392
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,440
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

393
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,877
Fascinating.

394
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,116
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

395
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,150
She did bullshit us.

396
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,485
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

397
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,115
Meet you down there.

398
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,388
So what kinda name is Bressant?

399
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,626
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

400
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,292
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

401
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,202
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

402
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,607
I mean, you might think that
you're more from here than me, for example.

403
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,807
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

404
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,345
So who's right?

405
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,883
I'll mull it over.

406
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,010
- What's up, sucker?
- Bubba.

407
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,417
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

408
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,978
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

409
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,422
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

410
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,321
You seen those people?

411
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,155
Drug addict, drug addict, fucking...
Pedophile.

412
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,259
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

413
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,134
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

414
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,071
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

415
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,733
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

416
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,800
They're not all three child molesters.

417
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,239
Just... Just this one, Corwin Earle.

418
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,648
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

419
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,376
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

420
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,047
We got hired to find that little girl.

421
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,987
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

422
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,047
while the kid was taken.

423
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,889
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

424
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,658
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

425
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,732
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

426
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,063
Ray works for Cheese?

427
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:08,697
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

428
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,434
Did you ever sell to Helene?

429
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,477
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

430
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,273
between us right now.

431
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,541
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

432
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,139
Or coconuts like Cheese.

433
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,240
You should know better by now.

434
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,717
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

435
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,380
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

436
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,650
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

437
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,585
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

438
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,358
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

439
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,398
- Who?
- Come on, sweetheart.

440
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,265
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

441
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,129
Oh, sounds familiar.

442
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,871
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

443
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:53,316
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

444
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,153
Either you know him or you don't.

445
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,784
Who is he?

446
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,225
He's a drug lord or something,
isn't he?

447
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,956
Helene, who is he?

448
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,495
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- Thank you.

449
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,093
He is, among other things,
Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

450
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,104
- What other things?
- I don't know.

451
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,037
Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

452
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,665
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

453
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,040
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

454
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,874
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

455
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,312
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

456
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,439
You know what I mean!

457
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,245
Hey, hey, hey. 
Take it easy. Take it easy.

458
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,219
He's a drug dealer, a pimp, a pornographer.
All right?

459
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,777
Perfect. You associate with a pimp.

460
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,618
A pornographer? Helene.

461
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,955
And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

462
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,654
and shot him in the head on Castlegate,
so there's that, too.

463
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,629
What do you do for him?

464
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,765
I just mule.

465
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,597
Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

466
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,399
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

467
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,464
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

468
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,976
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

469
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,104
- Where?
- Providence...

470
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,876
Does it fucking matter?

471
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,143
You think I'm fucking around, here?

472
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,653
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

473
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,593
Better answer his question, Helene.

474
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,151
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

475
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,858
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

476
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,867
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

477
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,869
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine and heroin.

478
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,738
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

479
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,208
Yeah, less addictive that way.

480
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,308
Piece of work.

481
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,746
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

482
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,989
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

483
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,897
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

484
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,663
Did you know I used to work DCU?

485
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,500
- I give a fuck.
- Okay.

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,666
So, I still know some
of those guys real well.

487
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,476
Anyway, I heard someone
ripped Cheese off

488
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,514
on a New Hampshire run.

489
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,544
- Did you hear anything about that?
- No.

490
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:10,145
- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

491
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,621
Different questions this time.

492
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,819
Come on. It's all right.

493
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,761
We don't care about a couple of hopheads
beating each other.

494
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,800
We care about your child.

495
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,162
So come on.

496
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,601
How much?

497
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,809
You even give a fuck about your kid?

498
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,469
'Course I do.

499
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:40,849
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

500
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,250
How much?

501
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,889
How much?

502
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,923
How much?

503
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,561
One thirty.

504
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,367
- $130,000?
- Yes, Bea.

505
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,104
How'd you do it?

506
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,484
Me and Ray had to do
this run up Nashua, right?

507
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,917
Yeah.

508
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,615
We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

509
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,352
When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

510
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,691
these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

511
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,700
and Amanda was with us,
so we just pretended to be like a family.

512
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,998
- And we got in the car, took off.
- You took Amanda with you?

513
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,268
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Leave her in the car, Bea?

514
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,108
I don't got no daycare.

515
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:44,745
It's really hard being a mother.
It's hard raising a family, you know?

516
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,908
All on my own.

517
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,511
But God made you barren,
so you wouldn't fucking know.

518
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,647
- So I understand, Bea, okay?
- You are an abomination.

519
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,282
- Hey, hey, hey. Right here.
- As God is my witness.

520
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,452
Right here.
What happened next?

521
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:03,329
We was driving back,
and Ray, fucking Ray was like,

522
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,302
"You know everyone's gonna think
the cops got the money."

523
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,396
You told Cheese the cops got it.

524
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,373
But you and Ray kept the money.

525
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,276
- This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.
- Where's the money now, Helene?

526
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,417
- It's with Ray.
- And where's Ray?

527
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,085
- Chelsea.
- Let's go. Come on.

528
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,752
She rides with you.
I don't want her in my car.

529
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,945
- Go on. Move your bike!
- Go fuck your mother.

530
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,609
- What the...
- Beat it, sucker!

531
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,891
Helene, you used to go
with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?

532
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,451
- How do you know?
- You know, I went to Saint Mark's.

533
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,498
I was a freshman when you were a senior.
You don't remember me?

534
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,691
No.

535
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,098
Whatever happened to Scott?

536
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,230
He stabbed a foreign exchange student
in the chest.

537
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,571
He got life in Walpole.
He's a faggot now.

538
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,773
He was kind of a faggot in high school.

539
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:27,841
Oh, man. You're terrible.
He was cute.

540
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,583
Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.

541
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:34,022
Oh, who's a faggot now?
You're dating a faggot.

542
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,561
So, how did the...
How'd the money end up in Chelsea?

543
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,032
I thought youse and...
You and Ray went home after.

544
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,934
No, we dropped off Amanda
and went back to Ray's.

545
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,098
But fucking retarded Ray
left his baby rock at my place.

546
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,074
You know, right then, I'm like,
"I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

547
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,771
"I don't care if he does got a big dick."

548
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,475
So we went back to the apartment
and Ray was hollering,

549
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,518
he was gonna wake up Amanda,
she needs her sleep, you know?

550
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,487
So, we went back to Ray's,

551
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,455
- or Ray's mother's. Whatever.
- Yeah?

552
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,925
I don't know where that mother went,
but she left all her fucking cats in there,

553
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,928
and it smells like cock.

554
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,658
And Cheese never contacted you,
never left you a note?

555
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,428
No. We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.

556
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,231
That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."

557
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,169
You didn't think it was worth it
for your daughter's sake

558
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,606
to tell people what happened?
Cheese has your kid.

559
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,540
God fucking knows
what he's doing to her.

560
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,876
What am I gonna do?

561
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,417
Call Cheese and be like,
"You got my daughter?

562
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,179
"'Cause I just ripped you off,
and I'm just checking."

563
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,277
Yeah!

564
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,185
- Helene, sit back.
- Oh, my God!

565
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,692
Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,
and be like, "You know,

566
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,956
"just so you know, wanna know
I run coke and heroin

567
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,360
"in case that's irrelevant."

568
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,693
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

569
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,096
You make me sick.

570
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,967
What makes you think Ray
hasn't spent all the money, Helene?

571
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,268
Nigger, please. I hid it.

572
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,501
Pull over.

573
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,129
Looks like somebody had a little talk with Ray
before they shot him.

574
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,537
- Looks like he held out pretty good.
- He didn't have it.

575
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,410
He couldn't tell them where the money was,
because he didn't know.

576
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,037
Helene hid it.

577
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,144
Ray made poor relationship choices.

578
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,553
Guess they didn't believe him.

579
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,054
Poor prick.

580
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,523
I'm not waiting in a fucking car.

581
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,604
- Where's the money, Helene?
- I give a fuck about the money.

582
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,972
- Helene...
- I just want my daughter home with me.

583
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,485
I know it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry.
It's very upsetting about Ray. But...

584
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,320
- Where's the money?
- It's right there.

585
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,789
- Where?
- Buried it when Ray was passed out.

586
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,550
What was that book about,

587
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,687
<i>Everything You Need
Is in Your Own Backyard?</i>

588
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,130
- I think it was a French book.
- Yeah, that wasn't a book.

589
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,327
- That was a book.
- No, it was a cartoon.

590
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,926
- The fuck out of here.
- No, it was a cartoon.

591
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,199
- Right, Helene?
- Fuck youse both.

592
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,433
Should we bring in the FBI
at this point?

593
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,771
- That's the worst thing we could do.
- Why is that?

594
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,674
'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese kill Amanda

595
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,042
after he opens a bag
full of newspapers.

596
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,546
It's kidnapping.

597
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:47,277
- I don't see a note. You see a note?
- Nope. No note.

598
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,581
We're investigating
a missing children's case, here.

599
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,055
Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.
Fastest way to get Amanda home

600
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,116
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

601
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,630
- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

602
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,155
Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

603
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,202
Cheese went another way.

604
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,638
- He wouldn't hurt her, right?
- Ask Ray.

605
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,504
All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

606
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,976
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

607
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,572
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

608
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,946
- Oh, you're gonna talk to him?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

609
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,178
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry,
all right?

610
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,915
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologize.

611
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,822
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

612
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,020
- We'll take care of this, all right?
- We'll meet you over there.

613
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,494
I'm hungry.

614
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,860
All right.
I'll get you something, Helene.

615
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,558
No, her.

616
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,601
That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

617
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,193
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

618
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,330
She's not still hungry?

619
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,003
I don't know.

620
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,053
I know I fucked up.

621
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,421
I just want my daughter back.

622
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:40,294
I swear to God,
I won't use no drugs no more.

623
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,195
I won't even go out,
I'll be fucking straight.

624
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,858
Cross my heart.

625
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,194
It's all right.
We're gonna find her, Helene.

626
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,330
You have to. You promise?

627
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,110
Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.

628
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,676
Promise. You have to promise me.

629
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,749
I promise.

630
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,816
All right.

631
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,198
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

632
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,301
<i>Talk to Cheese.</i>

633
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,039
<i>No, you're not.
No, get back in the car.</i>

634
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,673
<i>No, that's a mistake.
He's never gonna talk to a badge.</i>

635
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,148
- <i>No. No way.</i>
- <i>It's too important.</i>

636
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,741
<i>You wanna get the girl back, or not?</i>

637
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,948
<i>I know him.
If there's a deal to be brokered,</i>

638
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,080
- we're the ones who can do it.
- No, me and Nick are handling this.

639
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,145
Get back in the car.

640
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,988
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

641
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,461
then it is the FBI.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

642
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,690
All you're gonna do
is scare him.

643
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,495
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

644
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,002
All right. Go ahead.

645
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,775
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

646
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,313
Good luck.

647
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,449
It's been a long time.

648
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,720
No. I quit.

649
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,201
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

650
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:32,334
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

651
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,778
Bitches love the cheddar.

652
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,781
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

653
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,284
Yeah. Good to hear it.

654
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,455
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

655
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,433
It's been too long not to see a fool.

656
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,492
I grant you audience.

657
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,627
Go.

658
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,268
We found what you were looking for
in Chelsea.

659
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,445
What I care about Chelsea?

660
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,710
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

661
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,717
What idiot?

662
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,846
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

663
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,022
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

664
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,759
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead...

665
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,960
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

666
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,671
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

667
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,604
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

668
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,047
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

669
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,553
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

670
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,782
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

671
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,621
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

672
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,661
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

673
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,831
It's either this, real quiet,

674
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,128
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

675
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,691
putting their fat knees in your neck.

676
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,435
Hold up.

677
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,836
Whoa. Whoa.

678
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,740
What the fuck is this?

679
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,641
Lift up your shirt.

680
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,550
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

681
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,018
Lift up your shirt.

682
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,619
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

683
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,692
Lift up your shirt.

684
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,528
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

685
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,095
Let me see some tit.

686
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,041
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

687
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,979
You got my money,

688
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,854
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

689
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,858
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

690
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,157
I don't play scrimmage.

691
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,459
But I don't fuck with no kids.

692
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:16,206
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

693
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,138
'cause she's gone, baby.

694
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,436
Gone.

695
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,914
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

696
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,584
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

697
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,785
Okay?

698
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,294
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

699
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,429
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

700
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,398
But if it turns out you're lying,

701
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,137
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

702
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,906
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

703
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,448
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

704
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,610
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a CI and a rat.

705
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,778
And I know a lot of people.

706
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,548
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

707
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,388
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

708
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,825
is gonna get raided.

709
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,420
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

710
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,931
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

711
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

712
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,164
by a gang of crackers.

713
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,273
'Cause from what I heard,

714
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,640
you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

715
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,508
life a motherfucker.

716
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,327
If I see you again,
I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

717
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,835
And get that sausage off my lawn.

718
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,473
- Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

719
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,310
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

720
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,283
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

721
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,343
Nothing else?

722
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,788
Yeah. He said that he wanted you two
off his lawn.

723
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,092
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

724
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,391
Half the guys he knows are degenerates.

725
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,090
Yeah, you know what the other half are?

726
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,191
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

727
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,171
No, no.
I won't hold it against you.

728
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,042
You know what I'll hold against you?

729
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,604
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

730
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,673
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

731
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,718
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

732
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,652
hope to Christ we get lucky.

733
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,816
You know, if Amanda dies
because of this,

734
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,758
I won't have to hold it against you.

735
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,499
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

736
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,257
Hope we didn't fuck this up.

737
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,969
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

738
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,874
<i>Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,
but he wants to go tonight.</i>

739
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,571
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

740
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,342
They record calls at the station now.

741
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,976
- <i>Jack got a hold of the transcript.</i>
- What does that mean?

742
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,112
It means our badges are basically
fucking forfeit at this point.

743
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,053
<i>He wants you both down here, now.</i>

744
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,250
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

745
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,691
to prove that he's got Amanda.

746
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:23,210
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

747
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,584
Care to read the highlighted portion?

748
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,059
Aloud?

749
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,495
Uh.

750
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,002
"Caller:
Bitch, you better have my money.

751
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,100
"Detective Bressant:
Who is this?

752
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,736
"The caller:
You know who the fuck this is, fool...

753
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,303
"Creole curse words.
If you want that girl back,

754
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,849
"you need to meet me up Quincy tonight.

755
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,442
"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

756
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,115
The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

757
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,861
Detective Bressant goes on to make
an unauthorized ransom arrangement

758
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,660
to exchange Amanda McCready
for $130,000 tonight

759
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,792
in just that location.

760
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,365
After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

761
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,135
to produce this.

762
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,369
Recognize it?

763
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,538
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

764
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,106
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

765
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,676
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

766
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,483
If I delay this now,
after this agreement,

767
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,252
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

768
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,192
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

769
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,593
No, sir.

770
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,091
I went in there.
I'll accept responsibility.

771
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,031
You'll accept nothing!

772
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,826
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

773
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,803
Let me see that note.

774
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,175
My God.

775
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,377
He wants to separate us.

776
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,184
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

777
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,590
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

778
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,459
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

779
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,327
we turn over the cash.

780
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,565
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

781
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,763
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

782
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,466
What do you know about him?

783
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,475
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

784
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,737
If I had to guess.

785
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,575
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

786
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,081
- I don't know.
- Yes?

787
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,246
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

788
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,615
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

789
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,250
No, sir.

790
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:49,255
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

791
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,296
What you probably didn't hear,

792
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,597
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

793
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,106
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

794
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,706
Knowing that my little girl likely died

795
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,406
crying out for me
to come and save her.

796
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,976
And I never did.

797
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:13,987
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

798
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,618
by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

799
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,864
I know what it feels like to lose a child.

800
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,666
Now, damn it, you force my hand

801
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,038
and then you question
the way I handle it.

802
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,304
No one's questioning you, sir.

803
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,142
I honor my child with this division.

804
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,249
So that no parent
has to go through what I've known.

805
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,184
This child.

806
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,952
That's all I care about.

807
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,885
I'm gonna bring her home.

808
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,306
Why'd he bring us all the way up here?

809
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,076
I don't know. It's big. It's dark.
It's easy to get away.

810
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,210
No.

811
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,857
They're gonna kill her.

812
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,377
This asshole could've found
some level fucking ground somewhere.

813
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,479
This is where we part ways.
You guys'll be on top of that cliff.

814
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,581
We'll be right across from you.

815
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,718
Give us a call on the radio
when you have her.

816
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,286
- We will.
- Well, good luck.

817
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,532
Let's go.

818
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,101
How are they gonna get Amanda up here?

819
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,338
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

820
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:53,381
<i>Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!
Where is she?</i>

821
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:59,386
<i>There she is. I can see her.
It ain't the way it is!</i>

822
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,050
<i>Someone hit Cheese!</i>

823
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,159
- You sure you heard something?
- Yes!

824
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,786
- Over there!
- What happened?

825
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,559
I don't know. I heard a splash.
Down there!

826
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,622
Somebody took Cheese out,

827
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,133
- and then all hell broke loose.
- Where's Amanda?

828
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,362
- Shots were fired from over there.
- I don't know!

829
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,461
Something went in the water!

830
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,527
- What?
- You sure you heard something?

831
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,936
- Yeah, something went in, but I...
- Where did it go?

832
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,474
There! Right there!

833
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,566
Oh, my God.

834
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,005
Oh, no.

835
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,057
Jesus Christ!

836
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,172
<i>Paging Dr. Goldsburn.
Dr. Goldsburn to ICU.</i>

837
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,794
- Hi.
- Hi.

838
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,766
- How's the leg?
- It'll be fine.

839
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,740
They find anything?

840
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:08,849
- They got divers in there now.
- She could still be alive.

841
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,721
Maybe she's hiding.
She could be stuck.

842
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:15,985
Right?

843
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,553
I don't think so.

844
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,038
Hey...

845
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,209
<i>...he's ever seen
in all his years,</i>

846
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:46,278
<i>on a little girl called Amanda
and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

847
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,348
<i>This quarry is extremely
deep and treacherous.</i>

848
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:54,562
<i>All too often,
she keeps that which she takes in.</i>

849
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,360
<i>A sad end to that story, Suzanne.</i>

850
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,900
<i>It sure is, Phil.</i>

851
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:01,532
<i>And Ron is next with sports.
The Bruins in action tonight?</i>

852
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,038
<i>Yes, they are, Phil.</i>

853
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,937
<i>The B's took a crack
at the Flyers tonight,</i>

854
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,101
<i>and the rough stuff started
in the first period.</i>

855
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,873
<i>And like that, she was gone.</i>

856
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:17,144
<i>We gave our statements.
Nick and Remy the same.</i>

857
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:22,080
<i>All of us spared any blame
for Amanda's death.</i>

858
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,058
<i>Jack Doyle resigned on the condition</i>

859
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,255
<i>that he and he alone
be held accountable.</i>

860
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,027
<i>The legendary captain
of a unit dedicated to children</i>

861
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,763
<i>stepped down today
in the aftermath of controversy.</i>

862
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,897
<i>He was granted the dignity
of early retirement.</i>

863
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,839
<i>But the humiliation of half a pension.</i>

864
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:47,476
<i>It was an ignominious end
to an illustrious career.</i>

865
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,547
<i>Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,
from what they could tell,</i>

866
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,614
<i>he ran into someone who wanted the money
more than he did.</i>

867
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:56,681
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen</i>

868
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,818
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

869
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,452
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

870
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,793
<i>The police commissioner
defended the rising tide of crime</i>

871
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,732
<i>as a statistical aberration tied
to growing unemployment</i>

872
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,792
<i>and the humidity of...</i>

873
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,710
<i>Enough time went by
and they called off the search.</i>

874
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,474
<i>They issued Helene a death certificate.</i>

875
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,599
<i>The frame and the casket
were donated by the funeral home,</i>

876
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:42,235
<i>but had to be returned
at the end of the afternoon.</i>

877
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,633
You know I love you, right?

878
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,144
Yeah.

879
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,177
I just wanna be alone for a while.

880
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,418
<i>I don't know if she blamed me
or if she blamed herself.</i>

881
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,928
<i>But when she didn't think I was home,</i>

882
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,491
<i>or if she thought I couldn't hear,</i>

883
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,231
<i>she would cry.</i>

884
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:27,977
<i>I couldn't stop running it over
and over and over in my mind,</i>

885
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,581
<i>the vague and distant suspicion</i>

886
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,623
<i>that we never understood
what happened that night,</i>

887
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,488
<i>what our role was.</i>

888
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,661
<i>Or maybe it was just that,
like the hundreds of other children</i>

889
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,564
<i>who disappear each year
and never return...</i>

890
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:51,137
<i>Amanda was even more haunting
for never being found.</i>

891
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:58,173
<i>What they did find
was another big story,</i>

892
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,547
<i>and I couldn't help
but find it strange.</i>

893
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:07,614
<i>Not two months later and not far away,
another child went missing.</i>

894
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,317
<i>...and community watch patrols
are being formed.</i>

895
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:13,485
<i>A bicycle left roadside.
A tire left spinning.</i>

896
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,394
<i>Late-breaking news on that story.</i>

897
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,763
<i>Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing</i>

898
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,927
<i>what this reporter believes
might be a sign.</i>

899
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,964
<i>Johnny Pietro was wearing the
medallion of St. Christopher,</i>

900
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,165
<i>patron saint of...</i>

901
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,300
<i>Johnny Pietro and his medallion.</i>

902
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,074
<i>What I didn't find strange
was this time,</i>

903
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,513
<i>no relatives came knocking on our door.</i>

904
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,854
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi.

905
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,390
- I need you to come on a ride with me.
- Where?

906
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,687
To Everett.

907
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,955
- What, no parties in Lynn?
- Funny.

908
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,260
- You got your toast with you, right?
- My what?

909
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,095
Your gun, dummy.

910
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,194
Yeah.

911
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,971
This ain't no strip-clubbing
in Lynn, Patrick.

912
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,149
I got something better for you, buddy.

913
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,691
You asked me to find
some people for you.

914
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,668
I think I found them.

915
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:28,795
What you getting me into?

916
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,864
You don't give a fuck about this
Corwin Earle dude no more?

917
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:35,206
Yo, 'cause the fat bitch
and the old dude are in there.

918
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,213
My man didn't know about the diddler.

919
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,908
Come in with me.
Watch my side.

920
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,146
We'll find out
if this motherfucker's in there.

921
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,944
You know what, Patrick?

922
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,648
If you don't wanna come in,
you don't have to come in.

923
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,248
If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.

924
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,586
Let's go.

925
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,614
Guess who?

926
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,559
- Jerome Miller?
- No, it's the coke fairy.

927
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,459
- Open up.
- I got the money right here.

928
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,795
Marmaduke, you think you're gonna
hand me money on a fucking porch?

929
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,630
Open the door.

930
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,101
Who's he?

931
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,900
He's your father.
Open the fucking door!

932
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,169
- Look out.
- Okay, man!

933
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,076
Chill! Chill!

934
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,547
What are you guys, starting a band?

935
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,786
No one's starting a band.

936
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,492
It's a taste.

937
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,762
Cocaine for the old man.

938
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,297
Fucking Christ.

939
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,637
Want me to change
a roll of quarters for you, too?

940
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,540
I told you to tell me when they got here!

941
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,276
They just got here.

942
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,319
- You already did some!
- It was a taste bag.

943
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,614
Sorry, love.

944
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,919
Here, count this fucking mess.

945
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,256
Where's the rest, man?

946
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:39,427
As soon as he's finished counting
that fucking mess you gave me.

947
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,374
- Mr. Miller, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

948
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,139
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

949
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,277
- Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.
- Hey, relax, handsome.

950
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,547
Excuse me!

951
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,181
Where the fuck you think you're going?

952
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,487
Mr. Miller, I'm warning you!

953
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,059
Stop!

954
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,199
Patrick, shoot this bitch.

955
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,665
You fat busted cunt.

956
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,706
You put a gun on me,
you better use it.

957
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,305
Just give us the fucking wizza!

958
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,377
You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?

959
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,355
Who's this guy?

960
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,023
Corwin!
Go back to your room!

961
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,032
It's not a party?

962
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,169
No, it's not a party.

963
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,471
How much money's there, Patrick?

964
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,066
Enough.

965
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,903
Want this?

966
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,454
What are you doing?
Pick up the fucking money.

967
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,863
At least two guns in the house.
Roberta's carrying hers.

968
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,198
- What else?
- Well, they're definitely high.

969
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,203
- On what?
- Cocaine.

970
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,239
Your friend tell you that, too?

971
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,797
SWAT'll be here in five minutes.

972
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,069
You're not gonna wait for them?

973
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,236
Did you or did you not tell me
you saw Corwin Earle

974
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,179
with the medallion of St. Christopher
around his fucking wrist?

975
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,579
I definitely saw Corwin Earle.

976
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,708
We're not waiting.

977
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,481
Stay here.
And don't fuck around, all right?

978
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,851
Good job.

979
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,300
Fuck.

980
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:39,709
An... An officer... Shots are fired!
An officer down... Shots...

981
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:40,874
Listen to me!

982
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,477
A police officer has been shot
at 33 German Road!

983
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,133
Get away from him!

984
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,795
It was an accident.

985
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,502
It was an accident.

986
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,807
Wait!

987
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,618
Hey.

988
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,525
You okay?

989
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,392
They told me what happened.

990
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,866
I'm proud of you.

991
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,704
That man killed a child.

992
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,373
He had no right to live.

993
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,680
- You're proud of me?
- Of course I am.

994
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,186
You did what you had to do.

995
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,985
Let's go home.

996
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,130
I gotta stay here awhile.

997
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,905
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

998
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:52,792
Thanks.

999
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,693
It was fucked up, right?

1000
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,403
They tell you anything about Nick?

1001
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,070
They said he could be okay.

1002
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,241
I don't know.

1003
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,144
They say how old that little boy was?

1004
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,784
Seven.

1005
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,080
Second grade.

1006
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:28,226
Should be proud of yourself.
Most guys would've stayed outside.

1007
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,628
I don't know.

1008
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,668
What don't you know?

1009
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:38,730
My priest says shame is God
telling you what you did was wrong.

1010
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,566
Fuck him.

1011
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,108
Murder's a sin.

1012
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,777
Depends on who you do it to.

1013
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,378
That's not how it works.
It is what it is.

1014
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,259
I planted evidence on a guy once,

1015
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,498
back in '95.

1016
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,975
We were paying $100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1017
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,740
We got a call from our pal,
Ray Likanski.

1018
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,077
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1019
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,242
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1020
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,445
up in Columbia Point.

1021
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,346
We go in, me and Nicky.

1022
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:31,723
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1023
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,857
So, it's a...
It's a stash house, right?

1024
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:37,831
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1025
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,597
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1026
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,661
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1027
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,072
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1028
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:50,669
Now, this place was a shithole,
mind you.

1029
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,375
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1030
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,613
But the kid's room, in the back,

1031
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,582
was spotless.

1032
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:05,617
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1033
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,558
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1034
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,089
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1035
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,692
There's no expression on his face,

1036
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,468
tears streaming down.

1037
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,677
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

1038
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:24,906
Christ.

1039
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,574
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1040
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,346
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1041
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:36,051
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1042
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,527
You're worried what's Catholic?

1043
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,723
I mean, kids forgive.

1044
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,965
Kids don't judge.

1045
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,368
Kids turn the other cheek.

1046
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,337
What do they get for it?

1047
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,606
So I went back out there,

1048
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,770
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1049
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:00,212
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1050
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,421
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1051
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,884
You gotta take a side.

1052
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:16,889
You molest a child,
you beat a child,

1053
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,657
you're not on my side.

1054
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,202
If you see me coming,
you better run,

1055
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,171
because I am gonna lay you
the fuck down!

1056
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,267
Easy.

1057
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,748
Don't feel easy.

1058
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,687
Is the kid better off
without his father?

1059
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,648
Yeah.

1060
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,586
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1061
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,186
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1062
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,762
It's a war, man.

1063
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,863
Are we winning?

1064
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,963
No.

1065
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,211
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1066
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,216
No.

1067
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,849
Does that make you right?

1068
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,450
Hmm?

1069
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,825
I don't know.

1070
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,364
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

1071
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,980
- Hey.
- Hi.

1072
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,786
How's Remy?

1073
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,046
He lied to me.

1074
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,255
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1075
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,159
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1076
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,290
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1077
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,558
He called him his "old pal."

1078
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,503
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1079
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,800
Patrick...

1080
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,865
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1081
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,104
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1082
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,672
Let it go.

1083
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,275
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1084
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,377
Amanda's dead.

1085
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,549
Let it go.

1086
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,964
<i>Babe.</i>

1087
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,093
<i>Nick died.</i>

1088
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,716
Left. Left.

1089
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,783
Mr. Kenzie.

1090
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,019
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

1091
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,939
Amen.

1092
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,444
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1093
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:01,111
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1094
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,350
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1095
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,019
You know, too much rum.

1096
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,789
Yeah, like what?

1097
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:12,265
Don't fuck with me, Patrick.
Not today.

1098
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,702
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1099
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:20,766
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1100
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,635
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1101
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,442
What if I don't?

1102
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,976
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1103
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:37,523
Had lunch with him last week.

1104
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,753
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1105
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,294
Excuse me.

1106
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,089
Hey, Dev.

1107
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:47,001
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1108
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,196
I can't complain.

1109
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,705
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1110
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,573
Not here.

1111
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:58,044
If it's like that,
then you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

1112
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,810
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1113
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,652
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1114
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,416
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1115
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,013
Why'd he leave?

1116
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,652
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

1117
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,787
Like what? What'd he do?

1118
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,331
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1119
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,491
Come on.

1120
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,262
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1121
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,927
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

1122
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,801
So, what happened?

1123
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,570
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1124
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,736
and puts in for a transfer.

1125
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,835
What, to Doyle?

1126
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:34,609
Doyle brought Remy from Louisiana,
back in '72.

1127
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:38,119
You don't think that Remy's dirty,
though, do you?

1128
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,051
What's "dirty"?

1129
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,922
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1130
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,462
Yeah. Why?

1131
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,090
Look, man.
<i>CSI</i> is killing us out here.

1132
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,693
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

1133
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,567
Certain people are workers.

1134
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,265
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1135
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,501
So they don't mind it.

1136
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,140
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1137
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,083
He lied to me.

1138
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,416
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1139
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,115
that's small enough not to matter.

1140
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,756
All right, look.

1141
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:26,290
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1142
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,394
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

1143
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,495
Yeah.

1144
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:33,541
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1145
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,076
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1146
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,338
So what?

1147
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,175
So my informant tells me,

1148
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,774
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1149
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,918
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1150
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,887
How'd he know that?

1151
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,854
Let me tell you something.

1152
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:51,984
You better think long and hard

1153
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,052
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1154
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,965
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1155
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,471
Thanks for the steak.

1156
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,869
All right.

1157
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,687
Hey.

1158
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,215
I got it.

1159
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,795
<i>We need to talk to you, Lionel.</i>

1160
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,296
<i>About what?</i>

1161
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:32,094
<i>About the acoustics in your apartment.</i>

1162
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,725
<i>What?</i>

1163
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,702
<i>Oh, we live in a three-decker,
too, Lionel.</i>

1164
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,636
<i>I got nothing to talk about.</i>

1165
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,800
<i>Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.</i>

1166
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,071
<i>Meet me at Murphy's Law.</i>

1167
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,021
<i>I don't meet him down Murphy's,</i>

1168
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,396
<i>he's gonna call the staties.</i>

1169
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,833
<i>He's putting a move on you.
Don't go down there.</i>

1170
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,994
<i>I can handle Patrick Kenzie.</i>

1171
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,766
- <i>This is an oath we took.</i>
- <i>I started this.</i>

1172
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,808
- <i>This has to be protected.</i>
- <i>I got things to protect, too.</i>

1173
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,967
- <i>Listen to me!</i>
- <i>All right, Remy.</i>

1174
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:17,409
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1175
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,811
- <i>Just trust me, all right?</i>
- <i>No! Trust me!</i>

1176
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:24,545
<i>Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!</i>

1177
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,313
<i>How long have you known Remy?</i>

1178
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,409
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1179
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,749
Met him through the investigation of Amanda.

1180
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,789
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1181
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,354
How long you known Remy?

1182
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,590
What is this?

1183
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,633
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1184
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,067
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1185
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,604
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1186
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,299
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1187
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,363
I'm not.

1188
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:23,206
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1189
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,836
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1190
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:27,404
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1191
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,417
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1192
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,715
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1193
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,618
And I know you ain't being
100% with me right now,

1194
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,623
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1195
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,159
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1196
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,128
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1197
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,425
I haven't been honest with you.

1198
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,469
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1199
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,403
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1200
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,701
The other guy cracked his skull.

1201
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,265
At some point, I must've said,
"I'll kill you."

1202
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:59,712
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1203
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,545
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1204
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:05,518
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1205
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,248
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1206
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,620
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1207
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,922
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1208
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,859
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1209
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,795
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1210
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,457
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1211
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:22,936
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1212
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,736
Why would I do that?

1213
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,835
I don't know, Lionel.
I really don't know.

1214
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,904
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1215
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,973
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1216
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,212
you're just like everybody else.

1217
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,186
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1218
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,847
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1219
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,050
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1220
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,491
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1221
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,688
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1222
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:51,061
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1223
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,429
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1224
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,558
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1225
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,262
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1226
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,565
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1227
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,765
Can I get some service?

1228
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,205
Yeah.

1229
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,381
What?

1230
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,113
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1231
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,678
Thank you.

1232
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,016
Just give me a second.

1233
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:52,225
Twenty-three years is something, right?

1234
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,238
Go.

1235
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,542
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1236
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,342
<i>I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.</i>

1237
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,512
<i>They didn't know I was there.</i>

1238
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:23,114
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1239
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,888
They started talking about
how they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1240
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:30,055
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1241
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:31,894
What's the monkey gonna do?

1242
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,297
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1243
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,531
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1244
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,071
So I called Remy and told him.

1245
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,801
There's another drug run up to Nashua.
Taking cocaine...

1246
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,536
And then what?

1247
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,440
We took her.

1248
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,015
<i>Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.</i>

1249
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,955
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1250
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,049
then we put her back. You know?

1251
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,185
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1252
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,785
My sister learns a lesson.

1253
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,894
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1254
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,935
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1255
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,560
They were gonna handle the cops.

1256
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,867
But Bea, she went nuts.

1257
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,500
<i>Started calling the papers.
Hired you.</i>

1258
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,908
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1259
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:20,971
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1260
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:25,179
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1261
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,915
<i>They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.</i>

1262
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:31,584
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1263
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,693
<i>Cheese figured out what was happening.</i>

1264
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:40,222
<i>Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.</i>

1265
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,235
<i>Panicking.</i>

1266
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,205
<i>And she just fell.
I mean, she just...</i>

1267
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,936
She fell in.

1268
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,038
She's gone.

1269
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:54,308
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1270
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,577
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1271
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:02,149
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1272
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,783
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1273
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,990
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1274
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:14,295
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1275
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,261
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1276
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,101
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1277
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,903
Two hours.

1278
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:25,340
Amanda literally roasted.

1279
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,104
She was three.

1280
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:35,151
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1281
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:40,855
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1282
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:46,066
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1283
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,700
Like a fucking pot roast.

1284
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,171
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1285
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:58,008
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

1286
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,947
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

1287
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:08,578
Everybody needs to shut up and stay calm.
On the floor. On the floor!

1288
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:10,317
- Hands on your head. Do it.
- Oh, my God.

1289
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,983
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

1290
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,995
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

1291
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,430
Or you can get wise,
it's up to you.

1292
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:22,966
What did you say?

1293
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,763
You're a talker, huh?

1294
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,398
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

1295
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,568
Don't antagonize him.
He's got a gun.

1296
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,977
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

1297
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:34,912
You should learn to keep your mouth shut.

1298
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,416
Shut the fuck up,
for Christ's sake.

1299
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,214
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

1300
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:40,652
Close your eyes.

1301
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:41,848
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

1302
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,255
Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant.

1303
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:47,055
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

1304
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,959
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
- Remy Bressant.

1305
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,588
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

1306
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:51,723
Amanda McCready was taken

1307
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:52,925
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

1308
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,492
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

1309
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:59,006
Please, I told him we took her for ransom.
I did it.

1310
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:00,938
Remy, please.

1311
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:02,642
Please.

1312
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:22,793
Are you all right?

1313
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:24,989
Stay with him.

1314
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,125
Drop your gun.

1315
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,560
Put it down!

1316
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,797
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1317
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,975
What did you do?

1318
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,344
Did you get her killed?

1319
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,920
Say yes.

1320
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,229
Say yes.

1321
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:07,634
Say yes!

1322
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:12,700
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1323
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,079
She was a child.

1324
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,125
I love children.

1325
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,559
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1326
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:18,496
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1327
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,971
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1328
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:26,707
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1329
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,976
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1330
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,711
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1331
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,013
Whoa, hold on.

1332
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,520
You charge people money as a detective.

1333
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:38,525
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1334
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:41,528
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1335
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,996
You're baffled. Right?

1336
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:49,993
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1337
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:53,302
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1338
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,236
You're a fresh prick.
You know that?

1339
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:57,539
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1340
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:58,704
put in my mailbox.

1341
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:01,805
And because I read a transcript of a call
that Cheese put into the station.

1342
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:02,975
A 911 call?

1343
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:06,110
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1344
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,484
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1345
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,614
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1346
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,487
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1347
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,459
and there was a call.

1348
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,462
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1349
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,328
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1350
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:22,994
So, did you hear a tape?

1351
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,670
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1352
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,971
Did you see a transcript?

1353
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,274
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1354
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:47,994
<i>Kids forgive.</i>

1355
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:49,552
What do they get for it?

1356
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:52,064
Amanda literally roasted.

1357
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,569
<i>You think I don't miss her.</i>

1358
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,077
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1359
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,273
I love children.

1360
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:16,018
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1361
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:20,021
Are you sure?

1362
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,127
No.

1363
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:27,832
Are you coming?

1364
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:29,766
No.

1365
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:44,145
<i>Doyle brought Remy from Louisiana
back in '72.</i>

1366
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,914
<i>Care to read the highlighted portion?</i>

1367
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,931
Taking a trip?

1368
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:02,765
Patrick Kenzie.

1369
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:07,170
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1370
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,869
Remy Bressant died last night.

1371
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:13,437
I was told. It's a shame.

1372
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:19,478
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1373
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,384
He was a good man.

1374
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:25,385
We don't know why people do
what they do.

1375
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:28,058
Everybody looks out his own window.

1376
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:30,456
And everyone's got their reasons.

1377
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,570
- Hey.
- Hi.

1378
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:43,940
- How are you?
- Good.

1379
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,070
<i>Nick! They're firing at me.</i>

1380
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:47,842
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1381
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:49,075
Remy!

1382
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,414
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1383
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,386
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1384
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:56,453
<i>Panicking.</i>

1385
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,357
<i>Amanda got scared.
She started running.</i>

1386
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:02,362
<i>She just fell.
I mean, she just fell in.</i>

1387
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:07,961
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen</i>

1388
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:09,468
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

1389
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:10,799
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

1390
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:13,999
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1391
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:15,235
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1392
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:16,537
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1393
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,634
<i>Don't go down there.</i>

1394
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,407
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1395
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,606
I got no problem doing the time.

1396
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,115
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1397
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:24,515
- All right.
- <i>I got things to protect, too.</i>

1398
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:26,849
<i>You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me</i>

1399
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,115
<i>and you're a danger to Amanda.</i>

1400
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:30,316
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

1401
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,450
I told him. Remy, please.

1402
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:38,860
So now you know.

1403
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,225
<i>My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.</i>

1404
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,396
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1405
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:46,667
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1406
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,868
<i>We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.</i>

1407
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,501
Bigot. Drug mule.

1408
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,638
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1409
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:56,376
- <i>What about the uncle?</i>
- <i>He can never tell anyone.</i>

1410
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:59,851
<i>Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.</i>

1411
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,913
<i>It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.</i>

1412
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:06,983
<i>Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.</i>

1413
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,823
<i>How many children
have we seen destroyed?</i>

1414
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,097
<i>Enough.</i>

1415
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:17,700
Does it make you feel better?

1416
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:21,939
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1417
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,341
That you took her to be saved.

1418
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:26,276
From her own mother?

1419
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,646
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1420
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:36,220
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1421
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,020
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1422
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:43,029
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1423
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:46,456
You turn around.

1424
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:50,732
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1425
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,697
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1426
01:36:56,977 --> 01:37:00,071
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

1427
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,911
Thought you would've done that by now.

1428
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,482
You know why you haven't?

1429
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:13,326
Because you think this might be
an irreparable mistake.

1430
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:18,058
Because deep inside you,
you know it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1431
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,191
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1432
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:24,169
"Is she better off here or better off there,"
you know the answer.

1433
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,229
And you always will.

1434
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:33,171
You... You could do a right thing here.

1435
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:34,976
A good thing.

1436
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,118
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1437
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,085
You walk away from it,

1438
01:37:40,154 --> 01:37:42,452
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1439
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,888
You may not regret it for a year,

1440
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:47,621
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1441
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:52,865
I'll be dead, you'll be old.
But she...

1442
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:58,132
She'll be dragging around a couple of tattered,
damaged children of her own,

1443
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,740
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1444
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:05,939
You know what?
Maybe that'll happen.

1445
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:10,177
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1446
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:14,715
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1447
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,517
is have to apologize
to a grown woman

1448
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,648
who comes to me and says,

1449
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,818
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1450
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,124
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1451
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:25,757
"And you did,
you found me with some strange family.

1452
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,631
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1453
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:31,569
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1454
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,503
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1455
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,805
"They stole me.

1456
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:44,612
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1457
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:47,882
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1458
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:51,147
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1459
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:53,693
but I'll never forgive myself.

1460
01:38:57,865 --> 01:39:02,598
I did what I did
for the sake of the child.

1461
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:07,867
All right. For me, too.

1462
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:15,846
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

1463
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:20,350
I'm begging you.

1464
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:27,483
You think about it.

1465
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:38,499
She's happy.

1466
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:41,640
What?

1467
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:44,906
She's happy here.
I saw her.

1468
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:49,014
Angie, don't do this.

1469
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:52,109
If you call the police,
they will send her back.

1470
01:39:52,186 --> 01:39:55,246
I'm not sending her anywhere.
Helene is her mother.

1471
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:57,881
She's better off here.

1472
01:39:57,958 --> 01:40:01,792
Why? Because he's got money,
and he makes her sandwiches?

1473
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:03,892
Because he loves her.

1474
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:07,331
- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

1475
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:09,335
Well, maybe she'll change.

1476
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:11,594
She won't change.
People don't change.

1477
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,264
Helene is arsenic.

1478
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,570
Angie, I know that this is hard.

1479
01:40:15,642 --> 01:40:17,974
Look at me, I know it's hard.

1480
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:22,345
But I need you to stand by me.
I need you to say,

1481
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:23,542
"We're gonna make the right decision,

1482
01:40:23,617 --> 01:40:24,845
"and we're gonna make everything okay."

1483
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:27,045
Everything will be okay.

1484
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,247
Because we're gonna leave her here,

1485
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,483
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

1486
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:33,685
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

1487
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:37,786
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

1488
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:40,231
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

1489
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,269
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

1490
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:47,563
Baby, I'm sorry.

1491
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:51,270
But you can't ask me to do 
something that I can't do.

1492
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:57,212
And you can't ask me to live with it.

1493
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:02,722
Patrick, for me. Please?

1494
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:12,159
I will hate you for doing this,
and I don't want to.

- Helene, what does it feel like

1502
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:07,944
- to have your daughter with you now?
- How do you feel?

1503
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:09,777
Helene, how you feeling right now?
How you feeling...

1504
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,547
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

1505
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,918
Amanda, how do you feel
to see your mom?

1506
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:17,616
Hey, Amanda.

1507
01:43:18,759 --> 01:43:19,783
Helene, how you feeling?

1508
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,794
- Tell us how it feels.
- Tell us what you're thinking right now.

1509
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:22,886
You must be so excited.
Give us your feelings.

1510
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:23,987
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh, my.

1511
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:26,658
Helene, the whole world wants to know
what you're feeling right now.

1512
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,431
How are you, sweetheart?

1513
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:31,562
Oh, my heart is brimming.

1514
01:43:31,638 --> 01:43:38,043
And just God bless to everyone
and thank you to all...

1515
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:41,239
To all the policemen and the firemen,

1516
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:44,011
I feel like 9/11 right now.

1517
01:43:44,084 --> 01:43:47,247
<i>Oh, I swear to God, I mean, just...</i>

1518
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:49,688
<i>Do you have any comments
for parents out there</i>

1519
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,155
<i>that might be in a similar situation?</i>

1520
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,853
<i>Oh, just never let your kids
out of your sight.</i>

1521
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:55,622
<i>Don't trust them to no one.</i>

1522
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:58,824
<i>And just keep them in your arms,</i>

1523
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:02,027
<i>as much as they're in your heart,
you keep them in your arms.</i>

1524
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:04,866
<i>How about that?
A great end to that story.</i>

1525
01:44:04,938 --> 01:44:07,668
- <i>Good news for everybody.</i>
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

1526
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:35,695
- Sorry, I had to get some stuff.
- It's all right.

1527
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:41,373
You wanna talk for a minute?

1528
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,943
There's nothing to say.

1529
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:53,269
Sorry for being rude,
I gotta be out of here in, like, two minutes.

1530
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,110
Do your thing.

1531
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,622
- Think he'll like me?
- Who?

1532
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:08,024
My date.

1533
01:46:08,095 --> 01:46:11,064
Oh, how could he not?

1534
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:13,326
You're sweet.

1535
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,595
He seen me on my <i>American Victim.</i>

1536
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:18,661
He wrote me letters,
I was like, "Whatever."

1537
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:22,698
But then he seen my <i>Meredith Vieira,</i>
he drove down here from Providence.

1538
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:25,745
I'm like, "That's romantic." Right?

1539
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:27,279
How's your girlfriend?

1540
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:29,338
She's all right,
she's at the North Shore with her sister.

1541
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:32,146
Oh, hope she got better family
than I do, right?

1542
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,449
Those dirty motherfuckers.

1543
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:41,317
She don't get smart,
I'll take you out.

1544
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,964
- How's Bea?
- Fuck Bea.

1545
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,159
I banned her from the apartment.

1546
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:52,262
She sold her unit,
moved out fancy-pants Melrose.

1547
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:55,433
Don't think she don't hate you
for Lionel going to jail, neither.

1548
01:46:55,509 --> 01:46:57,477
Well, that's probably
why she never paid my bill.

1549
01:46:57,544 --> 01:46:59,842
You should fucking sue.

1550
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,040
How about you, Helene?

1551
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,811
You hate me?

1552
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:06,580
Fuck no.

1553
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:10,714
Brother or not, he took my kid.
Fuck Lionel. She could have been hurt.

1554
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:13,817
- What about Amanda?
- What about Amanda?

1555
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:18,720
- Who's gonna watch her?
- Dottie.

1556
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:21,359
Yeah, does Dottie know that?

1557
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:24,165
- She will in five minutes.
- Great.

1558
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:28,674
Fuck, I'm gonna be late, too.
Unless you don't mind sitting for her.

1559
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:34,376
- Yeah, sure.
- For real?

1560
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,475
- Yeah, that's fine.
- She likes you.

1561
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:44,082
Bye, sweetheart.

1562
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:46,387
You're a godsend, Patrick.

1563
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:49,685
Bye.

1564
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:09,578
Is that Mirabelle?

1565
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:12,751
Annabelle.

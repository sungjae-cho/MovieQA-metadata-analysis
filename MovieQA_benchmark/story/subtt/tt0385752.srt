1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,494
There are many universes
and many earths...

2
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,529
parallel to each other.

3
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:12,300
Worlds like yours...

4
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,802
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

5
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:23,145
and worlds like mine...

6
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:25,486
where they walk beside us...

7
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:29,323
as animal spirits
we call damons.

8
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,927
Are we going to see the child?

9
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,995
I should think so.

10
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:39,269
So many worlds...

11
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:42,535
but connecting them all is Dust.

12
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:45,907
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

13
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:48,970
the Gyptians of the water...

14
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,505
and the bears of the ice.

15
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:57,377
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

16
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:01,455
a golden compass...

17
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:04,428
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

18
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:10,260
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

19
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,168
destroyed these devices...

20
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:17,470
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

21
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,876
One compass remains, however...

22
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,676
and only one who can read it.

23
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:25,414
You'll never get me!

24
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,878
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

25
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,654
Come on!

26
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,021
Gonna get you!

27
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,993
I'll get you first!

28
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,688
Billy!

29
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,697
You come back here!

30
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,130
Leave me alone!

31
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,463
Faster, faster!

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,229
We're gonna get you!

33
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,998
Run, Roger!

34
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:49,730
You are now Gobbled!

35
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,403
You've gotta do whatever I say!

36
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:57,181
Go, Roger! Run!

37
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,385
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

38
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,252
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

39
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,217
Come on. Run!

40
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:14,026
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

41
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,260
Faster!

42
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,532
Hurry up!

43
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,873
Stop!

44
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,869
If you value your lives,
come no further.

45
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:31,108
Why?

46
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,912
We Gobbled him fair and square.

47
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,419
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

48
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,353
Don't you know what this gate is?

49
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,686
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

50
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:40,713
So?

51
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:43,226
There's a curse on this gate.

52
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,923
You Gyptians ought to know that.

53
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,124
Crossin' this gate...

54
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,725
is worse than touching
someone's damon...

55
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,098
with your bare hands.

56
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:53,468
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

57
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:55,302
'Cause we live 'ere.

58
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,433
We got safe passage, see?

59
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,000
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

60
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:01,705
on this gate in the first place.

61
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,077
What mother?

62
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,809
I heard you was an orphink...

63
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,046
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

64
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,610
Come 'ere and say that.

65
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,320
Don't, Billy.

66
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,123
You should listen to your mate.

67
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,790
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

68
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:21,856
They got this poison gown, right...

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,800
and it burns you alive!

70
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,736
Rubbish. Hand him over.

71
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,407
It ain't rubbish.
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

72
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,103
You can have Roger.

73
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,669
As long as you try it on.

74
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:38,614
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

75
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,912
Or else...

76
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,376
War.

77
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,288
Billy, don't!

78
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,486
See ya later, then.

79
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:50,426
OK.

80
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,921
Well done, Billy!

81
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,990
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

82
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,501
Of course not.

83
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:59,298
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

84
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,271
He'll never try it on anyway.

85
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,179
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

86
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,809
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

87
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,374
I'm sure he will.

88
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:50,052
I wish you'd listen
to me once in a while.

89
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,988
Stop being such a coward.

90
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,423
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

91
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,428
In the Retiring Room already.

92
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,233
Come on, quick.

93
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,771
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

94
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:17,044
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

95
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:19,845
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

96
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,120
Oh, Lyra.

97
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:29,752
You're gonna get us caught.

98
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:36,294
Oh, no! I told you!

99
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,998
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,033
And as master of Jordan,
you must force him...

101
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,942
to abandon his plan.

102
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,413
They're talking about Uncle Asriel.

103
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,076
I speak for the Magisterium.

104
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:56,484
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

105
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:59,319
My dear fellow...

106
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:02,656
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

107
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,160
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

108
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:10,190
one way or another.

109
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,327
That may be.

110
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,271
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

111
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:20,333
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

112
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,346
And that's my final word
on the matter.

113
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:25,339
Now, if you'll excuse me...

114
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:32,489
I shall call the Council to order.

115
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:40,496
I guess we lost that bet.

116
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,999
Hush, Pan.

117
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:10,584
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

118
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:11,617
Lyra.

119
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:16,827
- The professor... a really hard time.
- Oh, no.

120
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,663
It's Stelmaria.

121
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:27,405
The master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

122
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,413
He remembered
you were partial to it.

123
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,272
Thank you.

124
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,065
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

125
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,230
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

126
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:56,502
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

127
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,509
pour some powder into the wine.

128
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,405
Go back in there.

129
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,007
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

130
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,984
Go on.

131
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:19,294
Ah, Lord Asriel.

132
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,820
This is a rare pleasure.

133
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:26,064
May I introduce
Fra Pavel of the Magisterium?

134
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:31,803
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

135
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,470
That's what the smell is.

136
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,979
Master, gentlemen,
I shall get straight to the point.

137
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,640
Hunt, the lights.

138
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:43,283
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North Pole...

139
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,290
in Svalbard...

140
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,884
kingdom of the ice bears.

141
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,828
Ice bears, Pan.

142
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:56,960
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down?

143
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,061
No, that's coming down from the sky,
but that's not light.

144
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:05,508
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

145
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:12,905
- What's Dust?
- I don't know.

146
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,440
It can't be the normal sort.

147
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,851
They've got plenty of that here.

148
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,719
<i>Mirabile dictu,</i> gentlemen.

149
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:22,021
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

150
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,654
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

151
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:29,132
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

152
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,033
No, it is no aberration.

153
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:36,671
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

154
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:41,303
Dust is flowing into this man,
through his damon...

155
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,041
from a city in another world.

156
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:48,040
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

157
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:51,282
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

158
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:52,346
Until now.

159
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,121
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

160
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,856
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

161
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,488
Some where men have no damons.

162
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:02,226
Some where damons have no men.

163
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,860
People without damons.
That's impossible.

164
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,564
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

165
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,501
and no Authority.

166
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,001
That is heresy.

167
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,910
That...

168
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,516
is the truth.

169
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,044
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

170
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:27,251
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

171
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,759
With a sufficient source
of energy and...

172
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:31,921
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

173
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:35,362
I can effect a crossing.

174
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,368
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

175
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:47,103
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

176
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:52,275
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

177
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:55,285
You're not very grateful, are you?

178
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,048
I've just saved your life.

179
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,054
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

180
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:03,754
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

181
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,694
Well, I don't see why.

182
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,755
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

183
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,527
A miscreant and a liar.

184
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:14,731
What will the Magisterium
do to you now?

185
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,400
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

186
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,170
What does that mean?

187
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,474
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

188
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,747
Did you get the money you needed?

189
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:26,215
Are you going North again?

190
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,980
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

191
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,954
I'm leaving immediately.

192
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,478
Can I come with you?

193
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:34,354
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

194
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,053
and learn about Dust
and everything.

195
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,220
What do you know about Dust?

196
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,786
- Nothing.
- Good.

197
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,161
Keep it that way.

198
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,462
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

199
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,298
But you don't do what you're told.

200
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,361
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

201
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,236
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

202
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,743
Hush, Pan.

203
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,906
I see your damon
still changes shape.

204
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,812
Hasn't settled yet.

205
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,339
Yeah.

206
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,977
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

207
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,956
Why kids' damons
can change shape...

208
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:08,856
but grown-ups' damons can't.

209
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,955
Lyra.

210
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:14,089
Dust is none of your business.

211
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,467
Now you try and behave.

212
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:36,817
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me
to the North next time he goes. He swore it.

213
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:38,412
'Cause he needs my help, see.

214
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,787
What for?

215
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,656
Fightin', probably.

216
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,285
Or spying.

217
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:46,296
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

218
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,264
Like now, for instance.

219
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,233
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers...

220
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,256
Come on!

221
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:53,702
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

222
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,171
Billy Costa told me.

223
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:58,334
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

224
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,343
Course they don't.

225
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,577
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

226
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:04,706
No, I ain't.

227
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:11,052
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

228
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:13,352
They go after the poor kids, see.

229
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,326
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

230
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,955
Roger, I promise...

231
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:22,591
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

232
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:23,895
I'd come and rescue you.

233
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,727
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

234
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:31,538
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

235
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,736
- You're a lady.
- Says who?

236
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,078
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

237
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:39,912
Nobody can make me a lady.

238
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,784
Not the master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

239
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:47,120
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

240
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,058
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

241
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:50,788
Lyra!

242
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,195
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

243
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:55,789
The Master wants you at high table!

244
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:01,370
It was really...
really quite surprising.

245
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:03,600
The state of your knees.

246
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,768
And your hair.

247
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,799
Well...

248
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:09,610
It's not surprising.

249
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,445
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

250
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,212
It's dirty work.

251
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:17,652
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

252
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,486
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

253
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,498
Lyra, my dear...

254
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:37,132
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

255
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:41,110
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

256
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:45,479
but sometimes you must do
what others think... best.

257
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,345
But I disagree, Master.

258
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,909
Mrs. Coulter.

259
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:54,990
When I was a young woman...

260
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:58,085
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

261
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,289
except, of course, my damon...

262
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:03,357
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

263
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,330
Sit down, gentlemen.

264
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,933
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

265
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,309
But she shut up the Master, all right.

266
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:21,979
Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

267
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,487
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

268
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,785
a friend of the college.

269
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,357
Lovely to meet you.

270
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:34,228
Lovely to meet you too.

271
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:37,257
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

272
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:40,166
It was at the Royal Arctic Institute.

273
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,738
We discussed
the political structure...

274
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:45,139
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

275
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,908
You've seen an ice bear?

276
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,940
As a matter of fact...

277
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,642
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

278
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,207
Ragnar Sturlusson.

279
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,845
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't...

280
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:01,883
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a damon of his own.

281
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:07,029
Bears don't have them, you see,
and Ragnar...

282
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:09,555
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

283
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,398
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

284
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:16,030
But you mustn't repeat that.

285
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,768
Oh, I'd never.

286
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:23,106
You know, I feel I can trust you.

287
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:30,285
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

288
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:32,289
I'm going to need an assistant.

289
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,258
Me?

290
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,283
- Go to the North?
- North?

291
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,852
It's cold up there.

292
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:41,364
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

293
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,094
Master, I was wondering...

294
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:48,627
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

295
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,332
Only for a while, of course.

296
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,636
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

297
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,204
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

298
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:02,978
Let me deal with Asriel.

299
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,421
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

300
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,432
Very well.

301
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:21,894
Yeah...

302
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,265
Yeah...

303
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:33,980
A bet's a bet...

304
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,748
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

305
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,153
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

306
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,747
Which one's her room?

307
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,315
What are you gonna do?

308
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,190
Give her a fright, that's all.

309
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:46,958
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

310
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:49,989
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

311
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:52,161
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

312
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,782
It's all clear.

313
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,946
Billy! Billy!

314
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:26,534
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

315
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,734
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

316
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:35,102
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

317
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:38,979
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

318
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:43,180
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

319
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,987
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

320
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,858
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

321
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,524
What progress has she made?

322
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:57,659
The doctors at Bolvangar...

323
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,829
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

324
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:04,830
against the effects of Dust.

325
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,072
I am relieved to hear that.

326
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:12,310
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

327
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,079
before their damons settle...

328
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,317
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

329
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:23,122
one that will never question
our authority again.

330
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,262
We owe it to the young...

331
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,127
do we not?

332
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,567
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

333
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,371
now she'll be drawn into it.

334
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,437
We've failed her.

335
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:48,941
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

336
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,510
And she's still only a child.

337
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,385
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

338
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:54,287
She is.

339
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:57,885
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

340
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,228
How can you know such things?

341
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,927
The witches.

342
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,471
Thank you. Could you...

343
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,409
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

344
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,969
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

345
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,982
Why yes, Master.

346
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,349
It's for you, Lyra.

347
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:28,858
What is this?

348
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:30,826
An alethiometer.

349
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:34,991
Also known as a golden compass.

350
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,865
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

351
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:45,341
And now I'm giving it to you.

352
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,276
I feel you are meant to have it.

353
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:50,576
What's it for?

354
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:55,511
It tells the truth.

355
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:57,918
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

356
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,924
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

357
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,051
and, uh, Authorities.

358
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:06,859
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

359
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:12,098
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

360
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:13,432
It is of the utmost importance...

361
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,870
that Mrs. Coulter
does not know that you have it.

362
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:16,930
Do you understand me?

363
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:18,965
Of the utmost importance.

364
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,913
Lyra. Are you ready?

365
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:30,252
There's someone missing.

366
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:32,414
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

367
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:36,051
Roger? Who's Roger?

368
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,653
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

369
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,558
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

370
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:45,895
Why don't you write him a letter?

371
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,131
You can tell him
all about the journey, and...

372
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:49,798
you can even send him a photogram.

373
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,966
- Madam.
- What do you think?

374
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:53,135
Yeah. I suppose.

375
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,335
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

376
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,079
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

377
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,918
That is the Magisterial seat, Lyra.

378
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:42,416
What's the Magisterium for?

379
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:45,622
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

380
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:49,029
The Magisterium
is what people need.

381
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,131
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

382
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:58,164
But... you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

383
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,370
That's right. Clever girl.

384
00:24:03,413 --> 00:24:06,974
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

385
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,484
and some people don't.

386
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,245
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

387
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:12,550
in a mean, petty way...

388
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,853
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

389
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:17,359
to keep them out of danger.

390
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:20,159
Sugar?

391
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:20,983
Look, Pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

392
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,719
But what do they all mean?

393
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,590
Don't know.

394
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:30,592
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols...

395
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,465
Lady...

396
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:34,333
lightning bolt...

397
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:36,498
and the baby.

398
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,839
Then it goes back
and does it again. See?

399
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:42,572
What do you think
makes the needle move?

400
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:45,979
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

401
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,645
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

402
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:57,326
All washed and ready for bed?

403
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,092
We have a busy few weeks.

404
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:22,210
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

405
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:24,777
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

406
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:26,686
I shall never understand.

407
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:29,021
I'll only be a moment, darling.

408
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,549
Official business.

409
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,891
What?

410
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:39,197
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

411
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:41,796
She's never taking us to the North.

412
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:43,430
We're like prisoners in this house.

413
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,533
All these rules, and rooms
that we aren't allowed into.

414
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:53,014
Perhaps we shouldn't have
invited Professor Docker.

415
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,880
He's such a bore, isn't he?

416
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:56,886
And he had sauce in his beard.

417
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,087
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

418
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,625
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

419
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:09,859
Oh, I know about particles.

420
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,060
Like Dust.

421
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:13,360
That's a particle, isn't it?

422
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,005
Dust?

423
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,166
I mean the Dust from space.

424
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,438
That Dust, like in the North.

425
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:22,342
Where did you hear about that?

426
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:26,173
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

427
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,450
A wise person knows, Lyra...

428
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,685
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

429
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:39,718
subjects that you...
well, you never speak about.

430
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:43,292
- But I didn't...
- Yes.

431
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,234
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

432
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,032
Just don't mention it again.

433
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:51,540
Now, darling...

434
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,703
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

435
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,178
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

436
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,414
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

437
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:03,942
I do love it.

438
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,211
But I do not.

439
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,588
Put it away.

440
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,759
Lyra, put it away now.

441
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:19,393
I don't want to.

442
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,599
If you do not obey me...

443
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,334
we will have an argument
which I will win.

444
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:26,274
Now put it away at once.

445
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,005
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

446
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:31,013
in your own home.

447
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:32,912
Jordan is my home.

448
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,014
No! Lyra!

449
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:40,812
Don't. Please, it hurts!

450
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,119
Lyra!

451
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,285
Lyra!

452
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,817
Will you do as I tell you?

453
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,124
I promise.

454
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,226
Lyra.

455
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:56,501
Thank you.

456
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:00,672
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your damon.

457
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,541
He's much too wild.

458
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,809
Now...

459
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,941
Kiss me.

460
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:11,380
I hate her!

461
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:14,822
I hate them!

462
00:29:14,858 --> 00:29:16,223
And look.

463
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,056
They're spying on us.

464
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,963
What do they want with us?

465
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,970
Why are we here?

466
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:29,528
Did you see her damon?

467
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:32,166
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

468
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,574
And what does she keep
in that room?

469
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:36,272
Let's go find out.

470
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:54,589
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

471
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:02,800
Over here.

472
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:13,705
Look.

473
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:21,422
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

474
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,789
No, it isn't.

475
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,521
Look at it.

476
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,431
"Inter... cision."

477
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:34,395
What does it mean, Pan?

478
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,426
And that...

479
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:38,908
"General... Oblation Board."

480
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,536
G... O... B.

481
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,013
Gobblers.

482
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:48,176
From the letters, G... O... B.

483
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:54,485
"Workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa!"

484
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:55,991
Billy and Roger!

485
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:01,586
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

486
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,155
Lyra, where are you?

487
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,826
We have to get out of here.

488
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:09,100
Lyr...

489
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,470
Lyra.

490
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:11,974
What have you been doing?

491
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:13,134
Nothing.

492
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,973
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

493
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,980
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

494
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:23,419
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

495
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:25,614
Where is he? I don't see him.

496
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:38,027
Lyra, this way!

497
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,594
Quick, Lyra!

498
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:46,866
Lyra!

499
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:56,814
What are we gonna do, Pan?

500
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,822
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

501
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,721
We've got
to save ourselves first!

502
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:02,952
Where are we gonna go?

503
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:04,857
Anywhere's better than here.

504
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:08,857
Come on! This way!

505
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,835
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

506
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,664
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

507
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:19,834
Gobblers!

508
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,776
You, cover the canal.

509
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:25,908
She's gotta be here somewhere.

510
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,191
Wait up, Johnny!

511
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:38,057
Put your back into it!

512
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,220
We'll need two more of them.

513
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:44,192
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

514
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:47,726
Hurry!

515
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,841
Get her!

516
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,104
Get it!

517
00:32:57,747 --> 00:32:59,271
Pan!

518
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:01,010
Hurry, Lyra!

519
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:09,816
Lyra!

520
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,048
Hold her!

521
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:15,029
No!

522
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:30,844
- Lyra!
- Pan.

523
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,871
Gyptians.

524
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:39,282
Don't fret none, Lyra.

525
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:41,751
Come 'ere.

526
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,184
You're safe with us.

527
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,527
You're Ma Costa.

528
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:49,622
Billy's mum.

529
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,633
But what are you doing here?

530
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:54,000
We been in your shadow...

531
00:33:54,037 --> 00:33:57,302
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

532
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,831
And a good thing too.

533
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:01,901
You best come with us.

534
00:34:03,112 --> 00:34:03,279
Hurry, lads.

535
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,337
Hurry, lads.

536
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,938
Where are we going?

537
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:08,712
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

538
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,981
Come on, get yourself aboard.

539
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,463
Not very friendly, are they?

540
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,299
What are you lookin' at?

541
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,804
So now all the clans are here...

542
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:11,575
we'll head North on the next tide.

543
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,509
Ma Costa.

544
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:18,516
This is the child?

545
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:22,923
It's all right.

546
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,194
How do you do, Lord Faa?

547
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:33,564
Hello, Lyra.

548
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:36,868
You come and sit by my side.

549
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:37,964
Right, boys, get your heads up!

550
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:41,303
This is Farder Coram.

551
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,335
Head for the ice lake!

552
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:47,338
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

553
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:50,841
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

554
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,051
Lord Faa...

555
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,556
I want to thank you.

556
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,321
For keeping watch on me and all.

557
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,659
But why did you do it?

558
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:03,961
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

559
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,403
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

560
00:36:08,438 --> 00:36:12,272
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

561
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:15,469
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

562
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:22,149
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

563
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:25,484
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

564
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:28,046
And she did.

565
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:31,458
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

566
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,829
Lyra.

567
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:37,128
We know your tale
all the way up until...

568
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,135
you run away
and the Costas found you.

569
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:43,661
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

570
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:46,607
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

571
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:49,272
Don't show it to them.

572
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,714
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

573
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:59,816
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

574
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:06,926
It's an alethiometer.

575
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,988
It's a truth measurer.

576
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,431
A golden compass.

577
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:16,097
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

578
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,041
You got three hands
you can control.

579
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:23,534
By pointing at three symbols...

580
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,208
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

581
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:30,879
Once you got your question framed...

582
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,151
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

583
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,124
that give you the answer.

584
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,719
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

585
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,285
Not by me.

586
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,160
The art was jealously guarded.

587
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:43,187
Can I try?

588
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:47,491
All right.

589
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:49,027
What are you doing, Lyra?

590
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:50,368
You don't know how to read it.

591
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,101
Hush, Pan.

592
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,241
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

593
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:02,911
And... the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

594
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:04,817
And...

595
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:06,321
the baby...

596
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,880
that means kids.

597
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:10,722
One thing I do know, Lyra...

598
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,957
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

599
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:17,693
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

600
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:20,327
Like it was something alive.

601
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,790
It's an hourglass.

602
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:56,032
But it came round to it
on the second time.

603
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:59,473
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

604
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:03,578
On top of the hourglass...

605
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:05,342
there's a skull.

606
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:14,788
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

607
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:27,459
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

608
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:29,334
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

609
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:33,933
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

610
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:35,807
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

611
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:38,143
You're here to help us.

612
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,775
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

613
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,412
That's what you should write.

614
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:47,013
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

615
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:50,656
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

616
00:39:51,694 --> 00:39:54,424
Billy, just write the letter.

617
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:58,524
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

618
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,229
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

619
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:13,510
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

620
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:17,041
For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

621
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:19,884
How...? Ah, yes. The Master.

622
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:24,352
Can she read it?

623
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:27,089
Of course not.

624
00:40:27,129 --> 00:40:29,063
Mrs. Coulter...

625
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:31,794
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

626
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,394
You think she is that child?

627
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:36,360
Lmpossible.

628
00:40:37,606 --> 00:40:39,904
Nonetheless, she must be found.

629
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:50,217
They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

630
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:25,011
Svalbard.

631
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:28,286
Kingdom of the ice bears.

632
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:34,421
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

633
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,930
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

634
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:39,662
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the Pole to hunt us down.

635
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:49,430
Let's not be so hasty.

636
00:42:49,472 --> 00:42:50,700
Why don't we just...

637
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,707
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

638
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:24,535
Don't worry, Lyra.

639
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:26,234
We'll find Roger.

640
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:00,899
I'm all right.

641
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:04,443
What is it?

642
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,175
It's a spy-fly.

643
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:07,682
Is it dangerous?

644
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,781
The one that got away is.

645
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,152
If you was to crack it open...

646
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:16,749
you'd find no living thing in there.

647
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,260
No animal or insect, at any rate.

648
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,229
There's a clockwork...

649
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:25,131
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

650
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:27,931
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

651
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:31,901
We'll keep him safe in here.

652
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:35,733
What was it after?

653
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:37,746
- You, Lyra.
- Why me?

654
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,577
Why are they doing this?

655
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:41,378
We don't know.

656
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,214
But we Gyptians...

657
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:46,983
have been hurt worse than most
by these Gobblers...

658
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:49,923
these child-thieves.

659
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:52,450
They're takin' those children up North...

660
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:55,622
the land of cold and dark...

661
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:59,293
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

662
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:02,099
but we have heard terrible rumor.

663
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,970
Our aim...

664
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:09,739
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

665
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:13,111
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

666
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:20,449
But if they have been harmed...

667
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:22,548
I promise you...

668
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,458
if they have been harmed...

669
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:29,988
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

670
00:45:30,032 --> 00:45:31,795
for these Gobblers.

671
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,803
And when the time comes to punish...

672
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:40,969
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

673
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,034
Yes!

674
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:45,535
We will strike the strength
out of them.

675
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:50,348
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

676
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:51,444
Yes!

677
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,138
Are you getting scared, Pan?

678
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:11,969
Scared?

679
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:13,497
A little.

680
00:46:14,843 --> 00:46:17,539
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

681
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,742
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

682
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:24,344
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

683
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:26,217
Go on, I mean.

684
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:36,094
Who are you?

685
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,464
My name is Serafina Pekkala...

686
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:42,299
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

687
00:46:42,337 --> 00:46:43,668
A witch?

688
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:45,697
Where's your damon?

689
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:48,767
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

690
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:52,342
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

691
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:54,349
The one with a symbol reader?

692
00:46:59,455 --> 00:47:01,286
Let me see you read it.

693
00:47:01,323 --> 00:47:03,518
I want to know
if you can tell me...

694
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,892
which of the men
on this ship was once...

695
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:08,362
my lover.

696
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,589
Farder Coram?

697
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:40,856
But...

698
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:43,490
He was young and beautiful once.

699
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:46,899
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

700
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:48,766
Farder Coram wishes to know...

701
00:47:48,804 --> 00:47:51,272
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

702
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:53,934
It is a place...

703
00:47:53,976 --> 00:47:56,171
they call Bolvangar.

704
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:57,940
The place of fear.

705
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,746
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf damons guards it.

706
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:03,911
Birds do not fly above.

707
00:48:03,952 --> 00:48:05,419
Animals have fled.

708
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:08,082
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

709
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:13,618
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

710
00:48:13,662 --> 00:48:16,688
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

711
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:18,996
You will need all your courage.

712
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:23,766
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

713
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:26,602
child.

714
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:08,973
Who's going to help us?

715
00:49:09,017 --> 00:49:11,042
Can you see anything?

716
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:13,611
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

717
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:28,529
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

718
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:32,701
It's just a toy.

719
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:37,034
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

720
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:42,849
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

721
00:49:42,885 --> 00:49:47,083
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

722
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,920
I do beg pardon.

723
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,619
Lee Scoresby.

724
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,252
And this old gal is Hester.

725
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,064
I'm Lyra. And this is Pan.

726
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:58,430
Pantalaimon.

727
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:01,129
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

728
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:05,696
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.
Am I right?

729
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,868
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

730
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,275
Don't answer that.

731
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:12,803
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?

732
00:50:12,848 --> 00:50:16,375
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

733
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:18,716
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

734
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,221
Me too.

735
00:50:20,255 --> 00:50:22,485
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

736
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:26,858
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

737
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,397
You're an aeronaut!

738
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:32,833
Can I go up in your ship?

739
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,063
I'd be honored.

740
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:37,094
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

741
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:40,841
Miss Lyra...

742
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,071
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

743
00:50:44,112 --> 00:50:46,706
though you ain't asked for none.

744
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:49,512
If I was on the kinda... scout...

745
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:52,076
that I reckon you're on...

746
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,385
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

747
00:50:55,424 --> 00:50:57,016
and an armoured bear.

748
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:59,186
An armoured bear?

749
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:01,718
There's one in town.

750
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:04,095
Iorek Byrnison's his name.

751
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:07,659
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's Bar.

752
00:51:07,703 --> 00:51:10,433
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

753
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,404
Not that you're lookin' for that.

754
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:28,515
Iorek Byrnison? Lorek Byrnison?

755
00:51:28,557 --> 00:51:31,924
May I speak to you?

756
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,121
What?

757
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:37,495
We want to offer you employment.

758
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:41,798
I am employed, by the townspeople.

759
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:44,362
I mend broken machinery.

760
00:51:44,406 --> 00:51:47,398
I lift heavy objects.

761
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:50,900
What kind of work is that
for a Panserbjorn?

762
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:54,676
Paid work!

763
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:17,966
Is that what they pay you?

764
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,337
Whisky?

765
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,273
Lorek Byrnison...

766
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,507
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

767
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:29,216
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

768
00:52:30,419 --> 00:52:32,683
But now I'm just disappointed.

769
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:35,519
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

770
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,684
Why are you
wasting your time here...

771
00:52:38,727 --> 00:52:40,217
drinking whisky?

772
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,023
I stay because
the people of this town...

773
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,626
gave me spirits...

774
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:50,433
and let me drink till I was asleep.

775
00:52:50,472 --> 00:52:53,305
Then they took my armour away.

776
00:52:53,341 --> 00:52:56,538
And without my armour,
I cannot go to war.

777
00:52:56,578 --> 00:53:00,514
And I am an armoured bear.

778
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:03,985
War is the sea I swim in...

779
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:06,749
the air I breathe.

780
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:10,588
Without my armour, I am nothing.

781
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:14,584
But... can't you make new armour?

782
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:17,689
I thought bears were good at that.

783
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:19,597
There's all this metal around.

784
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,602
Worthless!

785
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,465
My armour is made of sky iron...

786
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:30,501
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

787
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:33,981
A bear's armour is his soul...

788
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:37,007
as your damon is your soul.

789
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,610
Irreplaceable.

790
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:42,214
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

791
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:47,292
It must have been terrible
to lose your armour.

792
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:50,264
It was no less than I deserved.

793
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,298
I am an exile.

794
00:53:53,335 --> 00:53:58,329
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

795
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,706
I fought another bear
in single combat...

796
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:04,439
and was defeated.

797
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:15,322
- Come, child.
- But Farder Coram...

798
00:54:15,357 --> 00:54:17,450
We can't involve ourselves.

799
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:49,257
He was a prince.

800
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:54,484
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

801
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,724
He lost everything.

802
00:54:56,765 --> 00:54:59,563
Oh, Pan, they've really hurt him.

803
00:55:02,938 --> 00:55:06,567
Iorek Byrnison? Lorek Byrnison.

804
00:55:07,943 --> 00:55:11,037
- Be careful.
- I know where your armour is.

805
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,846
They tricked you out of it.

806
00:55:15,884 --> 00:55:17,852
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

807
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:22,255
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

808
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,724
Right here in Trollesund.

809
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:27,455
What is your name, child?

810
00:55:27,495 --> 00:55:29,258
Lyra Belacqua.

811
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:32,858
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

812
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:35,369
I owe you a debt.

813
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:38,133
I will serve you in your campaign...

814
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:40,300
until I am dead...

815
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:43,573
or you have a victory.

816
00:56:39,334 --> 00:56:40,665
Iorek!

817
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,261
Lorek Byrnison!

818
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:47,764
Lorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

819
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:49,936
What they done ain't right, I know.

820
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:52,003
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

821
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:53,412
And there'll be more fighting...

822
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:55,382
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

823
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:03,589
Let's not be too hasty.

824
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:06,958
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

825
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,031
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

826
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:14,968
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

827
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:18,404
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

828
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,930
Fortunately, little girls...

829
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:22,204
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

830
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,711
Well, looky here. Reinforcements.

831
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:33,748
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

832
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:40,918
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

833
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:43,897
of the Gyptian persuasion.

834
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,423
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

835
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:50,029
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

836
00:57:52,774 --> 00:57:55,607
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

837
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:19,923
My lord.

838
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,764
Rise, Fra Pavel.

839
00:58:25,807 --> 00:58:27,604
I have received your news...

840
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:32,045
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

841
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,207
The matter is of
the first importance.

842
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:37,616
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

843
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:43,217
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

844
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:46,091
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

845
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:48,425
of the Coulter woman.

846
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:56,727
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

847
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:59,433
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

848
00:58:59,474 --> 00:59:02,466
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

849
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,942
No matter.
One way or another...

850
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,381
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

851
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,749
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

852
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:14,152
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

853
00:59:14,189 --> 00:59:18,057
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

854
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,846
I'm sorry.

855
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:54,119
I would never hurt you.

856
01:00:00,235 --> 01:00:02,226
Oh, Lyra.

857
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:07,066
I'll find you.

858
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:09,872
I will find you.

859
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,952
Careful now, boys.

860
01:00:28,997 --> 01:00:32,558
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

861
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,058
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

862
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:38,572
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

863
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,597
but she was always
telling me what to do.

864
01:00:40,642 --> 01:00:42,667
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

865
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,372
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

866
01:00:45,413 --> 01:00:47,381
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

867
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:50,509
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

868
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:00,593
Samoyed lands.

869
01:01:00,628 --> 01:01:04,223
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

870
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:07,359
It's the only way
to reach Bolvangar.

871
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:12,497
Stay close to me.

872
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,566
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

873
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:27,087
How far do you reckon?

874
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:29,783
Oh, I don't know for sure,
but a good few miles.

875
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:32,554
We covered some ground.

876
01:01:54,515 --> 01:01:57,916
What's wrong?
What can you see?

877
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,756
- Where are we going?
- Hush, Pan.

878
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:07,693
They told us not to leave the tent.

879
01:02:07,729 --> 01:02:09,026
Is he coming, then?

880
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:12,328
Don't know. I'll have a look.

881
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:29,478
Iorek?

882
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:32,452
What is it, child?

883
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:35,718
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

884
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:39,284
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

885
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:41,591
and it's troubled by a ghost.

886
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:45,121
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

887
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:48,795
You could take me there,
couldn't you?

888
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:50,736
You could carry me
there and back...

889
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,603
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

890
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:56,966
You wish to ride me?

891
01:02:57,011 --> 01:02:58,945
Yeah.

892
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,108
We will travel faster without armour.

893
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:39,146
Are those birds?

894
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:40,848
Witches.

895
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,617
More than I have ever seen.

896
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,650
Where are they going?

897
01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:49,492
Flying to war.

898
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,858
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

899
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,130
you should all be afraid.

900
01:03:55,837 --> 01:03:57,532
Are you afraid?

901
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,369
No.

902
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:03,070
When I am, I will master my fear.

903
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:33,999
I will make sure the way is clear.

904
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,703
No. Stay here.

905
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:01,296
Lyra, no, please don't.

906
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:03,303
Something's wrong.

907
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:06,795
- Hush, Pan.
- Something terrible.

908
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:09,275
I'm afraid.

909
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,870
We've got to master our fear.

910
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:35,896
Hello?

911
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:37,928
Hello?

912
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,526
Billy.

913
01:06:04,565 --> 01:06:06,931
Where's his damon?

914
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:09,732
He doesn't have a damon.

915
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,635
That's...

916
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:13,333
intercision.

917
01:06:15,176 --> 01:06:17,940
That's what
the Gobblers are doing...

918
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:23,008
cuttin' away kids' damons.

919
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:26,285
Where's my Ratter?

920
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,345
Have you seen her?

921
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:32,392
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

922
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:35,395
Let me take you
back to your mum.

923
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:37,488
I need Ratter.

924
01:06:37,531 --> 01:06:40,193
Billy, come on with me.

925
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:42,361
We'll take you someplace safe.

926
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:44,064
We'll find Ratter.

927
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:03,223
Gracious God, what's this?

928
01:07:05,626 --> 01:07:09,187
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

929
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:12,893
Billy. Billy Costa.

930
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:14,367
Billy!

931
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:19,766
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

932
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:22,037
You're safe now.

933
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:24,172
We'll find your damon.

934
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:27,044
We'll bring 'er back.

935
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:46,899
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

936
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,008
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

937
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:12,787
Look out, Lyra!

938
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,831
Lorek!

939
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:27,970
Lorek Byrnison, help me!

940
01:08:46,227 --> 01:08:48,855
Pan, where are they taking us?

941
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:50,864
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

942
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,446
Ice bears, Pan.

943
01:09:08,516 --> 01:09:10,677
I hope you're happy now.

944
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,964
You're losing your touch, <i>amigo.</i>

945
01:09:28,803 --> 01:09:30,293
So am I.

946
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,737
Don't worry.

947
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:34,468
We'll get her back.

948
01:09:35,743 --> 01:09:39,144
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

949
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,614
She's worth more in one piece.

950
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:47,281
I'll find her.

951
01:09:47,321 --> 01:09:50,813
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

952
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:55,658
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

953
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:58,665
No. I will not leave her.

954
01:10:01,202 --> 01:10:03,261
You show up in Svalbard...

955
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:05,295
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

956
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:06,897
You know that.

957
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:08,966
I know I would feel ashamed...

958
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:11,705
to show less courage
than that child.

959
01:10:11,745 --> 01:10:14,771
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

960
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:19,047
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

961
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:22,215
No.

962
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:25,482
I reckon not.

963
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:29,628
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

964
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:39,773
Don't worry. Iorek will come.

965
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:44,870
That's just it, Pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

966
01:10:50,184 --> 01:10:52,277
We've got to do something.

967
01:10:55,956 --> 01:11:00,393
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

968
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:03,555
about the king of the bears
wanting a damon?

969
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,962
Pan, I need you to hide.

970
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:12,302
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

971
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:15,069
We can beat him, Pan.

972
01:11:26,754 --> 01:11:29,848
What is this little thing?

973
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:34,286
Our greetings to you, great king.

974
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:38,355
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

975
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,594
Not whose?

976
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:43,432
Lorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

977
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,998
What have you
to do with lorek Byrnison?

978
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:53,612
I am lorek Byrnison's damon.

979
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:59,284
And how has the exile...

980
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,051
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a damon?

981
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:06,116
Lorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a damon...

982
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,889
but it should've been you.

983
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:11,728
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

984
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:15,462
And how could you be
so far from him?

985
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,970
I'm like a witch's damon, great king.

986
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:21,736
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Well...

987
01:12:21,775 --> 01:12:23,709
if you are his damon...

988
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:27,703
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

989
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:30,308
If you do that,
I can never be your damon.

990
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:33,812
My... damon?

991
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:36,186
That's why I come here, see?

992
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:38,691
'Cause I want to be
your damon, not his.

993
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:41,718
He's just an exile, nothing.

994
01:12:41,762 --> 01:12:45,289
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

995
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:48,529
and better in every way.

996
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:51,595
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

997
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:54,472
What? He's mad.

998
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:56,999
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

999
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:58,534
No.

1000
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,511
If you defeat him,
I will become your damon.

1001
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,279
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

1002
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:09,255
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

1003
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:13,624
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

1004
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:16,095
You and me, together.

1005
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:20,599
Have him killed any other way...

1006
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:23,762
and I'll just go out like a light,
and you'll never have a damon.

1007
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:26,102
Prove it.

1008
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,405
Prove to me that you are a damon.

1009
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:32,003
Ask me something only you know.

1010
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:37,609
How did I become king?

1011
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,851
What is that?

1012
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:51,262
It's a damon mirror, great king.

1013
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:55,098
We damons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

1014
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:20,488
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

1015
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:22,995
for you poisoned the old king...

1016
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:26,557
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

1017
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:31,333
Iorek Byrnison.

1018
01:14:53,427 --> 01:14:55,588
Oh, Pan, what have I done?

1019
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:57,358
Ragnar's too strong.

1020
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:05,297
So here he is.

1021
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:08,035
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

1022
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:11,010
Great king, let me speak to him.

1023
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:13,672
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

1024
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,410
You go to him. Give him courage.

1025
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,010
Bring him to his death.

1026
01:15:19,052 --> 01:15:21,953
Soon you'll be mine.

1027
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:36,131
Oh, lorek.

1028
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,900
Iorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

1029
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,375
What terrible thing?

1030
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:48,003
I told the king I was your damon
and that he must fight you.

1031
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:50,016
If not, they would never let you fight.

1032
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,075
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

1033
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:54,879
But you've been fighting...

1034
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,753
and running all this way.

1035
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:00,658
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

1036
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:05,028
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silvertongue.

1037
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:08,728
To fight him is all I want.

1038
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:11,761
Come, little damon.

1039
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,948
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

1040
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,246
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

1041
01:16:24,284 --> 01:16:27,481
Lyra, if I am killed...

1042
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,614
Scoresby will find you.

1043
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:14,925
Is that all...

1044
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,520
whimpering cub?

1045
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:18,656
Is that all...

1046
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,326
soon-to-die?

1047
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:26,031
Is that all? Huh?

1048
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:38,046
Is that all?

1049
01:18:59,673 --> 01:19:02,540
Yes, that is all.

1050
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:05,511
That is all.

1051
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:11,211
Bears, who is your king?

1052
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:29,098
Lorek...

1053
01:19:29,136 --> 01:19:31,730
Iorek, I thought I'd lost you.

1054
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,296
Why?

1055
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,002
You still own my contract.

1056
01:19:38,745 --> 01:19:42,010
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

1057
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:48,218
We've got to stop them, lorek.

1058
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:50,348
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

1059
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:15,648
There.

1060
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:35,598
It may not hold us both.

1061
01:20:36,369 --> 01:20:39,065
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

1062
01:20:48,615 --> 01:20:51,311
I'm right here. Step quickly.

1063
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,342
Don't look down.

1064
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:13,164
Don't look back!
You're almost there.

1065
01:21:29,823 --> 01:21:31,586
Run, Lyra!

1066
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,923
Run! Run!

1067
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:45,200
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

1068
01:21:48,475 --> 01:21:50,534
Wait for me there!

1069
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:53,410
Lyra! Wait!

1070
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:08,625
I don't like the look of this place.

1071
01:22:14,568 --> 01:22:16,763
Bolvangar.

1072
01:22:16,803 --> 01:22:18,998
Hello, there.

1073
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,941
I got lost in the snow. Where am I?

1074
01:22:22,976 --> 01:22:24,876
No need to worry, my child.

1075
01:22:24,911 --> 01:22:26,811
You're safe now.

1076
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:36,622
Well, you'd better come inside.

1077
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:38,590
It's warm and comfortable in here.

1078
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:42,026
- What's your name?
- Don't tell him who we are.

1079
01:22:43,597 --> 01:22:46,430
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

1080
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:52,104
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

1081
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:54,299
That must be an interesting story.

1082
01:22:54,341 --> 01:22:57,367
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

1083
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:59,378
They're traders.

1084
01:22:59,412 --> 01:23:03,746
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

1085
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:05,375
What is this place?

1086
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:07,909
Oh, you'll like it.

1087
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:10,479
It's called the Experimental Station.

1088
01:23:10,523 --> 01:23:12,388
What do you do here?

1089
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:14,359
We help children grow up.

1090
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:17,659
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie. Lucky you.

1091
01:23:17,697 --> 01:23:19,995
Just in time for dinner.

1092
01:23:35,982 --> 01:23:38,212
Can you see him?
Is he here?

1093
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:55,200
- Lyra, it's them.
- Pan!

1094
01:23:55,235 --> 01:23:56,998
- You found us!
- You're all right!

1095
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:59,631
You kept your promise!

1096
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:12,442
I knew you'd come.

1097
01:24:12,485 --> 01:24:14,112
I promised, didn't I?

1098
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:25,489
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

1099
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:29,528
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

1100
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,298
Then they'll send us home...

1101
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:33,135
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

1102
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:36,200
But once they call a kid in...

1103
01:24:36,242 --> 01:24:37,937
you'll never see them again.

1104
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:40,776
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

1105
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,179
and he's still gone.

1106
01:24:42,215 --> 01:24:45,412
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right?

1107
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:50,890
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

1108
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:52,983
I need to be alone someplace.

1109
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:55,789
But not here.

1110
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:02,257
They hardly ever use this one,
but be quick.

1111
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:21,745
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

1112
01:25:25,025 --> 01:25:26,993
But why would it...

1113
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:29,052
Oh, no. It's them.

1114
01:25:29,095 --> 01:25:30,687
I think you'll be pleased with our progress.

1115
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:34,359
That may be so,
but I am very interested in discovering...

1116
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:37,893
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

1117
01:25:40,507 --> 01:25:42,134
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

1118
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:44,666
I hope you'll understand
that the question is moot.

1119
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:47,407
Any child who escapes
from the facility...

1120
01:25:47,447 --> 01:25:49,540
would not last
very long in the cold.

1121
01:25:49,582 --> 01:25:52,483
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

1122
01:25:53,053 --> 01:25:54,714
Were they alive?

1123
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:01,657
Well, that is unfortunate.

1124
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:04,394
But enough of that for now.

1125
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:06,592
I, at least, have some good news.

1126
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:11,570
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

1127
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:17,200
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

1128
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:19,803
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

1129
01:26:21,714 --> 01:26:25,115
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

1130
01:26:25,151 --> 01:26:29,212
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

1131
01:26:29,255 --> 01:26:31,587
Put him to death? Dear me.

1132
01:26:34,594 --> 01:26:37,495
I think I will retire for the evening.

1133
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:39,498
Oh, well, yes, of course.

1134
01:26:39,532 --> 01:26:42,000
The orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

1135
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:48,905
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

1136
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:51,570
She's positively ghoulish.

1137
01:26:51,611 --> 01:26:53,738
Do you remember
the first experiments...

1138
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:56,044
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

1139
01:26:56,082 --> 01:26:58,550
Her and that mute of a damon.

1140
01:26:58,585 --> 01:27:00,177
- What was that?
- Down there.

1141
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,551
- Under the table.
- Quick!

1142
01:27:01,588 --> 01:27:03,522
- Lyra!
- Grab her leg!

1143
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:04,614
Lyra, they've got me!

1144
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:07,623
Come here.

1145
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,594
- Come on.
- Lyra!

1146
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:13,395
- You can't!
- Let me go! Get off me!

1147
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:15,867
You're not allowed!

1148
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,135
Lyra!

1149
01:27:25,745 --> 01:27:27,508
Quickly now. Straight into the chamber.

1150
01:27:27,547 --> 01:27:30,345
Let me go. Iorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.

1151
01:27:30,383 --> 01:27:32,578
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a...

1152
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,447
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

1153
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,789
- You'll never keep us apart.
- You want to grow up, don't you?

1154
01:27:40,827 --> 01:27:43,921
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

1155
01:27:43,963 --> 01:27:47,023
- You'll never keep us apart!
- Set phase two.

1156
01:27:47,066 --> 01:27:49,125
Never, never!

1157
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,935
No, stop!

1158
01:27:55,975 --> 01:27:58,102
- Lyra!
- Pan!

1159
01:27:58,144 --> 01:28:00,510
- No!
- Never!

1160
01:28:01,347 --> 01:28:03,713
You can't!

1161
01:28:06,152 --> 01:28:07,983
- Don't leave me, Pan.
- No!

1162
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:10,319
- Stop!
- No! Help me!

1163
01:28:10,356 --> 01:28:12,017
Lyra!

1164
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,989
Lyra!

1165
01:28:48,628 --> 01:28:50,721
Lyra. Darling.

1166
01:28:50,763 --> 01:28:52,754
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No, no one will hurt you.

1167
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:55,927
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

1168
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:57,664
ever going to hurt you.

1169
01:28:57,704 --> 01:29:01,504
They did it to Billy...

1170
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:03,566
and those other kids.

1171
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:06,306
They cut their damons away.

1172
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:09,406
Why? Why are they doing that?

1173
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:13,385
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

1174
01:29:13,419 --> 01:29:15,546
It's just a little cut.

1175
01:29:15,588 --> 01:29:19,524
You listen. Listen to me.

1176
01:29:19,559 --> 01:29:21,925
A long, long time ago...

1177
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:24,452
some of our ancestors made...

1178
01:29:24,497 --> 01:29:26,795
made a terrible mistake.

1179
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:29,529
They disobeyed...

1180
01:29:29,569 --> 01:29:31,764
the Authority.

1181
01:29:31,804 --> 01:29:35,035
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

1182
01:29:35,074 --> 01:29:38,840
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we have been sick with Dust.

1183
01:29:38,878 --> 01:29:41,142
But there is a way out.

1184
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,842
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

1185
01:29:45,184 --> 01:29:49,518
It's later, when your damon
begins to settle...

1186
01:29:49,555 --> 01:29:52,285
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

1187
01:29:52,325 --> 01:29:55,886
trying to work its mischief.

1188
01:29:55,928 --> 01:29:59,295
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

1189
01:29:59,332 --> 01:30:01,857
and unhappy feelings and...

1190
01:30:03,469 --> 01:30:05,869
But there is a way to stop it.

1191
01:30:07,273 --> 01:30:10,868
A little cut, and gone forever.

1192
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:14,243
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

1193
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,111
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

1194
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:21,712
I'm going to tell you something.

1195
01:30:21,754 --> 01:30:25,019
Something very important,
something you don't know.

1196
01:30:25,058 --> 01:30:27,549
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

1197
01:30:27,593 --> 01:30:30,027
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

1198
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:34,397
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

1199
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:38,302
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though...

1200
01:30:38,338 --> 01:30:41,933
even though she loved you
very much and...

1201
01:30:41,974 --> 01:30:43,908
and she wanted to keep you...

1202
01:30:45,778 --> 01:30:47,439
it wasn't allowed.

1203
01:30:49,148 --> 01:30:52,276
And so you were taken from her.

1204
01:30:52,318 --> 01:30:56,448
And it wasn't until things changed...

1205
01:30:56,489 --> 01:30:59,219
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

1206
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:05,054
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

1207
01:31:05,098 --> 01:31:07,566
No! You can't be!

1208
01:31:14,607 --> 01:31:18,236
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

1209
01:31:18,277 --> 01:31:21,178
And you're safe with me.

1210
01:31:21,214 --> 01:31:24,183
You'll always be safe with me.

1211
01:31:26,953 --> 01:31:29,046
Who's my father?

1212
01:31:36,195 --> 01:31:39,687
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

1213
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:45,534
Yes. Yes.

1214
01:31:55,415 --> 01:31:57,440
Now I almost forgot.

1215
01:31:57,483 --> 01:32:01,783
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

1216
01:32:01,821 --> 01:32:04,881
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

1217
01:32:06,459 --> 01:32:08,290
But you see...

1218
01:32:09,629 --> 01:32:12,325
it wasn't really his to give.

1219
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,459
Ah, he did. Oh.

1220
01:32:16,502 --> 01:32:20,598
Must've seemed such a puzzle, what
a silly old thing like that was any good for.

1221
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:23,700
All right.

1222
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:28,572
Here it is.

1223
01:32:28,614 --> 01:32:30,275
Thank you.

1224
01:32:32,685 --> 01:32:35,518
What a funny old tin. Did you...

1225
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:38,547
did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

1226
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:03,973
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

1227
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:07,644
We're just not used to that reaction.

1228
01:33:07,687 --> 01:33:10,383
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered...

1229
01:34:30,102 --> 01:34:32,536
Go on, then. Go on.

1230
01:34:58,598 --> 01:35:01,294
Iorek! Lorek!

1231
01:35:02,268 --> 01:35:03,667
Run, child!

1232
01:35:06,839 --> 01:35:09,137
Let's go! Come on!

1233
01:35:17,283 --> 01:35:19,046
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

1234
01:35:37,003 --> 01:35:40,097
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

1235
01:35:48,614 --> 01:35:50,741
Serafina Pekkala?

1236
01:36:28,854 --> 01:36:31,721
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

1237
01:36:31,757 --> 01:36:33,622
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

1238
01:36:33,659 --> 01:36:35,820
Come!

1239
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,389
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1240
01:37:00,052 --> 01:37:02,145
Charge!

1241
01:37:02,188 --> 01:37:03,917
Come on! Run!

1242
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,938
Come on! Get down, men!

1243
01:37:23,976 --> 01:37:26,774
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

1244
01:37:57,176 --> 01:37:58,837
Come on!

1245
01:38:45,357 --> 01:38:48,520
Joe! Oh, my precious!

1246
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:51,359
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

1247
01:38:53,065 --> 01:38:54,555
- Darling!
- Mum!

1248
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,329
Here's my daughter! Come here!

1249
01:39:02,608 --> 01:39:05,702
Gyptians! To me!

1250
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:07,837
We're going home!

1251
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:13,785
Lyra, we've got to go.

1252
01:39:13,819 --> 01:39:15,719
It's time to go home.

1253
01:39:16,755 --> 01:39:18,450
I can't, Roger.

1254
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:21,357
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

1255
01:39:21,393 --> 01:39:24,089
- Your father?
- Lord Asriel...

1256
01:39:24,129 --> 01:39:26,757
Mrs. Coulter and them...
they're gonna kill him.

1257
01:39:26,799 --> 01:39:28,198
Then I'm going too.

1258
01:39:28,234 --> 01:39:32,193
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

1259
01:39:38,777 --> 01:39:42,543
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

1260
01:39:45,351 --> 01:39:47,342
I know where she's going.

1261
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:05,329
Well, they're all tucked in back there.

1262
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:07,896
That little girl's somethin', huh?

1263
01:40:12,611 --> 01:40:15,512
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

1264
01:40:17,316 --> 01:40:20,080
She will decide the war
which is to come.

1265
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:21,484
War?

1266
01:40:23,222 --> 01:40:25,747
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

1267
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:28,055
You will.

1268
01:40:28,093 --> 01:40:31,756
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

1269
01:40:31,797 --> 01:40:35,927
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

1270
01:40:37,069 --> 01:40:41,597
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

1271
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,108
but every world in every universe.

1272
01:40:46,912 --> 01:40:49,904
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

1273
01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:54,146
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

1274
01:40:54,186 --> 01:40:57,952
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

1275
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:59,958
Nothing but us...

1276
01:40:59,992 --> 01:41:02,017
and that child.

1277
01:41:12,037 --> 01:41:14,096
What's it telling you?

1278
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:30,354
It's telling me about my father.

1279
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:34,655
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

1280
01:41:34,693 --> 01:41:36,888
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

1281
01:41:36,929 --> 01:41:38,624
After we save your father.

1282
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:42,260
Course.

1283
01:41:42,301 --> 01:41:45,634
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

1284
01:41:45,671 --> 01:41:49,801
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their damons. We've got to help them.

1285
01:41:50,676 --> 01:41:52,166
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

1286
01:41:52,211 --> 01:41:54,736
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

1287
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,975
or leave off ordering people about.

1288
01:41:58,217 --> 01:42:00,344
And Dust...

1289
01:42:00,386 --> 01:42:02,013
I want to know what Dust is.

1290
01:42:03,288 --> 01:42:06,621
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

1291
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:08,956
That's an awful lot to sort out.

1292
01:42:08,994 --> 01:42:10,689
Well, who else is gonna do it?

1293
01:42:10,729 --> 01:42:13,323
'Sides, we're in this together now.

1294
01:42:13,365 --> 01:42:15,560
Yeah, suppose we are.

1295
01:42:17,336 --> 01:42:20,999
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

1296
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,132
Go on, then.

1297
01:42:32,017 --> 01:42:34,247
We'll set things right.

1298
01:42:34,286 --> 01:42:36,652
We will.

1299
01:42:36,688 --> 01:42:39,088
You and me...

1300
01:42:39,124 --> 01:42:40,955
and lorek.

1301
01:42:40,993 --> 01:42:43,484
And Serafina Pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

1302
01:42:45,731 --> 01:42:47,062
And my father.

1303
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:49,698
We'll set it right, Pan.

1304
01:42:52,104 --> 01:42:54,095
Just let them try to stop us.

1305
01:43:38,984 --> 01:43:42,351
# Where are our lives #

1306
01:43:42,387 --> 01:43:45,618
# If there is no dream? #

1307
01:43:45,657 --> 01:43:50,754
# Where is our home? #

1308
01:43:50,796 --> 01:43:54,527
# We don't know how #

1309
01:43:54,566 --> 01:43:58,024
# There will be a way #

1310
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:01,267
# Out of the storm #

1311
01:44:01,306 --> 01:44:08,940
# We will find hope #

1312
01:44:16,822 --> 01:44:23,990
# And her soul
walks beside her #

1313
01:44:24,029 --> 01:44:30,457
# An army stands behind her #

1314
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:35,337
# Lyra #

1315
01:44:35,374 --> 01:44:37,569
# Lyra #

1316
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:41,409
# And her face #

1317
01:44:41,446 --> 01:44:44,381
# Full of grace #

1318
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:48,443
# Two worlds
collide around her #

1319
01:44:48,487 --> 01:44:54,551
# The truth lies
deep inside her #

1320
01:44:54,593 --> 01:44:59,656
# Lyra #

1321
01:44:59,698 --> 01:45:02,189
# Lyra #

1322
01:45:02,234 --> 01:45:08,730
# And the stars
look down upon her #

1323
01:45:08,774 --> 01:45:15,043
# This darkness settles on her #

1324
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:20,017
# Lyra #

1325
01:45:20,052 --> 01:45:22,247
# Lyra #

1326
01:45:22,287 --> 01:45:28,920
# Who's to know
what's in the future? #

1327
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:32,863
# Every hope
we will be with her #

1328
01:45:32,898 --> 01:45:38,859
# We have all our love
to give her #

1329
01:45:38,904 --> 01:45:44,035
# Oh, Lyra #

1330
01:45:44,076 --> 01:45:46,340
# Lyra #

1331
01:45:46,378 --> 01:45:53,341
# And her soul
walks beside her #

1332
01:45:53,385 --> 01:45:59,517
# An army stands behind her #

1333
01:45:59,558 --> 01:46:04,291
# Lyra #

1334
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:06,661
# Lyra #

1335
01:46:06,698 --> 01:46:10,600
# And her face #

1336
01:46:10,636 --> 01:46:13,935
# Full of grace #

1337
01:46:13,972 --> 01:46:17,772
# Two worlds
collide around her #

1338
01:46:17,809 --> 01:46:23,907
# The truth lies
deep inside her #

1339
01:46:23,949 --> 01:46:29,387
# Oh, Lyra #

1340
01:46:29,421 --> 01:46:36,827
# Lyra #

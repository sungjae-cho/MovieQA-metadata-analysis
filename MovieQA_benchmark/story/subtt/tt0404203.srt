1
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,000
Want to take a walk with me?

2
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,040
...continue to protest the presence|of a convicted sex offender

3
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,440
in their neighborhood.|Michelle Betler reports.

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Thanks, Rick. I'm standing here|on Woodward Court,

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
the quiet residential|street

6
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
that has become|the focus of controversy

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,360
ever since 48-year-old|Ronald James McGorvey returned here

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,160
after serving a two-year|prison sentence

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,240
for indecent exposure|to a minor.

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,320
ln the past few days|an organization

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
known as the Committee|of Concerned Parents

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
began distributing these notices|throughout the community

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,080
warning neighbors|of what they call a quote,

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,080
''Dangerous predator|in our midst.''

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,560
I don't really like having|him that close to my family.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,160
I think it's outrageous.|This block has too many children

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,160
for a sex offender to, uh, be|moving in the neighborhood.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
l-- I don't think|it's a good idea.

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,600
Makes me very nervous.|Makes me a little enraged.

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Um, I'd have a problem|if I see him on the street.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,960
It's like having an|alcoholic work in a bar.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,240
They don't mix.|They shouldn't be together.

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,480
The conditions of his parole|expressly forbid McGorvey

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,680
to be within 100 yards|of any playground,

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,280
school or recreation area|where children normally gather.

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
These conditions seem|to be of little comfort

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,000
to the many parents whose|children play and go to school

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,000
in this formerly|tranquil community,

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,320
and who in the coming days and weeks|will be hoping for the best

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,160
but preparing for the worst.|Rick, back to you.

31
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,160
My husband and I had an|actual spiritual experience.

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,280
We did this intense|spa treatment--

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
- Oh, come on.|- No, listen to me.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
lt was on our vacation in Cabo|and there were eight other couples

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,680
and this Mayan woman.

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,840
A goddess,|just a goddess.

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,200
- She had--|- She's due in September.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,920
She thinks she's gonna|take three months off,

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,520
then it's Christmas, then she'll be back|to work the first of the year.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,040
Please.

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
Six months from now she'll be right here|on this bench with us.

42
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
My friend Beth said|that the way she did it

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,400
was to just take him with her every time|she went to the bathroom.

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,520
- I find that strange.|- Yeah, that's what I said to Beth.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
It's Oedipal.

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,080
What's the rush?

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
Although I will say, when I was trying|to potty-train Christian,

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,040
I opened the diaper|and it was huge!

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
Like a grown man.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Smiling politely to mask a|familiar feeling of desperation

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Sarah reminded herself to think|like an anthropologist.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,400
She was a researcher studying the|behavior of typical suburban women.

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
They weren't organic?

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
She was not a typical|suburban woman herself.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,280
Troy, stop that!

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Paul and I were having|sex the other night

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,080
and I drifted off|right in the middle of it.

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
lt happens.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,120
Yeah, I guess.|But when I woke up and apologized

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
he said he hadn't|even noticed.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,720
You know what|you should do?

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Set aside a specific|block of time for it.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,160
That's what Louis and I do--|every Tuesday night at 9:00.

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,240
''Whether you want to or not''|Sarah thought,

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,720
her eyes straying over|to the play area.

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,080
Even at such a tiny|playground as this

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,160
Lucy didn't interact much|with the other children.

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Sarah didn't really know why|they even bothered coming here,

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
except that she'd|probably go crazy

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
trapped in the house|all day

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,880
with this unknowable|little person.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Morning snack time|was 10:30 on the dot...

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,080
Snack time!

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
...a regimen established|and maintained by Mary Ann,

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,600
who believed that rigid|adherence to a timetable

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
was not only the key|to a healthy marriage,

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
but to effective|parenting as well.

78
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,200
- I'll take this one!|- I want that one!

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,640
- Can I do it?|- Yeah. Ready?

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Mommy...

81
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,160
where's my snack?

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm sorry, honey,|Mommy can't find it.

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,040
- I forgot the rice cakes.|- Poor thing.

84
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
- I'm sure it's in here somewhere.|- Second time this week.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Well, who's going to keep|track of everything?

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,240
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.|- Just calm down, please.

87
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,000
No calm down!|l want my snack!

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,480
All right, you know what?|It's--

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,360
it's just not here, okay?|See for yourself.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Wait!

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Troy, honey,|give Lucy your goldfish.

92
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,120
No!

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,080
Troy Jonathan,|give me those goldfish!

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
But, Mama, they're mine.

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,160
No back talk.|You can share with your sister.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
Troy has goldfish for you.|Go sit down.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,520
That's much more than 10.

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
- That's great.|- Look how big I made my lawn.

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,560
Thank you, Mary Ann,|you're a life saver.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,000
It's nothing.|l just hate to see her suffer like that.

101
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,080
Maybe you should make|a checklist and tape it to the door

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,720
so it's the last thing you|see before leaving the house.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,920
That's what I do.

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah, thank you. That's-- that's|a really helpful suggestion.

105
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,880
You're welcome.

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,160
Drink your juice.

107
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Are you the plane again?

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
Look.

109
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Now you have to act like me.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,160
The prom king.

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,880
Oh my God,|he's back.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,680
Sarah followed|the other women's gazes

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
over to the entrance|of the playground,

114
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,320
eager to finally get a glimpse|of the prom king,

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
the handsome and mysterious|young father

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,080
who had been a regular|at the Walker Street playground

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,920
for several weeks|this past spring

118
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,040
before abruptly|dropping out of sight.

119
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't need a rest.|l need an airplane ride.

120
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
His departure had left a gaping|hole in the emotional lives

121
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,240
of Cheryl, Theresa|and Mary Ann.

122
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
Barely a day went by without one|of them speculating wistfully

123
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,120
about the reason for his absence|and the likelihood of his return.

124
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,120
Here I come.|There's no room for two of us, diesel.

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,680
You've done it again.

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,280
I hate steam engines.

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,240
When I come back I will|pinch you with my pinchers.

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Yeah?|Well, when I come back

129
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm gonna ram you|with my rammer.

130
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,600
- Ready?|- No, you won't.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Every time you win,|diesel!

132
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I know.

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,120
- Hello!|- Mommy's home.

134
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,080
The jester's cap was something|that truly disturbed Brad.

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,480
All day long the boy ate,|played and napped in it.

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
But the moment his mother stepped in|the house he had no more use for it.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,040
As if the entire day|up to that point

138
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,000
had been a pointless|and somewhat useless charade.

139
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,000
You got some sun|today, didn't you?

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Did Daddy forget|the sunscreen again?

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,360
What are you doing?

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,920
That's his full name.|What's your favorite thing about him?

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
Um...

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,880
I like to come over|to his house.

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,240
Hmm.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,800
I think I'm gonna finally break down|and get a cell phone.

147
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,040
- Really?|- Mmm.

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Why?

149
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,960
I have no way of reaching you|when I'm out with Aaron.

150
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
You're done,|right?

151
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,640
You've got one.

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't you think it's|strange that I don't?

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,520
Yeah, I do.|You just never wanted one before.

154
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,920
Yeah, I know.

155
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,440
There's a family plan.|We can talk for free.

156
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,080
Okay.

157
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,840
Let's just see where we are|at the end of the month.

158
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah?

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,680
Are your hands okay?

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,160
As was her custom each week|night after dinner,

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
the boy's mother sent Brad|down to the municipal library

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
to study for the bar exam.

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,160
But he never quite made it through|the door of the building.

164
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Brad had been watching|the skateboarders for weeks now,

165
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,960
sometimes for as long|as an hour at a stretch.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But he never received the slightest|acknowledgement from any of them.

167
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
He'd been the same age as these|boys when his mother died.

168
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,880
- You do that!|- No way!

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,040
- Nice.|- Hey, that was nice, dude!

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
''l must have been like this,''|Brad sometimes thought.

171
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,080
''l must have been|one of them.''

172
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Awful.

173
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,040
He should be castrated.

174
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,960
Quick and clean,|just chop it off.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,120
Then you wouldn't have to worry|about notifying the neighbors.

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
You know what else|you should do?

177
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Nail his penis above the entrance|to the elementary school.

178
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
You know, as a warning|to other perverts.

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,840
You think|this is funny?

180
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,360
I just can't believe you want to|castrate a man for indecent exposure.

181
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,200
My brother used|to expose himself when--

182
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,760
when we were teenagers.|He'd do it in my bedroom,

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,280
he'd do it in the dining room,|he'd do it in the back seat of a car.

184
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,840
He'd always figure out a way to do it so|that nobody could see him except me.

185
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
Didn't you|tell anyone?

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,120
No, I didn't want|to get him in trouble.

187
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Maybe he should|be castrated.

188
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
It's not the same thing.|He wasn't doing it to strangers.

189
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh my God, there he is.

190
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,040
After all this time,|two days in a row.

191
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,680
Where's the fire?

192
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,360
Maybe he needed a vacation.

193
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,920
From what?

194
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
From being|the prom king.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
It's a dirty job,|but someone's gotta do it.

196
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
- Close it?|- Close it.

197
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,680
Close the gate.|There you go.

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,200
- It's open.|- It's all right.

199
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
- Somebody else will close it.|- Are we practicing?

200
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,320
Are we playing|up on the swings?

201
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,440
Swing time!

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
What's he do for a living?

203
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,120
We've never actually|spoken to him.

204
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Really?

205
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,920
We don't even|know his name.

206
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,120
I thought you guys said|he was a regular here.

207
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
- It was awkward.|- He made us nervous.

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,520
You had to think about what you|were gonna wear in the morning.

209
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,160
You know, put on makeup.|lt was exhausting.

210
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,960
Mommy, push me!

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
Okay.|I'll be right there.

212
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,040
Wait!

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,360
Five bucks if you get|his phone number.

214
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,720
How old is she?

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,160
Lucy,

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,080
tell the nice boy|how old you are.

217
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm three.

218
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,040
My grandma|lives in New Jersey.

219
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,160
She doesn't have|a swim pool.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
Do you like to swim?

221
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,120
I don't like sharks.|They eat you up.

222
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't listen to him.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,440
We go to the town pool|almost every day.

224
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,160
- I'm Brad, by the way.|- Sarah.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
You guys come|here a lot?

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,000
No, just the last|few weeks.

227
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,320
I usually go to the one|over on Harris,

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,720
with the big wood things,|you know, and the slide across.

229
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah, we actually rent a house|right around the corner

230
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
from there on Ashforth.

231
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,040
That ice cream truck never leaves.|Such a nightmare.

232
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,720
Yeah, tell me about it.

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
You know, you're the first person|here who's ever talked to me.

234
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,640
You make 'em nervous.

235
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh, right.

236
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,640
I guess they don't see too many fathers|here during the weekdays.

237
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
You don't have to be polite.|Go ahead and ask.

238
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
What?

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,240
You know, what the person who wears the|pants in the family does for a living.

240
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Oh. All right,|what does your wife do?

241
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,120
- She makes documentaries.|- Oh, wow.

242
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,040
- Like Michael Moore?|- Uh, like PBS.

243
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,800
Oh.

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,880
Well, I think it's|admirable you're here.

245
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,720
There's no reason fathers|can't be primary caregivers.

246
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
I finished law school|two years ago,

247
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,440
but I can't seem to pass the bar exam.|Failed it twice now.

248
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,160
Maybe you just don't|want to be a lawyer.

249
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,840
I'll take the test|one more time.

250
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,480
lf I mess up now

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,760
I'll just have to find something else|to do with my life.

252
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,280
- Right, buddy?|- Right.

253
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Sarah was shocked by how Brad|delivered this confession,

254
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,360
with no apparent sense of being in the|least bit embarrassed by his failure.

255
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Most men weren't like this.

256
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,160
Her husband Richard|certainly wasn't.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,840
She wondered if Brad was|always this forthcoming.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,720
lf anything,|he seemed a little lonely,

259
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,240
all too ready to open his heart at|the slightest sign of interest,

260
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,960
like a lot of young|mothers she knew.

261
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,560
I couldn't help noticing|your stroller.

262
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,960
Do you have|another child?

263
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,800
No, just Aaron.|Got that at a yard sale.

264
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,160
Extra seat comes in handy|for the bear, though.

265
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,360
Lucy refuses to go|in a stroller or a car seat.

266
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,880
We have to walk everywhere. It takes us|half an hour to go three blocks,

267
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
unless I carry her.

268
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,320
- Daddy, I'm finished.|- Are you sure? We just got here.

269
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm finished right now.

270
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,680
Okay. All right,|here we go.

271
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Ready?|One, two, three.

272
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
- Oops.|- Oh, hold on for a second.

273
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
- There, thank you.|- Are you okay?

274
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,920
No problem.

275
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,120
lt was then while watching Brad|kneel down at his son's feet

276
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,920
that Sarah found herself gripped by|an unexpected pang of sadness.

277
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,000
''Don't go,'' she thought.

278
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,680
''Don't leave me here|with the others.''

279
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,520
- It was nice talking to you.|- Same here.

280
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,800
Wait! Um...

281
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,760
Come here. Just...

282
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,920
come here.

283
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,080
You see those women|over there?

284
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,040
Just, yeah, don't--|don't look.

285
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
You know what|they call you?

286
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,480
What?

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,880
The prom king.

288
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,520
Oh God, really?

289
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah, they mean it|as a compliment.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,520
You're a big character|in their fantasy lives.

291
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Wow.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
Um, so one of them bet me $5|l couldn't get your phone number.

293
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,120
Five bucks, huh?

294
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,040
Yeah.

295
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,560
Could we split|it 50-50?

296
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,680
lt could be|arranged.

297
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
lt doesn't have to be|your real number.

298
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,880
Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure.|You got a pen?

299
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,080
Great. Oh shit, no l--|um, no I don't.

300
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,040
- Uh...|- Well...

301
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,160
No wait, just--|wait.

302
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,560
You know what'd|really be funny?

303
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,640
lf you gave me a hug.

304
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,080
- You think?|- Yeah.

305
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,440
- Yeah.|- All right, come here.

306
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh my God.

307
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Do you want to really|freak them out?

308
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,280
Yeah.

309
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Who's gonna talk in there?

310
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,520
- Oh my God!|- Troy!

311
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
- Lucy!|- lsabelle!

312
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,040
lsabelle! Come here, lsabelle.|Okay, we have to go.

313
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
- lsabelle!|- Troy!

314
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,080
- I think that worked.|- Yeah, I think so.

315
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.|- Yeah.

316
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,160
It's okay, yeah.|We're gonna go.

317
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,360
- It's all right.|- Lucy?

318
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,280
We're gonna go home.

319
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,880
Okay, here we go,|good girl.

320
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Good girl.

321
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm sure your daughter|found that very educational.

322
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
His name is Brad.|He's a lawyer

323
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,840
and he's really very nice.

324
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,960
For the past few days|Sarah hadn't been able

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,560
to concentrate on anything|but the prom king

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,680
and the curious thing|that had happened

327
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,640
between them|on the playground.

328
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,760
She didn't feel|shame or guilt,

329
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,240
only a sense of profound|disorientation,

330
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,560
as if she had been|kidnapped by aliens

331
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,040
then released unharmed|a few hours later.

332
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,960
As he had so often|in recent days,

333
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
Brad mentally reenacted|the kiss by the swing set.

334
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,160
He still couldn't believe|it had really happened.

335
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,080
And with all those women|and children watching.

336
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,280
Troy! Troy!

337
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,400
Aaron had been particularly|curious about what he'd seen.

338
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,200
Why you hugging|that lady?

339
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,520
Well, that's what|I'm trying to show you with Bozo.

340
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,280
Sometimes it's a game that adults play|to show that they're friends.

341
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,760
You say, ''Hi,|I'm your friend.''

342
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
Aaron was skeptical.

343
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,960
They returned to the playground|the following morning,

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,800
but no one was there.

345
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
Sarah hadn't shown up|at the town pool either,

346
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,560
though Brad remembered telling|her that he and Aaron

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
could be found there|most afternoons.

348
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,160
lt didn't seem to matter|that Sarah wasn't his type,

349
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,280
wasn't even that pretty--|at least not compared to Kathy,

350
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,040
who had long legs|and lustrous hair

351
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,160
and perfect breasts.

352
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,880
Sarah was short, boyish,

353
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,880
and had eyebrows that were thicker|than Brad thought necessary.

354
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
But even so, she'd walked|into his arms that day

355
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,120
as if she were fulfilling|a secret wish

356
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
he hadn't remembered|making.

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hey, pervert!

358
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,080
Yeah, you,|you pervert!

359
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,760
You like little|boys, do you?

360
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,320
- Larry?|- Yes, it's fucking Larry!

361
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
Jesus, man, don't|even joke about that.

362
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,120
What are you doing?|Are you busy?

363
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,400
Uh, actually I'm|supposed to be studying.

364
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,880
Taking the bar exam|next month.

365
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,120
I thought you|did that last year.

366
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah.|See how well I did?

367
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,360
I got a better idea.|Get in.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,160
Come on. Come on,|come on, come on, come on, come on.

369
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Do you mind holding these?|Try to keep them nice.

370
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,120
Oh, uh...

371
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,320
are you, uh, part|of the committee?

372
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,800
I am the committee.

373
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,040
Wow.

374
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,040
That's-- that's|quite a commitment.

375
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,840
Yeah.

376
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,000
Aren't you full time|on the force already?

377
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah, I'm-- I'm taking|a little time off.

378
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,200
You know what|they should do to this bastard?

379
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
Just castrate him.|You know, pfft!

380
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,440
Get it over with,|right?

381
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,920
Yeah.

382
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,000
You look good.

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,040
You've been, uh,|working out?

384
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,800
Uh, just push-ups,|crunches...

385
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
a little light running.

386
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,040
The guys are|gonna love this.

387
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,680
What guys?

388
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,120
Wow, this is something.

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah, it's pretty,|but doesn't have a lot of give.

390
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,560
It's like|playing on cement.

391
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,480
Hey, hold on|a second.

392
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
Duane, I've really gotta talk|to you about the committee.

393
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,160
I mean, it would mean a lot to have|your support on this thing.

394
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,320
I told you already, Larry, none of us|are gonna get involved in that shit.

395
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
We're here to play ball. lf that's your|thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

396
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,040
Okay okay, fine.|l get it, I get it, I get it. Guys!

397
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,120
Bring it in!

398
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Come on, come on,|hustle up!

399
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,080
I want you all to meet|our new quarterback.

400
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,120
- Quarterback?|- Guy better not be a pussy.

401
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,560
He played in college.

402
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,600
Uh, I'm a little|behind the curve.

403
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,520
Who are you guys?

404
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,360
- We're the Guardians!|- We're cops.

405
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,320
Welcome to the Tri-County|touch football night league.

406
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,240
Let's just work on some|simple pass patterns.

407
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,480
Brad waited for his|good sense to kick in.

408
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,640
There were lots of excuses|available to him.

409
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,280
But it felt so good to be standing here|beneath the bright lights.

410
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,920
And he was filled|with a feeling similar to the one

411
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,160
he'd had right|before kissing Sarah,

412
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
like his world had|cracked open

413
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,480
to reveal a thrilling|new possibility.

414
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, just let me|warm up a little.

415
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
All right! Let's go!

416
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,880
Set, hut!

417
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,160
What the fuck?

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,880
That's a late hit!

419
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,840
This ain't|Pop Warner, ace.

420
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,360
You fucking faggot.|You call yourself a quarterback?

421
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,480
Oh, this isn't me.

422
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
What are you doing?

423
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,040
What is that?|What's that for?

424
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,720
I want the scumbag|to know I'm keeping an eye on him.

425
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,480
Oh, shit.|Oh, uh...

426
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I don't think we want|to be here, Larry.

427
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,560
It's not a question|of want.

428
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,480
Joanie thinks I'm|obsessed with this creep.

429
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,840
She thinks if I had a job, I wouldn't|be driving past his house

430
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,160
five, six times a day.|But you know what?

431
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
I kinda think|this is my job.

432
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,880
There's a roll of duct tape|in the glove compartment.

433
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,240
Would you grab it for me?

434
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,160
Honey?

435
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,120
Hi!

436
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,760
Where were you?

437
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
Oh my God.|What happened?

438
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
l-- l-- I joined|this group.

439
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,520
The Committee|for Concerned Parents.

440
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,560
We're distributing flyers about|that creep on Woodward Court.

441
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,160
These guys play a little|touch football after.

442
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,480
This late?

443
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,440
Uh, it's a night league.

444
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,080
So it's gonna be|a regular thing?

445
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,000
No no no no,|just once a week,

446
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
after I'm done|studying at the library.

447
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,960
ls that okay?

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,920
Uh, who are the guys?

449
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,080
You remember|Larry Hedges?

450
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
The guy from the Sprinkler|Park with the twins?

451
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,240
It's his organization.

452
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,360
I thought you|didn't like him.

453
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,160
He's okay.

454
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,520
This committee makes a|lot of sense. I mean it's--

455
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,840
it's pretty scary having|a weirdo like that

456
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,160
living right|by the playground.

457
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Mmm.|l know.

458
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
I hate to even|think about it.

459
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,080
Guess you'd better|take a shower.

460
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,000
Brad showered quickly,|sensing a rare opportunity

461
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,160
to have sex with his wife.

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,160
''This is just what I need,''|he thought.

463
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,400
''Something to take|my mind off that kiss.''

464
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,640
Please don't.

465
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
Come on, Kathy, we've|been through this before.

466
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,120
He needs to start|sleeping by himself.

467
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,000
I know.|He looks so comfy.

468
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,720
Well, he'll be just|as comfy in his own bed.

469
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,080
I just miss|him so much.

470
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm getting a little tired waking up|with his foot in my face.

471
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,040
It's a perfect foot.

472
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,760
Look at him.|Just look at him.

473
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,480
He's a handsome devil.

474
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,040
Mmm, he's perfect.

475
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,000
Good night.

476
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
Number 2 Hillcrest

477
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,600
was an impressive|piece of real estate.

478
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,920
Even so,|Sarah was ambivalent

479
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,040
about the house|she occupied.

480
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,320
She wasn't involved|with its purchase or design.

481
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,280
The place was a hand-me-down of sorts|from Richard's mother.

482
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,040
And the furnishings|were leftovers from his first marriage.

483
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
By the time|Sarah arrived here

484
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,520
Richard wasn't all that|interested in redecorating.

485
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,640
And so she decided|to leave it as it was,

486
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,520
with the exception of a single room|that she staked out for her own

487
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,560
and gradually began|to populate it

488
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
with the remnants|of her former self.

489
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
From the moment|Lucy was born

490
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,640
Sarah had refused to hire|someone for child care.

491
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,120
Read me a story?

492
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,880
ln a minute,|okay?

493
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,440
- Can I sit on your lap?|- I said in a minute!

494
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,680
Go finish your|program, go.

495
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
She wasn't exactly sure|why she had taken this stance.

496
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,120
The truth was she spent|most afternoons marking time,

497
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,840
waiting desperately for the moment|when her husband returned from work

498
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,680
and she could finally|have a moment to herself.

499
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,880
But even this was not|something she could rely on.

500
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,400
You're ready to roll?

501
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Could you wait|a few minutes?

502
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm sorry, Richard's barricaded|in the upstairs office

503
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,880
- finishing some stuff for work.|- No problem.

504
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,080
I've got a little surprise|for someone anyway.

505
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,400
She's a terror at night.|l couldn't get her to nap again.

506
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,520
- Oh, the poor thing.|- Poor mom is more like it.

507
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,640
Hello.

508
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,600
ls there a cute little|girl in the house?

509
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,200
Oh, my goodness!

510
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,160
What--

511
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,560
what have I found?

512
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,120
- A beanie.|- Oh, a beanie.

513
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,760
Jean, you didn't|need to to that.

514
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,680
Oh, this little dog needed|a girl to take care of him.

515
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,480
And I know a little girl|who needed a dog.

516
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,560
Let me see.

517
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,280
Sarah was beginning|to get angry.

518
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,000
Her evening fitness walk|was the one thing

519
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,120
she looked forward to all day,|and Richard knew this.

520
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
But if there was one thing|life had taught Richard,

521
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,160
it was that it was|ridiculous

522
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,360
to be at war|with your own desires.

523
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,120
He could easily imagine what people|would say if they could see him now--

524
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,080
Exactly the same thing they'd|say if someone had told them

525
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,600
that Ray from next door|was a transvestite,

526
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,400
or that Ted from work

527
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,040
had anonymous gay sex|at highway rest stops.

528
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,480
''But we want what we want,''|Richard thought,

529
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,600
''and there's not much|we can do about it.''

530
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,000
He had stumbled|on the site 11 months ago

531
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,160
while doing research|for a consulting firm.

532
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,800
His office door|was wide open.

533
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
But he clicked|on the link anyway.

534
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,160
He was deeply engrossed|in his discovery

535
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
when Ted knocked|on his door.

536
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,640
I'm taking lunch orders.|You want something?

537
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,640
Casually, but with great haste

538
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Richard banished Slutty Kay|from his screen...

539
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,000
Uh, yeah, I'll have|a chicken Caesar.

540
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,320
...and reentered the flow|of an ordinary day.

541
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,160
lt wasn't until|several months later

542
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,680
that Richard gave the slightest thought|to the site he had stumbled upon.

543
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
Do you need me|for anything else?

544
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,200
Uh, no no, you|can head home.

545
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm just gonna catch up|on some e-mail.

546
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,120
Well, don't stay to late.|Your dinner will get cold.

547
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,360
Lately Slutty Kay|had become a problem.

548
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,440
He thought about her|far to often,

549
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,880
and spent hours studying

550
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,040
the thousands of photographs|available to him.

551
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,920
Some of Kay's practices|struck him as bizarre,

552
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,920
even off-putting.

553
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,320
She had a thing|about kitchen utensils,

554
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,800
spatulas, and dressing up|like a little girl

555
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,480
and playing with balloons.

556
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,400
But who was|Richard to judge?

557
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,800
Oh, that's it.

558
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,520
Though as close as Richard|sometimes felt to Slutty Kay,

559
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,880
as much as he believed|that he knew her,

560
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,600
he could never get past|the uncomfortable fact

561
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,840
that she existed for him|solely as a digital image.

562
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,240
The panties were an attempt|to solve this problem.

563
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,320
Maybe a sniff or two|would hurry things along,

564
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,080
so he could get back|downstairs to his real life,

565
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
where his wife|was waiting for him

566
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,200
her impatience increasing|by the minute.

567
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,200
What are you doing?

568
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause|I'd really like to go for my walk?

569
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,080
- You could have knocked.|- I did!

570
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,400
We need to talk.

571
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,120
You're awfully quiet|this evening.

572
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,520
- Everything okay?|- What?

573
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,920
Yeah.

574
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
You'll have to walk|without me tomorrow night.

575
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,520
I've got a book|group meeting.

576
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay.

577
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,000
You're sure everything's|all right?

578
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,800
Yeah, sorry.

579
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
I guess I'm just|a little tired.

580
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,120
So what are|you reading?

581
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,960
''Crime and|Punishment.''

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Wow. That's pretty|highbrow for a book group.

583
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,040
Well, we have some|very stimulating discussions.

584
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,560
You should come next month.|We're doing ''Madame Bovary.''

585
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,800
You could be|my little sister.

586
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,320
Little sister?

587
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,160
We're trying to get younger|women involved.

588
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,040
We call them|our little sisters.

589
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,920
I don't know, Jean.

590
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,480
I read ''Madame Bovary''|in grad school.

591
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,120
It's a pretty|misogynist text.

592
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,120
Well, that's an|interesting perspective.

593
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,120
- You should come.|- Let me think about it.

594
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Oh, would you|excuse me, Jean?

595
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,560
Someone's at my door.|I'll call you, okay?

596
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
Hi!

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,480
Hi!

598
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,640
Wow, God,

599
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,040
this is a surprise.

600
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,120
I haven't seen|you since--

601
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,840
l-- I hope you don't mind. Your husband|said you'd be back any minute.

602
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
Oh, no,|not at all.

603
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,840
It's good|to see you.

604
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,640
God, um, can I get you|some tea or something?

605
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,040
I can only stay a minute.|l just came to warn you.

606
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,840
- You know that guy, the pervert?|- Uh-huh.

607
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,360
He's been riding his|bike near the playground

608
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,040
- checking out the kids.|- Oh, God.

609
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,720
Oh, God,|do the police know?

610
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Nothing they can do.|He's not breaking any laws.

611
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,040
I guess they're just waiting|for him to kill someone.

612
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,400
I just thought|you should know.

613
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,160
Thanks, that's|nice of you.

614
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Let me get|you some tea.

615
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm sorry.|l-- I don't think it's a good idea.

616
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,080
I didn't mean|to kiss him.

617
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,200
I don't even know|how it happened.

618
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,920
I'd better go.|Mike's gonna worry.

619
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,880
You wanna talk?

620
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,720
I'm tired.

621
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,880
Hello.

622
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,200
Hey.

623
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,000
No, he's still|sleeping.

624
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going|through it right now.

625
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,040
No, I guess l|don't need them.

626
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,640
Okay.

627
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,280
All right, bye.

628
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,720
H-hi.

629
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,120
H-hello?

630
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,280
Yes, I'd like|to place an order.

631
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,720
Pierce, Sarah,|Mrs.

632
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,920
Um...

633
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
it's the red bathing suit|on page 29.

634
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
The hide-your-tummy|halter neck.

635
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Uh, I'm size...

636
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,320
10, eight?|l mean, I think.

637
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,480
E-eight.

638
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,160
You want to go|in the pool?

639
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
You do?

640
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,320
One, two.

641
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,160
Daddy, can I go|in the pool now?

642
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,160
ln a minute, okay?

643
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,360
Okay.

644
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,280
There you go.

645
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,120
Mommy, I have|to go pee-pee.

646
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,520
Just go in the pool.

647
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,040
Huh-uh, I want|to go to the bathroom.

648
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
Really?

649
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay, come on.

650
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,040
Okay, ready?

651
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,240
There.

652
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,360
Swing down.

653
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Hey, I'm drumming it.

654
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,720
Oh.

655
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,680
Wow.

656
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,200
- It's you.|- Yeah, hey.

657
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,160
- Hi!|- Okay.

658
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,000
I hope you don't mind.|Lucy has sensitive skin.

659
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,640
She's better off|in the shade.

660
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,360
Oh no,|not at all.

661
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,680
It's nice|to see you again.

662
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,760
Yeah, you too.

663
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,800
I'm sorry,|would you get my back?

664
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,000
Um...|okay, sure.

665
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,320
Thanks.

666
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,000
Right.

667
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,120
## Who is knocking|on the door? ##

668
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,600
- Thanks a lot.|- ## Knocking on the door ##

669
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,760
## Knocking on the door ##

670
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,480
- ## Who is knocking on the door? ##|- It's okay, just...

671
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,080
## A way, hey hey. ##

672
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,080
Lucy, say hi to the little boy|from the playground.

673
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,600
Hi.

674
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,160
Hi.

675
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,320
You remember him?

676
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,640
The pool became a ritual.

677
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,320
I was trying to think.|l just didn't know the way.

678
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,160
- Oh oh, okay.|- I'm here, I'm here.

679
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,040
We have the creature|and we have flower.

680
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
Right.

681
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,760
Day after day they sat|together in the shade

682
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
getting to know|each other.

683
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,720
This needs mustard.

684
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,080
- Mustard?|- Yeah.

685
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,000
Having little choice|in the matter,

686
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,840
Aaron and Lucy formed|a fragile friendship.

687
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Aw, that's perfect.

688
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,160
Sometimes Brad and Sarah|traded offspring.

689
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,160
Mama said, ''What Papa|told you was right.

690
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,320
It's not a good idea|to talk to strangers.''

691
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,320
lt was the most fun|Sarah had had in years.

692
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,000
But there was always|that longing to touch,

693
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,480
to be touched by Brad.

694
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,160
And, as badly as|she wanted this,

695
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,560
she wanted just as badly|to hold on to the innocent public life

696
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,080
they'd made for themselves|out in the open.

697
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,880
So she accepted|the trade--

698
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,040
the melancholy|handshake at 4:00

699
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,000
in exchange for this|little patch of grass,

700
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,800
some sunscreen|and companionship.

701
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,240
One more happy day|at the pool.

702
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,760
Okay, no pasta|for dinner, okay?

703
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,040
We eat way too much|pasta around here.

704
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,120
I thought you|liked my pasta.

705
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,840
No, I do.|That's the problem.

706
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,880
Pretty soon I can sell advertising|space on my ass.

707
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,560
No, that's okay.|I've got to go.

708
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,600
I've got|a 9:00 at Taps.

709
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,720
I thought you were|already editing.

710
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,640
Yeah, so did l.|lt was just--

711
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,120
there's something in this|family's story that really got to me.

712
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
The father was...

713
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,160
K-l-L-L-E-D

714
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,480
in a, um,|mortar attack,

715
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,440
and, um, left behind|a little boy.

716
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,520
I was talking to the mother the other|day on the phone,

717
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,320
and she was saying she didn't know what|she was going to do next Christmas.

718
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,720
Jeez, I bet.

719
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,200
No, it wasn't like that.|lt was more...

720
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
she was wondering, should she keep|this tradition with her son

721
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,080
that began with|the boy's father.

722
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,880
And she was saying|he had this knack

723
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,600
for requesting|odd Christmas gifts--

724
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,560
scuba gear one year

725
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,160
and rappelling gear|the next.

726
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,200
She said he wasn't|afraid to try anything.

727
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,000
Trying new things|made him feel...

728
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,040
more alive.

729
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,200
I've got to go.|See you later.

730
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,200
Patch one of your best|and then we'll patch both of them.

731
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,160
Okay?

732
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,360
Hey, I got something.

733
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,200
Hot enough for you?

734
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah.

735
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah, it's so humid.

736
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,640
I've got football|practice tonight.

737
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,640
Be like playing|in a sauna.

738
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,080
Watch out for|that ltalian guy.

739
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,640
What's his name?

740
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,160
Corrente?

741
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,880
Yeah.

742
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,240
Remember what|happened to your knee last week?

743
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,880
You should be|careful, Brad.

744
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,280
I'll be careful.

745
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,040
Promise?

746
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.|Yeah, I promise.

747
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,720
Weatherman said|scattered showers.

748
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
I don't see|scattered showers.

749
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,680
Mom, could I please|have some money for a snack?

750
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,240
No, sweetheart.|You guys just had a snack. No.

751
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, okay.

752
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,880
All they want is sugar.

753
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,680
Constantly.

754
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Oh, no.

755
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,160
It's him.

756
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,320
Oh, Jesus.

757
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,040
Oh my God,|it's him.

758
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,680
He's in the pool.

759
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,880
Oh my God!

760
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,040
Jacob, get out|of the pool now!

761
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,120
Oh my God.|That's him.

762
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,120
- Get away from that man.|- Why is everybody running to the pool?

763
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Brooke?|Jake?

764
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,880
Dale, you'd better|get over here.

765
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,320
Get out of the pool!

766
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,160
Where's your sister?

767
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,400
Why'd we have to get out, Mom?

768
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,200
I'm scared.

769
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,720
- What did he do?|- What's going on?

770
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm scared.

771
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,000
Um, why the|police is here?

772
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,920
Um, there's a man over there who|doesn't have a ticket to get in,

773
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,560
so they're asking|him to go home.

774
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,680
Mr. McGorvey.|Mr. McGorvey.

775
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,640
lt'd be wise for you to get|out of the pool at this time.

776
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,920
Did that man|go near you?

777
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,600
You're sure he|didn't touch you?

778
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,200
Step out of|the pool, sir.

779
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,680
I was only trying|to cool off.

780
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,040
All right,|let's go.

781
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,720
You can go back in the pool.

782
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,280
Bear with us, please. You|know what that sounds means.

783
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,880
Let's go. Out of the pool.|We're closing her up. Let's go.

784
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Exit the pool and vacate|the grounds immediately.

785
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Okay, I'll see|you tomorrow.

786
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,400
You're going to carry her?|Come on, put her in the stroller.

787
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,680
No, she won't do the stroller.

788
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,160
- Really?|- No, she will not do this.

789
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,360
Lucy, would you like to go|in the stroller?

790
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,000
Can I interest you in a stroller?|lt appears she'd like a stroller.

791
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,520
It's out of|your way.

792
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,840
No, it's fine.|You don't mind, do you, Aaron?

793
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,120
Run!

794
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,240
You'd better come inside.|You can't walk home in this.

795
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,280
Oh!

796
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,280
- You can put him down in Lucy's room.|- Okay.

797
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,120
This is amazing.

798
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,800
She never naps.

799
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,160
Well, he'll be|out for the next two hours.

800
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,800
We'll have to get him out|of that nightgown, though,

801
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,960
before he wakes up|or he'll never forgive me.

802
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,120
Nice place.

803
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,040
- You think so?|- Yeah.

804
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,920
Well, Richard does|all right for himself.

805
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,000
What's he do, again?

806
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,560
Lies. Um, please have a seat.|Make yourself comfortable.

807
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,200
Better not,|l might ruin your furniture.

808
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,120
I'll put these things in the dryer|and get us some towels.

809
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,000
Okay.

810
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Oh, God!

811
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,080
Oh, God!

812
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,120
Do you feel bad|about this?

813
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,600
No, I don't.

814
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,560
I do.

815
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,320
I feel really bad.

816
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,040
Okay.

817
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Son?

818
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,760
Son?

819
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,520
Be well.

820
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,280
May knew it wasn't natural

821
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,160
for a grown man|to be living with his mother.

822
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200
No hobbies,|no diversions.

823
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,200
lt was like he was|still in prison.

824
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,200
What he needed|was a girlfriend,

825
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,080
and May intended to|help him find one.

826
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,200
There are four whole columns|of lonely women here,

827
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,840
and only a handful of men.|The odds are on our side.

828
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,240
Why wouldn't one of|these women want

829
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,080
to meet a nice|person like you?

830
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,520
I'm not|a nice person.

831
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,080
You did a bad thing.

832
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,360
But that doesn't mean|you're a bad person.

833
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,840
I have a psychosexual|disorder.

834
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,240
You're better now.

835
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,240
They wouldn't have let|you out if you weren't.

836
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,720
They let me out|because they had to.

837
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,240
Well, maybe|if you found

838
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,680
a girlfriend closer|to your own age

839
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,560
you wouldn't have|the bad urges so often.

840
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,120
I don't want a girlfriend|my own age, Mommy.

841
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,920
I wish I did.

842
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,920
What are you going|to do when I'm gone?

843
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,360
Who's going to|take care of you?

844
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
What's the matter,|Mommy?

845
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,560
Are you sick|or something?

846
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm an old woman.|I'm not going to live forever,

847
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,120
Who's going to cook|for you?

848
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,040
Who's going|to wash the dishes?

849
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,520
I can wash|the dishes,

850
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,480
You've never washed|a dish in your life.

851
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,200
I could do it if I had to.|I'm not a retard.

852
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,880
No, you're not.

853
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,080
You're a miracle,|Ronnie.

854
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,800
We're all miracles.

855
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,520
You know why?

856
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,800
Because as humans,

857
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,720
everyday we go|about our business,

858
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,320
and all that time

859
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,360
we know, we all know

860
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,720
that the things|we love,

861
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,360
the people we love...

862
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,120
at any time, it can|all be taken away.

863
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,160
We live knowing that

864
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,080
and we keep|going anyway.

865
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,080
Animals don't do that.

866
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,800
Now I'm not asking you|to get married, Ronnie.

867
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,920
I'm just saying put an ad in the paper,|see what happens.

868
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,240
Fine. I'll do it if|it will make you happy.

869
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,880
But just one date.|All right?

870
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,000
You have a nice smile,|why don't we start with that?

871
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,120
What else?

872
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,600
You always eat what I put in front|of you. You never complain.

873
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,480
What else?

874
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,280
You're trying to|get back in shape.

875
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,080
You exercise.

876
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,240
Wait right there,|young man.

877
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,760
lf you're going out|for some exercise,

878
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,440
you can post this now.

879
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,760
Hmm.

880
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
Mmm.

881
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,080
Come on.

882
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,680
Let's do it again.

883
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,560
All right.

884
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,400
God, it's hot|as hell up here.

885
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,680
What's wrong with|the laundry room?

886
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,920
No mattress.

887
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,040
Come on.|Lie down.

888
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,040
You're nervous,|aren't you?

889
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,920
What?|What do you mean?

890
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,800
The game.

891
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,280
Don't worry.|You'll be great tonight.

892
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,080
I don't know.|l haven't played in 10 years.

893
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,840
lt used to be|my whole life.

894
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,640
Then when I stopped,|l just...

895
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,960
stopped. I didn't|even miss it.

896
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,120
Now that I'm playing|again, l....

897
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,800
feel l--

898
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,160
I don't know.

899
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
You feel alive.

900
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,760
Yeah.

901
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,360
That's good.

902
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,360
That's how you're|supposed to feel.

903
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,040
You're right.

904
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,240
I guess it's just|been awhile.

905
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,160
Yeah.

906
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
Shake.

907
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,360
- Call it.|- Heads.

908
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,080
Heads it is.

909
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,080
Ready?

910
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,440
- Hello?|- Hi, Mom. Did I wake you?

911
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,360
Oh, no honey.|ls everything okay?

912
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

913
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,920
You don't|sound fine.

914
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,360
No, there's nothing wrong.|l just wanted to say hi.

915
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,880
Well, hi.

916
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,280
Hi.

917
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,920
So how's my|little guy?

918
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,080
He's great.|He's sleeping right here next to me.

919
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,920
He's such|a cutie.

920
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,960
So where's Brad?

921
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Brad's out.

922
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,920
Oh, I'm surprised|the library stays open this late.

923
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,640
Well, he's not|at the library.

924
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,200
He's playing football|with some buddies.

925
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,040
Oh, honey. Do you remember when|your father took up golf?

926
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,800
He's not|like dad.

927
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,200
Honey, they're|all the same.

928
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,520
Well, he's not.

929
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,640
You work so hard.

930
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,040
Now listen...

931
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,480
I could keep an eye|on the boys when you're at work;

932
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,120
make sure they're|staying out of trouble.

933
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,480
- Do you want me to come up for a visit?|- No no, Mom, don't come.

934
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,080
Well, honey, I worry|about you kids.

935
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,320
Now what are you going to do if he|fails the test again?

936
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,920
He's not going|to fail the test.

937
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,720
Oh, honey,|that's what you said last time.

938
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,440
Now how are you|doing for money?

939
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,160
We're fine.

940
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,240
I'm going to send you a little|extra this month.

941
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,040
- Mom...|- Honey, it's no burden.

942
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,280
- Mom... Mom, please.|- I'm happy to help.

943
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,040
Aw, shit.

944
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,440
Although the Guardians|lost by 26 points,

945
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,440
Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar|after the game.

946
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,600
He could feel a new respect|in the way the cops looked at him.

947
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,840
- What you drinking, buddy?|- He wasn't on probation anymore.

948
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,160
He was a member|of the team.

949
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,840
lce and Advil.

950
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,120
lf all else fails, you can always see|the team physician,

951
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,560
Dr. Daniels.|All his friends call him Jack.

952
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,880
- To the good doctor.|- Hear, hear.

953
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
- Larry? Here, you go Larry.|- Oh, thanks.

954
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,160
Let me just|grab a chair.

955
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,000
Oh, we just gave you a shot.|We just gave you a shot.

956
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,000
I had no business being|on that field tonight.

957
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,400
I let you down.

958
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,120
I let the whole|team down.

959
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,920
I'm slow and|I'm fat.

960
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,880
I let that guy|piss all over me.

961
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,560
Come on. That guy was offsides|the whole night.

962
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,880
Joanie left me.

963
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,920
Took the kids and went|to her mother's.

964
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,840
Jesus, Larry,|that's a tough break.

965
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,720
Oh, I deserved it.

966
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,800
Me and my big mouth.

967
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,000
I called her|a fucking whore,

968
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,040
right in front|of the kids.

969
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,120
Why did you do that?

970
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,160
Huh,|l don't know.

971
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,160
I was in a bad mood|or something.

972
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,000
Now I'm fucked.

973
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,480
Hey, did you hear|about the pervert?

974
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,520
He went swimming|at the town pool.

975
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,120
- What?|- Yeah.

976
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,720
- Who told you that?|- Nobody. I saw it myself.

977
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,920
- The town pool?|- Yeah, during the heatwave.

978
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,400
- The town pool?|- Yep.

979
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,200
Th-that place is|crawling with kids.

980
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,040
I mean, my boys|go there.

981
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,440
Yeah, well, you know what,|it was just that one time.

982
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,880
Um, he-- he won't be back.|The cops came.

983
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,800
Cops? What cops?|Anyone from the team?

984
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,320
Uh, no.

985
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,800
You sure?

986
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,160
- Anyone from the team show up there?|- No no.

987
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,000
- Yes or no!|- I'm saying no.

988
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,120
- No, nobody...|- Jesus Christ,

989
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,320
that little fucking weasel.

990
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,880
Larry, slow down.

991
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,120
Slow down, Larry!

992
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,880
- What now?|- Good evening, Mrs. McGorvey.

993
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,040
We were wondering|if Ronnie was home.

994
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,160
You leave him alone.

995
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,040
We just want a little|moment of his time. Just a little chat.

996
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,960
This is my house.|l pay the mortgage,

997
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,840
and I say who is|and isn't--

998
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,440
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

999
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,400
- Get your perverted ass down here now.|- I'm calling the police.

1000
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,760
I hear they're well-disposed|to child molesters.

1001
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,400
It's okay, Mommy.|Can I help you, gentlemen?

1002
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,160
Ronnie, you go|on upstairs.

1003
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,640
Larry, let him go. I think he gets|the point. We can go home now.

1004
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,640
You listen to me, you|little piece of shit.

1005
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,920
You stay the fuck away|from the town pool.

1006
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,960
- You hear me?|- You're a bully!

1007
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,480
My Ronnie would|never do what he did.

1008
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,800
That poor child|at the mall--

1009
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,320
what you did to him.

1010
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,840
Larry?

1011
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,200
Larry?

1012
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,640
Why did she|say that?

1013
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,240
Oh, don't pretend you|don't know about me.

1014
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,880
Everybody knows.|Everybody!

1015
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,120
Look, h-honestly,|l-- I don't know anything.

1016
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,840
I remember hearing|something...

1017
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,720
a few years ago|when we first moved here, but--

1018
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,720
something about|a-- a shooting

1019
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,960
at the mall.

1020
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,560
That's-- that's it.|That's all.

1021
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,000
I didn't even|know you then.

1022
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,480
I'm sorry.

1023
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
Sorry.

1024
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,960
It's okay.

1025
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,520
Dispatch said there|was a shooter loose at the mall.

1026
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,840
lt was 10 minutes|from the end of my shift.

1027
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,360
10 minutes and there would have|been someone else.

1028
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,160
I can still see that|boy's face staring up at me.

1029
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,920
Yeah, but--|but it was an accident.

1030
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,000
You were trying|to stop a guy,

1031
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,320
and the-- the boy|g-got caught

1032
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,040
in the crossfire,|right?

1033
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,880
No, I panicked.

1034
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,840
There was no shooter.

1035
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,840
Just the boy.

1036
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,080
Antoine Harris|was his name.

1037
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,000
He was big for his age,|only 1 3 years old.

1038
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,840
He was a good kid.|Thought it was a joke,

1039
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,800
waving around an air gun|at his friend

1040
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,480
in the Big 5.

1041
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,480
They were acting out some scene|from some movie they liked.

1042
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,560
Shop girl saw it|from across the way,

1043
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,040
called 911.

1044
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,000
Jesus, that's terrible.

1045
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,760
That...

1046
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,280
well, you didn't know.

1047
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,360
lt could have|been real.

1048
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,520
But it wasn't.

1049
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,120
His parents...

1050
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,640
uh, his parents--

1051
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,440
I had to...

1052
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,280
I was diagnosed with post-traumatic|stress syndrome

1053
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,480
by three different|psychiatrists.

1054
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,280
That's why I retired.

1055
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,080
I couldn't do|the job anymore.

1056
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,360
- So why don't you do something else?|- Like what?

1057
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,360
Drive a forklift|at Costco?

1058
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,520
Maybe you could|go back to school.

1059
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,640
I loved my job.

1060
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,040
I don't wanna do|anything else.

1061
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,120
You ever think about the term|''homeland security''?

1062
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,040
I mean,|really think about it?

1063
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,000
The day that|you found out

1064
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,560
that your father had|been killed in lraq,

1065
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,600
do you remember|that day?

1066
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,160
Can you talk|about that?

1067
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,360
You feel comfortable|talking about that?

1068
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,720
After the men came

1069
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,280
to tell my mom,

1070
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,760
I cried,

1071
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,240
but she didn't.

1072
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,040
She just went up|to her room

1073
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,000
and grabbed the pillows|off the bed,

1074
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,000
cut the tops off of them|with a pair scissors.

1075
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,600
There were feathers|all over the place.

1076
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
That must have really|frightened you.

1077
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,000
No, she was trying|to find the crown.

1078
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,640
The crown?

1079
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,640
The crown you leave|in your pillow

1080
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,040
when you've slept on it|for a long time.

1081
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,960
My--

1082
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,600
my father had|two crowns.

1083
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,120
Stop there.

1084
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,200
- You hungry?|- No.

1085
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,000
Mind if I get|some lunch?

1086
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,040
No, go ahead.

1087
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,520
Brad?

1088
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,120
Honey, you there?

1089
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,760
Pick up.|l know you're there.

1090
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,240
It's Aaron's nap time.

1091
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,080
Okay, I guess you guys|are out somewhere.

1092
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,680
Um...

1093
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,280
I love you both.

1094
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,440
Bye.

1095
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,640
I certainly did.

1096
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,040
Here we go.

1097
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
I don't know, Jean.|l don't think I'm up for this.

1098
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,440
Well, now don't|be silly.

1099
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,640
- lt'll be fun.|- Really?

1100
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,960
You're not the only|little sister here tonight.

1101
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,480
- Oh, that's good.|- Oh!

1102
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,600
Hi, would you|like a glass?

1103
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,240
Did anybody like this book?|Because I really just hated it.

1104
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,080
It's so depressing.

1105
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,240
She cheats on her husband|with two different guys,

1106
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,080
wastes all his money,|then kills herself with rat poison?

1107
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,040
Do I really need|to read this?

1108
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,840
Well, there is a lot|of good descriptive writing.

1109
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,840
It's supposed|to be depressing.

1110
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,800
It's a tragedy.

1111
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,160
Madame Bovary was undone|by a tragic flaw.

1112
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,120
What's her flaw?

1113
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,120
Blindness.|She didn't see

1114
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,320
that the men were|just using her.

1115
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,080
She just wants|a little romance in her life.

1116
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,720
- You can't blame her for that.|- It's about women's choices.

1117
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,400
Back then, a woman|didn't have a lot of choices.

1118
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,680
You could be a nun|or a wife.

1119
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,280
- That's all there was.|- Or a prostitute.

1120
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,480
She had a choice.

1121
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,160
She had a choice not|to cheat on her husband.

1122
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,120
I found it refreshing|to read about a woman

1123
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,000
reclaiming her sexuality.

1124
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,160
ls that a nice way|of saying she's a slut?

1125
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,960
Madame Bovary's|not a slut.

1126
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,920
She's one of the great|characters in Western literature.

1127
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,400
I was a little puzzled|by some of the sexual references.

1128
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,080
Look,|like this one.

1129
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,760
Um...

1130
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,320
''He abandoned|every last shred

1131
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,360
of restraint|and consideration.

1132
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,960
He turned her|into something compliant,

1133
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,440
something corrupt.''

1134
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,800
Does anyone know|what that means?

1135
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,560
lt means|she's a slut.

1136
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,560
ls he tying her up

1137
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,720
or something?

1138
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,200
Anal sex.

1139
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,560
Mm-hmm.|Mm-hmm.

1140
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,200
Did everyone get that|but me?

1141
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,120
Let's set that aside|for now.

1142
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
I'm really eager|to hear what

1143
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,040
our other little sister|has to say.

1144
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,800
I'm not sure if you know this,|but Sarah has a PhD

1145
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,760
in English lit.

1146
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,960
Just a masters.

1147
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,960
I never wrote|my dissertation.

1148
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Well, you still have|a lot more expertise

1149
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,400
than the rest of us.

1150
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,040
I think I understand|your feelings about this book.

1151
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,600
I used to have some|problems with it myself.

1152
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,600
When I read it|in grad school,

1153
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,640
Madame Bovary just|seemed like a fool.

1154
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,120
She marries|the wrong man,

1155
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,720
makes one foolish mistake|after another.

1156
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,440
But when I read it this time,|l just fell in love with her.

1157
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,080
She's trapped.

1158
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,000
She has a choice. She can either|accept a life of misery

1159
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,720
or she can struggle|against it.

1160
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,080
And she chooses|to struggle.

1161
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,280
Some struggle--|hop into bed

1162
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,280
with every guy|who says hello.

1163
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,000
Well, she fails in the end, but there's|something beautiful

1164
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,400
and even heroic|in her rebellion.

1165
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,040
My professors would|kill me for even thinking this,

1166
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,080
but...

1167
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,720
in her own|strange way,

1168
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,760
Emma Bovary|is a feminist.

1169
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,720
Oh, that's nice.

1170
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,560
So now cheating on your husband|makes you a feminist?

1171
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,160
No no no.

1172
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,920
It's not the cheating.|It's the hunger.

1173
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,240
The hunger|for an alternative,

1174
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,720
and the refusal to accept|a life of unhappiness.

1175
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,160
Maybe I didn't|understand the book.

1176
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,360
She just looks|so pathetic.

1177
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,120
ls she pretty?

1178
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,280
Who?

1179
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,920
Your wife.

1180
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,920
Degrading yourself|for nothing.

1181
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,560
It's a simple question.

1182
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,040
She's pretty, okay?|Do we have to talk about this now?

1183
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,720
I mean, did she really think a man like|that was gonna run away with her?

1184
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,280
Possibly.

1185
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,800
How pretty is she?

1186
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
A knockout.

1187
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,600
Beauty's overrated,|Sarah.

1188
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,840
Brad had meant this|to be comforting.

1189
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,560
But at 3:00 in the morning, it had|precisely the opposite effect.

1190
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,920
He had a beautiful wife,

1191
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,640
a knockout, and she was sleeping|beside him right now.

1192
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,320
Only someone who took|his own beauty for granted

1193
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,000
would have been able|to say something so stupid

1194
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,200
and with a straight face.

1195
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,040
Weekends were difficult|for Sarah.

1196
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,640
48-hour prison stretches

1197
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,560
separating one happy blur|of weekdays

1198
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,720
from the rest.

1199
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,120
I'm going to the ocean.

1200
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,800
- You are?|- I'm going to the ocean.

1201
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,000
ls he doing|his ocean dance?

1202
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,840
Sarah sometimes let herself|be carried away by fantasies

1203
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,640
of a future very different from the life|she was living now,

1204
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,040
in which she and Brad were|free to love each other

1205
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,880
in broad daylight;

1206
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,560
where they had no one|to answer to

1207
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,040
but each other.

1208
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,800
lt could happen,|she thought. It had to,

1209
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,240
because she wasn't sure she|could keep living like this

1210
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,880
for very much longer.

1211
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,120
Open your mouth again.

1212
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,080
No, I don't want to.

1213
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,040
May your mouth|be open.

1214
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,040
May your mouth.

1215
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,520
This is coming|into your mouth.

1216
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,160
Open your mouth,|little fishy.

1217
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,640
Hungry, hungry.

1218
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,920
Little fishy|is not hungry?

1219
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,880
You okay?

1220
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,760
Yeah, fine.

1221
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,080
- How about you?|- Great.

1222
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,840
So how was|your weekend?

1223
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,360
You really wanna know?|lt sucked.

1224
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,400
How was yours?

1225
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,600
Terrible.

1226
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,080
- Really?|- Yeah.

1227
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,440
Yeah, we went to the beach|and all Kathy and I did

1228
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,160
was argue|the whole time.

1229
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,680
Oh, you did?

1230
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,040
Yeah, it was our|annual argument

1231
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,040
over taking|the bar exam,

1232
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,160
like our whole life|depends on it.

1233
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,720
Get it over with.|You'll feel better.

1234
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,960
It's this whole thing.

1235
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,360
Gotta take a train|on Wednesday.

1236
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,280
It's a two-day ordeal.

1237
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,760
I'm not even|gonna pass.

1238
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,160
- You'll be fine.|- No.

1239
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,160
No, I won't.

1240
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,680
I haven't cracked|a book all summer.

1241
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,600
I missed you.

1242
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,320
I missed you, too.

1243
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,040
Don't-- don't do it.

1244
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,400
- What?|- The test.

1245
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,120
- Oh.|- Blow it off.

1246
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,760
We should go somewhere,

1247
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,800
just for a night,|you know?

1248
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,600
Richard's out|of town till Friday,

1249
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,800
and I'm sure I can get|a sitter for Lucy.

1250
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,160
No, I can't do that.

1251
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,720
I gotta take the test.

1252
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,080
That's good.

1253
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,760
- Looks good?|- Yeah.

1254
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
Well, I have a good|feeling about this whole thing.

1255
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,800
ln fact, I think I'm gonna go buy|a bottle of champagne

1256
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,040
and put it in the fridge,|and we can open it to celebrate

1257
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,760
when we get|the good news.

1258
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,840
Don't get your hopes up.

1259
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,880
We've been|through this before.

1260
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,920
Huh-uh. This time's|gonna be different.

1261
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,040
I can feel it.

1262
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,960
Can you believe it?|This is our first date.

1263
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,080
Like a date, you know,|without the kids, I mean.

1264
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,400
How was Lucy?|Did she cry or anything?

1265
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,640
No, are you kidding?

1266
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,400
With Jean there, she|just about shoved me out the door.

1267
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,880
I thought we could make something|really beautiful.

1268
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,120
I have so|many things here.

1269
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,800
We could make...

1270
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,040
a picture frame.

1271
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,680
Or a jewelry box.

1272
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,800
Or a hat.

1273
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,960
Something for my mommy.

1274
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Okay.

1275
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,080
- Stop it, stop it.|- No, Ronnie.

1276
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,880
Ron-- Ron-- Ronnie,|just hold on.

1277
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,120
Now there.

1278
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,520
You look handsome.|She won't be disappointed.

1279
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,640
Wait'll she hears|about my criminal record.

1280
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,040
I don't think you need|to get into that just yet.

1281
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,160
Why don't you stick|to small talk?

1282
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,160
What if someone|recognizes me?

1283
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,760
That's highly unlikely.|l made the dinner reservation

1284
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,160
at a restaurant over|in Haverhill.

1285
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,040
Sheila.

1286
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,960
- Sheila.|- Yeah.

1287
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,880
Something wrong|with the food?

1288
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,720
No, it's fine.

1289
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,640
Back at the house you|mentioned you were on medication.

1290
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,560
- What kind?|- All kinds.

1291
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,600
Mostly psychotropic.

1292
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,080
So you had some kind|of a breakdown?

1293
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:02,040
Mm-hmm, my junior year|in college.

1294
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,160
You were that young?

1295
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,120
What happened?

1296
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:11,000
I don't really know.

1297
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,040
Well, nervous breakdowns|don't just come out of nowhere.

1298
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,800
Something must have|caused it.

1299
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,400
I guess.

1300
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,440
But I was fine before|l left for college.

1301
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,400
I don't know.|Maybe it was the stress

1302
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,240
of being on my own.

1303
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,000
Maybe it's a chemical|imbalance in my brain.

1304
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,360
Every psychiatrist I go to|has a different opinion.

1305
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,600
This one guy, Dr. Faris,

1306
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,400
he said I must have been|sexually abused as a child.

1307
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,080
When I told him|l wasn't,

1308
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,640
he said I must be|repressing the memory.

1309
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,440
Right, um, so what|happened after that?

1310
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,320
Did you drop out|of school?

1311
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,160
Not right away.

1312
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,400
My mother wanted me|to go

1313
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,520
to the campus|counseling center.

1314
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,000
And they wanted|the problem fixed, like I could just

1315
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,000
snap my fingers and everything|would be okay again.

1316
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,560
Yeah, I know|all about that.

1317
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,000
You do?

1318
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,640
Yes, I do.

1319
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,440
So they said|l could leave school

1320
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,120
and get married and have lots of kids|like my sisters,

1321
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,320
and I can't take care|of kids.

1322
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,800
I can't even take care|of myself

1323
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,040
most of the time.|Besides, who's gonna marry me?

1324
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,440
You're not so bad.

1325
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,480
What?

1326
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,240
You're--|you're not so bad.

1327
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,560
I haven't had|a real boyfriend in six years,

1328
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,640
not since my second|breakdown.

1329
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,400
I had this thing happen|on a Greyhound bus.

1330
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,600
- I was--|- Do you want me to wrap that up?

1331
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,320
Oh, no, thank you.

1332
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,160
No, wrap it up, please.|I'll take it home.

1333
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,960
Folks gonna want dessert?

1334
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,120
What do you say, Sheila?|You wanna share something sweet?

1335
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,520
Let's make a little stop.

1336
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,320
Take the next left.

1337
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,520
Turn off the lights.

1338
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,160
I had|a nice time tonight.

1339
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,880
The last guy|l went out with,

1340
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,720
you know what he did?

1341
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,600
He ditched me.

1342
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,680
He got up to go|to the men's room,

1343
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,760
never came back.

1344
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,160
Stuck me with the check.

1345
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,560
Never said goodbye.

1346
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,680
Never called|to apologize.

1347
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,160
He wasn't my type anyway.|He was a big-shot CPA.

1348
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,800
Super normal guy.|Didn't want to be dating some psycho.

1349
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,760
But you seem like|a nice person.

1350
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,320
Better not tell on me.

1351
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,640
You hear me?

1352
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,160
You better not tell,|or I'll fucking get you.

1353
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,680
Hold on, Mom.|Hold on, Dad.

1354
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:16,280
You should park the car|on the escalator, and back...

1355
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,800
- So?|- What?

1356
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,800
- Up, down and then up.|- Test, dummy. How'd it go?

1357
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,840
lt was all right.

1358
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,080
You didn't call home|last night.

1359
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:30,720
I was worried.

1360
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,880
Go on the escalator.

1361
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,960
Guess I could really use|that cell phone.

1362
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,760
Go on the escalator.

1363
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,000
Go on the escalator.

1364
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,640
- Well, look who's back.|- Oh, hi.

1365
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,080
Hi, Jean.

1366
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,080
Thanks.

1367
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,040
You're a lifesaver.

1368
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,040
So how was|your old roommate?

1369
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,320
Oh, great.

1370
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,240
Yeah, thanks for doing this|on such short notice.

1371
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,720
Let me give you something|for your time.

1372
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,120
That's not necessary.

1373
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,440
No, really.|l insist.

1374
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,400
Please don't.

1375
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,200
Okay.

1376
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,600
Uh, any calls?

1377
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,160
Nope,|it was very quiet.

1378
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,760
She's asleep on your bed.|lt was a very busy day.

1379
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,600
That's great.

1380
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,720
Um, Jean,|is everything okay?

1381
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,720
Yeah, she's|a wonderful child.

1382
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,040
Mommy.

1383
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,040
Mommy!

1384
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,760
Yeah.

1385
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,120
Are you coming?

1386
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,360
- I have something.|- What?

1387
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,560
I have something|for you.

1388
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,040
Just give me|a second here, okay?

1389
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,000
Brad.

1390
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,960
Brad.

1391
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,080
Hmm.

1392
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,800
Aaron's been telling me|about his new friend Lucy.

1393
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,320
She sounds like|a sweet little girl.

1394
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,960
What's her mother like?

1395
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,640
Nice enough, I guess.

1396
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,160
I can't even|remember her name.

1397
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,080
lsn't it Sarah?

1398
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,160
Sarah?

1399
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,440
Yeah, Sarah,

1400
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,040
from the pool.

1401
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,400
Her daughter's name|is Lucy.

1402
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,920
Oh, Lucy's mom.|Yeah, I forgot. That's right.

1403
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,680
Her name is Sarah.

1404
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,000
Hmm.

1405
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,040
Yeah, it might be|really nice for Aaron

1406
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,320
if they came over|for dinner.

1407
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,400
Okay.

1408
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:01,040
So you're|in advertising?

1409
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,880
No, that's-- that's|a common misconception.

1410
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,920
I'm not in advertising.|I'm in branding.

1411
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,080
And that's very different.

1412
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,080
Richard's pretty high up|in the company.

1413
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,080
Yeah yeah,|l have these clients

1414
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,040
and they'll come to me|when they have,

1415
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,200
you know, a new product|they wanna sell.

1416
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:19,720
Like, um, these guys,|they were in a couple weeks ago.

1417
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,840
They're trying to open this chain|of Chinese restaurants, right?

1418
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,240
They're talking to me|and l-- I look down at the table

1419
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,680
and I realize that none|of these guys were Chinese.

1420
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,640
Where were they from?

1421
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,800
They're a bunch of fat cats|from Tennessee.

1422
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,480
They think they can start a chain|of Chinese restaurants good enough

1423
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,480
to fool the average|American boob.

1424
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,560
Oh, God.

1425
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,120
Mmm!

1426
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,080
- This is delicious.|- lsn't it?

1427
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,840
Brad's a fantastic cook.

1428
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,080
So you guys see these|fliers with the guy's face

1429
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,120
plastered all over|our village?

1430
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,680
Lots of Sturm und Drang|in our quiet little town, huh?

1431
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,320
Yeah, it's crazy.

1432
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,040
What I want to know is why they let|a creep like that out of prison.

1433
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,920
Some of the people|going after him are just as crazy.

1434
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,920
- What do you mean?|- Well, just today I heard that

1435
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,160
some nut's been spray-painting|the poor guy's house,

1436
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,280
lighting fires on his porch.|God knows what else.

1437
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,280
- Do they know who's doing it?|- Huh-uh.

1438
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,280
They think|it's some ex-cop.

1439
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,400
You know, that guy|who killed that kid at the mall.

1440
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,160
Yeah, I don't think|it's him.

1441
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,080
You're biased.|You're friends with the guy.

1442
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,160
Brad's on that Committee|of Concerned Parents

1443
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,760
with him.

1444
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,600
I didn't know|you were on that.

1445
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,040
I play on his|football team.

1446
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,360
He asked me to distribute|some fliers.

1447
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,480
He's on your team.

1448
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,480
You never told me that.

1449
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,120
Yeah.

1450
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,080
You know what's weird?|I've never even seen this McGorvey guy.

1451
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,440
- We did.|- No, we didn't.

1452
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,480
Not you.|Me and Brad.

1453
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,600
That day at the pool,|remember?

1454
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,920
Yeah, l-l|totally forgot.

1455
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,080
- Well, what happened?|- Sexual tension is an elusive thing,

1456
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,520
but Kathy had|pretty good radar for it.

1457
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,080
lt was like someone had|turned a knob a hair to the right,

1458
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,800
and the radio station|clicked in so loud and clear

1459
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,600
it almost|knocked her over.

1460
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:17,160
Once she became aware|of the connection between them,

1461
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,160
it seemed impossible that|she'd missed it before.

1462
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,960
On a hunch,|Kathy dropped her fork

1463
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,040
in the hopes that|while retrieving it

1464
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:28,520
she would catch Sarah|and Brad playing footsie,

1465
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,000
- but she was mistaken.|- Asked him to leave, and he left.

1466
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,160
But you know what?|He didn't look scary, right? I mean--

1467
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,000
No, it-- it wasn't that big|of a deal, you know.

1468
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,880
- No, he's like a regular guy, you know?|- Yeah, I mean--

1469
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,960
Kathy, are you okay?

1470
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,920
Uh, yeah.

1471
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:47,120
Just a sec.

1472
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,760
Brad had convinced|himself

1473
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,160
the dinner party|had gone well.

1474
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,840
That he and Sarah had managed|to put Kathy's suspicions to rest,

1475
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,120
at least temporarily.

1476
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,200
She certainly hadn't|accused him of anything,

1477
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,200
or behaved in a way|that made him think

1478
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,280
she'd noticed|anything untoward.

1479
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,160
I'm really glad|they came over.

1480
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,800
- Good night.|- Good night.

1481
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,520
Two days later, however,

1482
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,920
his mother-in-law showed up|for a surprise visit...

1483
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,880
- Thank you, John.|- ...of ominously indeterminate length.

1484
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,680
And from that moment on,|she accompanied Brad

1485
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,440
and Aaron everywhere:

1486
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,320
To the playground;

1487
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,280
- We need some butter.|- To the supermarket;

1488
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,920
And to the town pool.

1489
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,560
Hi, Aaron.

1490
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,960
Hi, Lucy.

1491
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:50,040
The worst of it|was the pool.

1492
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,920
Nevertheless,|after threatening all week

1493
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,080
to go the football game,|Brad's mother-in-law decided against it

1494
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,080
at the last minute.

1495
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,200
- So are you coming?|- Well, I'd like to,

1496
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,200
but I'm a little tired.

1497
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,640
You sure?|You're welcome to.

1498
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,640
No, go ahead.|You and Aaron

1499
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:09,000
sure kept me hopping|this afternoon.

1500
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,160
Looks like|you're on your own.

1501
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,160
Oh, that's my ride.

1502
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,880
- What time are you gonna be home?|- I don't know.

1503
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,600
Pretty late, though.

1504
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,640
Be careful and stay|out of trouble.

1505
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,200
Winds whisper|of high hopes,

1506
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,400
victory is in the skies.

1507
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,880
One joins with many|on the summer's green field.

1508
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,120
At 0 and 5, the Guardians|were the basement dwellers

1509
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,960
of the Tri-County|Touch Football Night League.

1510
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,880
The Controllers, a team of young|hotshots from the financial district

1511
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,800
were 4 and 1|with an explosive offense

1512
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,160
that regularly racked up|40 to 50 points a game.

1513
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,160
But from|the opening kickoff,

1514
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:04,800
this ragtag group|of law enforcement officers

1515
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,080
decided to crunch|their own numbers.

1516
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,080
But the Controllers|scored first

1517
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,160
after recovering|a Bart Williams fumble

1518
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,080
deep in Guardians' territory near|the end of the second quarter.

1519
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,880
The Guardians evened things up early|in the second half...

1520
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,000
moving methodically|downfield

1521
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,120
on an 80-yard|touchdown drive.

1522
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:41,440
The Controllers regained the lead|with a fourth quarter field goal.

1523
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:45,040
With less than a minute|to go, trailing by three,

1524
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,120
the Guardians faced|the extinction of their hopes.

1525
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,800
- Down!|- It was their last chance--

1526
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,200
4th and 5|on their own 35.

1527
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,000
Set!

1528
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,920
Hut, hut!

1529
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,800
Yeah yeah yeah!

1530
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,120
Yeah yeah!

1531
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,160
Yeah yeah!

1532
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,080
Yeah!

1533
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,880
Oh my God!

1534
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,920
Yeah!

1535
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,960
Brad, Brad!

1536
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,640
What do you want?

1537
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:08,280
Everyone is waiting for us at the bar.|Are-- are-- are you coming?

1538
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,600
Why don't you go on ahead?|I'll catch up later.

1539
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,200
You're gonna come, right?|l mean, we gotta celebrate.

1540
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,080
Yeah yeah yeah,|I'll be there.

1541
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:18,120
- You promise?|- Jesus, Larry, I just told you.

1542
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,360
- Well, you got a ride?|- Yeah.

1543
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,520
Okay.

1544
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,680
I'll have a cold one|waiting for you.

1545
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,800
Larry, you have|to go home now.

1546
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,040
Just give me five more minutes.|He promised he was coming.

1547
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,080
I don't care what he promised,|l want to lock up.

1548
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,080
Now get your butt|out of here!

1549
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,920
Now!

1550
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:54,520
When I looked up there|and saw you it was just...

1551
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,960
wow... wow.

1552
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,160
Thank God you came.

1553
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,520
I don't want|to go home.

1554
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,040
I want to stay|right here forever.

1555
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,880
No, I do.|For the first time in my life

1556
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,600
I feel like anything is possible.|Like I can do anything, you know?

1557
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,480
What are we doing?

1558
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,080
What do you mean?

1559
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,160
It's not real, Brad.

1560
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,120
What?

1561
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:32,040
This. It's wrong|and it's weird.

1562
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,760
How long are we|gonna sneak around together?

1563
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,880
How long can that last?|l can't do this anymore.

1564
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,200
No, no don't|say that.

1565
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,040
As long as I know that|we're gonna have this--

1566
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:42,400
Have what?

1567
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,480
What is this?

1568
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,760
Look...

1569
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,600
if that dinner at your house|was any indication,

1570
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,560
you seem pretty happy|with your wife.

1571
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,160
You know, you have|a perfect life

1572
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,200
- and I don't wanna to be the--|- Okay, stop stop stop.

1573
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,520
Run away with me.

1574
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,400
What?

1575
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,040
You don't mean that.

1576
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:13,760
You believe in me.

1577
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,120
Come on.

1578
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,280
We'll go away,|figure this thing out.

1579
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,640
It's not weird.

1580
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,640
The kids are comfortable|with each other.

1581
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,840
I know there's more|to it than that, but...

1582
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,440
let's do this.

1583
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,920
Please.|Please, Sarah.

1584
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:40,040
Oh my God.

1585
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,680
You really mean|it, don't you?

1586
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,160
Yes.

1587
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,840
Okay.

1588
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,480
Okay. Okay.|Yes!

1589
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,320
Yes!|Okay, yes.

1590
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:04,280
Fucking Brad, I'm so|sick of hearing about Brad.

1591
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,080
I'm fucking over it.

1592
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,280
I don't even like him.|He's a loser.

1593
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,080
''Brad made|the fucking touchdown.''

1594
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,080
Yeah, you know why|he hasn't the balls to show up here?

1595
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:17,160
'Cause I fucking made the block.|It's bullshit.

1596
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,080
That's why he's not even here,|he's fucking embarrassed to see me.

1597
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:24,840
I don't even like anybody|in this fucking town.

1598
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,960
Wake up, wake up!

1599
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,080
Wake up, Woodward Court!

1600
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,640
Okay, I'm awake.

1601
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:49,120
Open your eyes! Get your goddamn heads|out of the sand!

1602
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,600
My heads?|My goddamn heads?

1603
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,720
Don't you people|love your children?

1604
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,920
Don't you want|to protect them from evil?

1605
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,120
Woodward Court,|there's a pervert in your midst!

1606
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
There's a goddamn|pervert in your midst!

Wake up|and see the grass!

1610
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,880
- Just stay inside, Ronnie.|- Save the children!

1611
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,640
Open your goddamn eyes!

Wake up and save|your children!

1613
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,440
You dirty son of a bitch!|Get off my lawn!

1614
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,560
Who the hell do you think you are,|Mr. High and Mighty?

1615
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,040
No perverts|in Woodward Court!

1616
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,000
No perverts|in Woodward Court!

1617
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,680
You think you're God?|Far from it!

1618
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:33,160
I don't think I'm God!|l never said I was!

1619
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,000
You murderer, you|killed the boy.

1620
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,720
I didn't murder anyone. Now why don't|you go back inside, put some clothes on?

1621
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,920
You shot him through the neck.|l read it in the paper.

1622
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,760
- No perverts in--|- You son of a bitch. Give me that.

1623
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,000
Hey hey!

1624
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,320
Give me that!|You're--

1625
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,200
- You need to go home.|- The police are coming.

1626
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,680
I mean, you're|scaring my kids.

1627
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,040
Your kids need|to be frightened!

1628
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,800
They live across|the street from a pervert!

1629
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,640
Ow! Oh!

1630
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,680
Oh my God, Mrs. McGorvey.|Are you okay?

1631
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:05,800
May. May!

1632
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,040
May-- I think we should|call an ambulance.

1633
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,440
Karen, call an|ambulance, right now!

1634
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,760
- I'm doing it!|- Oh, fuck.

1635
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,480
- May!|- This is all I need.

1636
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Excuse me, Mr. McGorvey,|we need to ask you some questions.

1637
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,520
$14.35.

1638
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,800
The Fed continuing its|campaign against inflation

1639
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,480
by raising short-term interest rates|for the 10th time yesterday.

1640
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,160
Usually there is a correlation between|inflation and gold prices.

1641
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,080
Let's take you over|to our stocks desk...

1642
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,400
Cafe con leche?

1643
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,080
Thank you.

1644
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:47,080
Kim Bryson, please call|the operator.

1645
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:50,040
Kim Bryson, please call|the operator.

1646
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,080
Madre.

1647
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:01,080
Me too.|She's resting.

1648
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,040
Get down, knock it off!

1649
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,120
Quiet.

1650
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,120
Bring him around.

1651
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:02,480
It's all yours.

1652
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,280
Mr. McGorvey.

1653
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,200
Mr. McGorvey.

1654
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,720
I'm afraid we|have some bad news.

1655
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:06,120
Do you have a mortuary|to make arrangements for you?

1656
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:12,000
It's not a problem. The hospital has|a list that I can provide you with.

1657
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,200
Here's what's|going to happen:

1658
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,000
Your mother's body|will remain in her bed

1659
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,640
for up to three hours.

1660
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,920
Three hours is typical.

1661
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,600
But if there's a request for more time,|depending on our occupancy,

1662
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,840
that's usually|not a problem.

1663
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,560
lf there's anyone|you need to call--

1664
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,960
family, friends--

1665
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,400
they're welcome to full|bedside visitation privileges

1666
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,360
before the body is taken|downstairs

1667
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,240
to be prepped|for transport.

1668
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:43,200
Do you have any questions|that come to mind?

1669
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,880
Anything I can|help you with?

1670
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,040
- No.|- Okay.

1671
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:58,040
I'd like to remind you to take your|mother's personal belongings with you

1672
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,160
before you leave|the hospital today.

1673
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,800
And all I need from you now

1674
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,960
is to sign this release-|of-remains form.

1675
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,440
Aaron.

1676
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,520
Hey hey, buddy.

1677
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,600
Can you wake up?

1678
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:32,040
Could you take your|hat off for me?

1679
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,800
Just for a second.

1680
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:43,000
Are you mad|at me, Daddy?

1681
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:47,160
No.|No no no, not at all.

1682
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:51,200
I just want you to know

1683
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,120
that I love you very much,

1684
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:59,000
and I would never do|anything to hurt you, okay?

1685
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,640
Okay.

1686
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:11,120
Now you can go|back to sleep.

1687
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,200
Lucy, come on.

1688
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:17,200
Let's go.

1689
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:20,000
I will not go|in the car seat!

1690
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,200
- You have to go in the car--|- I will not go in the car seat!

1691
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,520
Yes, you will!

1692
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,840
- You will go in the car seat.|- No, I won't!

1693
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:29,360

1695
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:35,000
Okay, just...

1696
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:39,480

1697
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,040
You can just go here.|No, actually...

1698
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,560

Okay, go down on the floor.|You have to stay down, okay?

1700
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,720
Mommy is gonna get arrested.|Just stay down, okay?

1701
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,960
Okay.

1702
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:12,360
Mommy, I want to go home.

1703
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,000
Yeah, in a minute,

1704
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:17,000
as soon as Brad gets here.

1705
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:33,560
Hello?

1706
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:39,840

Yeah, give it a shot.|See what happens.

You guys are crazy,|l can't do that.

1718
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:01,920
It's not about that,|it's about skating.

1719
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,520
Whoo!

Come on.|Come on.

1721

Do you need help?

She's g-- gone.

She loved me.

1729
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,240
She's the only one.

1730
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,160
Mommy died.

1731
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,800

What happened to me?

1752
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:29,120
These kids say you've been|out cold for the last five minutes.

02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:32,560
- You almost had it.|- Dude, you were awesome.

1754
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:36,440
- That shit was gnarly, son.|- Back up, back up! Give him some space.

1755
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,520
You just hold still, all right?|Hold still.

1756
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,400
Hey, bro!

1757
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,240
Here, this fell|out of your pocket.

1758
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,600
I don't need it anymore.

1759
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:55,280
- Hey, Duane.|- Hm?

1760
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,240
Could you call my wife?

1761
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,200
You got it, buddy.

1762
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,400
Here we go.

1763
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,800
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

1764
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,520
I really am.

1765
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:39,760
I never wanted anything|like this to happen.

1766
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,280
Are-- are you--|are you okay?

1767
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:10,960
- Oh, no!|- Gonna be good now.

1768
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,960
Oh my God!

1769
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,000
Hold on, Ronnie.

1770
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:24,120
You hold on.

1771
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,920
I'm not gonna let|anything happen to you.

1772
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:29,480
You hold on there,|okay, buddy?

1773
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,440
ln his wildest dreams

1774
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:38,400
Larry would never have imagined|he'd once again be in this position,

1775
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:41,920
where precious|minutes count.

1776
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:44,800
Tonight he could|save a life.

1777
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,400
He knew Ronnie had done|some bad things in the past,

1778
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:52,200
but so had Larry.

1779
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:55,080
You couldn't|change the past.

1780
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:01,560
But the future could|be a different story.

1781
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:12,880
And it had|to start somewhere.

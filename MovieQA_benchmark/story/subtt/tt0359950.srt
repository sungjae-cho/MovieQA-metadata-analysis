00:00:27,144 --> 00:01:07,344


3
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,081
Huh?

4
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,044
Hi! Todd Mahar,
eHarmony.

5
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,725
<i>How can I help you today?</i>

6
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,487
Hi. I can't seem to leave
a wink for someone.

7
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,880
I don't know,
is my page broken?

8
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,963
Do I maybe have
a broken page, or...

9
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,361
<i>I've never heard
of that, but, okay.</i>

10
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,960
<i>You're trying to use your eHarmony
account for the first time?</i>

11
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,367
I am. Okay.

12
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,841
<i>I'm looking at your profile.</i>

13
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,042
<i>We have a pretty intricate
matching algorithm.</i>

14
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,090
<i>That's what distinguishes us from
other online dating services.</i>

15
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,401
Yeah, I like that.

16
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,844
Actually, I'm just trying to
leave a wink for one person.

17
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,490
Cheryl Melhoff.

18
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,246
She started in my division
at work about a month ago...

19
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,688
and I overheard her near the bagels
saying she was on your site.

20
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,365
<i>Okay, that's unique.</i>

21
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,561
<i>But let me ask you.</i>

22
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,165
<i>You left a lot of this stuff...</i>

23
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,211
<i>like the "Been There, Done That"
section, you left it blank.</i>

24
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,084
Yeah, I think I skipped it.

25
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,045
<i>Okay, you got to
help me out here, man.</i>

26
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,611
<i>Don't skip stuff.</i>

27
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
Okay, well, I haven't
really been

28
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,766
anywhere noteworthy
or mentionable.

29
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>Have you done anything
noteworthy, mentionable?</i>

30
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,203
<i>Hello, you still there?</i>

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,409
Can you hang on a second?

32
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,242
Go, go, go! Get out! Get out!

33
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,210
She's gonna blow! Go! Go!

34
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,969
Chips! Over here!

35
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
Chips! Thank you!

36
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,401
How did you know
about the building?

37
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,289
I heard barking,
thought I smelled gas.

38
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,646
I hope it's okay.

39
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,370
I engineered
a prosthesis for Chips

40
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,081
while I was sprinting
down the stairwell.

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
A little hip-joint assembly

42
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,882
with a drop-ring lock and
an anterior pelvic band.

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,561
God, you're noteworthy!

44
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,929
Adventurous, Brave, Creative.

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
That's
everything I want in a man.

46
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,601
<i>"TODD". My man?</i>

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,564
<i>Hey, my man, you still there?</i>

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,926
Hey

49
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,249
<i>What? Did you pass out or...</i>

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,563
No, I just like,
zoned out for a second.

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,927
<i>Okay. Do you do that a lot?</i>

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,801
Normal amount, I guess.

53
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,446
Yeah, I got to run. Sorry.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,125
<i>Okay, but we need a lot more...</i>

55
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,927
Hey.Bad day to be late.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,491
We just got acquired.

57
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,369
What? Yeah, over the weekend.

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,648
Walter! Happy birthday!

59
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,761
Whoo-hoo!

60
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,842
He's 42 years old!

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,764
Odessa!
What are you doing here?

62
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,322
Mom made you your
favorite clementine cake.

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,130
Aren't you supposed to be
at the retirement place

64
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,645
with her getting the
piano moved in?

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,325
Yes, I was there.
It's like halfway done...

66
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,324
piano's out of the van, it's on
the street, everything's fine.

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,120
But I just got a phone
call about a really

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,850
big audition,
so can you go finish it?

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,048
No, I can't. I'm late.
Walter, I...

70
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't think you're seeing
this from what I need.

71
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,966
What do you need?

72
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,327
I need to be Rizzo in Grease.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,881
I don't understand that.

74
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,281
My audition! Rizzo! Rizzo?

75
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,448
Rizzo! She's tough and tender!

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,521
Do me a favor, please.

77
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,000
Make sure Mom's piano gets moved
in all the way. All right?

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,691
Don't go to Rizzo!

79
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,491
Oh, thanks, Walter.
Happy birthday!

80
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,563
Guess what?
We just got acquired.

81
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,841
Yeah, I heard.

82
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,215
Yeah, there's gonna be changes.

83
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,881
Downsizing of us into some kind
of dot-com thing, possibly.

84
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,803
I wonder how this
thing goes down,

85
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,883
how the transition's
gonna play out.

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,326
I could probably tell you.

87
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,326
Ted Hendricks, managing
director of the transition.

88
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,531
Hey. Tim Naughton. Sales.

89
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,201
Gary Mannheim, graphic design.

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,170
And what do you do, cake man?

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,641
Oh, uh...

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,802
The cake's just for today.
I'm not a cake man.

93
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,325
I do...

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
I deal dirctly...

95
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,246
"Dirctly"?

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,043
Directly with
LIFE'S photo units...

97
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,242
I'm sorry, I was really
getting into this song

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,243
and I stopped listening to you.

99
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,568
I was saying, you know who
looks good in a beard?

100
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,404
Dumbledore, not you.

101
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,081
Guy?

102
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,327
Guy?

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,925
What do you do?

104
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,091
I'm a negative asset manager.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,445
Worth the wait.

106
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,927
<i>Mind over matter</i>

107
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,930
Ted. Donny.

108
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,444
Feeling tough? Feeling good.

109
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,682
Well, got to make
some tough calls ahead.

110
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,321
You been here before, yeah?

111
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,401
Yeah, so this is it, huh?

112
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,289
Yeah, the "house of pictures."

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,881
Hey

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,882
Hi. How was your weekend?

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,441
I had an awesome weekend.

116
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,924
And what did
you do this weekend?

117
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,129
Um... Let's see.

118
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,491
I bathed in Arctic
mountain water...

119
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,961
while my Latin lover
recited verse to me.

120
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,929
You slut. I know.

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,004
Actually, I waited for my refrigerator
repairman, who never came.

122
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,491
I'm so sorry.

123
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,681
I'm gonna call you later.

124
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,801
Okay-

125
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,561
The ice, yes?

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,125
She moves like a woman.

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,008
I'm Walter. Mitty.

128
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,886
Cheryl. Melhoff.

129
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,326
Where have you been?

130
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,847
Testing the limits
of the human espirit.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,970
I'd like to climb your
hair, test that out.

132
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,085
Perhaps I can contact you,
possibly through my poetry falcon.

133
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Poetry falcon.

134
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,721
I like that.

135
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,244
Do you think, if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,447
I don't know.

137
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,681
Do it.

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,251
Hello.

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,767
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

140
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,001
Yeah? Did he move?

141
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,650
No, I missed.

142
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,283
That's a great story.

143
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,123
Ground Control to Major Tom.

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,401
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

145
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,361
Oh!

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,531
Wow.

147
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,407
Moving on, as they say.

148
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,210
Conference room,
more of these stations here...

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,089
where people sort
of do their thing.

150
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,406
Layout's here for...

151
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,370
Morning, Hernando!

152
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,881
There's a new nut
pouch, did you hear?

153
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,845
Yeah. I met him.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,286
We're gonna be evaluated.

155
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,450
They won't be able to. We do
intricate details back here.

156
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,567
Yeah.

157
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,449
It's tricky. And bewildering.

158
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,921
I should evaluate you,
you should evaluate me.

159
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
I don't think
they'll let us do that.

160
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,687
Just saying.

161
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,802
Hey, how long has this neg roll
been here... out in the open?

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,247
It says "Sean O'Connell."

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,084
It came in this morning.

164
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,130
There's a present, too. He sent
you a present, on your desk.

165
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,724
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,242
That results for
me in a man crush.

167
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,884
Hey, you want to mount these?

168
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,201
Seriously?

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,640
Sure.

170
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,484
<i>Heard rumblings</i>
LIFE'S <i>done, man.</i>

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,926
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

172
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,166
<i>Take a look inside, a gift for
all the years of hard work.</i>

173
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,165
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,729
<i>I spilled some blood on</i> it...

175
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,604
<i>while self-stitching
a gun wound to my abdomen...</i>

176
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,009
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

177
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,004
<i>The quintessence
of life, I think.</i>

178
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,322
<i>I trust you'll get it
where it needs to</i> go...

179
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,170
<i>you always do.</i>

180
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,601
What did you get?

181
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,205
It's a wallet.

182
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,529
With LIFE'S motto on it.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,286
Here you go.

184
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,563
Where's 25? It's not there.

185
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,204
Hey, we need negative 25.

186
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,405
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.

187
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,561
An actual telegram.

188
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,688
A 100-year-old dude
came in a little hat.

189
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,286
So there's a floor meeting.

190
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,890
Bring 25.

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,767
It's here somewhere.
We'll find it.

192
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,651
Okay, make a contact sheet of
these frames as soon as you can.

193
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,926
And don't say
anything to anyone.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,081
Yeah.

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,325
I just wanted to inform you
all reluctantly, that...

196
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,331
I guess, just start back
from the beginning.

197
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,609
Okay. I just wanted to inform
you all reluctantly...

198
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,128
that this month's issue
will be our last.

199
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,841
What?

200
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,921
Yeah. What?

201
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,324
This is some bull!

202
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,167
It's sad...

203
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,448
news, for sure.

204
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,122
Now, you're all
valued employees.

205
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,921
But as we undergo this
transition to LIFE online...

206
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,650
we wanted to be
candid with you...

207
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,327
that some of you will be
determined non-vital employees...

208
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,170
to the new partnership.

209
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,288
And we'll be deciding
which of those positions...

210
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,848
will be remaining with us over
the course of the next week.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,050
Also, we feel sad about
that, as you can see.

212
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,601
Now for some good news.

213
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,762
We are very excited...
All right, Don.

214
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,728
Ted Hendricks. Managing
director of the transition.

215
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,286
Never fun, this stage.

216
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,922
But we do have ahead of us
the privilege of publishing...

217
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,846
what will be the very last
issue of <i>LIFE</i> magazine.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,403
And for the final issue,
we just received a telegram.

219
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,527
Come on.

220
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,921
From Sean O'Connell...

221
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,242
who has never,
I'm told, been willing...

222
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,289
to speak with
the executives here.

223
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,010
Well, he broke his long silence

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,764
and shared his
thoughts with us...

225
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,764
through that old man.

226
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,045
Sean O'Connell.

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,967
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover."

228
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,805
"My most grand."

229
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,328
"The quintessence of life."

230
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,806
What is that?

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,443
It means like the
fullest and most rich.

232
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,921
Okay. So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever...

233
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,562
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

234
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,969
Very full and so rich.

235
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,370
So let's see this thing. Huh?

236
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,891
Let's see it.

237
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,771
Can we... What am I doing up here?
What's going on?

238
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,365
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

239
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,800
This gentleman.
The last man in.

240
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,126
Negative Assets. What's that?

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,361
Ah, Major Tom.

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,601
Can I get that?

243
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,289
It's being processed.

244
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,321
All right. Well, let's do it.

245
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,847
Let's process
some quintessence.

246
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,241
Come on.

247
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,081
Go.

248
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,681
Now.

249
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,285
That's why I'm clapping.

250
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,408
When do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

251
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,361
Hi.

252
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,841
Hi.

253
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,648
I'm Walter.

254
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,208
Cheryl. Melhoff. Mitty.

255
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,687
Yes.

256
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,003
You work in Photo Accounts, right?
I do.

257
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,281
Negative Assets.

258
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,771
Yes. Lam.

259
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,764
You're processing the last cover photo.
That's a big deal.

260
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,810
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,445
Mini, on that one right now.

262
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,170
I wanted to say, to you...

263
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,885
do you maybe have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

264
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,127
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,884
He moves around
so much. I don't.

266
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,280
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

267
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,205
I don't know where and
he doesn't have a phone.

268
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,840
No phone? He's old school. Yeah.

269
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,889
But, you know, why don't
I check with Peg?

270
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,849
I know she just processed
a check for him.

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,810
And we could track his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?

272
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,290
Cool. Very cool. Okay.

273
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,044
Walter. Yes.

274
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,526
I'm on it.

275
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,841
Thanks.

276
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,121
Yes. Are you coming?

277
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,805
Yes, I'm not.

278
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,083
Yes, I have to stay.

279
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,520
Here's the contact sheet.

280
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
What do you see?

281
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,088
This photo cluster.
These three.

282
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,969
They're the only
printable ones.

283
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,248
He took them around the
same time he took 25.

284
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,966
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

285
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,121
Blow them up, all right?

286
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,241
Cool.

287
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,204
Hey.

288
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,090
Walter, right?

289
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,041
Yeah.

290
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,284
So, I called Peg about Sean.
She's gonna get back to me.

291
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,051
Oh! Hey, thanks.

292
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,361
Cool glasses, very Sand People.

293
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,801
These? No, these are loupes.

294
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,564
They're for work.
They magnify the...

295
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,722
Is that 25? Can I see?

296
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,961
That's... No.

297
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,604
I can't quite find 25...

298
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,285
just now.

299
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,930
You can't find it?

300
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,889
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

301
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm trying to track him down
somehow with these other images.

302
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,401
His whereabouts?

303
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,721
Yeah.

304
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,246
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

305
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,922
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.

306
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,482
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

307
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,404
There's like a whole
science to it.

308
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,565
May I? Sure.

309
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,762
Okay. Thumb.

310
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,766
Yeah. It's an unknown thumb.

311
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,843
Okay. Water?

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,286
Just water, I guess?

313
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,527
Yeah, just water.

314
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,687
Okay-

315
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,171
And...

316
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,206
like a curved piece of...

317
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,160
some kind of, part of a thing.

318
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,442
But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...

319
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,160
is you really only need one good
one, and then they'll connect...

320
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,045
and you'll be like, "Oh, yes, of
course, unknown thumb, water..."

321
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,521
"I should have seen this
the whole time. Ahh!"

322
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,010
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be like...

323
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,170
Well, anyway, I should get
back and try not to get fired.

324
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,121
Hey, Cheryl.

325
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,560
I have something creative
I've been working on, too.

326
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,641
Oh.

327
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,610
Little side project.

328
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,403
Walter, it's amazing!

329
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,405
Walter?

330
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,800
I was just saying I'll let you
know when I hear back from Peg.

331
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,563
Okay. Thank you.

332
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,001
Okay-

333
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
Hey, Odessa.

334
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,406
What?

335
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,049
Ls there a larger apartment
available the piano could fit in?

336
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,561
Because it's
a memento of our mom's.

337
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,848
That's a really big...

338
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,330
Most people sell their really big
mementos before they move here.

339
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,801
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married.

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,162
It means a lot to her.

341
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,083
That's a villa. It's a
little more costly...

342
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,687
but it has a more generous, piano kind
of size living room for you though.

343
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,245
Yeah. Yeah, this is good.

344
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,646
On move-in,
you'd need first month's,

345
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,040
last month's, and full deposit.

346
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,884
That's $4,700. Great.

347
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,247
Yeah, okay.

348
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,731
Yeah, we'll take it.
I'll get the paperwork.

349
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,928
The new villa comes
open in three weeks.

350
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,206
I'm guessing.

351
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,127
Happy birthday.

352
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,041
Stretch Armstrong!

353
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,486
That's cool.

354
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,886
Yeah. Isn't that awesome?

355
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,646
This was your favorite thing when
we were little. Do you remember?

356
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
You want to do it?

357
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,241
Yeah, all right.

358
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,165
Come on, Stretch! Good, good!

359
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,321
Come on, we got to go.

360
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,404
A villa, okay, but hey, I'm
not the Queen of Sheba.

361
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,800
You got to have
room for your piano.

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,411
You can stay at my place
until it's ready.

363
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,562
I won't be cramping your scene?

364
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,085
My scene? No.

365
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,960
And sorry we couldn't
get you in here today.

366
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,081
Walter!

367
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,242
Look what I found!

368
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,687
This is from you
and Tim Linderman.

369
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,081
Do you remember, we were
gonna backpack Europe?

370
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,605
That June Dad died?

371
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,967
Man! What is in here?

372
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,281
That's my Walter box.

373
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Some of my Walter
knick-knacks and keepsakes.

374
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,408
You made the best mix tapes!

375
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,087
Oh, man. What? What's that?

376
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,448
Travel journal Dad gave me.

377
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,561
Oh.

378
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,565
You should donate that, because
you never used it, to a poor kid.

379
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,722
A poor kid who's
gonna travel to Europe?

380
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,723
Look at you and your dad!

381
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,961
Is that my tournament one?

382
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,929
He was so proud of this.

383
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,321
Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.

384
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,802
<i>It's from the
Fairview Smalltowner, Mom.</i>

385
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,611
Well, I really
liked that nifty Mohawk.

386
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
You know, when
your daddy died...

387
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,647
and then you went to work
in that pizza place...

388
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,282
the one that was named after a father,
had that father kind of name.

389
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,361
Papa John's.

390
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,447
Yeah, delivery.

391
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,444
And I thought perhaps that
it was really sad for you...

392
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,363
working in a restaurant
named after a father

393
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,124
after your father just died.

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,890
I never even
thought about that.

395
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,929
Probably because
I didn't call Dad "Papa."

396
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,645
You had a weird style.

397
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,246
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform. KFC.

398
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,565
My worker bee.

399
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,640
"Word in the water"?

400
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,444
Okay, you know what?
I got to go.

401
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,602
We're getting you into a
villa situation, okay?

402
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,961
Okay. Good, everybody?

403
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,167
My worker bee...

404
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,121
and my performance artist bee!
Thank you, Mom.

405
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,165
Hernando. Hey.

406
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,685
I don't see anything.
Upper middle.

407
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,683
It's faint. There's a
word in the water.

408
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,009
I'm getting nervous, Walter.

409
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,965
Hey, this is an ocean.

410
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,685
That's a boat.

411
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,649
"Erkigsnek."

412
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,962
He was near this boat.

413
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,321
See you in a few.

414
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
I'll check the mail room.

415
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,731
Final cover.

416
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,204
Big responsibility.

417
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,806
Oh, is that my quintessence?

418
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,770
No.

419
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,720
We're prepping the wetting agents
on that to start the process.

420
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,571
Really? Because it looks like
you're playing with toys.

421
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,410
No, this is a gift.

422
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,642
Yeah, the negative needs to
go through a very technical...

423
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,644
I'm sorry. I can't have a
professional conversation with you.

424
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,451
You and your little blonde pal.

425
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,761
Let's...

426
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,768
You can't walk through
the office with him.

427
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,724
Let's have it.
I'll put it away.

428
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,170
Give me the toy, man! No!

429
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,606
Now.

430
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,202
This is a place of business,
not a place of jelly-man toys!

431
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,407
Get off it!

432
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,601
No, I'm taking it!

433
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,125
You can't just take my stuff!

434
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,930
It's mine! Give it to me!

435
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,081
No!

436
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,443
Stop fiddling with sweets
and little men!

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,046
I'm trying to do my job!

438
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,129
Are you the Tin Man?

439
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,962
Need a little oil can?

440
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,727
Jesus.

441
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,766
Picture.

442
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,404
<i>Hey!</i>

443
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,849
<i>Hey. What's up?</i>

444
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,291
Who is this? <i>Todd.</i>

445
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,441
<i>From eHarmony.</i>

446
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,726
Oh! Hi.

447
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,081
<i>When I lost you there,
I was saying...</i>

448
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,244
<i>we need to beef your profile up,
make it, you know, not blank.</i>

449
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,880
<i>Real quick, let's build your
"Been There, Done Thats."</i>

450
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,887
Okay. Been there...

451
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,961
Um...

452
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,811
Phoenix.

453
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,450
I forgot why.

454
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,687
Then Nashville...

455
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,001
but that was just
the airport on the way

456
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,600
to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that...

457
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,641
<i>Uh-huh...</i>

458
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,889
<i>Hey, man, I was thinking,
if you work with this girl...</i>

459
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,681
<i>why don't you just
humanly invite her out?</i>

460
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,611
No, no, no, I'm trying to do
like a "Pina Colada Song" thing.

461
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,921
<i>"Pina Colada Song"?</i>

462
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,162
Yeah, you know, a guy posts
an ad, looking for a lover...

463
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,560
and then his wife answers it...

464
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,041
and it turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it...

465
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,443
and they end up making love
in capes, or on a cape.

466
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,251
<i>It's a song? Can you
sing a little bit?</i>

467
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,927
<i>If you like pina
coladas, getting caught in the rain.</i>

468
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,161
You know that song?
I have to go.

469
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,361
<i>Is that Hall & Oates?</i>

470
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,409
Hey! Hey.

471
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,721
Is that another clue?

472
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,370
Yeah. This one's okay. Yeah?

473
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,008
There's a boat there, I think.

474
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,767
"Erkig... " Snek.

475
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,251
Erkigsnek? Yeah.

476
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,526
Sounds like a real clue.

477
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,091
Yeah, it's the boat's name.

478
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,401
Have you Googled it?

479
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,601
I was on my way to.

480
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,011
Yeah. N-U.

481
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,130
It's the first two letters
of the port city.

482
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,080
Buffering.

483
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,200
So, the park...

484
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,124
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.

485
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,123
He's skateboarding
with a friend.

486
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,487
Do you want to walk up with me?

487
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,041
Starting now?

488
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,486
Yeah, starting now.

489
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,846
Okay-

490
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,650
Yeah, we got to figure this out.
It's a big deal.

491
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,524
You lost a Sean O'Connell.

492
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,044
I used to work at Nabisco.

493
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,524
And then, I had a change...

494
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,001
and I decided to apply to <i>LIFE.</i>

495
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,642
Thought it would be more
colorful, less regular, I guess.

496
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,371
You know, I just like
the idea of it.

497
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,170
I like the motto
of the company.

498
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,646
Do you know it?

499
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,881
"To see the world...

500
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,361
"Things dangerous
to come to..."

501
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,885
"To see behind walls."

502
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,491
Yeah, I...

503
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,008
I got this, from Sean.

504
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,527
He gave this to you?

505
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,886
Yeah.

506
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,322
I like that, "TO DRAW CLOSER."

507
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,688
So, what's he like in person?

508
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,001
Sean? Yeah.

509
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,686
Well, I haven't
actually met him.

510
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,683
I mean, we talk a lot, but...

511
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,844
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

512
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,525
How long ago was that?

513
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,001
16 years.

514
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,286
16 years?

515
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,885
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

516
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:24,495
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

517
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,010
With the layoffs, I mean.

518
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,123
I've been here for a month.

519
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,282
"Last in, first out," right?

520
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,361
Oh. Sorry.

521
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,569
It's Rich's dad.

522
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,885
It's your...

523
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,930
Former. Newly former.

524
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,924
But we've been sort of...
I don't know.

525
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,760
I
don't need to get it.

526
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,571
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

527
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,250
Um, I have no idea!

528
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,568
It's oblong. I don't know.

529
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,041
Why? No, I just...

530
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,565
I used to... I was kind
of into the scene.

531
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,731
The skateboard scene? Yeah.

532
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,047
Wow!

533
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,125
Hi, Peg.

534
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,409
Yeah, it's Sean O'Connell, we
actually need to find him.

535
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,087
Yes. If you could hurry.

536
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,806
Kick flip.

537
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,320
Yeah.

538
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,484
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

539
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,965
I'm Walter.

540
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,167
Rich.

541
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,840
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

542
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,450
You know, you just got to get
a little more snap...

543
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,085
get that thing up there.

544
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,004
Want me to show you something?

545
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,244
Sure.

546
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,281
Here.

547
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,487
I like your trucks.

548
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,841
Thanks.

549
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,605
Now check this out.

550
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,364
Know about the flick? Uh-huh.

551
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,923
Yeah, we've finished processing
his April work order.

552
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,608
Yes, it's kind of important.

553
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,410
Did you forward the job 1090s?

554
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,764
Or his last salary?

555
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,121
Wow!

556
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,086
Wow!

557
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,931
Here you go. That was awesome.

558
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,201
So it could be either place.

559
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,930
Thanks, Walter.
Okay. Thanks, Peg.

560
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,081
All right.

561
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,641
Hey, so...

562
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,484
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

563
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,210
Peg said she sent multiples.

564
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,362
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

565
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,364
She sends copies because we
never know where he's gonna be.

566
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,603
And this week she sent 1090s
to Princeton, New Jersey.

567
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,763
Oh, great. Train ride.

568
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,485
And one to Greenland.

569
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,641
Just in case.

570
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,164
Greenland, the country?

571
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,281
That's...

572
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,011
You can't take a train there.

573
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,361
No.

574
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,363
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

575
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,330
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

576
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,568
Yes! Look. Here it is.

577
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,882
Nuuk, Greenland.

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,764
Yeah!

579
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,001
Come on, that's a good lead!

580
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,003
You should follow that up.

581
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,842
Yeah, follow it
up in Greenland.

582
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,207
Yeah. Why not? Go!

583
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,850
Crack the case.

584
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,570
Listen to your wallet.

585
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,969
Sorry, it's my...
it's Phil again.

586
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,646
Maybe he fell down a well or something.
Maybe I should get it.

587
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,921
Hey, buddy! Here!

588
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,889
Rich, Rich! Not so fast! Here!

589
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,201
Take that.

590
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,889
Yeah. I understand.

591
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,010
Okay. Bye.

592
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,844
He did fall down a well.

593
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,925
But I don't care.

594
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,526
I just want to be
with you, you know?

595
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,761
Really?

596
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,208
Let's run away together. Let's make
every moment count, starting now.

597
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,441
Sweet!

598
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,881
Can I tell you something?

599
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,007
Anything.

600
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,202
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

601
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,122
Where you get old, but smaller.

602
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,363
Or whatever, and become a gradual old baby.
Or something.

603
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,126
I didn't see the movie, so I
don't really know how it works.

604
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
But I have it.

605
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,522
We can still
build a life together.

606
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,121
Cool.

607
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,280
I like your snappy little suit.

608
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,967
I bought it at a doll store.

609
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,606
Oh. Cool.

610
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,888
My little heart is no
bigger than a quarter...

611
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,485
but it's as full as Fort Knox.

612
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,607
You're the bravest
man I've ever known.

613
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,449
I love you, baby.

614
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,251
Not like "baby," like...

615
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,246
because you look like a
little weird baby-man.

616
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,606
I get it.

617
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,805
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

618
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,964
Just nestle in here and die.

619
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,808
Good-bye, Walter.

620
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,771
Good-bye! Walter!

621
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,808
Walter! Walter!

622
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,166
Bye! Oh!

623
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,651
Sorry! I was just...

624
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,764
Where do you go?

625
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,809
I started thinking about...

626
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,761
No, it's okay, I was probably boring
you about my broken refrigerator.

627
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,801
No!

628
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,447
Rich!

629
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,887
My son's running into the street.
I have to go.

630
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,485
Yeah.

631
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,883
I wanted to tell you,
that song, "Major Tom"?

632
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,725
Back there, when
the beard guy was...

633
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,975
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

634
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,050
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

635
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,126
It's a cool song.

636
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,565
Rich!

637
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,681
Yo!

638
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,648
Where's my thing?

639
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,047
It's in a silver bath.

640
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:14,335
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.

641
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,169
You know, you got
to take me seriously.

642
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,368
I got a magazine
to execute here.

643
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,363
And bosses to answer to.

644
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,490
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

645
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,206
Hey! Dream Machine!

646
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,361
Hello?

647
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,203
I want proof you heard me.

648
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,729
Next time I see you...

649
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,366
You see the picture.

650
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,729
That's right!

651
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,242
Any luck, Hernando?

652
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,051
I turned the place upside-down.
25 is not here.

653
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,611
I searched Receiving, too, man.

654
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,082
This never happens!

655
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,050
I'm telling you...

656
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,440
it's nowhere, Walter.

657
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,563
I mean, maybe he
didn't even send it.

658
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,804
Maybe it's still on him.

659
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,926
Walter?

660
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,765
Walter!

661
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,322
<i>Something filled up.</i>

662
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,840
<i>My heart with nothing.</i>

663
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,684
<i>Someone told me not to cry.</i>

664
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,883
<i>Now that I'm older.</i>

665
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,049
<i>My heart's colder.</i>

666
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,084
<i>And I can see that it's a lie.</i>

667
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,641
Hi.

668
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,081
Hi.

669
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,925
Do you have any cars available?

670
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,760
Yeah, we have a blue one
and a red one.

671
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,724
I'll take the red one.

672
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,646
<i>You were working
as</i> a <i>waitress In</i> a <i>cocktail bar.</i>

673
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,804
<i>When I met you.</i>

674
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,170
<i>I picked you out, I shook you
up And turned you around.</i>

675
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,523
<i>Turned you into someone new.</i>

676
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,690
Hi. Hi.

677
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,970
Can I ask you, could
someone receive mail here?

678
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,288
An American? Sean O'Connell?

679
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,171
I think he might have received
mail at this address.

680
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,762
You want a drink?

681
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,204
Okay. Yeah, I guess...

682
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,124
a small beer shoe.

683
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,488
So, could somebody
get mail here?

684
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,761
Heli mail.

685
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,881
"Heli mail"?

686
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,329
We helicopter mail to the
ships when they pass by.

687
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,648
We are pub and helipad.

688
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,241
<i>Yeah. Wait, the Erkigsnek?</i>

689
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,851
<i>Yeah. Erkigsnek.</i>

690
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,126
<i>Erkigsnek.</i>

691
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,682
We flew mail to her Tuesday.

692
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,526
I'm gonna take it
down a little, here.

693
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,523
I just want to
speak from the heart.

694
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,524
I lost a good lady.

695
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,010
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

696
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,963
Even though I pretty much am.

697
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,281
Come on, let's sing it.

698
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,051
Everyone.

699
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,441
Let's sing it together.

700
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,807
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

701
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,883
Do you know who
flies the mail out?

702
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,963
Do you have regular pilots?

703
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,041
Hey, man.

704
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,849
Just keep it going, man.

705
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,240
Hey. Sing it.

706
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,801
No, no, thank you.
I'm all right.

707
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,450
Come on, man. Go on.

708
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,443
<i>I was working as a waitress.</i>

709
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,331
Yeah, I know it.
I'm okay. Thank you.

710
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,528
I'm on a business trip,
I'm working.

711
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,648
Come on, man. This song
is important to me.

712
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,847
Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,967
Sing it. Okay.

714
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,848
<i>I was working as a waitress in a
cocktail bar That much is true.</i>

715
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,967
Okay?

716
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,851
<i>That sucked.</i>

717
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,007
Do your work.

718
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,081
You don't have to push.

719
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,043
What if I poke you?
Don't poke me.

720
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,205
Do your work, man.
Don't poke me!

721
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,885
I'm poking you.
What am I doing?

722
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,929
Stop poking me! Don't poke me!

723
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,647
Hey!

724
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,881
Come on!

725
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,441
Aah!

726
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,771
Wait, wait. Wait!

727
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Your thumb! I have to talk
to you about your thumb!

728
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,208
Yeah. I flew mail out
to the <i>Erkigsnek</i> Tuesday.

729
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,767
Gave him a ride.

730
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,083
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

731
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,131
I'm just blown away
I located your thumb.

732
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
There is, like, eight
people in Greenland.

733
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,288
I mean, it's a good
place to find a thumb.

734
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,646
Don't cheat on
your lady, man...

735
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,804
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it.

736
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,725
By the way.

737
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,601
So, uh...

738
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,126
You're scrappy.

739
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,804
You're a little scrappy Duncan.

740
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,324
So, you're trying
to find this guy?

741
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,891
Yes. Yeah.

742
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,927
Well, I'm flying some radio parts
out there in five minutes.

743
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,166
He may still be on the boat.

744
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,727
Really? Yeah.

745
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,805
Maybe you could come with me.

746
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,531
Yeah, or maybe I could just
call him on the boat phone.

747
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,124
The boat phone?

748
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,482
Yeah, the phone on the boat.

749
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,371
You mean the ship-to-shore?

750
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,002
Yeah, maybe I could just ask
him on the ship-to-shore.

751
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,368
Their radio is broke.

752
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,364
That's why I'm
flying out there now.

753
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,801
Oh.

754
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,049
You're flying out right now?

755
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,646
I'm just gonna finish my beer.

756
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,205
The weather doesn't
look so great.

757
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,361
It's not.

758
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,480
Looks like there's
a storm moving in.

759
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,881
Yeah.

760
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,246
A-brewin'.

761
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,970
Yeah.

762
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,201
But you're just...

763
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,647
you're just gonna
finish your beer...

764
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,009
and then fly a machine?

765
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,165
Yeah.

766
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,561
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.

767
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,684
I just want to get
a couple of beers down.

768
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,280
Okay. I'm not gonna
go with you.

769
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,206
Yeah.

770
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,410
Whatever.

771
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,605
See you, man. Okay.

772
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,841
See you.

773
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,245
Okay-

774
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,801
Shut up!

775
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,966
Hi. Hello, everyone.

776
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,890
Hi. Uh...

777
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,849
Hello, Nuuk.

778
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,921
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

779
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,847
Okay-

780
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,208
This one goes out
to Walter Mitty.

781
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,089
He knows why.

782
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,205
<i>Ground Control to Major Tom.</i>

783
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,601
<i>Ground Control to Major Tom.</i>

784
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,690
<i>Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on.</i>

785
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,363
<i>Ground Control to Major Tom.</i>

786
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,362
<i>Commencing countdown,
engines on.</i>

787
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,725
<i>Check ignition.</i>

788
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,851
<i>And may God's love be with you.</i>

789
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,201
<i>This is Ground Control
to Major Tom.</i>

790
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,727
<i>You've really made the grade.</i>

791
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,604
<i>And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear.</i>

792
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,484
<i>Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare.</i>

793
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>This is Major Tom
to Ground Control.</i>

794
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,851
<i>I'm stepping through the door.</i>

795
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,846
<i>And I'm floating
in the most peculiar way.</i>

796
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,768
<i>And the stars look
very different today.</i>

797
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,129
<i>For here am I
sitting in a tin can.</i>

798
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,443
<i>Far above the world.</i>

799
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,689
<i>Planet Earth is blue
and there's nothing I can do.</i>

800
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,086
Hey

801
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,530
Glad you came.

802
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,649
Are you comfortable?

803
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,847
What?

804
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,485
Are you comfortable?

805
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,971
No!

806
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,724
Hold on tight.

807
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,202
Hey, there she is!

808
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,002
Where do we land?

809
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,003
We don't!

810
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,161
What?

811
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,011
We don't land.

812
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,849
Okay, Walter.

813
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,691
I was gonna drop the radio
parts into the boat.

814
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,207
You take them.
They're right next to you.

815
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,041
These? Yeah.

816
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,362
Just jump in the boat.
You got them?

817
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,728
Just jump in the boat? Yeah.

818
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,244
Yeah, you're doing
great, Walter!

819
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,801
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

820
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,929
What would be the best way of
reaching you to stay in touch?

821
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,405
I don't know. Wait!

822
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,562
What do you mean
"jump into the boat"?

823
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,731
It looks far away!

824
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,325
Yeah, but you got to go now!

825
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,641
Go, go, go!

826
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,447
Go!

827
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,281
No!

828
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,881
No, Walter!

829
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,731
I meant the other boat!
The little boat!

830
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,160
Help!

831
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,921
Help! Help!

832
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,764
Try to remain calm.

833
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,651
The pontoon boat
is coming for you.

834
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,971
You have at least a minute
before you freeze!

835
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,041
What?

836
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,241
You are safe!

837
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,403
There's something here!

838
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,606
There's a fin here, I think!

839
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,651
We are traveling through
a porpoise school!

840
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,122
Don't fear the porpoise!

841
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,647
I don't think it's a porpoise!

842
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,446
I'm telling you,
it's a porpoise.

843
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,604
Be friendly.

844
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,280
It will protect
you from the sharks.

845
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,965
Okay-

846
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,126
Come here.

847
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,965
Hey!

848
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,487
Hey

849
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,001
Okay, that's a shark.

850
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,650
That's what I said!

851
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,641
Jesus!

852
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,450
Stop befriending it!

853
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,567
Kill it!

854
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,444
It's not a porpoise!

855
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,330
It's not a porpoise!

856
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,289
Poke his eyes out!

857
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,441
Fight it!

858
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,440
Oh, my God.

859
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,681
That really happened?

860
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,725
Real face.

861
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,681
Sorry for palming your face.

862
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,526
Oh, my God.

863
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,771
A pilot boat came.

864
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,366
They took him four hours ago.

865
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,806
Before the storm.

866
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,201
Took him where?

867
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,001
Iceland.

868
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,335
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

869
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,523
It's very important that I
discuss something with him.

870
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,524
You jumped into the ocean
with our radio components.

871
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,045
They are lost.

872
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,326
Correct?

873
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,364
Yeah, that's correct.

874
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,325
You're American?

875
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,201
Yeah.

876
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,370
Excellent.

877
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,726
Fonzie!

878
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,200
Come on, I'll find you some
dry clothing, home slice.

879
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,370
Will this work? For your items?

880
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,010
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

881
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,764
Hey, I'll take this, buddy.

882
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,847
Okay-

883
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,160
Hungry? Sure.

884
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,130
I got some kick-ass cake, man.

885
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,081
Thank you.

886
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,446
Looking good.

887
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,608
You can keep it.

888
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,604
Hey, this is...

889
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,129
This is clementine cake.

890
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,684
This is clementine cake.
My mom makes this.

891
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,490
Yeah, Sean brought it.

892
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,244
Yeah.

893
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,451
Good.

894
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,481
Is this Sean's?

895
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,927
Yeah, he wrapped
the cake in it.

896
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,611
This is a shoot itinerary.

897
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,928
It's a field itinerary
for a photo...

898
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,289
Did he say anything
about where he was going?

899
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,442
No, he didn't say much.

900
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,440
He was just taking pictures of
these guys, the Chilean deckhands.

901
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,811
He even gave me some tips...

902
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,610
for my lnstagrams.

903
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,041
Facebook friends?

904
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,645
Yeah, sure. Great.

905
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,600
What is "Eyjafallajokull"?

906
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,046
Eyjafjallajékull.

907
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,241
Excuse me?

908
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,321
Eyjafjallajékull.

909
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,281
What is that?

910
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,687
It's in Iceland.
It's a volcano.

911
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,649
A volcano? Yeah.

912
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,564
May 2nd. That's tomorrow.

913
00:54:01,695 --> 00:54:02,935
Do you think there's any way...

914
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,611
that we could possibly
land in Iceland?

915
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,921
Yeah.

916
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,161
Yeah?

917
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,368
We have to in the morning.

918
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,567
Great.

919
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,324
Because you lost the radio.

920
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,569
Right, yeah, sorry.

921
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,643
Sorry. But that's...

922
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,201
Well, I just have to get to...

923
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,447
Eyjafjallajékull.

924
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,561
Right.

925
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,240
Hey, I'll see you on
Sesame Street, man.

926
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,567
Okay, you're here, and
this is Eyjafjallajékull.

927
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,165
It's 15 kilometers.

928
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,960
Okay. You can
take the shore bike.

929
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,846
But you better get going, man.

930
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,280
Yeah, he didn't write a time
on that clue paper.

931
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,563
No, man. Hurry. Because of...

932
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,007
What? I don't understand.

933
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:14,855
What he means, man,
is you have to hurry...

934
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,600
because there's a bunch
of horny Chileans...

935
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,087
who want to go
to the strip club.

936
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,486
There's only one bike.

937
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,403
Hurry, Walter, hurry! Run! Go!

938
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,806
Go!

939
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,084
Stay gold, Pony Boy!

940
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,321

941
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,129
<i>"TODD". Hey, what's up?</i>

942
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,602
Todd? From eHarmony?

943
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,240
<i>Yeah! What's up, man?</i>

944
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,767
Not much. How have you been?

945
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,446
<i>Good. It's early here.
I just got up, man.</i>

946
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,965
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

947
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,281
Where are you?

948
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,606
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

949
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,685
<i>Hey, so your profile still
hasn't received any winks.</i>

950
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,641
<i>Even though I put
that you've been to Phoenix.</i>

951
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,321
Oh!

952
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,924
I jumped out of a helicopter
yesterday into the ocean.

953
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,969
And had a shark fight.

954
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,691
<i>Yeah, listen,
I was mentioning before...</i>

955
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,127
<i>people who daydream too much,
they're not...</i>

956
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,806
No, it was real. I really did.

957
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,042
<i>Really? Then I'll put
down "adrenaline junkie."</i>

958
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,201
<i>What kind of a shark?</i>

959
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,361
Hey, Todd.

960
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,160
I can't really talk right now.

961
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,326
I'm on my way to a volcano.

962
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,481
<i>What the...?</i>

963
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,201
Hey

964
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,602
Hi. Hey.

965
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,762
Do you guys speak English?

966
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,882
I'm looking for Eldgos Street.

967
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,961
Eldgos?

968
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,607
Is that a street?

969
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,729
Is this Eyjafjallakuta?

970
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,081
Something like that?

971
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,126
I don't think this guy
knows what eldgos is.

972
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,441
It's a long board.

973
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,081
Yeah.

974
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,129
What is that?
Is that Thor, or...

975
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,881
Odin?

976
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,805
A Norse god? He's cool.

977
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,329
Hey

978
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,726
Would you maybe
want to make a trade?

979
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,484
I know a kid who
would love that board.

980
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,960
It's cool. Look, he stretches.

981
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,124
Here, come here
and check it out.

982
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,485
Yeah. He's fun.

983
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,728
Yeah, it's lots
of stretching fun.

984
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,003
Oh, man. We can tie that
around your sister...

985
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,401
Want to do it?

986
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,327
Yeah?

987
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,329
Great. Great. Thank you.

988
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,201
Hello?

989
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,087
Hello?

990
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,091
Hi.

991
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,801
Hi.

992
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,729
Do you speak English?

993
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,405
The hotel is closed.

994
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,568
Okay, yeah.

995
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,561
I'm trying to find this guy.

996
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,601
This man, Sean O'Connell.

997
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,888
I think that he possibly
might have stayed here.

998
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a plane for him.

999
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,770
<i>AX 1200.</i>

1000
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,001
Fifteen minutes.

1001
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,401
He's at airfield
in Stykkishélmur.

1002
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,369
In the valley. Next town south.

1003
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,329
Where is it? Stykkishélmur.

1004
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,447
"Tickishoumer"? Yeah.

1005
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,601
No, no!

1006
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,926
Is it straight down that way?

1007
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,045
Thank you!

1008
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,404
It's all right, I know him!

1009
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,290
<i>Step in front

1010
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,004
<i>Just to feel alive again.</i>

01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,010
<i>Pushing forward

1012

<i>Aching chest and blurry sight.</i>

01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,204
<i>It's so far, so far away.</i>

1014
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,891
<i>It's so far, so far away</i>

1015
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,081
Hello. Hello.

1016
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,845
<i>Come on, come on. Eldgos!</i>

1017
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,490
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1018
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,523
<i>Eldgos. Eldgos!</i>

1019
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,250
<i>Eldgos. Eldgos.</i>

1020
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,535
What does that mean? Eretion.

1021
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,641
Erertion?

1022
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,370
Erection!

1023
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,005
"Erection"? Yes. No!

1024
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,440
Eruption!

1025
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,840
Eruption! Yes.

1026
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,401
Sean.

1027
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,565
Faster! Go faster!

1028
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,042
Holy shit! Faster!

1029
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,161
Oh, my God!

1030
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,083
Thanks for coming back for me.

1031
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,971
I really appreciate it.

1032
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
I hope you find your man.

1033
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,481
Thanks.

1034
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,601
Yeah.

1035
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,489
There's a motel
near the pizza place there.

1036
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,170
Good luck.

1037
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,446

01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,730
That's because, guess what.

1043
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,930
I'm in Iceland.

1044
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,081
<i>Iceland?</i>

1045
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,924
<i>Wait, wasn't it Greenland?</i>

1046
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,684
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1047
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,769
<i>You know that they're
not the same place.</i>

1048
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,400
No, no, no. I went to
Greenland and then...

1049
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,407
I got on a fishing vessel tracking
Sean and ended up here in Iceland.

1050
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,931
<i>You're in Iceland.</i>

1051
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,401
Yeah. At a Papa John's.

1052
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,451
Hey, I got more clues.

1053
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,726
<i>What did you find?</i>

1054
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,451
There's a date that Sean wrote.

1055
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,807
And some words
on a cake wrapper.

1056
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,611
"Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"...

1057
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,921
<i>and "Warlocks."</i>

1058
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,923
Wait. They have a Papa
John's in Iceland?

1059
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,600
<i>Yeah. I just had to...
I just left.</i>

1060
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,765
Did you get kicked out?

1061
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,285
No, I just needed to leave.

1062
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,124
Just the atmosphere.

1063
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,409
And the cups.

1064
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,606
Hey, I was right
on Sean's trail.

1065
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,291
Then I lost him.

1066
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,244

01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,447
Thanks.

1068
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,283
No. "Rajqawee" means
"strong little man"...

1069
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,761
in, like, 40 Arabic countries.

1070
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,844
And "Buzkashi" is
"goat hockey"...

1071
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,809
in Central Asia.

1072
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,964
<i>And "Warlocks"...</i>

1073
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,647
Yeah.

1074
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,488
I was hoping
they would connect.

1075
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,922
So, you said that you left Papa
John's because of the cups?

1076
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,646
Is there something I should
be aware of as a customer?

1077
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,323
No, I just worked there,
that's all.

1078
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,001
I used to have a Mohawk...

1079
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,209
<i>and a backpack...</i>

1080
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,483
<i>and this idea of who I wanted
to be and what I wanted to do.</i>

1081
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,040
<i>Yeah?</i>

1082
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,168
Nothing. Just...

1083
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,691
<i>I was pretty close with my dad.</i>

1084
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,687
And he died when I
was 17, on a Tuesday.

1085
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,808
And we didn't have any savings.

1086
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,728
So I got a haircut
that Thursday...

1087
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,327
and a job the same Thursday.

1088
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,051
Papa John's?

1089
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,046
<i>Yeah.</i>

1090
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,802
Your dad let you have a Mohawk?

1091
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,807
He shaved my head.

1092
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,522
That's a good dad move.

1093
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,771
Yeah.

1094
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,931
Is it nice there?

1095
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,041
Yeah, it is.

1096
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,484
It's really beautiful.

1097
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,251
Well, it's pretty sucky here.

1098
01:08:57,374 --> 01:08:58,735
Human Resources
has already started

1099
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,000
letting some of the staff go...

1100
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,441
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.

1101
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,562
Hey, I picked
something up for...

1102
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,285
I think I lost you.

1103
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,447
You know what? I'll catch
you up when I see you.

1104
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,321
Great. Okay.

1105
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,562
All right. Okay.

1106
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,246
<i>Bye, Walter.</i>

1107
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,845
Bye, Cheryl.

1108
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,641
What's going on?

1109
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,204
They shut down two floors.

1110
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,125
Why do you look rugged?

1111
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,046
I see you.

1112
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,684
I see you!

1113
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,966
What did I say?

1114
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,565
I see you.

1115
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,564
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

1116
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,166
He looked it up. There's no
such thing as a silver bath.

1117
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,644
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

1118
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,680
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland.

1119
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,961
It was in your care.

1120
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,081
If you just give
me some more time...

1121
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,241
You're fired.

1122
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,651
We'll make another cover.

1123
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,721
Hey!

1124
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,891
More than a million, way more,
negatives have come through my office.

1125
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,530
I have never mislaid one.

1126
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,448
Put it on a plaque.
Hang it at your next job.

1127
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,482
Now I got to explain
this to the board?

1128
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,331
Hey

1129
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,121
Are you okay?

1130
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,690
Yeah.

1131
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,845
That's cool.

1132
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,368
It's a skateboard.
It's for Cheryl's son.

1133
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,962
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

1134
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,569
I told you, man, it's bad.

1135
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,165
Hey! That's my fern.

1136
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,850
Thank you.

1137
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,961
Hi.

1138
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,761
Hi.

1139
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,645
Can I...?

1140
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,045
Yeah.

1141
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,246
I'm looking for Cheryl Melhoff.

1142
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,881
You want Cheryl?

1143
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,847
Yeah. She's...

1144
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,811
We work together, and she was
helping me with a work thing.

1145
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,650
Cheryl.

1146
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,085
Honey?

1147
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,370
There's some guy here.

1148
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,170
What?

1149
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,286
From work.

1150
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,321
Okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

1151
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,486
It's Conan.

1152
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,487
<i>Tonight, First Lady Michelle
Obama, Walter Mitty.</i>

1153
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,483
<i>Can we talk
about your love life?</i>

1154
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,211
<i>I think people
would be interested.</i>

1155
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,000
<i>You don't want to know
about my love life.</i>

1156
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,481
<i>I think they do.</i>

1157
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,361
<i>Yeah, I think they do. Now, I
don't believe everything I read.</i>

1158
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,251
<i>There's a scandal?
A little scandal?</i>

1159
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,402
<i>A little scandal, yes.</i>

1160
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,167
<i>She was back with her
husband, or something.</i>

1161
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,287
<i>Then she fell for you?</i>

1162
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,522
<i>Where there's smoke,
there's fire.</i>

1163
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,841
<i>You're awesome, Walter.</i>

1164
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,001
Thanks.

1165
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,161
Sure.

1166
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,050
Can you turn this off?

1167
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,127
It stays on.

1168
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,681
I'm just going to get out.

1169
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,167
Hey, Mom.

1170
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,281
Hi, honey.

1171
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,203
Walter, you got
to tip these guys.

1172
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,362
We got the piano
back safe, Mom.

1173
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,408
Are you back
from your work trip?

1174
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,125
Yeah, this morning.

1175
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,566
Hungry?

1176
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,001
Mmm-hmm.

1177
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm making soup. Thanks.

1178
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,804
Hey, tipping time now.

1179
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,290
This is all I got.

1180
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,330
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1181
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,323
All right,
thanks, everybody.

1182
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,811
For all your hard work.

1183
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,161
We appreciate it, ma'am.

1184
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,049
You did great. You
just let yourself out.

1185
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,645
He's good for this.

1186
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,685
Are you gonna
stay for dinner?

1187
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,040
Oh, Mom, I'd love to.

1188
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,650
I think I'm just
really wiped out

1189
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,245
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1190
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,290
I think I just need to go to
yoga and then just crash.

1191
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,965
What is it? A class?

1192
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,361
Yes, yoga.

1193
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,291
It's a class. I go to the hot
kind, where they heat the room.

1194
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,570
Have you heard of that? Sure.

1195
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,688
You have? It's great for you.

1196
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,360
You just get it all
out of your system.

1197
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,960
You get your sweat out, you just
get everything, all your fear.

1198
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,248
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition.

1199
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,640
That Grease show?

1200
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,086
Yeah. Rizzo?

1201
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,328
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1202
01:15:23,175 --> 01:15:25,495
What's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1203
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,760
I just get out of my head.

1204
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,967
Is that good for you?

1205
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,247
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1206
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,004
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1207
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,685
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1208
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,450
And I feel like...

1209
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,571
It's just for kids, but I think it's
important for them to start early.

1210
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,320
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1211
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,448
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1212
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,443
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1213
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,883
You'll be good at that. Yeah.

1214
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,055
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1215
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,411
Hey. Mom?

1216
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,721
Yeah.

1217
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,763
Did somebody take a picture of
your piano, like, a week ago?

1218
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,366
I did.

1219
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,969
With Sean's camera.

1220
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,326
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1221
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,323
Yeah, he came to visit.

1222
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,805
Mom, what?

1223
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,921
Yeah.

1224
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,889
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,

1225
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,968
when you left,
when you came home.

1226
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,487
He said you
really understood <i>LIFE.</i>

1227
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,409
He was really
interested in your work.

1228
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,125
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1229
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,846
I told you. I told you
in the produce aisle.

1230
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,570
I remember that.

1231
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,207
Maybe you were...

1232
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,086
Odessa, what is it you call it when he
goes into one of his little places?

1233
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,884
"Zoned out."

1234
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,963
You do that now and then.

1235
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,529
What's the matter?

1236
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,769
I got fired.

1237
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,049
I lost a picture of his.

1238
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,801
Can you find it?

1239
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,168
No, I don't know where he is.

1240
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,403
He's someplace
with warlocks or...

1241
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,970
Warlords.

1242
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,690
No, warlocks.

1243
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,684
No. Warlords.

1244
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,162
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...

1245
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,322
and maybe he would take my cake

1246
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,482
so that he could
get permission...

1247
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,041
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1248
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,044
He said he wants to photograph
snow leopards. How about that?

1249
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,645
Who?

1250
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,646
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1251
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,647
Mmm-hmm.

1252
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,721
That's where Sean is.

1253
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,966
Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah.

1254
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,728
In the upper Himalayas.

1255
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,364
They can't let you go.

1256
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,442
You were Sean's partner.

1257
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,801
He told me...

1258
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,440
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...

1259
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,049
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1260
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,964
You finish his work.

1261
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,081
<i>Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight.</i>

1262
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,401
<i>She would even miss you
if you taught her sight.</i>

1263
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,608
<i>Power politician leaning
to the right.</i>

1264
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,920
<i>Baby's got a trust fund.</i>

1265
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,924
<i>That she'll want to
go off like that.</i>

1266
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,002
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1267
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,284
<i>Leave a little window.</i>

1268
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,442
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1269
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,808
<i>Now we wear same-colored
yellow uniforms.</i>

1270
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,486
<i>Sky is burning but at
least we know we're warm.</i>

1271
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,608
<i>Go and run yourself
a million miles.</i>

1272
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,045
<i>Hoping that the colors run out.</i>

1273
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,401
<i>And you go off like that.</i>

1274
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,842
<i>Get off of my stack.</i>

1275
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,725
<i>Stack</i>

1276
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,207
Hey, Todd.

1277
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,004
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1278
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,491
Not much.

1279
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,281
<i>Hey, good news. Your profile
really rounded out, man.</i>

1280
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,204
<i>That volcano-shark combo.</i>

1281
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,330
<i>That is money in the bank. Get
ready to get a lot of winks.</i>

1282
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,686
Okay-

1283
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,171
<i>But something else.</i>

1284
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,163
<i>Cheryl Melhoff...</i>

1285
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,891
<i>she's not on here
anymore. Withdrawn.</i>

1286
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,401
Oh.

1287
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,324
Really? Yeah.

1288
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,330
<i>Hey, man, where are you now?</i>

1289
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,686
Himalayas.

1290
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,003
<i>The Himalayas. I love it.</i>

1291
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,690
<i>That is a kick-ass
"Been There."</i>

1292
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,842
Todd, I'm gonna
keep this short.

1293
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,690
I have to make oxygen choices.

1294
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,081
<i>Hey, I get it. so!</i>

1295
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,403
<i>Anyway, you have a profile now.
Congratulations.</i>

1296
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,369
Cool, but, you know what?

1297
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,090
Would you take me off?

1298
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,244
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.

1299
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,686
Hey.

1300
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,281
Hey, man.

1301
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,646
<i>You're sure?
Because I feel like</i>

1302
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,040
<i>we're really
onto something here.</i>

1303
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,050
Do you mind? I'm working.

1304
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,202
<i>This is one of the best
profiles I've ever done.</i>

1305
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,320
<i>And our refund policy,
well, we don't have one...</i>

1306
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,169
Todd, I got to go.

1307
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,081
Sean.

1308
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,081
Yeah.

1309
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,888
It's Walter.

1310
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,249
Mitty.

1311
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,241
Walter Mitty.

1312
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,770
Seriously?

1313
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,087
How the hell did
you get up here?

1314
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,445
I just...

1315
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,809
I've been looking for you.

1316
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,404
Sit down.

1317
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,605
I'll sit.

1318
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,443
Well, take your time.
Settle in.

1319
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,443
Try to be real still, okay?

1320
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,490
There's a snow leopard.

1321
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,166
Right in this ridge.

1322
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,686
So we have to try to be very,
very, very, very still.

1323
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,326
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."

1324
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,607
it never lets itself be seen.

1325
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,362
Ghost cat?

1326
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,161
Beautiful things
don't ask for attention.

1327
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:47,965
Sean, there was a negative that
got separated from your roll.

1328
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:53,010
I'm taking a lot of
heat over it at work.

1329
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,006
It never came with the
roll that you sent.

1330
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,003
The last roll
you're talking about?

1331
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,321
Yeah.

1332
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,521
The 25.

1333
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,644
Yeah.

1334
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,808
You're sitting on it.

1335
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,729
Why am I sitting on it?

1336
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,049
It's in your wallet.

1337
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,928
That was the gift.

1338
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,844
The photograph.

1339
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,889
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

1340
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,487
So, I put it in a little slot, the
little picture holder in there.

1341
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,330
I thought it would be cute.

1342
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,763
I told you, "look inside."

1343
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,044
In the note.

1344
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,526
You said "look inside."

1345
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,889
I thought you meant look
inside of the wrapping paper.

1346
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,046
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.

1347
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,402
No, I don't have it.

1348
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,483
I don't have it anymore.

1349
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,561
Whoa!

1350
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,408
What the hell
were you thinking?

1351
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,604
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired
you for a very long time...

1352
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,441
but that is not a good move, at
all, with a valuable negative.

1353
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,568
Sorry, I just...

1354
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,286
I thought it would be
a playful kind of thing.

1355
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,930
Playful?

1356
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,724
Too playful.

1357
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,445
I see what you're saying.

1358
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,251
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.

1359
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,489
But can I ask you, I mean,
if you don't mind...

1360
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,249
what did you do
with the wallet?

1361
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,725
Chucked it.

1362
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,208
Well, that hurts my feelings.

1363
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,442
No. Man, I liked it very much.

1364
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,965
I appreciated it very much.

1365
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,121
So you threw it away?

1366
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,364
So, you have no
idea what it was?

1367
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,441
The photograph?

1368
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,645
It's a shame.

1369
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,963
It was a beauty.

1370
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,961
How did you find me, anyway?

1371
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,720
My mom.

1372
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,843
Cool lady. Knows how to bake.

1373
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,765
Yeah.

1374
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,686
Hey, Why did you... Shh!

1375
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,446
When are you gonna take it?

1376
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,443
Sometimes I don't.

1377
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,129
If I like a moment...

1378
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,446
I mean, me, personally...

1379
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,563
I don't like to have the
distraction of the camera.

1380
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,886
Just want to stay in it.

1381
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,084
Stay in it?

1382
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,244
Yeah, right there.

1383
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,243
Right here.

1384
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,403
Now it's gone. It's gone.

1385
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,445
That looks like fun.

1386
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,768
I think I'm gonna jump in.

1387
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,247
Hey, what was
the picture, Sean?

1388
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,283
We're gonna be odd-numbered
if you don't join.

1389
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,887
What was the picture?

1390
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,641
Let's just call it a
ghost cat, Walter Mitty.

1391
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,487
<i>What's in your hand.</i>

1392
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,843
<i>You're pinned down to routines.</i>

1393
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,046
<i>Elevate and leave.</i>

1394
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,201
<i>The flickering screen.</i>

1395
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,649
<i>Where nothing is compromised.</i>

1396
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,761
<i>Nothing is lost.</i>

1397
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,843
<i>When everything is realized.</i>

1398
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,202
<i>Nothing is crossed.</i>

1399
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,564
You made the watch list.

1400
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,451
How did you get to Afghanistan?
There's a travel ban.

1401
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,165
Through Yemen.

1402
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,363
Violent place.

1403
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,607
That's why the air
fare is only $84.

1404
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,603
Can I have my fife back?

1405
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,483
Do you know anyone
in Los Angeles?

1406
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,802
No. Any acquaintances? Okay.

1407
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,001
Any companions?

1408
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,403
Anybody here who might be able to
verify that you're Walter Mitty?

1409
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,170
Walter Mitty?

1410
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,361
Yeah.

1411
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,648
Todd Mahar. EHarmony.

1412
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,641
Hey

1413
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,241
Thank you. Thanks.

1414
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,965
What? Come here.

1415
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,690
Come here.

1416
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,285
Backpack.

1417
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,771
Big hug!

1418
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,128
Airport prison, huh?

1419
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,201
Yeah.

1420
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,846
Tell me all about it over a Cinnabon.
Come on.

1421
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,610
Cinnabon!

1422
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,722
How long were you
detained for, by the way?

1423
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,770
Like, 17 hours.

1424
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,447
Wow! How's that Cinnabon taste?

1425
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,601
Really great.

1426
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,650
That's frosted heroin. That's
what you're eating, my friend.

1427
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,485
That's what you're having
right there, man.

1428
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,567
By the way...

1429
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,406
you got 300 winks before I
took down your profile.

1430
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,171
In the space of two hours.
It was crazy.

1431
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,881
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.

1432
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,000
I never checked.

1433
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,963
Oh! Because of...

1434
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,571
the "Pina Colada"
girl that quit?

1435
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,925
Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,001
Cheryl.

1437
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,650
Cheryl, who did not respond
to a single wink...

1438
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,165
the whole time
she was on there.

1439
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,085
That's a choosy lady.

1440
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,450
<i>That's a choosy lady.</i>

1441
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,001
How's the...

1442
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,568
daydreaming going?

1443
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,845
Lately, less.

1444
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,841
Good.

1445
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,161
Less is good.

1446
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,246
Thanks for the pastry.

1447
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,522
Yeah, well, you owe me.

1448
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,047
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.

1449
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,409
You have a lot on your plate.

1450
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,043
What are you gonna do now?

1451
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,964
Go out and get another job.

1452
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,201
Boom!

1453
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,045
Sorry, Walter, I just...

1454
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,167
What?

1455
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,049
You are so not
how I pictured you.

1456
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,650
How did you picture me?

1457
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,286
I pictured you as a little
gray piece of paper.

1458
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,371
But now I see you...

1459
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,648
and it's like Indiana Jones...

1460
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,086
decided to become
the lead singer

1461
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,680
of The Strokes or
something like that.

1462
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,529
It's nuts. I know.

1463
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,331
Sorry, Mom.

1464
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,641
What for?

1465
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,848
Dad bought it for you.
It was my responsibility.

1466
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,766
Oh, Walter.

1467
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,327
We're all grown here.

1468
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,289
We're all good.

1469
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,367
Ooh!

1470
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,761
That's heavy duty, that sum.

1471
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,763
You should put
this in your wallet.

1472
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,649
I don't have one. Oh.

1473
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,247
I found it in the trash.

1474
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,085
I always save
your knick-knacks.

1475
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,131
Thanks.

1476
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,206
Got it, Mom? Got it.

1477
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,765
Watch the stairs.

1478
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,850
I think this works.

1479
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,731
Heart of America. Different generations.
This says it all.

1480
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,326
Oh, hey. Welcome.

1481
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,528
Wait, I'm sorry, not welcome.

1482
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,569
Not an employee.

1483
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,571
Sorry.

1484
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,530
There's the picture
Sean wanted. 25.

1485
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,725
You have two days
to print for cover.

1486
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,362
There's your quintessence.

1487
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,441
Hey

1488
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,209
Do you know our motto?

1489
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,684
"Life..."

1490
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,044
"I'm lovin' it?"

1491
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,726
No.

1492
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,082
That's McDonald's.

1493
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,922
This thing that you do, Ted...

1494
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,526
where you come into a place
and you push people out.

1495
01:37:08,775 --> 01:37:10,815
You should know that those
people worked really hard

1496
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,729
to build this magazine.

1497
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,724
They believed in the motto.

1498
01:37:17,255 --> 01:37:19,015
And I get it. You got
your marching orders...

1499
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,805
and you have to do
what you have to do.

1500
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,726
But you don't have
to be such a dick.

1501
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:33,251
Put that on a plaque, and
hang it at your next job.

1502
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,449
What was it? Sasquatch?
A unicorn?

1503
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,443
The negative? Yeah.

1504
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,610
I didn't look.

1505
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,002
You were a good boss, Walter.

1506
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,850
Thanks, man.

1507
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,930
<i>Hey, Walter. What's up?</i>

1508
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,570
<i>Check this out.</i>

1509
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,086
<i>See you!</i>

1510
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,961
<i>Hi.</i>

1511
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,561
Walter Mitty.
Severance package.

1512
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,806
Hey

1513
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,971
Cheryl.

1514
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,165
Hey Hey

1515
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,286
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.

1516
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,726
He's really good.

1517
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,120
Walter, thank you.

1518
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,566
That was...

1519
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,883
That was just a really
cool thing to do.

1520
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,042
I just saw it in Iceland.

1521
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,641
He loves it.

1522
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,689
And I'm taking
him this afternoon.

1523
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,003
Hey, I wanted you to know...

1524
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,324
you weren't boring me.

1525
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,725
That day in the park.

1526
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,406
I was...

1527
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,801
I was thinking about...

1528
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,164
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I was thinking about you.

1529
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,562
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...

1530
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,326
and I had to get on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.

1531
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,851
And I started to imagine you...

1532
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,568
singing Major Tom.

1533
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,010
Anyway...

1534
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,082
it got me on the helicopter.

1535
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,365
And it got me
where I wanted to go.

1536
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,881
So, what happened to you?

1537
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,289
You sort of fell off
the face of the Earth there.

1538
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,885
For a little bit.

1539
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,682
I came by and...

1540
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,690
your husband answered so I
figured I should just go.

1541
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,402
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.

1542
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,369
And he's not my husband.

1543
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,728
I guess I imagined...

1544
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,887
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1545
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,728
You have a good imagination.

1546
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,405
<i>But no.</i>

1547
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,566
Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.

1548
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,926
Rizzo.

1549
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,447
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.

1550
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,970
Do you want to go with me?

1551
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,604
I made that sound
really not good.

1552
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,966
Yeah.

1553
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,080
Yeah?

1554
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,449
Yeah, yeah. I would love to.

1555
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,444
Grease in a weird church?
Are you kidding?

1556
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,762
Rizzo, that's the best part.

1557
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,004
Yeah, Rizzo.
Tough and tender.

1558
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,605
Yeah.

1559
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,765
Great.

1560
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,687
Are you heading Uptown?

1561
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,361
Sure.

1562
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,441
Yeah?

1563
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,602
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1564
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,285
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1565
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,523
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?

1566
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,604
No. She was just real, I guess.

1567
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,761
Oh!

1568
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,163
The last issue, it should be here.
It came out this morning.

1569
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,281
Man. Walter.

1570
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,367
Should we go buy one of those?

1571
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,284
Yeah. I was probably gonna...

1572
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,124
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah.

1573
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,001
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.

1574
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,167
<i>There's a rhythm
in rush these days.</i>

1575
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:51,571
<i>Where the lines don't move
and the colors don't fade.</i>

1576
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:58,087
<i>Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams.</i>

1577
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:04,571
<i>In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean.</i>

1578
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,207

a man cannot know.</i>

1579
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,522
<i>The gears won't turn
and the leaves won't grow.</i>

1580
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,246
<i>There's no place to run
and no gasoline.</i>

1581
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,248
<i>Engine won't turn
And the train won't leave.</i>

1582
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:37,485
<i>Engines won't turn
And the train won't leave.</i>

1583
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,082
<i>I will stay with you tonight.</i>

1584
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,926
<i>Hold you close
'til the morning light.</i>

1585
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,201
<i>In the morning watch
a new day rise.</i>

1586
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:02,841

1588
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,287
<i>Well, the way I feel is
the way I write.</i>

1589
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,241
<i>Racin' like the thoughts
of the man who lies.</i>

1590
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,403
<i>There is a truth and
it's on our side.</i>

1591
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:32,042
<i>Dawn is coming Open your eyes.</i>

1592
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:38,001
<i>Look into the sun
as the new days rise.</i>

1593
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,247
<i>And I will wait for you tonight.</i>

1594
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,080
<i>You're here forever
and you're by my side.</i>

1595
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:54,526
<i>I've been waiting all my life.</i>

1596
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:00,166
<i>To feel your heart
as it's keeping time.</i>

1597

01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,722
<i>Leaves you empty
with nothing but dreams.</i>

1606
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:32,285
<i>In a world gone shallow
In a world gone lean.</i>

1607
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,483
<i>But there is a truth
and it's on our side.</i>

1608
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,963
<i>Dawn is coming, open your eyes.</i>

1609
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:52,450
<i>Look into the sun
as a new days rise.</i>

1610
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,364
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1611
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,209
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1612
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,964
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1613
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:42,562
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1614
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,045
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1615
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,607
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1616
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:08,929
<i>Living life Feeding appetites.</i>

1617
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,290
<i>Stake through every heart
stop in the mood.</i>

1618
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,081
<i>Being glad.</i>

1619
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,810
<i>Breathing half the time.</i>

1620
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,803
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1621
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,161
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1622
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,851
<i>Step outside,
I'm gonna step outside.</i>

1623
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,484
<i>Broke to Monday.</i>

1624
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,127
<i>Somethings not the same.</i>

1625
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,969
<i>Blank head.</i>

1626
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,765
<i>Cross tiles sweep the floor.</i>

1627
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,487
<i>Feel your presence
in your absence.</i>

1628
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,285
<i>Shut the door.</i>

1629
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,962
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1630
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,208
<i>Dark as night,
let the lightning guide you.</i>

1631
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:11,767
<i>Must believe in.</i>

1632
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,810
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside.</i>

1633
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,484
<i>Take a step outside.</i>

1634
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,042
<i>Must believe in.</i>

1635
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,090
<i>Step outside
Take a step outside.</i>

1636
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,764
<i>Take a step outside.</i>

1637
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,688
<i>Heart's on fire,
leave it all behind you.</i>

1638
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,487
<i>You know I love my lady.</i>

1639
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,928
<i>We've been together so long.</i>

1640
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,840
<i>Like a worn-out recording.</i>

1641
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,929
<i>Of my favorite song.</i>

1642
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,846
<i>So while she lay there sleepin'.</i>

1643
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,923
<i>I read the paper in bed.</i>

1644
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,051
<i>And in the personal columns,</i>

1645
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,963
<i>There was this letter that read.</i>

1646
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,371
<i>If you like pina coladas.</i>

1647
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,328
<i>Or getting caught in the rain.</i>

1648
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,441
<i>And the feel of the ocean.</i>

1649
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,722
<i>And the taste of champagne.</i>

1650
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,281
<i>If you like making love
at midnight.</i>

1651
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,722
<i>In the dunes of the cape.</i>

1652
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,691
<i>Then you're the lady
that I look for.</i>

1653
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,842
<i>Come with me and escape.</i>

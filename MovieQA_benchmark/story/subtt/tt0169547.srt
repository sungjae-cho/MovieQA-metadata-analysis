00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,707
- How would it look
if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

329
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:59,277
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

330
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,548
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

331
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,950
and part of my job
is to live that image.

332
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,522
Honey, do me a favor and say
whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

333
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:12,523
All right.
Hi, Shirley!

334
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,930
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

335
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,802
- [High Voice] I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

336

- Buddy! Buddy! Hi!
- Hi.

337
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:27,909
Good to see you again.

338
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,513
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

339
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:34,550
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

340
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,586
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

341
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:42,626
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

342
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:47,831
Oh, we've met before,
actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.

343
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,201
Oh, yeah!

344
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:53,395
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

345
00:30:57,476 --> 00:30:59,945
Honey, don't be weird.

346
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:02,882
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

347
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:06,186
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

even tell you this if I weren't
a little tipsy, but...

I'm in complete awe of you.

364
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,727
I mean, your firm...

365
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:45,798
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

366
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,402
and your personal
sales record is...

367

It's very intimidating.

with you and just pick your brain,

You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

371
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:10,460

I don't flatter myself...

in the same league as you.

Excuse me?

I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.

I think you just

Well, I guess when

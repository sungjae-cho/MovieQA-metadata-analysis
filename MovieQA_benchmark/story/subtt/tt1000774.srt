<i > But, after all < /i>

12
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,280
<i > something "divinal" is not so easy
of finding, when it is love.</i>

13
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,337
The something?!

14
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:02,560
Are you married?!
His/her brute! The mother's Filho!

15
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,006
<i > AND it continues to be it.</i>

16
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,348
I hate you!

17
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:08,329
<i > it is for that that he/she needs her of help
to find something like that.</i>

18
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,116

My God, look at this!

23
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,542
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,990
Oh, rays!

25
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:34,152
<i > my name is Carrie Bradshaw < /i>

26
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:35,840
<i > and I am a writer.</i>

27

<i > AND, as if it came to prove,
my sustenance.</i>

29
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:44,471
<b > LATER CHARLOTTE SAID: < /b>

30
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:48,037
<i > Already courtship since the fifteen years.
I am exhausted! Where is he?</i>

31
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:50,427
<i > Charlotte sought the perfect love.</i>

32
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,563
<i > - Drake doesn't get to lift him/it.
- Well, almost perfect.</i>

33
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:56,544
<B > CHARLOTTE MARRIES AGAIN
- I will be Jewish.</b>

34
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:58,687
Happinesses!

35
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:02,336
<i > we are not to get.
We are deficient at reproductive level.</i>

36
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,822
<i > - They will feel the bebé.
- It is our bebé!</i>

37
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,822
<i > Then, < /i>

38
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:10,879
<i > Charlotte and Harry went to China
and they returned, with the daughter Lilly.</i>

39
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,284
<i > Miranda was a disciple
of the hard love.</i>

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,691
<i > Good-bye.
The sex was óptimo.</i>

41
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,675
<i > - Steve, I am pregnant.
- Are you the something?</i>

42
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,076
<i > Carrie...</i>

43
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,039
<i > Me, Miranda Hobbes,
I accept you, Steve Brady...</i>

44
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:27,324
<i > AND Miranda traveled to Brooklyn,
by Brady and for Steve.</i>

45
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,836
Who wants a rajá?
No!

46
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,228
<i > THE love of Samantha < /i>

47
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:34,794
<i > it was the sex.</i>

48
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,535
<i > sex Montes.</i>

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,254
<i > I Walk with a type whose sperm
he/she has an eccentric flavor.</i>

50
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,334
<i > can I cancel my pudding of rice?
Then she found a man, < /i>

51
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:46,384
<i > that combined sex with love.
- I will help you to be a Stripper.</i>

52
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:51,214
<i > - Yes, he is interested...
- Then Samantha steered Hollywood < /i>

53
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,489
<i > with the television star:
Smith Jared.</i>

54
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,805
<i > as for me...</i>

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,889
<i > it sought something
Big (= Big).</i>

56
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:01,493
<i > he/she Enters.</i>

57
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,199
<i > Sr. Big.</i>

58
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,374
<i > But, after all, when
that great love appears...</i>

59
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,366
<i > not always it is easy.
- He/she tells me just that I am the such.</i>

60
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,614
<i > AND in spite of all the other chapters
of my life...</i>

61
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:16,247
<i > any era "Big" enough.
Until...</i>

62
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,847
<i > Carrie, you are the such.</i>

63
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:21,617
<i > it is like this without further ado,
I was the such.</i>

64
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,509
<i > Three books and three years later...</i>

65
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:29,363
<i > we still felt as
those four single girls.</i>

66
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:35,569
<i > AND although the time has us done to move forward,
I arranged way to be how it was.</i>

67
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,612
<i > Passionate.</i>

68
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:54,191
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

69
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:56,536
I have a good premonition
on this, small.

70
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:59,475
I hope so,
I always adored this block.

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,816
Hello.
3-C?

72
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,730
<i > to Find the perfect apartment
in New York, < /i>

73
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,227
<i > it is as finding the perfect partner.</i>

74
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,839
<i > it can take years.</i>

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,524
Are in how many going we?

76
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,377
33.

77
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:14,939
33, the number of the luck.

78
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:21,453
Of the worst.
Have just left him/her a message.

79
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,990
And the kitchen is for here.

80
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:25,528
That is the window...

81
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,278
with the best view.

82
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:31,492
34?
34, the number of the luck?

83
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:37,902
If something more slowness, inform us.
I am very interested in this building.

84
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:42,538
I have another apartment that still nor
he/she is at the market. Do they want to see him/it?

85
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,699
- Clear.
- Very well, then.

86
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:48,367
He/she costs more than they wanted to pay.

87
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:49,933
The more?

88
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,098
Plus.

89
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,806
<b > PENTHOUSE < /b>

90
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:02,607
Then it is here where they keep the light.

91
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:05,148
My God!

92
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:09,738
I died and I went to the sky of the properties.

93
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:14,334
A simple house for two.

94
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,675
And,

95
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,078
through the terrace...
- The something?

96
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:19,883
The Nirvana?

97
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:25,825
Hello.

98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,716
I live here.

99
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,549
His/her wife
he/she has been feeling a lot of of humor.

100
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,487
- They are not married.
- He/she is my boyfriend.

101
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,374
For here.

102
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:41,152
I am not too old for
to be presented as your boyfriend?

103
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,421
You are right.
From now on,

104
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,773
you will be my friend.
- That sounds to dog.

105
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,575
But it serves that nor a glove.

106
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,364
And this is the main room.

107
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:54,601
Vile.

108
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,194
I hate him/it,
it hurts my eyes.

109
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:01,348
As it can a ranch like this
to be vague?

110
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:05,329
- It was a complicated divorce.
- Living here, which was their problem?

111
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,502
Now I understand the divorce.

112
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:18,538
I make you a better wardrobe.

113
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,630
Welcome the house, wanted.

114
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,598
Do we have money for this?

115
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,489
I treat of that.

116
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:32,883
Right.
We will sign some contracts there.

117
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,908
"I treat of that."
Like this, as if it was to pay a coffee.

118
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,969
- It is perfect!
- Excepto the wardrobe,

119
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,874
that Big says that he/she arranges. It is also
he/she says that the necessary kitchen of works.

120
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:45,241
That doesn't know, because
I don't keep the clothes in the oven.

121
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,470
Then, he bought her and you go
to live there with him?

122
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,251
- Yes, together. Quite so.
- But the owner is him. Therefore

123
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,569
will you maintain your old house, right?
- I still didn't think about the details,

124
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:56,590
but I am smart and have-of thinking
in something that pleases me.

125
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,947
I only want to have certainty
that are smart in this.

126
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,130
And I adore you for that.
But,

127
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:02,435
for the time being,

128
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,417
you can stop worrying with me
and do you feel him/it what I want that feel?

129
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,108
Envy!

130
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:13,154
He/she envies of me to live in a
beautiful Penthouse in Manhattan.

131
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,023
- He/she is well, I am with envy.
- Thank you.

132
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,062
You live in the sky of the properties
and me alive in Brooklyn.

133
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,072
The magazine New York says that Brooklyn
it is new Manhattan.

134
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,175
Who wrote that
he/she lives at Brooklyn.

135
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,387
There it is her!
Hello, Hollywood!

136
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:29,374
Oh, my lady!

Good.

139
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,508
- Fortunately.
- I am so excited!

140
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:40,742
<i > it was a rare occasion that joined all
the types of women From New York.</i>

141
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:47,266

150
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,618
"This flower is my essence.
It is only."

151
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,702
- "Full of fire."
- A little more than owed.

152
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,270
Exacto.

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,242
We will spend a there little of mine
arduous money of Hollywood.

154
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:27,671
Now the item 39.

We began the auction with 10 thousand dollars.

Does he/she want to move forward with 60?

167
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:11,027
Does he/she offer 60?
60 thousand?

168
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,633
I marked the limit to the 50.

169
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:19,993
He/she thought that this auction would be more
entertaining. Is it half sad, it is not?

170
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:25,530
I thought that was alone sad for me,
because I know her. But it is really sad.

171
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,212
And it is graced, because them
they were very happy.

172
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,019
- Until they leave of the being.
- I know.

173
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,945
All told him/her that if it married,
but she didn't want to hear.

174
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,682
He had already been married three times.
Therefore she let to "enjoy" him/it.

175
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:43,615
One night, she returns the house and
he had changed the locks.

176
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,835
Her nor he/she had where to live.

177
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,126
A feather.
After ten years.

178
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:51,107
He/she was a smart girl,

179
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,467
until if to have lover.

180
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,231
I am to think

181
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,505
in

182
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:10,067
to sell my apartment
and to invest the money in the new house.

183
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,369
Reason?

184
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,603
- You adore your apartment.
- I know, but...

185
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:16,302
There is immense space in the new house and...

186
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,018
And...

187
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,880
Besides, me...

188
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:23,628
I want us to make life there.
You know...

189
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,388
I want that is ours.

190
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,291
But it is ours.

191
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:32,247
- I bought him/it for us.
- And that is wonderful, but...

192
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,220
You went you that bought him/it.

193
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:37,018
Therefore, the house is yours and...

194
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,317
- If something happened...
- What will happen he/she?

195
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:46,151
I have to be smart. We are not
married, I am not entitled.

196
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,929
On...

197
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:51,446
On this home that I built

198
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,585
with you.

199
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,995
Do you want to marry?

200
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,189
Well,

201
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:06,580
I didn't think that that went an option.
- And if it went?

202
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:10,588
Reason?
Do you want to marry?

203
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:13,613
He/she didn't care of being married with you.

204
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:16,384
Did you care of being married with me?

205
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,192
No... if that that you wanted went.

206
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:24,476
He/she wants to say,

207
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,268
is it that what want?

208
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,074
I want you.

209
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:32,055
Therefore,

210
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,603
he/she is well.

211
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:36,403
Then,

212
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,378
will we marry even?

213
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,058
We will marry.

214
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,172
- Should I feel a diamond?
- No. No.

215
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:46,903
He/she arranges me only an enormous wardrobe.

216
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:48,844
Then,

217
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,169
in the other night,
Big and I were to speak on...

218
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,094
You know, to live together and

219
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,023
our future and...

220
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:01,558
On what he/she made sense
while we moved forward and...

221
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,368
And?

222
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,095
We decided to marry.

223
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:13,150
- And I am deaf.
- I am so excited!

224
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:15,597
- All are to look.
- Excuse!

225
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,821
Immense lament, but...

226
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:19,853
This is my friend and

227
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:26,616
he/she has just been bride.
She already walks with the man 10 years ago!

228
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:35,086
- I am tortured.
- I have a buzzing in the ear.

229
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,289
<i > AND the great news was about
to cross the country.</i>

230
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,073
Samantha Jones.

231
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:43,728
I Made a decision and I wait
that are happy with her.

232
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,698
Wanted, finally you applied botox!

233
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:51,208
- No, I didn't apply botox.
- I tell you that you will adore, Carrie.

234
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,740
<i > I didn't call to speak of botox.</i>

235
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,375
I am only to say.

236
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:57,849
Last week,

237
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:01,129
<i > after the auction
I began to think in my options.</i>

238
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,222
Yes...

239
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,261
<I > AND...</i>

240
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,254
Well...

241
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,524
I and Big decided to marry.

242
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:11,798
Seriously?

243
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,217
<i > Yes.</i>

244
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,884
Well, that is óptimo.

245
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,754
You seemed more animated with the botox.

246
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,833
Wanted, I am animated by you,
but you already know me.

247
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,111
I don't believe in the marriage.
Now the botox...

248
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,547
he/she always results.
- Samantha, line two.

249
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:33,673
I have to turn off. We spoke when
it is in the city, for the week.

250
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,030
Is he/she there?

251
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,493
I think was in shock.

252
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,852
<i > you are you, to marry.</i>

253
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:56,327
- It is not any other one, you are you.
- Yes, I notice.

254
00:13:56,362 --> 00:14:00,497
I thought after that confusion with
Aiden, didn't want to marry.

255
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,512
Therefore I put you in my file
of no-casadoira and

256
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,706
now I will have to leave.
- Well,

257
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:12,396
I lament the extra paper work.
- You will receive the bill.

258
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:13,805
<i > Samantha, < /i>

259
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,436
it is that this time seems to be everything so
different. No there is none

260
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:22,309
cliché of a to kneel down romantic.
They are alone

261
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,078
two adults

262
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,643
to make a decision on
they pass the rest of the together life.

263
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:28,985
Well...

264
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,913
I am happy for you.

265
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,630
One more thing.

266
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,628
I want you to be honor lady.

267
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,506
What do find of that?

268
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,432
<i > the same as you sit down for the botox.</i>

269
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,845
Painful and unnecessary.

270
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,313
74, 75, 76 guests.

271
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:47,871
75 sound better.

272
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:51,232
A small marriage of 75 guests.

273
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,418
76 trombones, yes.
76 guests, not.

274
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:58,442
<i > As marriage present, Charlotte
he/she gave me Anthony Marentino.</i>

275
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,911
<i > I Become friends and organizer of marriages.
Right.</i>

276
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:03,196
Then...

277
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,813
Scratched out!
I adored.

278
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:09,000
I hope are so resolved
for the location and for the dress.

279
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,815
- I already found the dress.
- The something? When?

280
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,210
Yes, the other day.
I have him/it there!

281
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:18,525
- This will be good.
- I am so excited.

282
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,312
Here it is.

283
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,895
It was really that reacção that I intended.

284
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,459
It is beautiful, but...

285
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:33,395
It is so simple.

286
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,484
Simple and classic.

287
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,450
When I saw him/it, I thought:

288
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,846
"It is with that
that I should marry with Big."

289
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,343
Of who it is?
Which is the mark?

290
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,075
Of anybody.
I found him/it in an old clothing store.

291
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,164
- "The bride used a dress of Anybody ".
- Go there.

292
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,431
You know that will improve him/it
with some shoes.

293
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:54,751
Because.

294
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,578
The invitation is finer
that the dress.

295
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,923
- I heard that.
- It was for you hear!

296
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,250
<i > THE last spinster,
Carrie Bradshaw, < /i>

297
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,121
<i > it will marry in Manolo's,
with the financier From New York < /i>

298
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,377
<i > John James Preston,
next Autumn.</i>

299
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,878
- Our marriage comes in the page six.
- Who there would put that?

300
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,821
<i > what proves the all the unmarried women < /i>

301
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:29,228

after the forty.

302
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,164
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

303
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,712
<i > it Seemed that wherever went,
all had seen the page six.</i>

304
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:40,843
<i > Even people that it was not waited,
as my publisher of the it Sails. Enid.</i>

305
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:45,347
We are to do ours
annual article about the age

306
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:47,097
and we want you to treat of the forty.
- Óptimo. Who will interview?

307
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,213
No, you...
You have forty.

308
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,754
I want that are portrayed
as the quarentona

309
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,454
- and here it is going the diamond or else -

310
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:57,357
bride.

311
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,922
Wait, me...

312
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:03,580
- Would I appear in the magazine?
- Dressed of bride.

313
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:08,650
It is an only opportunity, for that
it releases me a week of search for the soul

314
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:11,093
and he/she just says that yes.

315
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:15,192
- Enid, am very flattered, but...
- Carrie...

316
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:18,281
Designers of the it Sails.
Photographers of the it Sails.

317
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,636
Hairdressers of the it Sails.

318
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:22,997
He/she waives with the head.
Yes.

319
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:29,061
Thank you.
It will be a surprise.

320
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:31,506
We will call him/her:
"The last unmarried woman."

321
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,964
Well,

322
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,913
difficultly I am the last unmarried woman.

323
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,312
No, but

324
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,440
forty years it is the limit for a woman
to be photographed dressed of bride

325
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:43,504
without seeming an espectáculo of the brave.

326
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,808
He/she thought that if he/she treated of style
the any age.

327
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,892
Style, yes.
He/she becomes engaged, not.

328
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:58,725
<i > A typical Wednesday,
to tan with old friends, < /i>

329
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,565
<i > like Stanford Blatch.</i>

330
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,786
<i > AND with new friends, < /i>

331
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,436
<i > like Vera Wang.</i>

332
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:06,977
She is a borracho, for somebody
that he/she didn't judge to possess bride's genes.

333
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:10,377
- He/she seems that with the right man.
- And with the right dress.

334
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,139
When it marries I will use myself something like that.

335
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,305
- Only that larger.

336
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,105
I liked.
Smile.

00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:26,458
Fantastic. Beautiful.

Óptima.

00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,257
<i > it began my fatito to run
of there outside.</i>

355
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,191
I lean...

356
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:29,723
You are the last New Yorker
what does still bring books of the library?

357
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:32,095
I adore the smell.

358
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,910
It is velhinho.

359
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:42,431
"Letters of great men's love"
Volume One.

360
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,142
- Am I there?
- No...

361
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:48,072
but some of your school friends
they are. Voltaire, Napoleon.

362
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,712
Young, you have to buy glasses.

363
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:54,870
I don't have anything, I have yours.

364
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,692
He/she listens to Napoleon.

365
00:20:57,075 --> 00:21:00,954
"My dear Josefina,
consumed agreement of thinking in you."

366
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:04,439
It is typical.
The quietly surrenders soon.

367
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:08,061
- Because you are to read that?
- It is research for my new book.

368
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:10,097
Is it on the something?

369
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,358
The Love.

370
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:14,124
Write on finding
the love. Now I want to write

371
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,656
on what it happens
after finding.

372
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,746
Interesting.

373
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,555
What does happen he/she?

374
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,255
Continue tuned in.

375
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,994
Listen.
It belongs to Beethoven.

376
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,337
He/she orders to come, Ludwig.

377
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,982
"My thoughts are going to you,
my dear immortal.

378
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:36,910
"I will only be able to live in the middle of the with you,
or not to live of completely."

379
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,371
It is good material.

380
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,947
"It turns you my life,
my whole.

381
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:45,520
"Just with the full conscience of ours
existence can reach the objectivo

382
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,861
"of we live together.

383
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,536
"Oh, he/she continues to love me,

384
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:52,377
"never judge mistakenly
your lover's faithful heart."

385
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,990
"Forever your

386
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,776
"Forever mine

387
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,444
Forever ours."

388
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,373
Some time you wrote me
a love letter?

389
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,523
Does a love fax count?

390
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,611
When is it that received a love fax?

391
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,589
I am the sure that mine
secretary will have you correspondent one.

392
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:17,183
What can tell you, done want?
He/she doesn't make my style.

393
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:21,231
Besides, those types had to write.
They were separate from the lovers for wars

394
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,579
and hundreds of quilómetros.

395
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,596
I am here.

396
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:28,203
Hello.

397
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,135
You do me very happy.

398
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,413
He/she puts that in writing.

399
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,029
<i > With my mind
concerned pré-nupcialmente, < /i>

400
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:41,020

402
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,264
<i > and of "Love Story", they will cost me
plus than some tears.</i>

403
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,686
He/she does favor.

404
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:51,073
- Where is the marriage?
- To the summit of the stairways.

405
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,181
<i > it was perfect.</i>

406
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,415
<i > Big and I would marry in a classic
mark of New York < /i>

407
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,119
<i > that housed all the big ones
love histories.</i>

408
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:16,624
Where is the employee with the bill?

409
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:20,028
He/she has calm, Miranda.
Magda still nor it ended.

410
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:22,892
I still have a summary for
to prepare when the house arrives.

411
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,974
I have to go to the bath house.

412
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,557
I take him/it.

413
00:23:26,592 --> 00:23:28,014
Thank you, Magda.

414
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:31,965
We will wash that beautiful face.
He/she walks, he/she walks.

415
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:35,831
What was?

416
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,473
We cannot leave that
the hard-working owner has just had dinner?

417
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,495
He/she excuses, but I am exhausted.

418
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,730
Brady woke up me at 5 in the morning.

419
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,611
He/she also woke up me.

420
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:45,416
Because...

421
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:48,508
We have to leave of putting Brady
in our bed.

422
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:56,045
You have milk in the upper lip.

423
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,699
What did go now he/she?

424
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:01,631
- You are always to criticize me.
- Nothing is not!

425
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:06,254
You want to live with foam in the lip
without nobody tells you?

426
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,483
Do you want to tell me some thing?

427
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,399
Is there something what want me to say?

428
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:33,990
Yes...

429
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:34,827
Yes!

430
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,899
He/she waits, wait,
don't come you already.

431
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,256
He/she jumps upward.

432
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,206
We will dispatch there this.

433
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,850
Dear, we have to get up
in four and a half hours.

434
00:24:52,946 --> 00:24:56,783
We never have sex and you
do you want to dispatch?

435
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,521
Steve, we make sex.

436
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,644
When was the last time?

437
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,154
There was snow in the ground.

438
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:23,137
With that frequency you
do they make sex?

439
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,157
Miranda, please.

440
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,155
What was? She is three years old,
he/she doesn't know what that is.

441
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,715
- I have 41 and I don't also know.
- I know, but she walks to repeat everything.

442
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,993
If I knew that the conversation
of women it will be prohibited

443
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:40,032
5 thousand quilómetros would not have flown.
- We can speak, but without that word.

444
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,796
Right.

445
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,150
With that frequency you...

446
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,969
- "Do they paint?"
- Thank you.

447
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:49,914
I don't get to "paint" that arrives.
The day could start to "paint."

448
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:54,833
Everyday, if he/she had opportunity.
All used my box's pencils.

449
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,761
We already noticed.
You adore to "paint."

450
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,892
Because you ask?

451
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,706
Well, last night
Steve and I were to "paint"

452
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,475
and I was almost the...
- To come me.

453
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:10,483
- Lament. There is no equivalence in the pencils.
- He wanted to change of position

454
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:11,859
and I said:

455
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:15,849
"We will dispatch there this!"

456
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:19,385
He was always to try
to prolong the acto.

457
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,716
- And is that bad?
- It is, when one works on time entirely.

458
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,001
I work on time entirely.

459
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:26,255
But you don't have a small of 5 years,
parties, parents' meetings.

460
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,501
And a mother-in-law in a home
with Alzheimer already advanced.

461
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:33,114
We are just to pass for a phase
of "No-painting."

462
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,643
It goes and it comes.
Right?

463
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,658
All the couples are different.
Harry and I make love

464
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,475
two to three times a week.
- Good, now I feel worser.

465
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,245
When was your last time?

466
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,857
- Six months ago.
- Epá!

467
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,521
He/she seems a long time.

468
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,468
- But they were times of thin cows.
- Apposed that yes.

469
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,424
Carrie, then and you and Big?

470
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:59,200
Go there. I counted.

471
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,694
Bill!

472
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,277
But I tell you this.

473
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,579
When Big "paints",

474
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:10,557
he/she rarely stays inside
of the outlines.

475
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,976
This helped enough.

476
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,491
John?

477
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,931
<i > Completely out of the outlines.</i>

478
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:56,257
He/she sends for Smith Jared,
in the home of the office.

479
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,550
I have to turn off,
a thing appeared.

480
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:04,675
- I have a gift for you.
- Up to now, I am to like.

481
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:14,442
How?

482
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:18,544
Wait!
You were you to the telephone in the auction.

483
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:20,618
- I know him/it as you wanted him/it.
- But,

484
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:23,302
I will buy him/it for me.

485
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:26,131
I wanted offer-to.

486
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,476
For our birthday.

487
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:31,334
He/she does today five years
that we met each other.

488
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,081
Because it was.

489
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:36,083
Do you like?

490
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:36,949
Well,

491
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:39,256
just so that it is clear,
that is a ring with diamonds,

492
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,079
no a ring of diamonds, right?
- Yes.

493
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:45,352
In that case, I adore.

494
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:49,808
It is the second best thing
that some time I found there inside.

495
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,856
Now, my gift

496
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,050
it is more for the oral.

497
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,622
Wanted,

498
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,407
I have to go for the bed.
- For the bed?

499
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:03,669
- They are 19:30.
- I have to be at the studio at 06:00 o'clock

500
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:07,252
and I have go workout first.
- Do you see? It is like this that begins.

501
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:12,002
When we give for her, we already only have sex
three or four times a week.

502
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:45,985
<i > AND it was Samantha as soon as discovered
that he/she had a new neighbor.</i>

503
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,092
<i > From there, night after night, < /i>

504
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:53,025
<i > while Smith made yours
beauty sleep, < /i>

505
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:59,328
<i > Samantha found something more
interesting to see than TV.</i>

506
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,102
Continue.

507
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:10,274
- He/she maintains in the closed ones.
- He/she is well.

508
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,320
He/she opens them.

509
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,044
Double doors.

510
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,606
Up to now everything well.

511
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,135
My God!

512
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:41,422
I am proud, gentleman.

513
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:43,271
Do you like?

514
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:46,064
Do I like if?

515
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,814
It is love at first sight.

516
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:54,214
Epá!

517
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:55,886
Take.

518
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,408
Wait.

519
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,089
Hold.

520
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:10,225
Now I believe that this
he/she is really to happen.

521
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,141
Nor I believe in the speed with
that he/she sold himself your apartment.

522
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:16,870
- It is a sign.
- A sign that the price was very low.

523
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,447
It is the... food.
Do you open, please?

524
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,686
While they put her/it in the table,
I begin in the wardrobe.

525
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:24,637
I should dispatch myself of here the some
17 years.

526
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,609
Very well.

527
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:28,415
Pink PostIt is to take.

528
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,786
The violet is for the garbage.
The yellow is to keep.

529
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:34,839
They are óptimas friends!

530
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:41,657
My God!

531
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:47,582
I don't believe! Lilly, looks who is!
It is Samantha!

532
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,807
- What do make here?
- A lot of thing happened at this house.

533
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,570
The attention should be rewarded.

534
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:02,222
- Come unfastened!
- My God!

535
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,981
Do they remember this?

536
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:14,831
<i > While Samantha put
the best of the eighties < /i>

537
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:19,183
<i > I put the worst ones.</i>

538
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:21,590
The aliens are there.

539
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:28,450
- A hook in banana form.
- GARBAGE

540
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,549
<b > it TAKES < /b>

541
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:36,450
It is quite so.
Sway.

<b > it TAKES < /b>

543
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,892
<b > I SAND < /b>

544
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:53,989
It is for the garbage.

00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:07,098
<b > it TAKES < /b>

546
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:16,534

00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,256
<i > in 38 boxes.</i>

548
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:44,289
Tomorrow,
while I will see your mother,

549
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:47,318
maybe you could take Brady to the
first party of years that is going alone.

550
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:51,906
Then I will have with you to the party of the gémeoses,
you can leave and to be at the bar at 18.00 o'clock.

551
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:55,141
What was?

552
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,180
I made sex with other person.

553
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:04,670
And, you are wonderful and,

554
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:08,507
I don't know as I could do you that.

555
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:12,342
Us the two didn't have sex
there is immense time and me...

556
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:14,295
My God!

557
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,965
He/she didn't mean anything,
he/she only happened once.

558
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,552
I have been me unbearable.

559
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,838
Has it been you unbearable?

560
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:24,854
He/she happened.

561
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:29,813
I was not to think.

562
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,155
Don't follow me!

563
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,970
Scott, leaves.

564
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:56,719
Miranda, I continue to be me.

565
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:01,697
Are you?

566
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,204
Steve?
I don't get to believe.

567
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:21,142
- It is sad.
- Yes, it is sad, but...

568
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:25,241
I won't turn him/it sadder being
in a bad hotel, while I seek house.

569
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:27,009
Do you pass me the salt?

570
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:30,007
Of course has to be in the
he/she lowers and close to Brooklyn.

571
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,862
We will maintain the life of Brady
the most normal possible.

572
00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:35,927
I am with him in my days and
Steve us of him. And...

573
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:38,515
he will walk
back and for ahead.

574
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:42,124
I don't know if this question is valid,
but,

575
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,056
how is Steve to work with this?

576
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:46,903
He/she says to be devastated and he/she begs me
for he/she forgives him.

577
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,294
He/she won't happen.

578
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,591
- Badly I support to look for him.
- Miranda, wanted,

579
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,445
are you the sure that you want to do this?

580
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,029
It was alone once,
any one can slip.

581
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,156
Even if accepted that justification,

582
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:00,827
it is the part of betraying.
The part behind my backs,

583
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:04,219
the violation of the trust.
It is that that is me to kill.

584
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,544
Thank you for beings you.

585
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:22,159
<i > Charlotte made love with Harry
four times on that week.</i>

586
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,715
The marriage is to press.
We have to see this seriously.

587
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,677
Now no.

588
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:29,970
Have just received one
our contractor's e-mail.

589
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,326
He postponed the conclusion date,
again.

590
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:34,719
- I have to answer him/her...
- No, not,

591
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:35,788
no.

592
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:38,562
The Marriage before the contractor.

593
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,814
Unless planeies to invite him.

594
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,740
What would do with that the list
of guests it passed for 201.

595
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:46,549
200?

596
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,377
My God, Carrie!
Did he/she arise again?

597
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:51,939
- It is the dress.
- You said that you/they were 75 people.

598
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,656
How can I explain?

599
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,276
Listen.

600
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:01,073
Did you already play póquer, right?

601
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,706
The dress?

602
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:04,577
He/she goes up the stop.

603
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,123
As they are

604
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,829
your votes?

605
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,053
He/she reminds you that will say them
in front of immense people.

606
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:17,517
- Therefore the pressure is...
- Right. He/she lifts you,

607
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:19,076
I have to finish this.
He/she lifts you!

608
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:21,879
- I don't have time for this.
- You are not to take him/it seriously.

609
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:24,085
Because I am not.
It is a circus.

610
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,668
200 people?

611
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:33,847
Page six?

612
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,136
This is my third marriage.

613
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,599
How do you think this makes to resemble?

614
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,472
Me not

615
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:54,521
he/she knew that that would be a problem.

616
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:02,070
Because you didn't say anything earlier?

617
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,897
You wanted this everything.

618
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:05,428
Yes.

619
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:08,578
- But you don't want...
- I want you.

620
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,718
It is that that I want.

621
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,407
For me it was enough to have gone
to Registo Civil.

622
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:38,303
I think now is too much
late for Registo Civil.

623
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,915
No, I was not to suggest,

624
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,429
he/she was only to say.

625
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:47,535
Do you see?

626
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:52,229
It is that expression
that have been trying to avoid.

627
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:55,157
He/she walks here.

628
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:59,025
Excuse.

629
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:01,135
No...

630
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:04,518
You are a óptimo friend.

631
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:12,163
<i > it is soon arrived the night
previous to the great day.</i>

632
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:16,576
There they are them!

633
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:40,167
I know that in the rehearsal dinner,
it is tradition that the honor lady

634
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:43,788
reveal embarrassing things
on the bride.

635
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,641
But in our group,

636
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,945
us never in the descaímos.

637
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:51,984
Therefore it would like of
to do a gift to the fiancé.

638
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:54,740
There it is a word
that he already heard before.

639
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:59,914
- Who is that type?
- He/she is Carl. He/she is partner in the firm.

640
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,868
- He is half foolish.
- They know what gets used to say:

641
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:04,385
- "There are third is once and for all."
- Silly Ó!

642
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,945
I am to speak!

643
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:10,830
Samantha!

644
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:17,765
There were heights in that we had the
our doubts on this borracho.

645
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,248
But after having taken care observation,
along the last a hundred years,

646
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,875
my doubts are dissipated.

647
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,884
Therefore, to the fiancé.

648
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:32,348
A man that was finally
"Carrie-cattle" for far.

649
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,777
To the hope, Jonh.

650
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:37,744
That stupid!

651
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:40,186
It was really beautiful.
Thank you.

652
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:43,718
- Anything as an illegal Cuban cigar.
- Exacto.

653
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:47,353
- It was a great gift, Samantha.
- Because.

654
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:49,268
And you are a great man.

655
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:52,428
- He/she is there a taxi. He/she picks him/it.
- Ó friend, wait there!

656
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,054
Steve.

657
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:58,483
I don't want to inconvenience you.

658
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:00,514
You are not us to inconvenience.

659
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:03,127
But,

660
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,448
I need to speak with Miranda.

661
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,785
Samantha, could ask him/her
to come here out?

662
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,848
I don't want to enter,
it is a party and such...

663
00:41:13,218 --> 00:41:14,607
Clear.

664
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:21,878
I didn't speak to you the night all.

665
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:24,258
Steve is here.

666
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,554
Hello, personal.

667
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:34,875
They could feel...

668
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,540
Clear.
We will enter.

669
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,648
Are you well?

670
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,307
No me of this choice.

671
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,412
You don't answer to my phone calls.

672
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,693
Only speeches with me when
we are ahead of the small,

673
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:59,235
and you know that cannot say anything.
- What will have to say

674
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,791
what can improve the things?
- Miranda,

675
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:03,461
please.

676
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:06,964
- It was only that time.
- You of this cable of us!

677
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:10,467
Of this cable of us!
The one that we had is undone!

678
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:23,439
I changed for you.

679
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,355
- Are you well?
- No, anything well.

680
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:38,582
You are crazy in marrying.

681
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:41,189
The marriage arruína everything.

682
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,612
Here you are you.

683
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:57,470
I thought will flee me.

684
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:01,227
The grown girls' night
he/she is about to begin.

685
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,370
Is everything well?

686
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:12,430
Yes.
I think am tired.

687
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,894
We are going home to sleep.

688
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:18,158
But first he/she gives me a good night kiss
and that is a good one.

689
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:22,752
Because it is the last as unmarried woman.

690
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,956
I always knew that she would marry
with Big.

691
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:30,185
- You didn't know anything.
- That is of crazy.

692
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,054
He/she knew, yes!
Every time that you/they ended

693
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,251
I thought for me:
"No. They deserve to be together."

694
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:38,264
Same later
of the second time that ended?

695
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,313
- Yes.
- Even after to 15th?

696
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,334
Hilarious.
Acabámos a lot of times.

697
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:47,087
Yes, but later the comes
scalding reconciliation sex.

698
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,855
Do you want to assist?

699
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,655
He/she opens him/it.

700
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,045
Sex.

701
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:03,226
Are you the sure that my daughter is not?

702
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:04,945
Am I?

703
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,105
I am me.

704
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:08,291
Did you hear Lilly?

705
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,457
I need to speak with you.

706
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:11,759
The something?

707
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:14,040
I am here seating

708
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:16,733
to try to write the votes and...

709
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:21,375
That is a thing
what do want even to do?

710
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:25,027
Personal, it is Big.
I will assist...

711
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:29,190
He/she sees if you sleep, fiancé!

712
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,110
What does happen he/she?

713
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:36,571
It is alone...

714
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,239
Everything is óptimo as it is.

715
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:42,799
I don't want to destroy him/it.

716
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:44,179
You don't go.

717
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:47,208
I already destroyed him/it twice.

718
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:49,333
But now,

719
00:44:50,032 --> 00:44:53,308
it is with me that you will marry tomorrow.
With me.

720
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,942
With more nobody.

721
00:44:56,287 --> 00:44:57,507
Yes?

722
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,647
<i > AND I will marry with you.</i>

723
00:44:59,682 --> 00:45:01,578
<i > I am me and you.</i>

724
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:04,591
And do you want to know the best of that?

725
00:45:05,022 --> 00:45:05,989
<i > Yes.</i>

726
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:09,942
Both already made the possible ones
for destroying.

727
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:13,101
Is a smile that I am to listen?

728
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,266
It is.

729
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:15,622

<i > I find,
as professional writer, < /i>

733
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:27,100

740
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:47,666
Simple, necessary and interest
that I don't claim author's rights.

741
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,416
Now you are going to the bed, right?

742
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,629
He/she is well.

743
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,822

That yes, he/she is a bride.

Before we leave will look for
the flowers, certain, girls?

00:47:31,063 --> 00:47:33,493
<i > Hello, it is Carrie.
Leave message.</i>

757
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:35,513

Good-bye.

759
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,324
- Blue.
- Yes, gentleman.

760
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,831
Red.

761
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:46,935
- It is black.
- Red, I am me.

762
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,296

Go, he/she walks.

766
00:47:57,476 --> 00:48:01,494
There it is going the bride.
Does he/she look, does a princess seem, do you see?

Could you hold in this?

768
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,809
- Thank you.
- Happinesses.

769
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:13,969
It is as passing a convoy for one
hole of a lock.

770
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:15,157
We see each other in the library.

771

<i > Hello, it is Carrie.
Leave message.</i>

772

He/she ties me as soon as hear this.

774
00:48:25,006 --> 00:48:28,497
I don't want more guests in these stairways.
Just the bride's group.

775
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:29,947
Right.

776
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:32,299
We have a problem.

777
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:35,233
- They are not here.
- They should be arrested in the traffic.

778
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:36,541
The two?

779
00:48:42,644 --> 00:48:45,169

00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:47,992

I need to know
that are still us.

00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,460
Only you and me.

There they come.

789
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,552
- Then?
- I know, the traffic was of the worst.

790
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:47,852

We are ready.

794
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,298
He is not here.

795
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:04,012
- Who is that is not here?
- The fiancé.

796
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:05,787
What does happen he/she?

797
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:08,640
Big is not here.

798
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:11,071
But we are 25 minutes
late.

799
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:13,150
Did anybody tie him/her?

800
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:18,535
Feel a telephone.

801
00:50:19,073 --> 00:50:20,891
Somebody that feels a telephone.

802
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:25,931
I don't know how to move in this.

803
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:27,172
He/she takes, wanted.

00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:28,715

807
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:45,229
Are you well?

00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:47,980
I am to call there is one hour.
Because you don't answer the telephone?

809
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:50,628
Because I don't know where I have the telephone!

810
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:54,017
What does the one happen then?
Where are you?

811
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,807
I was there ahead.

812
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:58,199
Have just come me away.

813
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:03,209
I don't manage to do this.

814
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:10,156
My God!

815
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:15,026
<i > Carrie?</i>

816
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:16,669

818
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:24,436
- My God!
- How like this, doesn't it come?

819
00:51:24,757 --> 00:51:26,725
Group Brady home

820
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,504
Remove me of here.

- Remove me of here!
- They go, vain.

822
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:34,347
Take her that I am here to treat of this.

823
00:51:57,266 --> 00:51:59,487
But the one what do I be to do?
Give the turn.

824
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:01,290
It is a street of only sense,
I have to give the turn to the block.

825
00:52:01,325 --> 00:52:03,515
When we give the turn
she already left.

826
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:06,553
Nobody doesn't come behind us.
Give the turn.

827
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:16,222
I think are them.

828
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:18,050
Lean.
Lean.

829
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,302
Carrie!

830
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:28,692
Carrie.

831
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,034
I went by moments
but now I am prepared.

832
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:41,391
I knew that you would make this!
I knew!

833
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,952
Carrie, excuse.

834
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:45,807
- I was humiliated!
- Excuse.

835
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:47,462
He/she excuses, Carrie.

836
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,049
He/she walks, he/she walks.

837
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,535
Carrie, wait.
Excuse. Carrie...

838
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,015
No! No!

839
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,158
He/she walks, he/she enters in the car.

840
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,481
Everything is well.

841
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,961
He/she walks there! He/she moves you!

842
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:55,887
He/she thought that would be still
to suffer vastly.

843
00:53:58,853 --> 00:54:00,923
I don't feel anything.

844
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:06,301
He/she wanted a little more of "anything."

845
00:54:12,073 --> 00:54:14,528
Yes, I continue abandoned.

846
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:19,769
What bug will have bitten him/her?
He was óptimo in dinner.

847
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:23,181
I knew when he called last night.

848
00:54:23,216 --> 00:54:24,352
I noticed something.

849
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,929
Then because you didn't say anything?

850
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,434
He/she didn't want to believe.

851
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,333
Nor he/she wanted to say him/it aloud.

852
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:39,082
Now I don't have where to live.

853
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:42,048
- You are here.
- Forever.

854
00:54:42,723 --> 00:54:45,400
Maybe you should eat any thing.

855
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,709
Is anybody hungry?

856
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,449
My clothes.
There I cannot return.

857
00:54:52,484 --> 00:54:54,506
How will I recover the clothes?

858
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,499
I can hire people to do that.
What wants you to need.

859
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,953
A murderer?

860
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:05,296
I don't have anything to dress
excepto a wedding dress.

861
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:08,699
You have the clothes here for the honeymoon.

862
00:55:09,488 --> 00:55:12,416
There it is a comfort.

863
00:55:13,803 --> 00:55:15,469
A honeymoon

864
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:20,652
in a romantic Mexican stay that
it was pré-paid with my credit card

865
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:23,137
because I wanted to surprise the man
that he/she abandoned me.

866
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:24,732
I can get rid of that.

867
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:27,882
Nor that is said that he/she died somebody.

868
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:29,938
And didn't he/she die?

869
00:55:33,258 --> 00:55:36,388
He/she maintains those closed eyes.
Fechadinhos.

870
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:52,809
Charlotte...

871
00:55:57,461 --> 00:56:00,340
I think I made a big one blurry.

872
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,645
He/she said a thing to Big,
in the rehearsal dinner.

873
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:06,848
How like this?

874
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:10,370
It was just after Steve to appear.
It was disturbed.

875
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:13,795
Big came to have with me
and I said something as:

876
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,710
"You are crazy in marrying."

877
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:20,042
He/she left me.

878
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,307
- Do you think was for that?
- No.

879
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:28,112
He is eccentric with the marriage
there are years.

880
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,284
I continue to think
that should tell Carrie.

881
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:32,685
No, not.

882
00:56:33,108 --> 00:56:36,763
It is a bad height until
to mention that.

883
00:56:37,337 --> 00:56:38,854
No, not.

884
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:42,529
He/she arranges another height,
later.

885
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,223
Well, it seems that not
I removed her/it of the honeymoon,

886
00:56:46,258 --> 00:56:48,714
but I put us there.
- The something?

887
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:52,613
I marked in the three places in the flight.
Mexico,

888
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,746
here we go us.

889
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:58,191
I cannot go to Mexico.
I have a job.

890
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:08,960
He/she leaves for Jared.
Smith Jared with a "J."

891
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:12,007
Quite so, thank you.

892
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:14,108
I adore you.

893
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:19,864
Already chegámos.
I later call you.

894
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:24,005
- Welcome to Mexico.
- Buenos days!

895
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,893
Buenos days.

896
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,161
- Hello.
- Do they have Wi-Fi?

897
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,797
Thank you.

898
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:34,767
Lament, but I am confused.

899
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,985
I wait for Sr. and Sra. Preston.

900
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,806
You will wait a lot.

901
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,913
Then we spoke.

902
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:50,553
This will kill her.

903
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:54,671
- Where is she?
- In the bath house.

904
00:57:54,706 --> 00:57:57,378
- We will give a view of eyes.
- Yes.

905
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:30,608
And this is the main suite.

906
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:33,497
Oh my God!

907
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:35,202
Hold.

908
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:37,455
You treat of that side.

909
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:41,200
Where will we put this?

910
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:43,722
In here.

911
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:47,046
Enough of honeymoon things.
That is very important.

912
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:54,742
There she comes.

913
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:10,950
It will be a sunset divinal.

914
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:14,337
He/she closes the blinds.

915
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:22,030
All.

916
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:44,658
Good morning.

917
00:59:47,147 --> 00:59:49,127
Was a dream?

918
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:03,876
Carrie?

919
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,447
It is dinnertime,
you slept all the day.

920
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:10,941
Is it later?

921
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:25,703
Wanted,

922
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:28,671
you have to eat any thing.

923
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,571
I am tired.

924
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:34,569
He/she eats any thing and turn to sleep.

925
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:49,758
Carrie!

926
01:00:52,168 --> 01:00:53,615
Is there coffee?

927
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:56,933
Yes!
Yes, clear.

928
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:07,047
This sun knows well.

929
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:12,825
My God, wanted!
There was not wax?

930
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,095
What was?
He/she didn't know that will walk in fact of bath.

931
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,871
Of the one what are to speak you?

932
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:21,123
- I forgot to do the depilation.
- From when, 1998?

933
01:01:21,158 --> 01:01:24,428
- He/she had other things in that to think.
- I could be in the corridor of the death,

934
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:27,489
and it would not be like this.
- Samantha, when if it is married,

935
01:01:27,524 --> 01:01:30,900
it is had different priorities.
- Don't use the marriage.

936
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:33,820
This is married and not
he/she has a forest.

937
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:36,271
How do you get to cross the legs?

938
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:40,723
He/she lets to mark me you a session in SPA.
Denser and no longer you find her.

939
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:45,020
Is it then?
Is my fault?

940
01:01:45,055 --> 01:01:48,219
Did I leave the sex to dismay in my marriage?
Did I deserve him/it what had?

941
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:51,104
- Thank you for you understand.
- Wanted, excuse.

942
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:54,081
- It is not that that me...
- I am well!

943
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:08,947
- We will have dinner to the hotel, today.
- Seriously?

944
01:02:09,232 --> 01:02:09,997
Yes.

945
01:02:10,032 --> 01:02:13,073
I have to do something to remove me
of my "Move-coma."

946
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:17,094
Wanted, you made a joke.
That good for you.

947
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,200
Buenas noches.

948
01:02:36,235 --> 01:02:38,238
My name is Felix and I will be your employee.

949
01:02:38,273 --> 01:02:40,678
Felix, we will begin with four
Margaritas.

950
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,774
No, I won't drink.
A bottle of water.

951
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:45,717
- I drink the one of her.
- Yes. Can they give me the number of the rooms?

952
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:49,246
We are in an of the private houses.

953
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,084
To number three.

954
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,045
Certain, Sra. Preston.

955
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:59,362
It was as taking a shot.

956
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,774
Charlotte has pudding in his/her Prada.

957
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,786
- Will it be that will smile again?
- Yes!

958
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:16,923
When?

959
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:20,176
When there is something
same very funny.

960
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:25,848
I have to thank to Mariachis.
Nor I hear myself to think.

961
01:03:27,831 --> 01:03:31,281
Fabulous!
And he/she continues to bring them.

962
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:33,286
Thank you.

963
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,135
Thank you.

964
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:49,808
He didn't get to leave the car.

965
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:53,163
After ten years
of the one that did happen

966
01:03:53,198 --> 01:03:57,779
he/she could not make the effort,
and to leave the car.

967
01:03:57,814 --> 01:03:59,748
I made the effort.

968
01:03:59,783 --> 01:04:02,781
- I put a bird in the head.
- Was that a bird?

969
01:04:02,816 --> 01:04:05,098
- Yes.
- He/she thought that were feathers.

970
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,975
- It was a bird.
- It was beautiful.

971
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,133
He is bad.

972
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:15,001
It was always it.

973
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:19,806
- Subjects bad, make bad things.
- Good subjects, also make bad things.

974
01:04:19,841 --> 01:04:22,789
The good ones fodem-you
and the bad fodem-you.

975
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:25,268
And the remaining ones don't know you foder,
trust me.

976
01:04:25,303 --> 01:04:28,275
- I have been making my research.
- After everything that I know,

977
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:32,534
after 20 years of
learning,

978
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:37,740
everything lied down out for the emotion of putting
his name in the honeymoon suite.

979
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:41,092
If he/she didn't know me
he/she would not say that was me.

980
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:44,461
Since we are with this conversation,

981
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:49,295
nor I believe that my life
rotate to a man's turn.

982
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,813
How did I allow that?

983
01:04:51,848 --> 01:04:53,045
But you love him.

984
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:57,117
That explains to say his name
50 times more than mine?

985
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:01,548
He/she explains worrying with him and with
their needs before mine?

986
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:04,152
Is everything on the other person?
Is that the love?

987
01:05:04,187 --> 01:05:06,072
No.
That is the marriage.

988
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:07,524
Until this ring.

989
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,386
I wanted to buy him/it for me.
That meant something for me.

990
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:12,388
To make that.
Then,

991
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,655
he buys him/it for me.
- Because he/she knew him/it all liked of him.

992
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:20,346
Yes, but now whenever I look down
I see him/it to him and not to me.

993
01:05:21,758 --> 01:05:23,842
- Everything is...
- One more round.

994
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:25,331
- Wonderful.
- Other?

995
01:05:25,366 --> 01:05:27,915
Relax.
We are on vacation.

996
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:29,723
Technically,
we are in my honeymoon.

997
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:30,681
No.

998
01:05:30,716 --> 01:05:33,019
I think are in their honeymoon.

999
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,484
Yes, it is to boil,
there are already three days.

1000
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,045
What are to do?

1001
01:05:44,164 --> 01:05:46,253
Post office box flood.

1002
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:48,035
Apposed that is.

1003
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,814
- There is nothing as the present.
- No...

1004
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:53,392
I am not still prepared
to face him/it.

1005
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:58,586
I will give a race and later I go
to the class of Pilates, somebody wants...

1006
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,758
- Hello.
- Hello.

1007
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,018
Good news.

1008
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:05,205
Have just received an e-mail of the lawyer
of your buyers.

1009
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,364
They are willing to sell you of turn the
old apartment

1010
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,513
for the market price, and...

1011
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:14,177
they wander when you return
for one more changes.

1012
01:06:14,212 --> 01:06:16,546
For the visas, it can go back home,

1013
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:18,017
but it will cost you.

1014
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:20,471
We will treat of there to put your things.

1015
01:06:21,082 --> 01:06:24,073
You two could govern the world.

1016
01:06:24,453 --> 01:06:26,741
<i > after his/her training,
Charlotte didn't get to avoid < /i>

1020
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,651
<i > he/she forgot from where was
and he/she opened the mouth.</i>

1021
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:06,314
Hello, girl.

1022
01:07:12,035 --> 01:07:13,898
Wanted, which if...

1023
01:07:13,933 --> 01:07:16,976
He/she is closed, she is to clean.
He/she tries the...

1024
01:07:27,698 --> 01:07:30,227
- You ended of...
- He/she silences you! He/she silences you!

1025
01:07:30,302 --> 01:07:31,540
<i > it is like this...</i>

1026
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:35,341
<i > Charlotte made cocó
in the pants.</i>

1027
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,485
<i > Miranda was right.</i>

1028
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,507
<i > When something was
same very funny, < /i>

1029
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:50,003
<i > I laughed me.</i>

1030
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:23,804
<i > 1st message.
Received Saturday, September 20, at 00:30 o'clock.</i>

1031
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:27,621
<i > Carrie, ties me.
I need to speak with you before...</i>

1032
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:23,199
<i > it didn't happen me better height for
to hire an assistant.</i>

1033
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:25,316
No.

1034
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:28,142
I don't lift boxes.

1035
01:09:28,823 --> 01:09:32,672
Without a doubt that not.
He/she adored a career in the fashion.

1036
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:38,267
This is not thin.

1037
01:09:39,256 --> 01:09:41,085
I adore their books.

1038
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,813
It is a brilliant scene.

1039
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,927
Katty?

1040
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:49,237
- You are intoxicated.
- You can have faith.

1041
01:09:49,312 --> 01:09:51,155
Still nor I went to the bed.

1042
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,183
But dactilografo that nor a nut!

1043
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,147
I was formed in Finances, in Princeton.
On these last two years,

1044
01:09:56,182 --> 01:09:58,462
I went assisting of a Vice-president
in Merrill Lynch.

1045
01:09:58,497 --> 01:09:59,790
Impressive.

1046
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:04,556
And... Paul, because he/she is
suitable for this work?

1047
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,326
Then it is of Saint Louis?

1048
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:16,164
Yes.
Louise of Saint Louis.

1049
01:10:16,763 --> 01:10:19,635
- And is it formed in Ciências Informáticas?
- Yes, correcto.

1050
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:22,450
That good for itself.
I badly know how to type.

1051
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,909
- Already some time was assisting personal?
- No.

1052
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:29,696
But I am the oldest of six siblings,
of certainty that I will escape.

1053
01:10:30,256 --> 01:10:32,070
Six siblings.
How is that?

1054
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:33,320
Packed.

1055
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,225
I had to move for New York
only to have space. And how was I?

1056
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,630
In a T0, with three room friends.

1057
01:10:39,665 --> 01:10:43,571
For besides the space,
because he/she moved to New York?

1058
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,893
To fall in love.

1059
01:10:47,598 --> 01:10:49,647
What was?
Is piegas, right?

1060
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:50,573
No.

1061
01:10:50,805 --> 01:10:52,837
No, not.
It is...

1062
01:10:53,611 --> 01:10:55,604
It is very honest.

1063
01:10:56,041 --> 01:11:00,475
I don't hear anybody say that,
there is already a long time.

1064
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:06,470
Then, Louise of Saint Louis,

1065
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:08,792
I only have one more question.

1066
01:11:08,827 --> 01:11:11,221
As it is that an unemployed
with three room friends,

1067
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:14,224
does he/she support to have a suitcase Louis Vuitton?

1068
01:11:14,477 --> 01:11:15,620
It is rented.

1069
01:11:15,655 --> 01:11:18,854
Bag, Borrow or Steel
it is the paradise of the suitcases.

1070
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:22,708
- How is it possible I not to know that?
- He/she is close to me that I guide you.

1071
01:11:27,831 --> 01:11:30,711
<i > it is BEEN guided me.</i>

1072
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,266
Hello.

1073
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:34,970
Speech Louise, I am to call in name
of Carrie Bradshaw.

1074
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:40,309
Yes, she received his/her invitation but
it will be him/her impossible to attend.

1075
01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:41,864
Thank you.

1076
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,715
Put that beyond.

1077
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:53,065
<i > only three days later,
I began to see her as < /i>

1078
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,708
<i > Saint Louis' Santa Louise.</i>

1079
01:11:56,496 --> 01:11:58,918
No there is here anything for you.

1080
01:11:59,647 --> 01:12:03,672
<i > AND while he/she moved for
my old apartment, Miranda < /i>

1081
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:06,374
<i > it sought a new one,
in the drop.</i>

1082
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:09,032
- Do you like letters in Chinese?
- Yes.

1083
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:13,435
To New Magazine he/she says that this
it is the new neighborhood in ascension.

1084
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:17,418
- Maybe over there?
- Maybe do go back home?

1085
01:12:18,156 --> 01:12:19,279
Look!

1086
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:21,186
A white with a bebé.

1087
01:12:21,221 --> 01:12:25,172
Where he goes,
it is where we have to go.

1088
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,671
Let us go.

1089
01:12:27,713 --> 01:12:29,784
I already here lived.

1090
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:33,048
Be an Ukrainian area.

1091
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,223
He/she looks, changes.

1092
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:37,584
Do they arrive or do they go?

1093
01:12:37,835 --> 01:12:39,094
Vain!

1094
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:42,246
Opá, will see.
Do wait here, is it well?

1095
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:47,226
<i > There, in old Ukraine, Miranda
he/she found his/her new apartment.</i>

1096
01:12:49,302 --> 01:12:53,251
It is there were the rest of their days,
where the birds were of guard

1097
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:57,504
and the women nor one
step could give for the street.

1098
01:12:57,871 --> 01:13:03,368
Cinderela and the Prince
they lived happily forever.

1099
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:08,852
You...

1100
01:13:08,887 --> 01:13:12,599
You know that that is just
a fairy tale, right?

1101
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:16,056
And that in the real life the things
not always they happen like this?

1102
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:19,154
I think should know that now.

1103
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:20,803
Again.

1104
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:24,222
One more that falls in the conversation.

1105
01:13:24,257 --> 01:13:25,340
Hello!

1106
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,430
- Hello.
- The mammy is home.

1107
01:13:29,332 --> 01:13:31,754
Thank you for you take care of Lilly
while I went to the doctor.

1108
01:13:31,789 --> 01:13:33,364
You are welcome.

1109
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:35,296
Is everything well?

1110
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:38,572
I am pregnant.

1111
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:40,512
How?

1112
01:13:40,547 --> 01:13:43,972
You know that you/they say that when
it is stopped trying

1113
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:45,525
can it happen?

1114
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,131
And the doctor says that she knows others
couples that adoptaram

1115
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,366
and that later they became pregnant.

1116
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:53,058
Wanted.

1117
01:13:53,093 --> 01:13:55,171
Carrie, am pregnant.

1118
01:13:57,092 --> 01:14:01,199
<i > I Think in certain homes,
the fairy stories take place.</i>

1119
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:05,164
It was really good.

1120
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,038
You seemed half distant.

1121
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:09,015
Distant?

1122
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,040
You are still inside of me.

1123
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:20,055
Do you want to talk about that?

1124
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,125
Some time I already wanted to speak?

1125
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,362
He/she is well.

1126
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:26,737
I speak.

1127
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:29,313
Your best friend was sanded
for that type.

1128
01:14:29,348 --> 01:14:31,818
How could not you be like this?

1129
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:35,396
It is more than that.

1130
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:38,323
Lately,

1131
01:14:38,358 --> 01:14:41,672
I don't have sense a connection with...

1132
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:43,979
- With me?
- No!

1133
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,509
To everything this!

1134
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:50,039
I don't have any connection
with our life here.

1135
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:52,589
What life here?
Seriously.

1136
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:56,980
I only work and you flee for
New York whenever you can.

1137
01:14:57,015 --> 01:15:01,283
Not always that can.
I am only there going to help.

1138
01:15:01,611 --> 01:15:03,114
And the part of being your agent

1139
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:06,711
he/she is to be too much.
I am to begin to resent him/it.

1140
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:09,643
On these last two years
everything is on you.

1141
01:15:09,678 --> 01:15:12,828
In the first three years
everything was on you.

1142
01:15:12,863 --> 01:15:13,957
I know.

1143
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:16,139
It was much more entertaining.

1144
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:19,962
Carrie Bradshaw's page
he/she is a confusion.

1145
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:22,524
Interesting,
Carrie Bradshaw says.

1146
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:26,570
When it is that will treat
of the things really important?

1147
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,236
- How to unwrap my closet?
- A thing of every time.

1148
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,948
- Some time you answered to these e-mails?
- Yes.

1149
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:33,514
When?

1150
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,142
Now?

1151
01:15:35,927 --> 01:15:39,149
- I read and you tell me that to do.
- He/she is well.

1152
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:44,277
Who is john@jjpny.com?

1153
01:15:45,702 --> 01:15:46,960
Shit.

1154
01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:49,262
Is he, it is not?

1155
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:58,250
<B > I DON'T KNOW HIM/IT THAT SAYING.</b>

1156
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:02,495
Turn off.

1157
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:05,960
No there is

1158
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:11,012
any ranch in the cyberspace for
where can you send his e-mails?

1159
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,410
He/she makes that, please.

1160
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,365
You are the sure that you want to finish
all the communication with him?

1161
01:16:24,901 --> 01:16:26,476
He/she is well.
Óptimo.

1162
01:16:29,874 --> 01:16:31,923
Nor I believe that will disguise.

1163
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:35,366
All of the parents in the school of Brady
they disguise, it is entertaining.

1164
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:39,759
This invented by mothers that don't work
and that you/they don't have anything else to do.

1165
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:42,005
Very well, what have here?
Witch

1166
01:16:42,963 --> 01:16:44,901
and Sexy Kitty.

1167
01:16:44,936 --> 01:16:47,564
And it is that.
The only two options for woman.

1168
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:49,466
Witch and Sexy Kitty.

1169
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:51,903
Have just said
a great truth, sister.

1170
01:16:51,938 --> 01:16:55,747
Maybe it should use this with one
suitcase of businesses and to go like me own.

1171
01:16:56,889 --> 01:16:59,130
I received an e-mail of Big.

1172
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:02,119
"I don't know him/it that saying."

1173
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:04,685
Then don't send an e-mail.

1174
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,530
Did for what wait you?

1175
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:10,136
And in the "subject", two words.

1176
01:17:11,015 --> 01:17:12,903
"I apologize."

1177
01:17:14,675 --> 01:17:17,144
Steve is only excuses.

1178
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:18,669
An e-mail of excuses,

1179
01:17:18,704 --> 01:17:21,104
an excuse message,
excuse flowers,

1180
01:17:21,139 --> 01:17:22,756
excuse cards.

1181
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:26,542
That such: Don't "make anything of
what do you come to be sorry?"

1182
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:29,030
Maybe he is sorry.

1183
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:31,660
Maybe Big is also.

1184
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:33,564
Well seen.

1185
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,486
He/she arrives here.
You are to scare the people.

1186
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:41,075
It will be need more than that for me
to scare, after what passed.

1187
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:45,072
I still don't believe
that this happened me.

1188
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:46,589
I know that happened,

1189
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:50,813
but I don't get to believe
that happened.

1190
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:55,588
I am wakened up at night to review,
in the head,

1191
01:17:55,623 --> 01:17:58,820
all of the details of that
last week.

1192
01:17:59,696 --> 01:18:03,299
Carrie, there is a detail
on that last week

1193
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:05,243
that I walk to want to tell you.

1194
01:18:05,278 --> 01:18:06,632
In the rehearsal dinner...

1195
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:08,592
<i > it was then that I saw.</i>

1196
01:18:08,627 --> 01:18:12,022
<i > THE only frightening thing enough
to get scared after what I passed.</i>

1197
01:18:12,023 --> 01:18:13,060
<b > THE SUBJECT OF the AGE < /b>

1198
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:15,050
You are beautiful.
You are wonderful.

1199
01:18:15,085 --> 01:18:17,542
- It is the worst than he/she has.
- He/she waits, wait.

1200
01:18:18,584 --> 01:18:21,130
What does say there he/she, in the note editorial?

1201
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:23,424
"Carrie Bradshaw's marriage
and John James Preston

1202
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:25,636
"it was canceled when
this article went to impression.

1203
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:27,778
"Bradshaw is...

1204
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,145
Is Bradshaw the something?

1205
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:35,429
Move away.

1206
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:40,989
"Bradshaw is still
unmarried woman and to live in New York."

1207
01:18:47,783 --> 01:18:50,008
<i > I didn't want to buy her, but, < /i>

1208
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:53,457
<i > it was like this less one Sails
in New York.</i>

1209
01:19:14,342 --> 01:19:15,999
Louise.

1210
01:19:18,298 --> 01:19:19,723
Credo!

1211
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:22,595
- Nor I recognized you.
- It is that the objectivo.

1212
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,795
My head is in the program
of protecção of witnesses.

1213
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,693
But I feel that is you well.

1214
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:29,919
And I feel this Channel in you.

1215
01:19:29,954 --> 01:19:32,098
It is mine until Tuesday.

1216
01:19:33,778 --> 01:19:35,721
- Certain, then?
- Take.

1217
01:19:35,756 --> 01:19:37,415
It is hour of returning to the world.

1218
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,830
Already?

1219
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:43,641
Your new number.
The code of the area is the 347...

1220
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:48,470
347?

1221
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:49,738
Oh not!

1222
01:19:49,773 --> 01:19:52,520
I am a 917,
I always went him.

1223
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:55,484
I tried,
no longer it is available.

1224
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,486
Now you are a 347.

1225
01:19:57,521 --> 01:19:58,896
Samantha Jones.

1226
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:00,719
<i > Carrie Bradshaw.</i>

1227
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,561
<i > at least, be.</i>

1228
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:03,922
He/she says things.

1229
01:20:04,288 --> 01:20:08,087
I am a 347 of area code.
How horrible that is?

1230
01:20:08,122 --> 01:20:10,307
347 are new New York.

1231
01:20:10,342 --> 01:20:12,925
I want old New York.
With my old one 917

1232
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,021
and my old will of living.
- Old New York, new New York.

1233
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:18,187
At least, it is New York.

1234
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:21,968
Another difficult thing on being
in Los Angeles

1235
01:20:22,003 --> 01:20:26,123
it is the thick of my neighbor on the side.
I don't get to stop looking for him.

1236
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:27,132
<i > Glance?</i>

1237
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:28,595
Only to look.

1238
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:32,049
After having seen the face of Steve
in dinner, it was never able to...

1239
01:20:33,366 --> 01:20:34,956
But you should see this.

1240
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:37,846
All of the nights, he/she makes sex
with a different partner.

1241
01:20:37,881 --> 01:20:39,090
He is...

1242
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:42,175
like me,
five years ago.

1243
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,189
<i > Because, < /i>

1244
01:20:43,224 --> 01:20:45,350
when I was a 917.

1245
01:20:45,385 --> 01:20:48,135
<i > Which is the interest in having one
bonzão to the side, < /i>

1246
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,834
<i > if you cannot have sex with him?</i>

1247
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:55,142
Concordámos that more nobody
excepto Smith, would be in the layer.

1248
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,802
I already tie you.

1249
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,283
Hello.

1250
01:21:33,019 --> 01:21:36,503
<i > AND in an effort to maintain
out of house and out of sarilhos, < /i>

1251
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:38,840
<i > Samantha went shopping.</i>

1252
01:21:41,704 --> 01:21:44,182
What such to save a cãozinho?

1253
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:53,562
She needs a home.
Interested?

1254
01:21:54,388 --> 01:21:55,803
No.

1255
01:21:56,243 --> 01:22:00,522
<i > While Samantha was convinced of
that a dog was not for her...</i>

1256
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,737
She was sterilized,
but it didn't lose the will.

1257
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:19,636
<i > AND like Samantha
she didn't get to "free", < /i>

1258
01:22:21,088 --> 01:22:23,046
<i > he/she bought things.</i>

1259
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,991
What happened if these
did they disappear how that for magic?

1260
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:40,205
I know where you live.

1261
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,612
For a pair like this,
he/she moved.

1262
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:45,237
Wait Carrie, that not.

1263
01:22:51,077 --> 01:22:53,437
Do you want that me free from him?

1264
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,028
No.

1265
01:22:57,327 --> 01:22:59,691
No, it is too beautiful.

1266
01:23:01,093 --> 01:23:02,621
Me...

1267
01:23:02,656 --> 01:23:04,553
I will only bury him.

1268
01:23:05,058 --> 01:23:08,008
Well in the bottom, as I did with
my feelings.

1269
01:23:09,104 --> 01:23:10,844
Do you feel his lack?

1270
01:23:10,879 --> 01:23:12,472
Everyday.

1271
01:23:14,016 --> 01:23:16,894
Do you know him/it what is strange?

1272
01:23:16,929 --> 01:23:19,309
I have not been regretting almost anything.

1273
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:21,084
Maybe...

1274
01:23:22,574 --> 01:23:25,773
Maybe only it is allowed us one
certain amount of tears

1275
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:28,436
for man
and I already spent mine.

1276
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:30,645
Yes, I know as you sit down.

1277
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,219
My boyfriend of Saint Louis
it put an end to me last year.

1278
01:23:34,808 --> 01:23:37,043
I miss constantly.

1279
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:39,288
<i > suddenly, he/she did shines.</i>

1280
01:23:39,323 --> 01:23:42,487
<i > there were two broken hearts
in my entrance hall.</i>

1281
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,130
Louise, we needed a drink.

1282
01:23:47,165 --> 01:23:48,923
He/she diffuses in the rented suitcase.

1283
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:52,237
He/she went so hard for me.

1284
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,941
Of course thought that Will...

1285
01:23:55,312 --> 01:23:57,131
It is his name.

1286
01:23:57,918 --> 01:23:59,946
He/she thought him
it was the love of my life.

1287
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:01,826
What did happen he/she?

1288
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:07,138
He said that he/she loved me and everything,
but it didn't think I was the such.

1289
01:24:07,849 --> 01:24:09,743
That hurt.

1290
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,105
But do you know that more?

1291
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,706
As you want.

1292
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:15,284
- I won't give up the love.
- Good.

1293
01:24:15,902 --> 01:24:18,292
Is the love that "thing", do you know?

1294
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:22,575
Do you see this?

1295
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,211
That is the love.

1296
01:24:24,246 --> 01:24:27,742
And I swallow him/it with me the whole day.

1297
01:24:28,879 --> 01:24:30,562
He/she gives me license.

1298
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,358
I remember that smile.
Who is he?

1299
01:24:39,393 --> 01:24:42,974
Somebody that I have just known.
He/she wants go drink a glass with me.

1300
01:24:43,009 --> 01:24:44,819
At 23:30 o'clock?

1301
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:47,272
- That is for the queca.
- It is not anything.

1302
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,800
He is used of table,
he/she left now.

1303
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:53,068
Louise, I cannot know how to type,

1304
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:56,444
but it trusts me.
The message subliminar of that

1305
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,197
it is queca!

1306
01:24:58,747 --> 01:25:02,369
But if he comes to have with me
no longer he/she wants anything to say, right?

1307
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:05,171
He/she is well.

1308
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:07,488
He/she amuses you.

1309
01:25:07,523 --> 01:25:09,977
It is for that that you/they serve the twenty.

1310
01:25:10,124 --> 01:25:12,538
To the thirty, you learn the lessons.

1311
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:15,703
To the forty, you pay the drinks.

1312
01:25:15,738 --> 01:25:17,578
In that case,

1313
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,456
I want one more.

1314
01:25:21,394 --> 01:25:23,440
Everything is in the secretary.

1315
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:26,696
If to find, the writing will appear.
And it is better than comes,

1316
01:25:26,731 --> 01:25:30,323
because I am to use the progress
of the new book to pay the decorator.

1317
01:25:32,309 --> 01:25:37,421
I find wonderful be to redecorate
the whole apartment.

1318
01:25:37,456 --> 01:25:38,187
Well,

1319
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:40,428
out with the old and...

1320
01:25:40,786 --> 01:25:43,181
come the expensive.

1321
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:50,567
Harry tied me and he said
that you didn't walk to run.

1322
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:52,636
Because he/she did him that?

1323
01:25:53,058 --> 01:25:56,118
Because he/she loves you and it is concerned.

1324
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:58,094
He/she doesn't have anything with that if
to worry.

1325
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:03,708
The doctor said that
it is not safe or like this?

1326
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:04,738
No.

1327
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,833
He/she said that like me already
run doesn't do badly.

1328
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:12,242
- Then, because no...
- Because I fear that something bad happens.

1329
01:26:12,277 --> 01:26:14,631
It is already a miracle to be pregnant.

1330
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:15,870
Right.

1331
01:26:17,362 --> 01:26:20,116
Everything has that always wanted.

1332
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:23,128
I am so happy that until I am afraid.

1333
01:26:23,163 --> 01:26:26,657
Nobody has everything that wants.
He/she looks at you.

1334
01:26:26,692 --> 01:26:28,817
He/she looks at Miranda.

1335
01:26:29,157 --> 01:26:31,575
They are such good people
and he/she sees what happened you.

1336
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,026
Of course something of bad
I will happen me.

1337
01:26:34,061 --> 01:26:35,210
Wanted,

1338
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:38,462
you defecated in the pants this year.

1339
01:26:38,497 --> 01:26:40,669
Maybe already you are dispatched.

1340
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:47,189
You run everyday.
It is that that you do.

1341
01:26:47,224 --> 01:26:50,755
You cannot stop being who are
for you be afraid.

1342
01:26:53,094 --> 01:26:54,564
Very well, then.

1343
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,759
Here we go us.

1344
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:11,399
<i > AND as well as the last leaf of Autumn it fell,
also the fear of Charlotte left.</i>

1345
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,176
<i > When the first snow fell, < /i>

1346
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:19,054
<i > Charlotte recovered the forces.</i>

1347
01:27:26,581 --> 01:27:29,449
Of certainty that you don't want that
answer the affirmatively none

1348
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:33,238
of these invitations for parties of the block?
- No. I am perfectly happy alone.

1349
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:34,245
Of certainty?

1350
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,456
- Because this seems to be good.
- He/she is going home.

1351
01:27:36,913 --> 01:27:38,897
Seriously. You will lose the airplane.
Go.

1352
01:27:39,345 --> 01:27:40,804
He/she is well.

1353
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:42,962
But first...

1354
01:27:46,252 --> 01:27:48,005
Merry Christmas.

1355
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:52,108
You didn't need.

1356
01:27:52,143 --> 01:27:54,108
It is a stupidity.

1357
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,177
<b > he/she FINDS ME IN SAINT LOUIS < /b>

1358
01:27:58,677 --> 01:28:00,809
Oh Louise, of Saint Louis!

1359
01:28:00,844 --> 01:28:02,972
You said that you had never seen.

1360
01:28:04,717 --> 01:28:07,056
Now I feel bad.

1361
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:10,031
If he/she knew that will change gifts...

1362
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:17,229
He/she had bought you one
two weeks ago behind

1363
01:28:17,264 --> 01:28:19,710
and he/she had her hidden here.

1364
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:26,088
That is not it that me leaning,
yes?

1365
01:28:26,123 --> 01:28:27,719
I don't know. Open.

1366
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:45,337
My own Louis Vuitton?!

1367
01:28:45,372 --> 01:28:48,426
Because it is.
Enough of alugueres.

1368
01:28:48,739 --> 01:28:51,692
He/she looks who returned of the big city.

1369
01:28:53,466 --> 01:28:57,116
<i > it was the best money
that some time I spent.</i>

1370
01:28:57,151 --> 01:28:58,814
<i > Previous day of new year.</i>

1371
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:00,930
<i > AND a mass packing.</i>

1372
01:29:09,858 --> 01:29:14,057
- Do you know him/it what will say at midnight?
- Happy new year.

1373
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:15,939
Yes.

1374
01:29:15,974 --> 01:29:19,080
Only that will say him/it
much more lively than that.

1375
01:29:19,115 --> 01:29:20,038
You will say:

1376
01:29:20,073 --> 01:29:22,822
"Happy new year!"

1377
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,323
- Happy new year!
- Yes!

1378
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:28,597
You say that and later you give a kiss.

1379
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,309
Right.

1380
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,164
- Ready to go, rapazão?
- Yes.

1381
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:44,354
You remembered to take Batman
what did Sandra give you?

1382
01:29:44,389 --> 01:29:46,302
I think is at the kitchen.

1383
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:48,352
You have to have new Batman!

1384
01:29:48,353 --> 01:29:51,116
Batman!
Where are you?

1385
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,935
Do you have plans with them?

1386
01:29:59,804 --> 01:30:02,848
All will stay home today.

1387
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:06,186
You want

1388
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:08,366
to come to eat connosco?

1389
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:12,218
We could go the some place that is
on your side of the bridge.

1390
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:14,820
No. Thank you.

1391
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:22,233
Miranda, I never had intentions
of hurting you.

1392
01:30:26,402 --> 01:30:28,614
I found him/it!

1393
01:30:29,436 --> 01:30:33,101
- Batman!
- There it is him. Batman.

1394
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,533
- He/she puts the cap.
- Yes.

1395
01:30:36,568 --> 01:30:38,363
He/she is to snow outside.

1396
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:41,851
- Here you have.
- I want to be like Batman.

1397
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:44,709
Happy new year.

1398
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:46,869
Happy new year.

1399
01:30:47,684 --> 01:30:49,457
Kiss!

1400
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:02,226
- Until tomorrow.
- Good-bye.

1401
01:31:05,091 --> 01:31:06,916
This is my new Batman.

1402
01:31:09,748 --> 01:31:11,779
<i > do you Know him/it what will do?</i>

1403
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:16,279
- We will play until at midnight!
- Father!

1404
01:31:53,164 --> 01:31:54,942
<b > LOVE < /b>

1405
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:25,684
Am I?

1406
01:32:25,719 --> 01:32:28,850
He/she thought that one of the purposes
of having a family

1407
01:32:28,885 --> 01:32:33,082
it was not to have to do the passage
of alone year with Chinese food.

1408
01:32:33,117 --> 01:32:36,432
I am alone with Chinese food.

1409
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,204
I was to sleep.

1410
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,563
Shit.
Excuse.

1411
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:42,464
No, everything well.

1412
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:44,494
Where is Brady?

1413
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:46,309
<i > it is the night of Steve.</i>

1414
01:32:47,413 --> 01:32:48,379
Because.

1415
01:32:48,414 --> 01:32:49,367
<i > you don't wake up, < /i>

1416
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:51,089
he/she sleeps again.
- No.

1417
01:32:51,562 --> 01:32:52,852
Everything well.

1418
01:32:53,138 --> 01:32:55,842
- Are you well?
- I am óptima.

1419
01:32:55,877 --> 01:32:57,826
I was all excited,

1420
01:32:57,861 --> 01:33:01,854
to see the year passage
alone, in television.

1421
01:33:01,889 --> 01:33:03,513
Do you want that goes there?

1422
01:33:03,548 --> 01:33:05,910
<i > To the drop?</i>

1423
01:33:05,911 --> 01:33:08,428
No, I can...
I can go of taxi.

1424
01:33:09,615 --> 01:33:11,190
In the new year?

1425
01:33:11,225 --> 01:33:13,421
Nor to think.
I am well.

1426
01:33:13,456 --> 01:33:16,265
Seriously.
He/she only wanted to speak a little bit.

1427
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,122
<i > he/she sleeps again.
Me, < /i>

1428
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:20,036
<i > I see you for the year.</i>

1429
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:22,244
- Good night.
- Good night.

1430
01:34:00,577 --> 01:34:02,007
That was good.

1431
01:34:21,396 --> 01:34:23,860
My God!
Fortunately you arrived.

1432
01:34:47,378 --> 01:34:49,278
Will arrived.

1433
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:00,248
Opá...

1434
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:02,553
You are not alone.

1435
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:06,893
<b > Happy new year < /b>

1436
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:09,802
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

1437
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,213
- He/she calms there, small.
- Are you well?

1438
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:00,014
Yes.

1439
01:37:00,605 --> 01:37:03,798
In Los Angeles I only go by car,
until I forgot of as if he/she walks.

1440
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,784
<i > All of the Springs,
the women from New York < /i>

1441
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:08,375
<i > they leave the superfluous choices
of their past back < /i>

1442
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:10,540
<i > and they desire for the future.</i>

1443
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,572
<i > That is known as:
The Week of the Fashion.</i>

1444
01:37:15,751 --> 01:37:17,045
Here we are.

1445
01:37:17,943 --> 01:37:19,588
Are we in the first line?

1446
01:37:19,623 --> 01:37:21,699
I had to pull some cordelinhos.

1447
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,733
- Very well.
- Go thank them.

1448
01:37:24,768 --> 01:37:27,222
Decide where we will eat lunch
while I make a phone call.

1449
01:37:27,257 --> 01:37:28,988
As in the old times.

1450
01:37:29,532 --> 01:37:32,222
It was in this that you passed
Saturdays

1451
01:37:32,257 --> 01:37:35,010
while I was with Brady
and with Steve in Aquarium?

1452
01:37:35,597 --> 01:37:37,129
Well,

1453
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,481
nor every Saturday.

1454
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,448
Only so that they know,

1455
01:37:41,483 --> 01:37:45,193
we always had rooms ahead
in the espectáculo of the dolphins.

1456
01:37:45,228 --> 01:37:48,747
Steve makes a funny imitation
of the dolphins. By chance,

1457
01:37:48,953 --> 01:37:52,195
it is more Steve as a dolphin.

1458
01:37:56,862 --> 01:37:59,243
Even you cannot forgive him?

1459
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:02,373
Are you some to suggest thing?

1460
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:05,773
I liked Steve,
I always liked.

1461
01:38:05,774 --> 01:38:09,708
He apologized hundreds of times,
he/she doesn't walk with more nobody.

1462
01:38:09,743 --> 01:38:13,251
- What will be I need?
- Do you also suggest that she forgives Big?

1463
01:38:13,286 --> 01:38:14,723
No!

1464
01:38:14,758 --> 01:38:17,439
He/she was capable to kill Big.

1465
01:38:17,951 --> 01:38:20,437
Sometimes when I run,

1466
01:38:20,472 --> 01:38:24,776
I imagine what would tell him/her
if it returned him to see.

1467
01:38:25,073 --> 01:38:28,415
I have the clue of perfect opening.

1468
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:30,295
Do they want to hear her?

1469
01:38:31,446 --> 01:38:32,903
Yes.

1470
01:38:34,271 --> 01:38:38,030
I curse the day in that you were born.

1471
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,491
Impressive.

1472
01:38:40,526 --> 01:38:43,145
It is better train a gesture with the hand
to accompany.

1473
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:58,221
<i > he/she didn't know if it was the fashion or the facto of
us the four be again committees.</i>

1474
01:38:58,326 --> 01:39:01,303
<i > But for the first time
there is already a long time, < /i>

1475
01:39:01,338 --> 01:39:03,346
<i > I felt me own.</i>

1476
01:39:33,698 --> 01:39:34,777
<B > THE COMPASSION IS THAT SHOULD BE IN THE FASHION
SKINS are CRIME < /b>

1477
01:39:34,812 --> 01:39:36,729
We will pick a taxi.

1478
01:39:36,764 --> 01:39:39,502
I always thought would owe...

1479
01:39:39,537 --> 01:39:41,361
Skins are crime!

1480
01:39:41,396 --> 01:39:44,865
Crime!
Crime!!!

1481
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,061
- Crime!
- Crime!

1482
01:39:47,096 --> 01:39:49,607
As I feel the lack of New York!

1483
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:57,068
<i > Two weeks later, I met the boyfriend of the
Santa Louise of Saint Louis, Will.</i>

1484
01:39:57,103 --> 01:40:01,009
<i > In Christmas, they noticed
of the all liked each other.</i>

1485
01:40:01,945 --> 01:40:05,807
<i > Same on time of the Day of the Lovers.</i>

1486
01:40:12,527 --> 01:40:15,776
<B > SAME ON TIME OF...</b>

1487
01:40:15,989 --> 01:40:20,030
<B > TO WANT YOU A HAPPY ONE

1488
01:40:21,175 --> 01:40:23,648
<B > FOR THE TIA CARRIE
WITH LOVE, OF LILLY < /b>

1489
01:40:27,186 --> 01:40:28,539
The telephone.

1490
01:40:30,818 --> 01:40:31,671
Am I?

1491
01:40:31,706 --> 01:40:35,820
I am only to call to certify me that
you are not yourself to hang in the shower.

1492
01:40:35,855 --> 01:40:37,703
You called one hour
I too much give in.

1493
01:40:37,738 --> 01:40:40,169
Which is the plan for
the Day of the Lovers?

1494
01:40:41,238 --> 01:40:43,692
Miranda and I will have dinner.

1495
01:40:43,727 --> 01:40:46,097
It is later, a violent one
terror film.

1496
01:40:46,132 --> 01:40:47,422
Perfect!

1497
01:40:47,457 --> 01:40:48,217
<i > AND you?</i>

1498
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:51,433
I am to do Sushi for Smith.
And this?

1499
01:40:52,464 --> 01:40:53,627
Do you make those things?

1500
01:40:53,662 --> 01:40:55,964
We took a course there are some times,

1501
01:40:55,999 --> 01:40:58,471
and when he enters for that door
at 19:30 o'clock,

1502
01:40:58,506 --> 01:41:04,913
I will surprise him, lying down nude
in the table, covered with home-made sushi.

1503
01:41:04,914 --> 01:41:06,318
Epá,

1504
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:08,451
you don't have even anything that to do.

1505
01:41:08,486 --> 01:41:10,494
<i > AND more innovations?</i>

1506
01:41:33,402 --> 01:41:36,981
Carrie, there is immense love
in this room.

1507
01:41:36,982 --> 01:41:40,331
I am alone me, or this year
are the steroids in the fashion?

1508
01:41:40,366 --> 01:41:44,340
No, not. It was already like this last year,
we are that played for the another equips.

1509
01:41:44,535 --> 01:41:45,910
Good night!

1510
01:41:45,945 --> 01:41:48,764
This is our menu of the day.
All of the specialties

1511
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:51,671
they are related romanticamente
with the theme and suitable for two.

1512
01:41:51,706 --> 01:41:52,737
Will they drink wine?

1513
01:41:52,772 --> 01:41:53,426
- Yes!
- Yes!

1514
01:41:53,461 --> 01:41:54,934
- Glass or bottle?
- Bottle.

1515
01:41:54,969 --> 01:41:58,477
I already go back to take yours
request and the one of his/her girlfriend.

1516
01:42:03,971 --> 01:42:06,378
Because you looked for it Sails her?

1517
01:42:06,413 --> 01:42:08,848
- Today, above all?
- Because

1518
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:11,264
I am an emotional suicide.

1519
01:42:11,299 --> 01:42:14,303
I deserved what had.
To run for all to New York,

1520
01:42:14,338 --> 01:42:17,247
having faith that would have my happy end.
"Do they see?

1521
01:42:17,282 --> 01:42:21,724
"The love always conquest everything!
Look at me and for my only dress,

1522
01:42:21,759 --> 01:42:24,496
"to get married with the love of my life."
- Do they want another bottle?

1523
01:42:24,531 --> 01:42:25,822
- Yes!
- Yes!

1524
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:31,091
Miranda, in that article,
I didn't say "Us" a single time.

1525
01:42:31,126 --> 01:42:35,763
No... the whole article was:
"I find" and "I want."

1526
01:42:35,798 --> 01:42:38,995
- It was your point of view.
- Exacto, my point of view.

1527
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:43,155
The whole marriage
it was of my point of view.

1528
01:42:43,728 --> 01:42:47,164
I left that the marriage went
more important than Big.

1529
01:42:49,065 --> 01:42:52,562
I am the reason for the which
he didn't leave the car.

1530
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:55,694
Right.

1531
01:42:56,293 --> 01:42:59,555
I said a thing to Big...

1532
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:03,324
that should not have statement,
in the rehearsal dinner.

1533
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:05,108
How like this?

1534
01:43:06,428 --> 01:43:09,438
After Steve to appear,
I was very disturbed

1535
01:43:09,473 --> 01:43:11,699
and I came across Big.

1536
01:43:11,734 --> 01:43:12,671
And...

1537
01:43:14,538 --> 01:43:17,161
he/she said that you two
they were crazy in marrying.

1538
01:43:17,196 --> 01:43:19,727
Here it is her.

1539
01:43:29,322 --> 01:43:31,588
Óptimo. Thank you very much.

1540
01:43:36,321 --> 01:43:37,822
Excuse.

1541
01:43:37,857 --> 01:43:39,828
It was disturbed.

1542
01:43:39,863 --> 01:43:42,423
- Steve...
- I have been walking to review this

1543
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:45,574
in my head,
five months ago.

1544
01:43:46,287 --> 01:43:49,947
And for five months
did you keep a secret of those?

1545
01:43:49,982 --> 01:43:52,913
- Once I tried to tell you, but...
- Once?

1546
01:43:52,948 --> 01:43:55,808
Did you try to tell me once?

1547
01:43:55,843 --> 01:43:59,908
- You should have tried everyday!
- I know.

1548
01:44:00,217 --> 01:44:02,878
- He/she was awaiting the right moment.
- There is no moment certain

1549
01:44:02,913 --> 01:44:04,726
for you count that ruined me
the marriage.

1550
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:07,636
He/she happened!
He/she was not to think!

1551
01:44:09,304 --> 01:44:12,641
- Carrie, please, you don't go!
- Do you know him/it what think hurts more?

1552
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,551
He/she went have kept the secret of me.

1553
01:44:16,586 --> 01:44:19,267
Me never, never,

1554
01:44:19,302 --> 01:44:21,655
I kept the secret of you.
Never!

1555
01:44:25,052 --> 01:44:26,049
No, I lie.

1556
01:44:26,084 --> 01:44:31,497
In the last five months, I have think
it was an enormous mistake have left Steve.

1557
01:44:31,856 --> 01:44:33,723
Ready.

1558
01:44:34,091 --> 01:44:36,290
How do you sit down?

1559
01:44:36,325 --> 01:44:37,626
With license.

1560
01:44:42,453 --> 01:44:44,039
With license.

1561
01:44:59,114 --> 01:45:01,622
At any moment.

1562
01:45:11,064 --> 01:45:13,751

1563

We are delayed, I will arrive late.</i>

1565
01:45:20,072 --> 01:45:22,558
<i > Excuse.
Good-bye.</i>

1566
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:33,722

1569
01:45:44,898 --> 01:45:47,240
That is a treta.

1570
01:46:18,019 --> 01:46:22,236
<i > it was one night as soon as Samantha
he/she had planeado.</i>

1571
01:46:22,726 --> 01:46:24,757
<i > Removing the Sushi.</i>

1572
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:28,700
<i > AND the other woman.</i>

1573
01:46:38,894 --> 01:46:40,575
Hello!

1574
01:46:41,957 --> 01:46:44,251
- It was a long day.
- You are 3 hours delayed.

1575
01:46:44,286 --> 01:46:45,349
I know.

1576
01:46:45,384 --> 01:46:47,499
- Did you already eat?
- I already ate, yes.

1577
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:50,833
I ate the home-made Sushi
that I did for you.

1578
01:46:50,868 --> 01:46:56,178
The Sushi that I spread for my nude body,
as surprise of the Day of the Lovers.

1579
01:46:56,213 --> 01:46:57,993
Because you are so annoyed?

1580
01:46:58,028 --> 01:46:59,028
I called.

1581
01:46:59,063 --> 01:47:04,338
He/she could not answer the telephone.
He/she had the body covered with Sushi.

1582
01:47:04,373 --> 01:47:07,961
He/she had Wasabi in ranches where
she should not put Wasabi.

1583
01:47:09,082 --> 01:47:13,342
You find to have killed me well
all the day in the kitchen,

1584
01:47:13,377 --> 01:47:16,134
to get ready a beautiful meal?

1585
01:47:16,788 --> 01:47:19,288
You made some Sushi.

1586
01:47:19,408 --> 01:47:21,516
- It is not anything of special.
- Anything of special?

1587
01:47:21,551 --> 01:47:22,479
Take.

1588
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,996
I am not the woman type that passes
the day home awaiting a man!

1589
01:47:28,472 --> 01:47:32,676
He/she enjoys your Californian roll
home-made!

1590
01:47:35,432 --> 01:47:38,716
Happy shit in the daytime of the Lovers!

1591
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,005
<i > it is Carrie, leave message.</i>

1592
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,710
<i > Carrie, am me.
He/she assists, please.</i>

1593
01:47:51,745 --> 01:47:56,799
<i > Three days of excuse phone calls,
e-mails, flowers, < /i>

1594
01:47:56,834 --> 01:47:58,713
<i > and I was not still ready.</i>

1595
01:47:58,748 --> 01:48:01,956
<i > it was the time in that passámos
more time without we speak to each other.</i>

1596
01:48:08,856 --> 01:48:10,458
Carrie!

1597
01:48:10,766 --> 01:48:12,342
Hello.

1598
01:48:13,005 --> 01:48:14,694
I need to speak with you.

1599
01:48:14,729 --> 01:48:17,214
Is there how long you are here to the wait?

1600
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:21,067
There are 17 dollars of duration.

1601
01:48:22,462 --> 01:48:25,234
He/she enters, please, has just marked 18.

1602
01:48:38,486 --> 01:48:41,225
This like this without speaking it is eccentric.

1603
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:43,494
I am disturbed.

1604
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,358
I understand, Carrie,
but it simply happened.

1605
01:48:47,393 --> 01:48:50,255
He/she never wanted to hurt you.

1606
01:48:53,429 --> 01:48:55,947
You have to forgive me.

1607
01:48:57,266 --> 01:48:58,673
Do you know that more?

1608
01:48:58,708 --> 01:48:59,786
- What was?
- No.

1609
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:02,090
No, he/she says what will say.

1610
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:05,065
You implore for he/she forgives you
in three days

1611
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:09,607
and nor you consider to forgive Steve
for something that he did six months ago.

1612
01:49:09,642 --> 01:49:12,021
It is not the same thing.

1613
01:49:12,056 --> 01:49:14,520
It is to forgive.

1614
01:49:18,557 --> 01:49:22,264
I don't know if I can trust
in as it doesn't happen again.

1615
01:49:23,022 --> 01:49:25,538
Steve, today is very quiet.

1616
01:49:26,512 --> 01:49:28,402
Miranda, I know

1617
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:30,372
that I did with that was difficult
you trust me.

1618
01:49:30,407 --> 01:49:31,962
But,

1619
01:49:33,999 --> 01:49:36,021
you did with that went
difficult to trust you.

1620
01:49:36,056 --> 01:49:39,079
- Me?
- The form as you treated me?

1621
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:42,010
And do you cut me of your life of that sorts things out?
Yes!

1622
01:49:42,045 --> 01:49:43,676
I broke a vote!

1623
01:49:43,711 --> 01:49:46,716
Then and the remaining ones?

1624
01:49:46,751 --> 01:49:51,109
How to promise to love somebody
for the best and for the worst.

1625
01:49:51,144 --> 01:49:53,320
Then and that?

1626
01:49:53,355 --> 01:49:56,821
As I know that she won't punish me
to the rest of the life?

1627
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:58,154
Don't know.

1628
01:49:58,189 --> 01:50:03,504
And she is not sure that you
he/she won't have other "indiscreetness."

1629
01:50:05,845 --> 01:50:09,351
The one that you/they know is that you/they want
to proceed in front.

1630
01:50:09,426 --> 01:50:13,985
And that the love that you/they seat one for the
another doesn't allow that to happen.

1631
01:50:16,731 --> 01:50:20,036
And it is that that we will discover here.

1632
01:50:25,614 --> 01:50:26,807
Then,

1633
01:50:26,842 --> 01:50:30,686
we made the last session and not
we can speak to each other for 2 weeks,

1634
01:50:30,721 --> 01:50:35,174
while we decided if we are together
again it is something that we do want.

1635
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:36,464
It is later,

1636
01:50:36,499 --> 01:50:38,993
we have to choose a ranch for
we find ourselves.

1637
01:50:39,028 --> 01:50:42,935
If both of us appear on that day,
the past will stop existing.

1638
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,866
As if the facto of we appear there
it was the promise of both

1639
01:50:45,901 --> 01:50:50,686
that are willing the
everything to forget and to proceed in front.

1640
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:54,357
- Are you willing to do that?
- I don't know.

1641
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:55,994
I don't know.

1642
01:50:56,135 --> 01:50:58,091
I have a lot in that to think.

1643
01:50:58,126 --> 01:50:59,273
To think?

1644
01:50:59,308 --> 01:51:01,615
- Or to feel?
- How like this?

1645
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:03,340
Well, Miranda,

1646
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:06,195
you are a lawyer.
You can struggle on both sides.

1647
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:06,995
But,

1648
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:10,118
because it is that that
what did feel it is not logical?

1649
01:51:10,153 --> 01:51:11,736
It is emotional.

1650
01:51:11,771 --> 01:51:16,328
Therefore, I lament Harvard.
You will have to base that decision

1651
01:51:16,363 --> 01:51:19,236
in your emotions.
- Then I am sanded.

1652
01:51:19,728 --> 01:51:21,882
- I don't know what feel.
- You will know.

1653
01:51:21,917 --> 01:51:25,002
He/she will come the moment in that you will know.
And if it goes "yes",

1654
01:51:25,037 --> 01:51:28,827
then that whole logical diamond
he/she is going border out with the past.

1655
01:51:30,222 --> 01:51:33,241
And me that he/she thought that the challenge would be
to choose the ranch for us to find ourselves.

1656
01:51:33,276 --> 01:51:34,730
Where will it be?

1657
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:37,320
In the bridge of Brooklyn.

1658
01:51:37,355 --> 01:51:39,819
He/she is halfway
of our houses.

1659
01:51:39,854 --> 01:51:40,920
Very logical,

1660
01:51:40,955 --> 01:51:42,202
and nevertheless poetic.

1661
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,632
Poetic if both of us appear.

1662
01:51:44,667 --> 01:51:46,537
In another way,
you are in a bridge,

1663
01:51:46,572 --> 01:51:48,081
rejected...

1664
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,635
A good plan is not?

1665
01:51:58,521 --> 01:52:00,622
I have two good news.

1666
01:52:00,657 --> 01:52:02,891
- And I have two coffees.
- Thank you.

1667
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:03,938
Here it is.

1668
01:52:03,973 --> 01:52:04,999
What does happen he/she?

1669
01:52:05,034 --> 01:52:06,843
I had news of your real estate one.

1670
01:52:06,878 --> 01:52:09,027
The apartment of the 5th Avenue
it was sold finally.

1671
01:52:09,062 --> 01:52:12,723
You have 60 days before the new owner
to take ownership

1672
01:52:12,758 --> 01:52:14,778
and you are out of there.

1673
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:18,088
And which is the other news?

1674
01:52:22,126 --> 01:52:24,048
I will go back to Saint Louis

1675
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:26,370
and we will get married in the Autumn.

1676
01:52:26,405 --> 01:52:28,178
My God!

1677
01:52:28,213 --> 01:52:30,967
He/she waits there, I have to see that.

1678
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:32,645
It is beautiful.

1679
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,089
And do you know that more?

1680
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:36,042
He didn't rent him/it.

1681
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:38,219
<B > ADVANTAGES - OBSTACLES

He/she kisses me.

<i > However, in "Saint" of Angeles...</i>

1692

1695
01:54:01,214 --> 01:54:03,147
Wanted, turn!

1696
01:54:03,435 --> 01:54:05,713
It is not our house!

1697
01:54:06,055 --> 01:54:08,059
Where do you go?

1698
01:54:46,498 --> 01:54:47,990
Lament.

1699
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:52,066
I am his/her neighbor on the side and
my dog fled for his/her piça...

01:54:52,067 --> 01:54:53,646
Terrace!

1701
01:54:55,542 --> 01:54:58,717
<i > suddenly, it was not secret
him/her needed what.</i>

1702
01:54:58,752 --> 01:55:00,465
Does he/she want to join me?

1703
01:55:11,722 --> 01:55:13,005
I am Dante.

1704
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,503
It returns when you want.

1705
01:55:18,385 --> 01:55:20,564
<i > it was the drop of water.</i>

1706
01:55:20,599 --> 01:55:22,667
<i > Since the moment
that he/she met Dante, < /i>

1707
01:55:22,702 --> 01:55:26,033
<i > Samantha
he/she was at a hell.</i>

1708
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:31,401
<i > AND for the Spring,
he/she was already as the old me, < /i>

1709
01:55:31,436 --> 01:55:35,097
<i > in my new apartment,
same on time of the party of the bebé.</i>

1710
01:55:35,643 --> 01:55:37,673
He/she gives me license, wanted.

1711
01:55:38,251 --> 01:55:39,562
- Hello.
- Hello.

1712
01:55:39,706 --> 01:55:42,137
They placed a glass without base
in your new secretary.

1713
01:55:42,572 --> 01:55:44,622
He/she told him/her that if he/she made him/it again
it broke him/her the arm.

1714
01:55:44,657 --> 01:55:45,985
- Thank you.
- Are we going to the bath house?

1715
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,933
Yes.
Hello, as it goes?

1716
01:55:47,968 --> 01:55:50,160
- Well, thank you.
- Fortunately.

1717
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:53,532
Where is Samantha?
Her airplane covered with earth two hours ago.

1718
01:55:53,567 --> 01:55:55,352
You know how it is,
he/she should be to workout.

1719
01:55:55,387 --> 01:55:57,846
- Take.
- There is no place as the home!

1720
01:55:57,881 --> 01:55:59,635
Wanted!

1721
01:56:01,969 --> 01:56:03,734
You have a rat in the suitcase.

1722
01:56:03,769 --> 01:56:05,685
- It is better than is workout.
- Can I remove him/her the coat?

1723
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,060
Clear.

1724
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:09,162
Linda suitcase.

1725
01:56:10,311 --> 01:56:12,007
Oh my God!
Samantha!

1726
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,957
You have a dog!

1727
01:56:16,348 --> 01:56:19,656
Some time you thought to see this day
to arrive? Me with a dog?

1728
01:56:19,691 --> 01:56:22,422
My God!
So that it is that belly?

1729
01:56:23,501 --> 01:56:26,166
She walks to eat some thing.

1730
01:56:26,201 --> 01:56:28,483
- Enter!
- Hello!

1731
01:56:28,518 --> 01:56:30,510
We were to your wait.

1732
01:56:34,023 --> 01:56:35,366
I eat

1733
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:37,332
for not betraying.

1734
01:56:37,367 --> 01:56:39,454
What do walk exactamente to eat?

1735
01:56:39,489 --> 01:56:42,103
Everything, excepto the piça of Dante.

1736
01:56:42,138 --> 01:56:45,396
He/she looks at the language, please.
This now is a house of adults.

1737
01:56:45,802 --> 01:56:48,791
I think I didn't give bill of the fat
that I am, until seeing in your faces.

1738
01:56:48,826 --> 01:56:49,803
As,

1739
01:56:49,838 --> 01:56:52,704
and I say this with love,
as it is that

1740
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:54,646
not of this bill?

1741
01:56:54,681 --> 01:56:57,903
- I have been avoiding mirrors.
- I am proud for you betray not.

1742
01:56:57,938 --> 01:57:00,408
I don't think so there is anything
of what to be proud.

1743
01:57:00,443 --> 01:57:04,771
I stuff myself for not doing something
that I think natural.

1744
01:57:04,806 --> 01:57:08,951
This is not on the weight.
You are beautiful in any size.

1745
01:57:08,986 --> 01:57:11,005
But are you happy?

1746
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,398
Well...

1747
01:57:14,217 --> 01:57:18,338
The relationships not always they are
about the happiness.

1748
01:57:18,373 --> 01:57:19,718
Right?

1749
01:57:19,753 --> 01:57:23,049
With that frequency sits down
happy in your relationship?

1750
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:25,028
I am the sure that is with you.

1751
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:27,763
Everyday.

1752
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:30,064
Do you feel happy everyday?

1753
01:57:30,099 --> 01:57:32,853
Not during all the day,
but,

1754
01:57:32,888 --> 01:57:34,394
everyday.

1755
01:57:34,395 --> 01:57:37,146
When it was the last time
what did feel happy?

1756
01:57:37,181 --> 01:57:39,119
Six months ago.

1757
01:57:39,154 --> 01:57:42,198
I think is normal for Los Angeles.

1758
01:57:42,587 --> 01:57:43,916
What will make?

1759
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:45,863
What tells you
your bowels?

1760
01:57:48,561 --> 01:57:50,314
I know, but,

1761
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:53,589
Smith was with me
aquando of the chemotherapy.

1762
01:57:54,294 --> 01:57:57,142
If he was with me during that,
then

1763
01:57:57,177 --> 01:58:01,066
I have to be capable to be
in this relationship for him.

1764
01:58:01,101 --> 01:58:01,776
Wanted,

1765
01:58:01,811 --> 01:58:04,815
have just compared your relationship
with the chemotherapy.

1766
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:07,421
<i > There we were us.
The three "mirrors" < /i>

1767
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:09,749
<i > that Samantha no
he/she got to avoid. </i>

1768
01:58:09,784 --> 01:58:11,261
And Samantha,

1769
01:58:12,033 --> 01:58:15,279
that cushion cost
300 dollars.

1770
01:58:24,544 --> 01:58:26,086
Hello!

1771
01:58:26,793 --> 01:58:29,029
Hello, his/her monster!

1772
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:33,613
You are home.

1773
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:35,590
Won't you be one week?

1774
01:58:35,625 --> 01:58:37,706
We needed to speak.

1775
01:58:38,629 --> 01:58:40,527
Oh shovel!

1776
01:58:42,675 --> 01:58:45,075
- He/she knew that this was to come.
- Because...

1777
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:47,650
This is not to work.

1778
01:58:47,685 --> 01:58:49,396
I made the best than he/she knew,

1779
01:58:49,431 --> 01:58:52,233
I gave him/her 5 years and 7 kg.

1780
01:58:52,268 --> 01:58:53,357
Then,

1781
01:58:55,923 --> 01:58:57,786
no longer you love me?

1782
01:58:57,821 --> 01:58:59,901
I love you, yes.

1783
01:59:00,415 --> 01:59:01,893
It is alone that...

1784
01:59:03,905 --> 01:59:07,201
I will say something that should not say.

1785
01:59:08,206 --> 01:59:11,530
I love you,
but I love myself more to me. And,

1786
01:59:11,565 --> 01:59:17,381
I have a relationship with me own there are 49
years and it is in that that I have ponder.

1787
01:59:19,042 --> 01:59:23,572
You will find a wonderful woman
that he/she adores to be in a relationship.

1788
01:59:26,867 --> 01:59:29,367
And will you find the something?

1789
01:59:29,473 --> 01:59:31,196
I don't know.

1790
01:59:31,758 --> 01:59:34,727
But it is a risk that I am
disposed to run.

1791
01:59:39,072 --> 01:59:39,990
No.

1792
01:59:40,025 --> 01:59:41,828
He/she is with him.

1793
01:59:41,863 --> 01:59:43,726
He/she is well.

1794
01:59:46,676 --> 01:59:49,150
Every time that to look for him

1795
01:59:52,564 --> 01:59:54,882
I will think about you.

1796
01:59:57,405 --> 02:00:00,069
<i > Some love histories
they are not epic romances.</i>

1797
02:00:00,104 --> 02:00:01,540
<i > Some are short stories.</i>

1798
02:00:01,575 --> 02:00:05,029
<i > what doesn't turn them
less romantic.</i>

1799
02:00:06,183 --> 02:00:12,075
<i > we Asked for the all the passengers
that fasten the seatbelts for us to cover with earth.</i>

1800
02:00:12,909 --> 02:00:15,644
We will cover with earth in New York.

1801
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:18,729
Now I have to take that.

1802
02:00:26,568 --> 02:00:30,961
<i > While somebody returned to my life,
other somebody left.</i>

1803
02:00:30,996 --> 02:00:33,164
Stamps and labels.

1804
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:36,996
And I put all your mail
for opening in these envelopes.

1805
02:00:37,031 --> 02:00:38,489
Right.

1806
02:00:42,548 --> 02:00:44,773
It is please, please,

1807
02:00:44,808 --> 02:00:49,157
don't destroy Carrie Bradshaw's site.
- He/she is well.

1808
02:00:49,792 --> 02:00:52,203
It is my masterpiece.

1809
02:00:52,535 --> 02:00:54,372
What will make without you?

1810
02:00:54,407 --> 02:00:56,345
You arrange other.

1811
02:00:56,642 --> 02:00:59,282
But she won't have my style.

1812
02:00:59,629 --> 02:01:01,726
Santa Louise,

1813
02:01:03,448 --> 02:01:05,557
you brought me of turn to the life.

1814
02:01:05,592 --> 02:01:07,375
And you gave me

1815
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:10,092
"Louise Vuitton."

1816
02:01:15,383 --> 02:01:17,090
Now seriously,

1817
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:19,158
you have to stop crying.

1818
02:01:20,077 --> 02:01:21,485
Your keys.

Thank you.

1820
02:01:22,549 --> 02:01:24,095
He/she waits, wait.

1821
02:01:24,695 --> 02:01:26,295
Don't forget about your love.

1822
02:01:26,469 --> 02:01:27,719
No.

1823
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,820
I found my love.

1824
02:01:30,201 --> 02:01:32,456
I leave that with you.

1825
02:01:33,171 --> 02:01:35,390
I see you in my marriage.

1826
02:01:35,425 --> 02:01:37,982

1827
02:01:41,209 --> 02:01:42,667
Good-bye.

1832
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:13,188
Hello.

1833
02:02:13,223 --> 02:02:15,108
Can I bring him/her something to drink?

1834
02:02:15,143 --> 02:02:16,312
- No.
- No?

1835
02:02:16,347 --> 02:02:18,319
No. I cannot be.

1836
02:02:19,767 --> 02:02:21,334
Help me to divert her.

1837
02:02:25,132 --> 02:02:26,258
Charlotte!

1838
02:02:27,604 --> 02:02:29,166
Charlotte, wait.

1839
02:02:29,201 --> 02:02:30,136
Charlotte.

1840
02:02:30,171 --> 02:02:32,708
Charlotte, don't run,
you are pregnant.

1841
02:02:32,743 --> 02:02:34,896
I don't want to see you!

1842
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:36,947
I am furious with you!

1843
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:39,026
I was always on your side!

1844
02:02:39,061 --> 02:02:42,620
Is it later do that to Carrie?
No! No!

1845
02:02:43,313 --> 02:02:45,291
I won't cry!

1846
02:02:45,326 --> 02:02:47,501
I won't waste tears with you.

1847
02:02:48,037 --> 02:02:51,266
I curse the day in that you were born!

1848
02:02:54,906 --> 02:02:57,371
I think burst me the waters.
Oh my God.

1849
02:02:57,667 --> 02:02:59,361
Taxi!

1850
02:02:59,396 --> 02:03:01,885
- My car is really here...
- I don't enter in your car!

1851
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,893
- Taxi!
- Charlotte, do I take you to the hospital, yes?

1852
02:03:04,928 --> 02:03:06,061
Please?

1853
02:03:06,668 --> 02:03:09,523
- Do you leave me there?
- He/she is well. He/she ties the car.

1854
02:03:19,301 --> 02:03:20,570
Hello.

1855
02:03:20,605 --> 02:03:23,373
Congratulations.
A girl!

1856
02:03:24,226 --> 02:03:27,653
It is my fate, to be surrounded
for beautiful women.

1857
02:03:27,688 --> 02:03:29,580
- He/she walks here.
- He/she is well.

1858
02:03:30,367 --> 02:03:31,518
Hello.

1859
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:37,862
- She is beautiful.
- He/she says hello to Rose.

1860
02:03:37,897 --> 02:03:39,068
Rose!

1861
02:03:39,103 --> 02:03:40,887
That beautiful name.

1862
02:03:40,922 --> 02:03:42,985
It is in Harry's grandmother's honor.

1863
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,840
I already have a Lilly (= Lily)
and a Rose (= Pink)

1864
02:03:48,656 --> 02:03:50,228
I have to say

1865
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:56,265
that you are two óptimos customers.
They make the bebés without that drama:

1866
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,923
"I am in labor!"

1867
02:03:57,958 --> 02:04:00,015
There was immense drama.

1868
02:04:01,264 --> 02:04:04,738
They burst me the waters while
he/she was in front of a restaurant.

1869
02:04:05,108 --> 02:04:08,232
- Very dramatic.
- He/she hopes she still didn't end.

1870
02:04:08,716 --> 02:04:11,104
They broke out while he/she spoke
with Big.

1871
02:04:11,139 --> 02:04:11,984
The something?

1872
02:04:12,019 --> 02:04:12,993
Do you see?

1873
02:04:13,028 --> 02:04:14,285
Drama.

1874
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,525
I found him/it and I was so disturbed
that if they burst me the waters.

1875
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:19,609
He brought her/it to the hospital.

1876
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:21,914
It was until the bebé to be born.

1877
02:04:23,017 --> 02:04:25,824
I think he wanted to meet.

1878
02:04:28,387 --> 02:04:30,808
Today it is not on him.

1879
02:04:30,843 --> 02:04:33,335
It is on the beautiful bebé Rose.

1880
02:04:33,786 --> 02:04:37,281
We know that she has the hair of Charlotte.
What more we know?

1881
02:04:40,132 --> 02:04:41,543
It is a doll.

1882
02:04:41,578 --> 02:04:43,753
- Happinesses.
- Thank you.

1883
02:04:45,113 --> 02:04:46,318
Good-bye.

1884
02:04:46,802 --> 02:04:50,142
He asked me that he/she asked you
that tied him/her.

1885
02:04:50,921 --> 02:04:52,586
I know that I don't have to do anything with that.

1886
02:04:52,621 --> 02:04:56,440
But I felt bad for him be
in the hospital to your wait.

1887
02:04:56,475 --> 02:05:00,643
I swear you. Whenever he heard somebody
of jumps, it stopped him/her the heart.

1888
02:05:03,032 --> 02:05:04,583
Harry, is...

1889
02:05:04,931 --> 02:05:07,684
It is much more complicated
of what you imagine.

1890
02:05:07,719 --> 02:05:08,633
I know that is.

1891
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:11,883
And you are entitled the of never
plus to tie him/her, but me...

1892
02:05:11,918 --> 02:05:13,780
Today I am for love.

1893
02:05:13,815 --> 02:05:15,900
And I feel bad for him.

1894
02:05:15,935 --> 02:05:19,320
He said that he/she writes you,
but that you never answered.

1895
02:05:20,592 --> 02:05:22,320
No, he never wrote me.

1896
02:05:22,355 --> 02:05:24,256
He said that he/she wrote because
he/she didn't have your telephone.

1897
02:05:24,291 --> 02:05:25,241
No.

1898
02:05:26,331 --> 02:05:28,444
No, he/she never wrote me.

1899
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:29,480
Never.

1900
02:05:29,515 --> 02:05:32,512
Then, because he would say that did him/it?

1901
02:06:12,842 --> 02:06:15,646
<i > Two hours,
two arquivadores < /i>

<i > he/she Had statement to Louise to put

1906
02:06:28,676 --> 02:06:30,140

1908

<i > he/she Speaks to Louise, leave message.</i>

1909
02:06:41,925 --> 02:06:47,262
Louise, I am me.
Can you give me the password of your ficheiro?

1910
02:06:48,989 --> 02:06:51,288
He/she ties me, thank you.

1911
02:06:54,213 --> 02:06:55,717
Shit.

1912
02:07:07,061 --> 02:07:09,777
<B > THE... M... The... R < /b>

1913
02:07:12,341 --> 02:07:14,875
<i > As soon as I inserted "Love", < /i>

1914
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,496

1915
02:07:21,353 --> 02:07:23,853

<B > I KNOW THAT I DID BLURRY

1924
02:07:49,036 --> 02:07:52,134

1925
02:08:00,992 --> 02:08:03,691
<i > he/she Wanted to tie him/her, but our love, < /i>

<i > Carrie and Big,
volumes a, two three, < /i>

1927
02:08:07,537 --> 02:08:09,586
<i > they impeded me.</i>

1928
02:08:14,704 --> 02:08:16,878
- Am I?
- I didn't hear the telephone.

1929
02:08:16,913 --> 02:08:19,098
We came to buy my wedding dress.

1930
02:08:19,133 --> 02:08:21,834
That neckline makes you the big mamocas!

1931
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:24,041
Mother, do you care?
It is a work call.

1932
02:08:24,672 --> 02:08:25,701
<i > Everything well, < /i>

1933
02:08:25,736 --> 02:08:26,985
I discovered which was.

1934
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,116
I will call,
in any way.

1935
02:08:30,042 --> 02:08:33,255
Today it is the last day for the apartment
of the 5th Avenue. You have to the 18:00

1936
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:36,958
before they change the locks.
- No, I don't need to go there.

1937
02:08:36,993 --> 02:08:39,267
Don't you want those shoes?

1938
02:08:39,546 --> 02:08:41,494
God, I forgot completely.

1939
02:08:41,529 --> 02:08:45,123
Because if you don't want,
send-millstones that I press my foot.

1940
02:08:45,158 --> 02:08:47,516
But they are already 17:00.

1941
02:08:47,551 --> 02:08:49,682
The something?
They were never used.

1942
02:08:49,717 --> 02:08:51,343
Shoes of 400 dollars.

1943
02:08:51,378 --> 02:08:53,084
By chance, they were 525.

1944
02:08:53,119 --> 02:08:54,482
Yes. Everything well.

1945
02:08:54,517 --> 02:08:56,112
Thank you, good-bye.

1946
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:58,414
Taxi!!!

1947
02:09:08,327 --> 02:09:11,767
<i > THE light in our apartment pré-war < /i>

1948
02:09:12,088 --> 02:09:15,234
<i > it was completely different
in the postwar period.</i>

1949
02:09:36,197 --> 02:09:38,408
He/she will order give-tos.

1950
02:09:38,443 --> 02:09:41,289
He/she didn't want that if they wasted
entirely.

1951
02:09:41,324 --> 02:09:43,377
<i > it was not the logic.</i>

1952
02:09:43,412 --> 02:09:45,283
<i > it was the love.</i>

1953
02:10:06,528 --> 02:10:08,796
Because it is that we decided to marry?

1954
02:10:11,706 --> 02:10:13,203
I find

1955
02:10:13,635 --> 02:10:17,300
that feared that meant
something if we didn't make him/it.

1956
02:10:21,367 --> 02:10:24,245
Excuse to have made you that.

1957
02:10:25,133 --> 02:10:27,957
Excuse to have made you that.

1958
02:10:31,777 --> 02:10:34,083
Which do know the funny part is?

1959
02:10:35,943 --> 02:10:38,401
Is there a funny part?

1960
02:10:38,436 --> 02:10:42,943
We perfectly went happy before
we decide to live happily forever.

1961
02:10:43,215 --> 02:10:45,815
I think the fools are us.

1962
02:10:54,184 --> 02:10:56,489
It is a beautiful wardrobe.

1963
02:10:56,524 --> 02:10:58,325
Thank you.

1964
02:11:01,357 --> 02:11:03,614
It is comfortable.

1965
02:11:04,019 --> 02:11:07,200
It was this that you had in mind when
did you put the alcatifa?

1966
02:11:08,425 --> 02:11:11,236
He/she liked to have thought about that.

1967
02:11:18,902 --> 02:11:22,696
It is better leave before the
new owner picks us.

1968
02:11:31,836 --> 02:11:35,839
And the form as we decided to get married.

1969
02:11:35,874 --> 02:11:39,374
Only work, without romance.

1970
02:11:42,648 --> 02:11:47,648
It is not manageable of
to intend to somebody.

1971
02:11:49,254 --> 02:11:51,088
It is like this that is.

1972
02:11:54,772 --> 02:11:56,717
Carrie Bradshaw,

1973
02:11:57,359 --> 02:11:59,953
love of my life,

1974
02:12:01,864 --> 02:12:03,944
do you want to marry with me?

1975
02:12:08,738 --> 02:12:11,273
It is for this that there is always a diamond.

1976
02:12:11,308 --> 02:12:14,501
You have to do something
that he/she closes the business.

1977
02:12:38,266 --> 02:12:39,523
... forgetting that everything...

1978
02:12:39,558 --> 02:12:40,457
<i > AND in the end, < /i>

1979
02:12:40,492 --> 02:12:43,691
<i > Carrie Bradshaw married with
John James Preston, < /i>

1980
02:12:43,726 --> 02:12:45,598
<i > in an a dress without mark.
- I accept.</i>

1981
02:12:45,633 --> 02:12:48,548
For the power in me invested by the
state of New York,

1982
02:12:48,583 --> 02:12:51,490
I pronounce you husband and woman.

1983
02:12:51,525 --> 02:12:53,621
He/she can kiss the bride.

1984
02:13:03,621 --> 02:13:08,087
Forever your
Forever mine. Forever ours.

1985
02:13:11,632 --> 02:13:14,321
Everything well in terms
been alone us?

1986
02:13:14,356 --> 02:13:15,694
Perfect.

1987
02:13:15,729 --> 02:13:17,112
You and me.

1988
02:13:17,147 --> 02:13:18,641
As I said.

1989
02:13:18,642 --> 02:13:21,732
But it had been more pleasant
if the small ones here were.

1990
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:25,524
It was for that that I tied them.

1991
02:13:30,692 --> 02:13:33,152
- Happinesses!
- Happinesses!

1992
02:13:36,266 --> 02:13:38,516
Eggs.
Eggs for you.

1993
02:13:38,517 --> 02:13:39,739
It is for me.

1994
02:13:39,774 --> 02:13:42,873
<i > the reception also not
it was anything thereabout beyond.</i>

1995
02:13:42,908 --> 02:13:45,695
<i > it was just eaten and friends.</i>

1996
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:47,720
And butter.

1997
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:16,460
And, while it arranged him/it
I reflect of the marriage,

1998
02:14:16,495 --> 02:14:18,707
he/she didn't get to leave of wondering

1999
02:14:18,742 --> 02:14:23,025
because it is that we wrote
our own votes

2000
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:26,339
and no our own rules?

2001
02:14:26,754 --> 02:14:29,693
That is something in that
I am to work.

2002
02:14:31,733 --> 02:14:33,215
Thank you.

2003
02:14:39,202 --> 02:14:42,019
<i > Maybe it is better some
marks be inside of the wardrobe.</i>

2004
02:14:42,054 --> 02:14:46,535
<i > Maybe, when we labelled somebody as
he/she becomes engaged, fiancé, husband, woman, < /i>

2005
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:51,680
<i > married, unmarried woman, we forgot
of seeing for besides the label.</i>

2006
02:14:52,909 --> 02:14:54,297
That is delicious.

2007
02:14:54,332 --> 02:14:57,442
- Because parámos of drinking of this?
- Because all the others began.

2008
02:14:57,477 --> 02:14:59,694
Now already it is elderly, but it is good.

2009
02:14:59,729 --> 02:15:02,971
And for speaking in velhotas.

2010
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:08,150
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2011
02:15:08,907 --> 02:15:10,546
He/she waits, a gift.

2012
02:15:10,961 --> 02:15:12,548
To Samantha.

2013
02:15:12,911 --> 02:15:15,646
Fifty-year-old and fabulous.

2014
02:15:21,766 --> 02:15:23,240
To us.

2015
02:15:25,269 --> 02:15:28,864
- And to the next 50 years.
- To the close ones 50!

2016
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:33,486
<i > it is there, in the same city < /i>

2017
02:15:33,521 --> 02:15:35,536
<i > where they met each other
while small, < /i>

2018
02:15:35,571 --> 02:15:40,189
<i > four women from New York
they entered in the next phase of his/her life.</i>

2019
02:15:40,224 --> 02:15:43,599
<i > Dressed of the feet to the head
with love.</i>

2020
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:46,577
<i > That is the only mark < /i>

2021
02:15:46,612 --> 02:15:49,761
<i > that never leaves of fashion.</i>

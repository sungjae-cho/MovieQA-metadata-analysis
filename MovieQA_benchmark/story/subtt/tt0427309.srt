Heavenly Father, we come before Thee,

10
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,065
knee bent and body bowed

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,556
in the humblest way
that we know how.

12
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,331
Father, who controls
and knows all things,

13
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,102
both the living
and dying of all creatures.

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:21,011
Give us the strength and the wisdom
to do Thy work.

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,515
In God's name we pray.

16
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,916
And all God's people say, "Amen."

17
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,544
- # My soul is a witness #
- Amen.

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,088
- # Water, wine #
- # So high #

19
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,249

[Man]
When Agave sobered up,

29
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,740
she looked down and saw
the head of her son Pentheus

30
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,838
- right there in her hands.
- She thought he was a wild animal.

31
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,712
That's how Dionysus got his revenge.

32
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,116
You a heathen, Henry.

33
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,676
You know what I got right here?

34
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,348
- What?
- Some of that very wine.

35
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,691
"When I was a child, I spake as a child.

36
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,233
"I understood as a child.

37
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,770
"I thought as a child.

38
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,931
"But when I became a man,

39
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,533
I put away all childish things."

Freshman class...

47
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:54,498
I believe we are the most privileged
people in America,

48
00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:00,546
because we have
the most important job

49
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,877
in America:

50
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,976
The education of our young people.

51
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,214
# I was traveling #

63
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,818
- Who the hell is he?
- Oh, he's just my husband.

64
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,789
I'm gonna cut your head off.

65
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,161
[Speaker]
We must impress upon our young people

66
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,191
that there will be difficulties
that they face.

67
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,328
Come on, Trudell.
Come get this whuppin', boy.

68
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,372
- [Man] Get him down, Trudell.
- Scared, ain't ya?

69
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,566
Huh? You with the razor
and twice my size?

70
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,007
[Speaker]
They must defeat them!

71
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:14,984
They must do what they have to do
in order to do what they want to do.

72
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,988
[Man]
Come on, now.

Get up, baby. Come on!

00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,169
[Speaker]
The way out of ignorance...

78
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,899
Like cuttin' people, huh, boy?

79
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,975
Want to cut people, Trudell, huh?

80
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,573
Get your hands off me!

81
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,637

- Give it back!
- "To our precious Hamilton..."

87
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,341
This isn't funny. Come on.
Dunbar, give it back.

88
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,347
Who do you think you are?
Jesse Owens?

Have a seat.

90
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,243
"I am...

91
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,972
"the darker brother.

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,538
"They send me to eat in the kitchen
when company comes.

93
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,016
"But I laugh, and I eat well,

94
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,155
"and I grow strong.

95
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,716
"Tomorrow, I will sit at the table
when company comes.

96
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,783
"Nobody'll dare say to me,

97
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,829
"'Eat in the kitchen' then.

98
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:41,833
"Besides, they'll see how beautiful I am,

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,392
"and be ashamed.

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,907
I, too, am America."

101
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,000
Who wrote that?

102
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,878
Langston Hughes, 1924.

103
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,381
1925.

104
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:05,046
"Hating you shall be a game
played with cool hands."

105
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:11,262
"Memory will lay its hands
upon your breast,

106
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,562
and you will understand my hatred."

107
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,262
Gwendolyn Bennett wrote that.

108
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,474
She was born in 1902.

109
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,102
Unofficially.

110
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,974
You see, in most states,

111
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,842
Negroes were denied birth certificates,

112
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,508
which means I can
lie about my age the rest of my life.

113
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,880
[Laughing]

114
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,215
You think that's funny?

115
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,018
To be born...

116
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,217
without record.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,124
Mr. Reed, hand these out.

118
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,825
I'm going to introduce you
to some new voices this semester.

119
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,265
There's a revolution going on.

120
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,666
In the North. In Harlem.

121
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,296
They're changing the way
Negroes in America think.

122
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,604
I'm talking about poets
like Hughes, Bennett,

123
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,043
Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen...

124
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,704
"Some are teethed on a silver spoon,

125
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,546
"with the stars strung up for a rattle.

126
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,951
"I cut my teeth
as a black raccoon...

127
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,454
...for implements of battle."

128
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,654
Meet me after class.

129
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,770
[Sighs]

130
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,471
What's a professor doing
in the middle of the night

131
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,207
dressed like a cotton-chopper?

132
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,340
What is a student doing
in the middle of the night

133
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,576
throwing his life away?

134
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,619
It's funny. I thought
I was defending myself.

135
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,052
Mm.

136
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,319
I remember you.

137
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,054
Couple of years ago.
Then you disappeared.

138
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,220
What happened?

139
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,094
I come and go whenever it suits me.

140
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,224
- Suspensions?
- Leaves of absence.

141
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,569
Why'd you come back?

142
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,004
School's the only place
you can read all day.

143
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,041
Except prison.

144
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,706
I want you to come by
my house tonight, 7:30.

145
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,714
- Corner of June and Campus.
- Why would I do that?

146
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,012
Holding tryouts for the debate team.

147
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,717
- You sure you want somebody like me?
- No.

148
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,350
That's why you're trying out.

149
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,916
7:30.

150
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,757
June and Campus.

151
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,751
[Muttering]

152
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,815
"Driven by the wind and tossed..."

153
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,119
Do well tonight, Junior.

154
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,832
[Professor]
Of the 360 students here at Wiley College,

155
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,032
only 45 of you were brave enough
to try out for the debate team.

156
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,836
Of that 45, only four
of you will remain standing

157
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,003
when the tryouts are over... why?

158
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,207
Because debate is
blood sport. It's combat.

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,443
But your weapons are words.

160
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,882
[Knocking]
Come on in.

161
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,113
Now that Mr. Farmer
has joined us, we can begin.

162
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,485
Sit down, Mr. Farmer.

163
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,922
Not right there. Over there.

164
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,823
- Yes, sir.
- James. Right this way.

165
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,952
Good evening, Mrs. Tolson.

166
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,997
- Evening.
- Excuse me.

167
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,463
We're waiting for you, Mr. Farmer.

168
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,999
I'm going, sir.

169
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,468
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
You smell very good, Mr. Farmer.

170
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,903
- Thank you, sir.
- You're very welcome.

171
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,770
Gentlemen and lady.

172
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,072
This is...

173
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,137
the hot spot.

174
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,083
You will enter it at your own risk.

175
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,347
Mr. Tolson, what about
the debaters from last year?

176
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,911
Don't ask a question you
already know the answer to.

177
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,251
Get up here. You'll be first.

178
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,916
Get right here. Hot spot.

179
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,017
Debate starts with a proposition.

180
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,618
With an idea..."Resolved:

181
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,427
Child labor should be regulated
by the federal government."

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,559
The first debater argues
the affirmative.

183
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,296
Affirmative means
that you are for something.

184
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,928
Mr. Reed will argue the affirmative.

185
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,666
The second debater
argues the negative.

186
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,207
Negative means that you are what?

187
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,207
Against.

188
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,107
Brilliant, Mr. Burgess.

189
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,147
You shall argue
the affirmative, Mr. Reed. Go.

190
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:26,708
Well, sir, I'd begin with a quote
from the poet Cleghorn.

191
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,984
"The golf links lie so near the mill,

192
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,356
"that almost every day,

193
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,022
"the laboring children
can look out and...

194
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,962
and..."

195
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,763
# And watch the men at play #

196
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,337
Is that what you learned
from last year, Mr. Reed?

197
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,669
To start something,
and not finish it?

198
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,299
- Is it?
- No, sir.

199
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,070
Sit down.

200
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,574
Who's next? You? Stand up.

201
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,051
Stand up.

202
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,854
It's getting late.
How much longer can you hide?

203
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,358
I'm not hiding, sir.
I transferred from my college

204
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,053
just to come here
and try out for your team.

205
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,459
I am deeply moved. What's your name?

206
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,019
Samantha Booke.

207
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,395
- Book?
- With an "e."

208
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,924
Arise, Miss Booke. With an "e."

209
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,373
Into the hot spot,
Miss Booke with an "e."

210
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,434
You know, there's never been a female
on the debating team, ever.

211
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,139
Yes, sir. I know that.

212
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,580
What makes you think
you should be the first?

213
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,913
Because, sir, I am just as qualified as...

214
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,714
- Quit stammering, Miss Booke.
...anybody else here.

215
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,516
- My gender has nothing...
- "Resolved:

216
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,353
Welfare discourages hard work."

217
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,553
- You'll argue the negative.
- All right.

218
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,325
Welfare takes away a man's
strongest reason for working,

219
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,992
which is survival.

220
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,659
And that weakens the will of the poor.

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,873
How would you rebut that,
Miss Booke with an "e"?

222
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,966
I would say it does not.

223
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,135
Most of the New Deal
goes to children, anyway,

224
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,372
and to the handicapped,
and to old people...

225
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,880
- Is that fact, or conjecture?
- It is a fact.

226
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,348
- Speak up.
- It is a fact.

227
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,180
- What's your source?
- The president.

228
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,619
- Of the United States?
- Yes, sir.

229
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,851
That's your primary source? You spoke
to President Roosevelt personally?

230
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,325
Of course not. I did not
speak to him personally,

231
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,986
but I listened to his Fireside Chat.

232
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,963
- Oh, a radio broadcast.
- Yes.

233
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,193
- Any other sources?
- Well...

234
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,269
Any other sources?

235
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,698
Yes, there are other sources.

236
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,504
Like that look in a mother's eyes
when she can't feed her kids.

237
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,013
Without welfare, Mr. Tolson,
people would be starving.

238
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,240
Who's starving, Miss Booke?

239
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,681
- The unemployed are starving.
- Mr. Burgess here.

240
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,117
He's unemployed.
Obviously, he's not starving.

241
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,219
I drew you in, Miss Booke.

242
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,022
You gave a faulty premise,
so your syllogism fell apart.

243
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,028
- "Syllogism"?
- Your logic fell apart.

244
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,064
Major premise:
The unemployed are starving.

245
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,623
Minor premise:
Mr. Burgess is unemployed.

246
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,225
Conclusion: Mr. Burgess is starving.

247
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,170
Your major premise was
based on a faulty assumption.

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,038
Classic fallacy. Who's next?

249
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,578
[Whispers]
You were right.

250
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,880
[Tolson]
Tell us your name.

251
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,252
I'm Henry Lowe. With an "e."

252
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,259
All right, Mr. Lowe. I will name a subject.

253
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,023
You speak a few words...
a pertinent quote from world literature.

254
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,324
Go ahead.

255
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,657
Beauty.

256
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,159
"I heard the old, old men say,

257
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,637
all that is beautiful
drifts away, like the waters."

258
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,107
Very good.

259
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,373
History. And name
the author this time.

260
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,540
"History is a nightmare,
from which I am trying to awake."

261
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,981
James Joyce.

262
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,748
Self-pity.

263
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,224
"I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself."

264
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,593
D.H. Lawrence.

265
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,232
[Whispers]
I love D.H. Lawrence. Have you ever read...

266
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,327
Mr. Farmer.

267
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,495
Yes, sir?

268
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,041
I have eyes in the back of my head
and ears on both sides. Stand up.

269
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,847
Tell me the irony in the name
"Bethlehem Steel Corporation."

270
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,184
Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus,
Prince of Peace,

271
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,088
and Bethlehem Steel
makes weapons of war.

272
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,626
Very good. Sit down.

273
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,784
Good.

274
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,558
[Tolson]
Who's next?

275
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,495
That went well.
How will we know how we did?

276
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,228
- [Chattering]
- Samantha.

277
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,772
Samantha.

278
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,337
Tolson's tough, isn't he?

279
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,402
He sure is.

280
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,481
I'm James.

281
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,609
Is your father Dr. James Farmer?

282
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,677
Yes... yes, he is.

283
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,155
I'm taking theology from him,
and that man speaks in tongues.

284
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,283
French, Greek, Hebrew, Latin...

285
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,021
How many languages
does he speak?

286
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,191
- Seven languages.
- "Seven languages."

287
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,099
He must be the smartest man in Texas.

288
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,102
Well, that's not saying much.

289
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,207
So why do you want
to be on the team?

290
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,870
- I think it would be good training.
- For what?

291
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,277
Bein' a lawyer.

292
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,908
Lawyer? That's great.

293
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,851
You know how many Negro
women practice law in this state?

294
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,182
- Two.
- Exactly.

295
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,279
One of them's my aunt.

296
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,985
Well, look at you, Mr. Farmer.

297
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,617
How old are you, anyway?

298
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,288
I'll be 16...

299
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,626
in 21 months.
[Chuckles]

300
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:44,032
Young lady. James.
I just wanted to thank you.

301
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,831
For what?

302
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,530
Well, for your performance tonight.

303
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,698
I mean, how many other students
ever stand up to Tolson?

304
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,070
- I did.
- No.

305
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,442
You answered a question,
and I spouted a few quotes.

306
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,538
Miss Booke with an "e,"

307
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,550
- she fought back.
- And lost!

308
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,779
But you didn't have to lose.

309
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,948
Why isn't a Fireside Chat
a legitimate source?

310
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,424
Because Tolson says so?

311
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:12,157
Nobody has better access
to those statistics than the president.

312
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,634
Now, if you'd have called Tolson on that,
you would have won.

313
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:21,468
I don't know. I'm sure that man
would have come up with something.

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,303
Good night, James.

315
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,036
[Samantha]
Can you believe he's

316
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,169
- Good night, Samantha.
- 14 years old, and he's in college?

317
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,245
You are gifted, all of you.

318
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,785
So I want you to know that I chose
this team for balance,

319
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,879
and none of you should
take it as a failure...

320
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,083
as a denigration of your intellect.

321
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,490
Denigrate. There's a word for you.

322
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,495
From the Latin word "niger,"
to defame, to blacken.

323
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,588
It's always there, isn't it?
Even in the dictionary.

324
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,123
Even in the speech
of a Negro professor.

325
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,365
Somehow, "black" is always
equated with failure.

326
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,998
Well, write your own dictionary.

327
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,577
And mark this as a new beginning,

328
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,375
whether you make the team or not.

329
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:07,613
The Wiley College Forensics
Society of 1935-1936 is as follows:

330
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,314
The debaters...

331
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,187
will be Mr. Hamilton Burgess
from last year's team...

332
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,989
- Yea!
- Sit down, Mr. Burgess.

333
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,193
Mr. Henry Lowe.

334
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,166
Our alternates.

335
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,601
Miss Samantha Booke. With an "e."

336
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,602
And finally...

337
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,208
Junior, slow down.

338
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,372
- Where's Dad?
- Quiet. He's writing a lecture.

339
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,386
- Dad.
- Junior.

340
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,651
What is the greatest
weakness of man?

341
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,320
Not believing? Doubt?

342
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,788
That's it. Thank you, Junior.

343
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,494
Matthew 14:31.

344
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,196
- That will be the lesson.
- Dad.

345
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:04,241
"O you of little faith,
why do you doubt me?"

346
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,038
Dad?

347
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,510
What is it, son?

348
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,104
I made the debate team.

349
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,275
Well, congratulations.

350
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,251
And who is on your team?

351
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,686
Um, there's four of us.
I'm one of the alternates.

352
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,679
Who's ahead of you?

353
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,249
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

354
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,955
And the other alternate's
Samantha Booke.

355
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,691
There's a girl?

356
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,960
She wants to be a lawyer.

357
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,831
- A lawyer?
- She's very intelligent.

358
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,533
Is she pretty?

359
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,907
I don't know.
I never really noticed.

360
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,004
Because extracurricular activities
like the debate team are fine,

361
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,515
but you must not take
your eye off the ball, son.

362
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,883
- Yes, sir.
- Hmph.

363
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,821
So what do we do here?

364
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,223
We do what we have to do,
so we can do what we want to do.

365
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,728
What do you have to do right now?

366
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,627
- My homework.
- So get to it.

367
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,290
Yes, sir.

## [Woman singing opera]

My daddy owns a grocery store
that has apples, bananas, cookies,

00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,946
doughnuts, eggs, figs,

371
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,209
and "gonzola" beans.

372
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,150
Right. What's a gonzola bean?
[Laughs]

373
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,279
- [Dr. Farmer] Hogwash!
- Hogwash!

374
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,379
"Gonzola" bean?

375
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,526
Ready, set, go!

376
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,552
- Apricots, uh...
- Hogwash.

377
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,096
What, no apricots?

378
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,394
Look out!

[Switches off motor]

380
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,637
What was that?

381
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,467
I'm not sure.

00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,918
- You stay put.
- [Barking continues]

385
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,978
Be still.

386
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,296
What is it?

387
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,026
It's a pig.

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,795
- Hit a pig.
- [Screen door slams]

389
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,630
Shut up, dog!

390
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,466
Junior, get in the car.

391
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,506
What the hell happened to my hog?

392
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,906
Sorry about that.
Came out of nowhere.

393
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,170
I didn't see it coming.

394
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,144
You done killed my hog, boy.

395
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,841
Truly sorry. Gladly pay you for it.

396
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,782
How much...
How much you want?

397
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,047
It's gonna cost you $25.

398
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,053
Only have a few bucks on me
right now, but I can...

399
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,528
I do have a check.

400
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,696
My monthly check,
for Wiley College in Marshall.

401
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,037
It's for $17.36.

402
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,373
You may have that.

403
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,379
I will endorse that over to you.

404
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,943
You'll do what?

405
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,111
I will sign the check over to you.

406
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,781
Well, let me see it.

00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:08,348
It's in the car, with my wife.

Junior, get in the car.

410
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,777
Give me that salary check, Pearl.

411
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,607
We need that money, James.

412
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,839
Just give me the check.

413
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,109

[Dr. Farmer]
Just relax. It's all right.

417
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,356
It's in here. You'll find it.

418
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,297
Here it is.

419
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,063

That check better be good, boy.

421
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,276
It's good.

422
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,846
Well, pick it up!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

You got to help us
get this hog in my truck.

426
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,869
Come on. Grab the tail end of that, boy.

427
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,368
All right, on three.

428
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,074
One, two, three!
[Grunting]

Town niggers. They think
they're too good to get their hands dirty.

- I told you to get in the car.

something, Junior, you do it.

[Tolson]
Who's the judge?

433
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,270
The judge is God.

434
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,644
Why is he God?

435
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,149
Because he decides
who wins or loses,

436
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,310
not my opponent.

437
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,410
Who is your opponent?

438
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,954
He doesn't exist.

439
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,649
Why does he not exist?

440
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,487
He's merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak.

441
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,388
Who's the judge?

442
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,396
- The judge is God!
- The judge is God!

443
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,920
Why is he God?

444
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,331
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

445
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,333
Who is your opponent?

446
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,199
He doesn't exist!

447
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,863
Why doesn't he exist?

448
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,602
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

449
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,440
[Laughing]

450
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,501
Who's the judge?

451
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,979
The judge is God!

452
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,276
Why is he God?

453
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,115
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

454
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,380
Who's your opponent?

455
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,648
He doesn't exist!

456
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,246
Why does he not exist?

457
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,851
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

458
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,224
Who's the judge?

459
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,353
The judge is God!

460
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,260
Louder!

461
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,855
The judge is God!

462
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,057
Why is he God?

463
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,365
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

464
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,426
Who's your opponent?

465
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,630
He doesn't exist!

466
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,967
Why does he not exist?

467
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,669
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

468
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,711
Speak the truth!

469
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,109
Speak the truth!

470
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,738
Yes, sir, I do like to talk.

471
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,680
Is that a virtue or a vice?

472
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,517
Well, I have to admit I've always wanted
to be the quiet, mysterious type,

473
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,681
only I couldn't keep
my mouth shut long enough.

474
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,590
Would you punch yourself
in a street fight, Mr. Burgess?

475
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,020
No, sir.

476
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,791
Then don't punch yourself in a word fight.

477
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,525
You don't have to make fun of yourself.

478
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,536
Use your humor against your opponent.

479
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,798
Mr. Farmer!

480
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,930
Yes, sir.

481
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,332
Happy Mr. Farmer.

482
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,741
Tell us one thing we don't
know about your father.

483
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,040
He was the first Negro Ph...

484
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,481
One thing we don't know
about your father, Mr. Farmer.

485
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,619
He walked from Florida to Massachusetts
to go to college at Boston University.

486
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,886
He graduated magna cum laude.

487
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,021
Mr. Lowe!

488
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,262
Tell us about your father.

489
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,928
Why don't you tell us something
about your father?

490
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,097
We're trying to get
to know each other, Mr. Lowe.

491
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,197
I was trying to get
to know you, Mr. Tolson.

492
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,072
I'm not the one on the debate team.

493
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,612
Are we not engaged
in a debate right now?

494
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,977
All right.

495
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,109
I'll take the affirmative.

496
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:34,584
Take the meanest...
most restless nigger,

497
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,627
strip him of his clothes

498
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,890
in front of the remaining male niggers,
female niggers,

499
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,124
and nigger infants.

500
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,029
Tar and feather him.

501
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,194
Tie each leg to a horse
facing an opposite direction,

502
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,429
set him on fire,

503
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,974
and beat both horses
until they tear him apart

504
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,408
in front of the male,
female, and nigger infants.

505
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:57,414
Bullwhip and beat
the remaining nigger males

506
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,847
within an inch of their life.

507
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,647
Do not kill them, but put
the fear of God in them,

508
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,382
for they can be useful for future breeding.

509
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,117
Anybody know
who Willie Lynch was?

510
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,590
Anybody? Raise your hand.

511
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,853
No one?

512
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,191
He was a vicious slave owner
in the West Indies.

513
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,696
The slave-masters
in the colony of Virginia

514
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,097
were having trouble
controlling their slaves,

515
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,659
so they sent for Mr. Lynch
to teach them his methods.

516
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,263
The word "lynching"
came from his last name.

517
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:27,573
His methods were very simple,
but they were diabolical.

518
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,707
Keep the slave physically strong
but psychologically weak

519
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,478
and dependent on the slave master.

520
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,952
Keep the body, take the mind.

521
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,587
I... and every other
professor on this campus

522
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,290
are here to help you...

523
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,102
to find, take back,

524
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,538
and keep your righteous mind...

525
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,270
because obviously you have lost it.

526
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,875
That's all you need to know about me,
Mr. Lowe.

527

00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,973
All right.

711
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,624
I'm going to be honest with you, boys.

712
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,026
I'm not well.

713
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,656
I'm not well at all this morning.

714
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,198
I'm sure sorry to hear that, sir.

715
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,255
You look well to me.

716
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,460
Don't he look well, Sam?

717
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,537
Yes, sir. He looks real good.

718
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:18,041
Now, we got some white fellas
from up north come into our town.

719
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,077
They're stirring up trouble
between our coloreds and our whites.

720
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,010
They say that we need to make a union:

721
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,605
The sharecroppers
and the workers all together,

722
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,877
colored and white.

723
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,782
They need to make a union?

724
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,787
How do you boys feel about that?

725
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,117
I don't know, sir.

726
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,180
I really ain't thought much about that.

727
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,226
Well, it's a bad idea.

728
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,784
It's a bad idea, take my word for it.

729
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,763
Yes, sir.

730
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,391
And they say that there was
some kind of secret meeting

731
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,832
last night down near the lake.

732
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,459
Now, do you boys know about that?

733
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,969
No, sir.

734
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,165
You don't know about that?

735
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,903
- Samuel?
- No, sir.

736
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,308
- You didn't hear about that?
- No, sir.

737
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,675
- You swear to me?
- Yes, sir.

738
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,270
Yes, sir, I swear.

739
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,880
All right, then.

740
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,878
See you later.

741
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,718
Our first debate

742
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:13,719
is one week from today.

743
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,662
- One week?
- That's right.

744
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,394
I thought Prairie View was first.

745
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,334
Prairie View is tough,
so I thought we needed a warm-up.

746
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,895
With the best Negro college in the state?

747
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,736
That's right, Mr. Burgess.

748
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,900
Does that frighten you?

749
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,534
Yes, sir.

750
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,705
One week's not enough time
to write our arguments.

751
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,840
You do the research.
I'll write the arguments.

752
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,782
Wait. You...

753
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,285
You write the arguments?

754
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,342
And you deliver them, Mr. Lowe.

755
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,150
What the hell do I look like, a mailman?

756
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,192
Hell is where you're headed
if you question me again.

757
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,887
In theory, you look like a student.

758
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,260
So what you're saying
is I'm not capable.

759
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,491
It's not a matter of competence.

760
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,624
It's a matter of experience.

761
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,860
How do I know you write...

762
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,663
I write the arguments!

763
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,032
That's the way it's been!

764
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,504
That's the way it's going to be!

765
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,270
Any more questions?

766
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,469
One week.

767
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,075
[Moderator]
I bring to you

768
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,345
our first affirmative debater:

769
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,583
From Paul Quinn College,
Otheree Hubbard.

770
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:24,800
Resolved: Unemployment
relief should be ended

771
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,370
when the Depression ends.

772
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,268
If the Depression ends.

773
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,969
I traveled back through history to 1536,

774
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,534
when the first Poor Laws
of England were mandated.

775
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,946
In those days, the dole...
or welfare, as we call it...

776
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,746
was funded by voluntary contributions.

777
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,287
But, as time passed,

778
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,516
the English devised the Allowance System,

779
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,558
the first unemployment relief,

780
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,959
only now it was paid
with involuntary contributions,

781
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,929
more commonly known as taxes.

782
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,192
[Audience laughs]

783
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,597
The Allowance System was a disaster.

784
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,568
The only real unemployment relief
is to give a man a job.

785
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,639
But to do that, you have
to give the economy life,

786
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,905
not tax it to death.

787
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,844
When capitalism was young,

788
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,010
the old puritanical concept of duty

789
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:19,453
was, "He who does not work
shall not eat."

790
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,388
That made sense
when there was more work

791
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,153
than men willing to do it.

792
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,785
But those days are gone.

793
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,727
Now there are millions
who want to work,

794
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,662
but find themselves
standing in breadlines.

795
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,394
Now, should they not eat
because there are no jobs?

796
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,663
People, today we need
a new concept of duty:

797
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,740
The right of the individual
to demand from society

798
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,742
just as much as he gives to society.

799
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,380
We clutch at anything that
even looks like a solution.

800
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,748
$60 million a month for public relief?

801
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,619
Pay it out if it'll sweep
the hoboes off the streets.

802
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,150
One seventh of the population
of the United States on welfare.

803
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,559
Fine, as long as it ends our misery.

804
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,033
A nation as desperate as this
is a danger to itself.

805
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,092
- [Applause]
- [Audience member] That's right.

806
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,906
Once,

807
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,943
a Roman general brought peace
to a rebellious province...

808
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,842
by killing all its citizens.

809
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,575
Even his fellow Romans
were shocked.

810
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,877
One of them wrote,

811
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,248
<i>"Solitudinem faciunt,</i>
<i>pacem appellant, "

812
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,551
which means "They create desolation
and call it peace."

813
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,455
Now, for all their facts and figures,

814
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,360
the Paul Quinn debaters would also
create desolation and call it peace.

815
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,526
They would allow the unemployed to die
so the economy can live.

816
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,192
[Applause]

817
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,012
A brilliant young woman I know

818
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:01,023
was asked once to support her argument
in favor of social welfare.

819
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,457
She named the most powerful source
imaginable:

820
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:08,727
The look in a mother's face
when she cannot feed her children.

821
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,069
Can you look that hungry
child in the eyes?

822
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,504
See the blood on his feet

823
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,541
from walking barefoot
in the cotton fields?

824
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,668
Or do you ask his baby sister
with her belly swollen from hunger

825
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,610
if she cares about
her daddy's work ethic?

826
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,977
[Applause]

827
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,946
He's good.

# <i>Had a little girl</i> #

832
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,931
# <i>She's little and low</i> #

833
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,404
# <i>She used to love me</i> #

834
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,702
# <i>But she don't no more</i> #

# <i>Yeah, and go</i> #

837
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,103
The only thing that matters
is that big fish eat little fish,

838
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,309
and the color of the fish
does not count!

839
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,974
<i>#...step it up and go</i> #

840
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,054

would have turned their heads

00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,489
each and every time
a Negro was lynched,

842
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,186
shouldn't the federal government intervene?

That's right, Captain.

I think I've got the ringleader.

00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,675
Uh, all right,

00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,991
Texas Rangers?

884
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,257
Mm-hmm.

885
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,634
He wants me to, uh, hold off
on picking this fella up

886
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,796
until him and his boys get up here.

887
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,202
Shit. Wants to get
his picture in the paper.

888
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,265
Yeah.

889
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,436
We do all the work,
they get all the glory.

890
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,036
Yep.

891
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,512
[Sigh]

892
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:16,253
I guess that's just the way the world is.

893
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,118
Isn't that right, Samuel?

894
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,552
I have an announcement
to make. Excuse me.

895
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,199
Recently, l... uh, we...

896
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,767
Mm-hmm.

897
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:35,271
...sent some letters
to some major universities.

898
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,364
Told them all about us, our team,

899
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,907
what we've been doing,

900
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,935
and, uh, yesterday
we got a response.

901
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,342
From Oklahoma City University.

902
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,849
Aren't they...?

903
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,783
Anglo-Saxon? Yes. Yes.

904
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,684
We'll be the first Negro college in America...

905
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,950
well, one of the first Negro
colleges in America...

906
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,491
to ever debate a white college.

907
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,651
All right!

908
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,354
University of Oklahoma!

909
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,795
Not University of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City University.

910
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,662
The debate will take place
at an off-campus site.

911
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,362
Wait. An off-campus site? Why?

912
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,495
Because sometimes, Mr. Lowe,

913
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,869
you have to take things
one step at a time.

914
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,738
So what you're saying is
the crackers in Oklahoma

915
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,208
ain't gonna let us on their campus.

916
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,337
No, what I'm saying is you have to take
things one step at a time.

917
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,881
This is a great opportunity.

918
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,881
Thank you very much.

919
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,442
Master is going to give us
a crumb off his plate, huh?

920
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,488
What? Wha...

921
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,254
I think Lowe here is afraid.

922
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,796
What am I afraid of, James?

923
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,832
I think you're afraid
to debate white people.

924
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,264
- Anglo-Saxons.
- Anglo-Saxons.

925
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,095
Thank you very much.

926
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,725
Mr. Tolson, let me debate.

927
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:44,466
I mean, I'll debate
Anglo-Saxons anywhere:

928
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,371
In a dark alley, with no light,

929
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,707
with a candle lit and people
chasing you down with guns.

930
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,077
Hell, I'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere.

931
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,410
I ain't afraid.

932
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,040
I am.

933
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,546
[Sigh]

934
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,851
Mr. Tolson, when I came here today,

935
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:03,086
I saw the sheriff outside watching your house.

936
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,219
What's going on?

937
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,557
Maybe you should ask the sheriff.

938
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,398
I've been hearing a lot of rumors
about what you're doing.

939
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,404
My dad just called the Dean last week

940
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,031
and asked, "What is
a communist doing

941
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,506
teaching at a good Methodist college?"

942
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,669
My politics are my business,
Mr. Burgess,

943
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,475
and I promise you that they
will not endanger the team.

944
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,175
But, sir, it is being endangered.

945
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,581
I came to Wiley College
to be educated, not investigated.

946
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,778
I understand that.

947
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,753
I don't want to be dragged into anything.

948
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,949
- You're not...
- If my parents find...

949
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,821
I'm sorry.

950
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,394
Mr. Tolson, please.

951
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,556
Just tell me you're not
a communist. Otherwise...

952
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,326
Otherwise what?

953
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,228
Otherwise what?

954
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,169
My father says I have to quit.

955
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,571
Nobody wants that.

956
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,972
Then tell me.

957
00:51:54,644 --> 00:52:00,344
As I said, my politics are my business.

958
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,916
I guess I have to resign.

959
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:18,564
Mrs. Tolson, thank you
for a wonderful dinner.

960
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,863
You're welcome, Ham.

961
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,398
Good luck in Oklahoma, y'all.

962
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,072
I know you'll win.

963
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,723
All right. Well,

964
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,662
if anybody else wants to quit, I'll understand.

965
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:35,770
Resolved:

966
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,372
Negroes should be...

967
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,043
should be admitted...

968
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,585
I can't hear you!

969
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,314
Speak up!

970
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,481
[Iouder]
Resolved...

971
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:56,162
Negroes should be admitted
to state universities.

972
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,430
My partner and I will prove

973
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,905
that blocking a Negro's admission
to a state university

974
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:08,673
is not only wrong, it is absurd.

975
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:15,412
The Negro people are not just a color
in the American fabric.

976
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,454
They are the thread
that holds it all together.

977
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:22,287
Consider the legal
and historical record.

978
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,327
May 13, 1865:

979
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,021
Sergeant Crocker, a Negro,

980
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,862
is the last soldier to die in the Civil War.

981
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,094
1918: The first U.S. Soldiers

982
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,067
decorated for bravery in France

983
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,629
are Negroes Henry Johnson
and Needham Roberts.

984
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,177
1920: <i>The New York Times</i> announces

985
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:45,374
that the "N" in Negro would hereafter
be capitalized.

986
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:49,475
To force upon the South
what they are not ready for

987
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,884
would result in nothing
but more racial hatred.

988
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,944
[Audience member]
What?

989
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,048
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois...

990
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,322
he's perhaps the most eminent
Negro scholar in America.

991
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,260
He comments...

992
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:04,390
"It's a silly waste
of money, time, and temper

993
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,061
"to try and compel a powerful majority

994
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:10,095
to do what they are
determined not to do."

995
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,573
My opponent so conveniently chose
to ignore the fact

996
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,306
that W.E.B. DuBois is the first Negro

997
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,043
to receive a Ph. D
from a white college called Harvard.

998
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,675
Dr. DuBois, he adds,

999
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:27,121
"It is impossible...
impossible for a Negro

1000
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,023
to receive a proper education
at a white college."

1001
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:33,119
The most eminent
Negro scholar in America

1002
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,528
is the product of
an Ivy League education.

1003
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,863
You see, DuBois knows all too well
the white man's resistance to change.

1004
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,768
But that's no reason to keep
a black man out of any college.

1005
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,036
If someone didn't force upon the South
something it wasn't ready for,

1006
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,303
I'd still be in chains,

1007
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,811
and Miss Booke here would be
running from her old Master!

1008
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,574
[Applause]

1009
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,276
I do admit it.

1010
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,251
It is true.

1011
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,449
Far too many whites are afflicted
with the disease of racial hatred.

1012
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,717
And because of racism,

1013
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,352
it would be impossible
for a Negro to be happy

1014
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,760
at a southern white college today.

1015
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:07,888
[Woman]
That's true.

1016
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,329
And if someone is unhappy,

1017
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:13,495
it is impossible to see how they could
receive a proper education.

1018
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,070
That's right.

1019
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,696
Yes, a time will come

1020
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,673
when Negroes and whites
will walk on the same campus

1021
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,405
and we will share
the same classrooms.

1022
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,178
But sadly, that day is not today.

1023
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,742
As long as schools
are segregated,

1024
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:36,622
Negroes will receive an education
that is both separate and unequal.

1025
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,661
By Oklahoma's own reckoning,

1026
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,459
the state is currently
spending five times more

1027
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,500
for the education of a white child

1028
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,933
than it is spending
to educate a colored child.

1029
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,631
That means better textbooks
for that child than for that child.

1030
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,298
Oh, I say that's a shame,

1031
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,503
but my opponent says
today is not the day

1032
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,378
for whites and coloreds
to go to the same college,

1033
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,713
to share the same campus,

1034
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,842
to walk in the same classroom.

1035
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,516
Well, would you kindly tell me
when is that day gonna come?

1036
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,821
Is it gonna come tomorrow?
Is it gonna come next week?

1037
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,190
In a hundred years?

1038
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,319
Never?

1039
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,386
No, the time for justice,

1040
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,433
the time for freedom,
and the time for equality

1041
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,266
is always, is always, right now!

1042
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,743
Thank you.

1043
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,794
[Coughing]

1044
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,300
What is this?

1045
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,869
I told you it was holy wine.

1046
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,130
Put hair on your chest.

1047
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,671
If you say so.

1048
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:57,671
Good, ain't it?

1049
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,832
[Cough]
Uh-huh.

1050
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,069
You know where the bathroom
is if you need it.

1051
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,439
Yeah.
[Cough]

1052
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,480
[General chatter]

1053
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,116
And my weapons were words.

1054
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,518
I didn't need a gun. I didn't need a knife.

1055
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:13,578
You see...

1056
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,185
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1057
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,319
And then what?

1058
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,472
Yes, I did, honey,

1059
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,908
and nobody knows that
better than you know.

1060
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,104
Oh, I'm fine.

1061
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,612
How are you doing, Pearl?

1062
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,704
Pearl!

1063
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,646
Yes, I do. Where's your husband?

1064
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,548
- He's in the study.
- Okay.

1065
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,032
Dr. Farmer.

1066
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,431
Congratulations, Melvin.

1067
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,434
Thank you.

1068
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,901
You've put us on the map.

1069
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,598
Well, your son is doing a great job.

1070
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,039
His research is impeccable.

1071
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,736
That's good to hear.
That's good to hear.

1072
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,677
Listen, there are people around town

1073
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,648
who aren't very happy
with your off-campus activities.

1074
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,881
They're calling you a radical.

1075
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,012
In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised

1076
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,249
to find out one morning
when I woke up

1077
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,189
that you were strung up to a tree.

1078
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,624
They'd have to catch me first.

1079
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,218
This is serious, Melvin.

1080
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,957
Very serious.

1081
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,591
A hungry Negro steals
a chicken, he goes to jail.

1082
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,500
A rich businessman steals
bonds, he goes to Congress.

1083
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,797
I think that's wrong.

1084
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,101
Now, if that makes me a radical,
a socialist, a communist, so be it.

1085
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,232
Amen... Amen on that.

1086
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,866
- Jesus was a radical.
- Careful.

1087
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,842
Yes, He was. Jesus was a radical.

1088
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,436
Mental institutions are filled with people

1089
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,106
who have confused themselves
with Jesus Christ.

1090
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,240
I'm not confused.

1091
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,784
You're convinced you're Jesus Christ now?

1092
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,284
- No.
- You're convinced you're Jesus Christ?

1093
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,684
You know what words do.

1094
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,914
- Okay.
- Come on now.

1095
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,217
Amen.

1096
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,587
Don't want to confuse
yourself with Jesus Christ.

1097
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,489
I'm not confused. I'm convinced.

1098
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,188
I'm not, uh, I'm not judging you.

1099
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:06,035
I'm just concerned
about your methods.

1100
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,003
What methods?

1101
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,131
James was there that night, wasn't he?

1102
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,868
He was not with me.

1103
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,171
Is he involved in this?

1104
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,506
Of course not, James.

1105
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,343
I've done everything in my power
to keep him out of this.

1106
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,473
- To keep him out?
- Yes.

1107
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,313
Are you telling me
he wants to be involved?

1108
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,012
Maybe this is something
you should discuss with him.

1109
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,486
I'm discussing it with you right now,

1110
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,614
and I don't feel like I'm getting
a straight answer.

1111
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,850
You're getting a straight answer.

1112
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,393
I think that you were
there with him that night.

1113
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,393
He was not with me.

1114
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,554
He's a 14-year-old boy.

1115
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,619
I understand that.

1116
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,257
I'll do whatever I have to do
to protect him.

1117
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,493
Is anybody thirsty?

1118
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,091
Here you are.

1119
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,137
Thank you. Thank you, Ruth.

1120
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,604
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

1121
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,140
Okay.

1122
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,607
Ruth, this is a fine party.

1123
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,076
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1124
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,113
I think it's time
for some sweet potato pie.

1125
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,112
Please.

1126
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,512
I'll help you with that.

1127
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,184
Not the time to talk about it.

1128
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,021
Congratulations.

1129
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,425
Thank you.

1130
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,714
It's so beautiful out here.

1131
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,551
Mm-hmm.

1132
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:34,783
Yeah.

1133
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,588
I was born near here,
a little further up the lake near Jefferson.

1134
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,153
I've been coming here
since I was a little boy.

1135
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,756
Your parents still live around here?

1136
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,962
No, no. They're, uh, they're gone.

1137
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,062
My grandparents raised me.

1138
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,141
And my Pah-Pah, he, uh,

1139
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,539
spent his life doing
the levees around here...

1140
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,872
for free, of course.

1141
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,175
- Mm. He was a slave?
- Mm-hmm.

1142
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,681
My grandma was always
telling me to be good

1143
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,253
or else the Confederates would rise up
out of Marshall Cemetery and get me.

1144
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,154
Boy.

1145
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:13,588
What?

1146
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,928
I've just never seen
this side of you before.

1147
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,092
What side?

1148
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,636
You seem so calm,

1149
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,137
so peaceful.

1150
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,505
It's what the lake does to me.

1151
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,044
I'm happy when I'm out here,
you know?

1152
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,641
It's funny.

1153
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:51,128
Part of me wants to just stay out here
by the lake, you know?

1154
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,297
Read books all day and hunt
and fish when I get hungry.

1155
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,703
And the other part
wants to go everywhere,

1156
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,037
you know, see everything.

1157
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:06,911
I want to go to New Orleans and New York
and Chicago and even San Francisco.

1158
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,409
I just want to go...

1159
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:14,616
walking down the road and...

1160
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,055
just disappear.

1161
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,564
Well, maybe you could
take me with you.

1162
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,708
## ["When the Saints
Come Marching In"]

1163
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,264
- Lord.
- What?

1164
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,931
It's the school band,
and they're outside.

1165
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,702
What? Jesus!

1166
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,710
I thought you said nobody
ever comes around here.

1167
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,040
Nobody ever does
come here, Samantha.

1168
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,512
- [Knock on door]
- Hold on! Hold on!

1169
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,208
Henry, come on!

1170
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,307
[Knocking]

1171
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,749
Henry.

1172
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:23,978
Get dressed.

1173
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,611
What's going on?

1174
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,883
We're gonna go get
Mr. Tolson and Samantha,

1175
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,619
head back to the campus,
and have a pep rally.

1176
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,024
Come on, get dressed.

1177
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,686
You know what?
You go get Tolson,

1178
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,856
and I'll meet up with y'all later on campus.

1179
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,126
Come on, Lowe.

1180
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,463
You know it's going to be fun.

1181
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,581
I guess I'll tell them
you're going to join us later?

1182
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,324
He's going to join us later.

1183
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,127
He just has to clean
his house, that's all.

1184
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,403
[Sigh]

1185
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:33,319
Great news. Great news.
Great news!

1186
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,256
My phone has been ringing off the hook.

1187
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,520
University of Michigan
wants to debate us.

1188
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,619
So does SMU. So does Georgia.

1189
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,788
Where's Mr. Lowe?

1190
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,832
When do I get to debate?

1191
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,264
Sooner than you think, James.

1192
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,426
Sooner than you think.

1193
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,661
When?

1194
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,101
When you're ready.

1195
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,331
I'm ready now.

1196
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,602
Mr. Tolson, I do not mind if James...

1197
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,704
What's wrong?

1198
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,213
Maybe I'm tired of this.

1199
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:00,612
Of what?

1200
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,684
Of watching other people debate.

1201
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,947
When am I going to get
a chance to prove myself?

1202
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,955
You're our best researcher, James.

1203
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,581
We could not do this without you.

1204
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,955
You do plenty without me.

1205
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,129
Excuse me.

1206
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,563
- James!
- What?

1207
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,503
James, you wait!

1208
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:27,406
That was so mean
what you said in there.

1209
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,238
All right, uh, look,

1210
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,008
I don't want to lose your friendship.

1211
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,142
How can you lose something
that you never had?

1212
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,243
You were never my friend?

1213
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,720
Maybe I don't want
to just be your friend.

1214
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,258
Maybe it hurts me
to be your friend.

1215
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,068
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

1216
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,537
[All murmuring]

1217
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,607
[Officer]
Grab his hands.

1218
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,540
Mr. Tolson!

1219
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:12,578
Where is he?

1220
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:13,815
Calm down, Henry.

1221
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:14,821
Have you seen him?

1222
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,050
No, they won't let us.

1223
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,490
They didn't do nothing to you, did they?

1224
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,551
- No, we're fine.
- Deputy,

1225
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,186
I'm Dr. James Farmer
of Wiley College.

1226
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,163
This is William Taylor,
Mr. Tolson's attorney.

1227
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,699
And this is his wife Ruth.

1228
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,791
Hello.

1229
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,425
I'd like to see my client, please.

1230
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,503
William!

1231
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,061
Sheriff Dozier. Dr. James Farmer...

1232
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,969
Hello, William. How you doing today?

1233
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,599
Fine, sir, thank you. And you?

1234
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,301
Oh, not too bad, not too bad.

1235
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,901
Me and William, we go way back.

1236
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,970
I knew William when I was a boy.

1237
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,915
Could I see my client now, Sheriff?

1238
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,178
Your client?

1239
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,652
Well, the fact of the business
is, William,

1240
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,621
your client is kind of busy right now.

1241
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,952
Busy doing what?

1242
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,652
[Deputy]
Sheriff. Sheriff.

1243
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:53,787
[Whispering]
We have a situation.

1244
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:54,921
[Shouting outside]

1245
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,430
Get some of your boys out there.

1246
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,523
[Deputy]
All right, men.

1247
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,569
Let him go! Let him go!

1248
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,034
Let him go! Let him go!

1249
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,733
Let him go! Let him go!

1250
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,402
Let him go! Let him go!

1251
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,138
Let him go! Let him go!

1252
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,476
Let him go! Let him go!

1253
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:14,379
Let him go! Let him go!

1254
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,077
Let him go! Let him go!

1255
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,449
They with you?

1256
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,010
That's right.

1257
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:23,115
See? This is what happens to a town
when you let the unions in.

1258
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,420
Starts trouble.

1259
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,757
People get all riled up about nothing.

1260
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,663
One of them's liable to get hurt,
if you catch my drift.

1261
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,701
Sheriff, since it's clear

1262
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,964
that you have no evidence
to arrest Mr. Tolson,

1263
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,971
I suggest you let him go.

1264
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,302
You suggest it?

1265
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,672
Who the hell are you?

1266
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,677
Couple of months ago,

1267
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,874
there was a raid
on Floyd Tillman's barn.

1268
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:50,646
It was a peaceful and lawful
gathering of sharecroppers

1269
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,622
who were brutally attacked
by a gang of violent vigilantes.

1270
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,525
Now, witnesses say
that you were there.

1271
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:03,156
If you led that raid, Sheriff,

1272
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:06,462
you're the one who broke
the law, not Tolson.

1273
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,929
Are you threatening me, boy?

1274
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,370
No, sir.

1275
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,408
I wouldn't do that.

1276
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,535
But I cannot speak
for those people outside.

1277
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:21,606
An unjust law is no law at all.

1278
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,879
What does that mean?

1279
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,978
A mass slaughter

1280
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,650
of citizens, both white and colored,

1281
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,454
by Texas Rangers?

1282
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:35,190
Is that really what you want
as the Sheriff of this county?

1283
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,633
Now, if you let Tolson go home,

1284
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,567
I believe...

1285
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:48,042
I believe that these folks outside,
they'll go home as well.

1286
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,245
[Cheering]

1287
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,399
That pig wasn't worth $25.

1288
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,472
What?

1289
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,700
You owe my father some money.

1290
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,468
Have a seat, Mr. Farmer.

1291
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,062
Oh, Lord.

1292
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,568
Um...

1293
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,612
SMU has cancelled.

1294
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,548
University of Georgia sounds
like they will follow suit.

1295
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,016
Why?

1296
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,216
I've been blacklisted.

1297
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,281
They're talking about censuring me.

1298
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,691
Dean Clay and the board
have asked me

1299
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:49,219
to stop working with
the sharecroppers, or else.

1300
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,858
They say that it is not my fight.

1301
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,426
So... things are bad.

1302
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,505
My academic career's in jeopardy.

1303
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,972
My debate team has nowhere to go.

1304
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,307
Anyone know who Antaeus was?

1305
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,874
Sure. He was a gigantic
wrestler in Greek mythology.

1306
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:13,285
His mother was, uh, Gaea,
the goddess of Earth,

1307
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,289
and, uh, I mean, he was unbeatable

1308
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,257
because anytime someone
threw him down to the Earth,

1309
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,315
it would make him stronger.

1310
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,588
That's correct.

1311
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,060
It would make him stronger.

1312
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,861
Defeat would make him stronger.

1313
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,026
You are my students.
I am your teacher.

1314
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,832
I think that's a sacred trust.

1315
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,963
So what do I say to you now?

1316
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,065
Quit because the Dean says so?

1317
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,076
Because the sheriff says so?

1318
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,170
Because the Texas Rangers say so?

1319
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,544
No.

1320
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,583
I am diametrically opposed to that.

1321
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,016
My message to you is to never quit.

1322
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,747
We are not quitting.

1323
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:46,845
Good.

1324
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,446
What do you want us to do?

1325
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,513
Debate Harvard.

1326
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,058
- Harvard?
- Harvard University.

1327
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,390
They're the reigning
national champions.

1328
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,363
If we defeat them, we defeat the best.

1329
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,366
Mr. Tolson, sir, with all due respect,

1330
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,196
um, Harvard ain't going to debate us,

1331
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,836
not little old Wiley College
in Marshall, Texas.

1332
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,337
They know who we are, Henry.

1333
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,566
I've been writing them letters,
sending them articles.

1334
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,472
But how do we get a letter back?

1335
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,510
By continuing to win.

1336
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:09,703
Dr. Farmer has informed me

1337
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,941
that Howard University is going to be
at Prairie View next week.

1338
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,539
We annihilated Fisk.

1339
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,244
If we eliminate Howard,
we will have beaten

1340
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,253
the two best Negro colleges in America,

1341
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,653
and I can guarantee you
that I will see to it

1342
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,247
that Harvard does not ignore that.

1343
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,690
All right?

1344
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,749
Yeah.

1345
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,591
# <i>You guys, scoodle um skoo</i> #

1349

[Tolson]
Just look for it on there.

1350
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,530
You see it on there?

1351
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,901
[Henry]
I've been looking the whole time.

1352
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,271
Prairie View, Texas. The 127.

1353
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,469
You show me where to look
because it's not on...

1354
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:43,977
127 near Waxahachie.

1355
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,274
It's not there.

1356
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,372
It's there. You just can't find it.

1357
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,212
I see 2, and I see 7.

1358
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:52,048
Right. Now look for a 1 in front of it,
and you got it.

1359
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,553
[Henry laughs]

1360
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:54,554
- After 126...
- Okay.

1361
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,217
Before 128.

1362
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,123
I really don't think...

1363
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,126
You don't see it.

1364
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,627
When did you get this map?

1365
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,594
What are you doing?

1366
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,264
I'm gonna cut him down.

1367
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,171
Get back in the car. Shut the door.

1368
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,205
Nobody move.

1369
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:55,941
Just get down.

Get down, get down.

1371
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,950
Get down, too. You get down, too.

01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,578
Got him, Mr. Tolson.

1411

# They come from Shevelstown #

1412
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,157
Shh!

# Devil knocked my daddy down #

1417
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,007
Okay. Just sit... sit...

1418
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,702
Not in that bed, though. Get up.

1419
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,640

1420
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,375

1421

You're worthless.

1427
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:03,323
What?

1428
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,128
You think you're the only one hurting?

1429
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,237
Um...

1430
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,363
[sigh]

1431
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,432
Okay, I'm sorry... for everything.

1432
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:20,277
For, uh, for drinkin', yeah,

1433
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,543
I apologize.

1434
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,085
I'm not talking about me.

1435
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,103
You're right.

1436
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,298
I'm gonna go talk to her.

1437
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:47,998
No, no, you won't, Lowe.

1438
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,043
She doesn't need
to see you like this, okay?

1439
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,544
I'm just going to talk to her.

1440
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:52,875
Leave me alone.

1441
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:53,937
Lowe!

1442
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,722
Calm down, boy!

1443
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,314
Stop! Stop!

1444
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,449
I'm not playing with you.

1445
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,086
Calm... Calm down!

1446
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,755
You crazy?

1447
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,893
You're never gonna forget what you saw
out there, do you understand?

1448
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,698
You're never gonna forget
what you saw out there.

1449
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,739
Hanging's the easiest
part of it sometimes.

1450
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,536
Sometimes they cut
the little fingers off,

1451
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,099
your toes, your nose, your ears.

1452
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,041
Sometimes they cut
your privates off.

1453
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,478
Sometimes they skin you alive.

1454
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:32,317
You'll never be able to forget.

1455

1456
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:48,463
What do you think he did?

1457
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,663
He didn't have to do nothing, James!

1458
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,103
He didn't have to do nothing!

1459
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,641
In Texas they lynch Negroes!

1460
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,973
Do you understand?

1461
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,377
So it doesn't matter
how good we are, does it?

1462
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,312
What are you talk... What?

1463
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,440
This is all useless.

1464
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,452
What are you talking about?

1465
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,217
I mean we're just a bunch of Negroes

1466
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,281
debating each other
on subjects we all agree on.

1467
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,259
Now, James, don't talk like that, all right?

1468
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,125
- Why not?
- Because you can't!

1469
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:18,457
Not you.

[Liquid gurgles]

1471
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:05,505
Bye! God bless you!

1472
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,581
Where's Samantha?

1473
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,142
She's not going with us.

1474
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,187
Why not?

1475
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,722
Why do you think?

1476
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,849
I took her to the bus station.

1477
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,791
She wanted to go back to school.

1478
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,463
You wanted your chance.

1479
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,366
This is it.

1480
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,295
[Applause]

1481
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,806
[Student]
But how can any Negro

1482
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,605
defend the punishment of prison

1483
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:40,478
when he's seen so much oppression
in his own life?

1484
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:41,981
[Man]
Yeah!

1485
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,745
How?

1486
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:48,255
Because crime itself
is a form of oppression,

1487
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:52,157
and Negroes fall victim
to more violent crime

1488
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,253
than any other race in America.

1489
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,992

For us,

1491
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:04,003
prison not only offers protection,
but retribution.

1492
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,196
[Audience member]
Yes, indeed!

1493
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:10,177
And for the criminal, it is a dark gift:

1494
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:14,375
The hardship that introduces
a man to himself,

1495
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:17,714
that rouses his passion
for freedom...

1496
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:18,775

Yes, sir!

Go on and open it and read it.

- Looks like somebody opened it already.
- Not me.

1518

You didn't open it already?

No.

Yes, it was, Mr. Lowe, for all of us.

No, sir. She did not walk out on us.

1767
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:27,638
You serious?

1768
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:30,134
You're crazy.

1769
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,371
At 14, you're just as good as me.

1770
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:33,811
The judges will love you.

1771
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,075
No. No. You can't quit.

1772
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,174
I'm not quitting, Samantha.

1773
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:42,785
Tolson made me captain,
and he said you were ready.

1774
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:44,721
Yeah, but you saw me at Howard.

1775
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:45,985
I was horrible.

1776
01:42:46,059 --> 01:42:47,583
That's right. You did terrible, didn't you?

1777
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:48,958
Stunk up the whole joint, right?

1778
01:42:49,029 --> 01:42:50,758
So you should just quit, right?

1779
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,264
You should just give up.

1780
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:56,925
No.

1781
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:04,643
Who's the judge?

1782
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:07,278
What?

1783
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:09,441
Who's the judge?

1784
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,913
The judge is God.

1785
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:16,918
And why is he God?

1786
01:43:18,625 --> 01:43:23,460
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent.

1787
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:26,465
And who is your opponent?

1788
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:29,058
He doesn't exist.

1789
01:43:29,169 --> 01:43:31,933
Why doesn't he exist?

1790
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:34,530
[Both]
Because he is a mere a dissenting voice

1791
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:36,700
to the truth that I speak.

1792
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:40,674
That's right.

1793
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,738
Speak the truth.

1794
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:46,744
Direct from Harvard Memorial Hall

1795
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,685
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

1796
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:52,521
this is WNBC Radio,
bringing to you live

1797
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:54,254
tonight's history-making debate

1798
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:57,855
between little Wiley College
from Marshall, Texas,

1799
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:00,331
and the Harvard University Debate team,

1800
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:01,661
the first time ever

1801
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:04,100
a Negro college has faced
the national champions.

1802
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:05,229
Harvard's Dean of Students

1803
01:44:05,339 --> 01:44:07,204
is making his way to the podium now.

1804
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,641
The crowd, as if on cue, falls silent.

1805
01:44:10,978 --> 01:44:12,912
[Dean]
On this historic occasion,

1806
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,915
we welcome the distinguished team
from Wiley College,

1807
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:19,077
our illustrious judges, you the audience,

1808
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:22,644
and through the wonder
of radio, the nation.

1809
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:26,989
Harvard University celebrates
its 300th anniversary this year,

1810
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:31,690
and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
its fifth President of the United States.

1811
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:35,701
<i>But no university, no matter how grand</i>
<i>or august in its history,</i>

1812
01:44:35,802 --> 01:44:38,327
<i>can afford to live in the past.</i>

1813
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:42,204
<i>So, in the spirit of tomorrow,</i>

1814
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,211
<i>I introduce to you today:</i>

1815
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:48,414
The debaters from Wiley College:

1816
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:49,847
Miss Samantha Booke,

1817
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:51,907
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

1818
01:44:51,985 --> 01:44:53,247
<i>[Applause]</i>

1819
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,844
What?

1820
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:07,065
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.

1821
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:28,550
Resolved:

1822
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:32,080
Civil disobedience is a moral weapon

1823
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,094
in the fight for justice.

1824
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:38,290
But how can disobedience
ever be moral?

1825
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:39,730
Well, I guess that depends

1826
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,633
on one's definition of the words.

1827
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:43,725
Word.

1828
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:48,606
In 1919, in India,

1829
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:53,339
10,000 people gathered in Amritsar
to protest the tyranny of British rule.

1830
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:54,471
Has it started?

1831
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:55,606
- Shh!
- Your brother's talking.

1832
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:56,910
Just sit down.

1833
01:45:56,983 --> 01:46:00,146
General Reginald Dyer
trapped them in a courtyard

1834
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:05,247
and ordered his troops
to fire into the crowd for ten minutes.

1835
01:46:05,325 --> 01:46:07,350
379 died...

1836
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:12,525
men, women, children...

1837
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:14,295
Shot down in cold blood.

1838
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:18,838
Dyer said he had
taught them a moral lesson.

1839
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:22,739
Gandhi and his followers responded
not with violence

1840
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:27,109
but with an organized
campaign of non-cooperation.

1841
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,842
Government buildings were occupied.

1842
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:32,544
<i>Streets were blocked</i>
<i>with people who refused to rise,</i>

1843
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:35,520
<i>even when beaten by police.</i>

1844
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:37,989
Gandhi was arrested,

1845
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:41,357
but the British were soon
forced to release him.

1846
01:46:41,428 --> 01:46:45,558
He called it a moral victory.

1847
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,964
The definition of moral:

1848
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:52,471
Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory?

1849
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,006
You choose.

1850
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,339
<i>[Applause]</i>

1851
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:14,955
From 1914 to 1918,

1852
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:20,227
for every single minute
the world was at war,

1853
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:24,293
four men laid down their lives.

1854
01:47:24,404 --> 01:47:26,838
Just think of it.

1855
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:32,140
240 brave young men
were hurled into eternity

1856
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:35,613
every hour of every day, of every night,

1857
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:38,378
for four long years.

1858
01:47:40,353 --> 01:47:43,789
35,000 hours.

1859
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:50,262
8,281,000 casualties.

1860
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:54,030
240.

1861
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:57,362
240.

1862
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:01,908
240.

1863
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:03,508
Here was a slaughter

1864
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:07,809
immeasurably greater than
what happened at Amritsar.

1865
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:11,340
Can there be anything moral about it?

1866
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,118
Nothing...

1867
01:48:14,187 --> 01:48:16,018
except that it stopped Germany

1868
01:48:16,089 --> 01:48:17,989
from enslaving all of Europe.

1869
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:22,927
Civil disobedience isn't moral
because it's non-violent.

1870
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:25,965
Fighting for your country with violence

1871
01:48:26,032 --> 01:48:28,500
can be deeply moral,

1872
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:33,767
demanding the greatest
sacrifice of all:

1873
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,172
Life itself.

1874
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:39,679
Non-violence is the mask
civil disobedience wears

1875
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:43,306
to conceal its true face...

1876
01:48:43,383 --> 01:48:45,874
anarchy.

1877
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:00,094
Gandhi believes one must always act

1878
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:03,065
with love and respect
for one's opponents,

1879
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:05,694
even if they are Harvard debaters.

1880
01:49:05,805 --> 01:49:07,272
[Laughter]

1881
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:11,243
Gandhi also believes
that lawbreakers must accept

1882
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:14,576
the legal consequences for their actions.

1883
01:49:14,648 --> 01:49:16,775
Does that sound like anarchy?

1884
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:22,117
Civil disobedience is not something
for us to fear.

1885
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:25,214
It is, after all, an American concept.

1886
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:27,624
You see, Gandhi draws his inspiration

1887
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:29,491
not from a Hindu scripture,

1888
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,554
but from Henry David Thoreau,

1889
01:49:31,631 --> 01:49:34,156
who I believe graduated from Harvard

1890
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:44,511
<i>and lived by a pond</i>
<i>not too far from here.</i>

1891
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:47,708
My opponent is right about one thing.

1892
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:50,306
Thoreau was a Harvard grad,

1893
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:55,116
and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous.

1894
01:49:55,188 --> 01:49:57,554
[Laughter]

1895
01:49:57,624 --> 01:50:02,823
He once said, "Any man
more right than his neighbors

1896
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:06,593
constitutes a majority of one."

1897
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:10,364
Thoreau the idealist could never know

1898
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:14,497
that Adolf Hitler
would agree with his words.

1899
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:19,739
The beauty and the burden
of democracy is this:

1900
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:25,183
No idea prevails without
the support of the majority.

1901
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:28,084
The people decide
the moral issues of the day,

1902
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:30,520
not a majority of one.

1903
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:35,050
Majorities do not decide
what is right or wrong.

1904
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,096
Your conscience does.

1905
01:50:37,163 --> 01:50:39,825
So why should a citizen

1906
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:42,390
surrender his or her conscience

1907
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:43,833
to a legislator?

1908
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:48,101
No, we must never, ever kneel down

1909
01:50:48,174 --> 01:50:51,075
before the tyranny of a majority.

1910
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:53,840
[Applause]

1911
01:50:56,016 --> 01:50:57,881
<i>[Applause]</i>

1912
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:03,046
We can't decide which laws
to obey and which to ignore.

1913
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:05,714
If we could...

1914
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:07,419
I'd never stop for a red light.

1915
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,257
[Laughter]

1916
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:11,320
My father is one of those men

1917
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:15,129
that stands between us and chaos:

1918
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:17,703
A police officer.

1919
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:23,743
I remember the day
his partner, his best friend,

1920
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:26,472
was gunned down in the line of duty.

1921
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:31,245
Most vividly of all,

1922
01:51:31,317 --> 01:51:34,809
I remember the expression
on my dad's face.

1923
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:42,828
Nothing that erodes
the rule of law can be moral,

1924
01:51:42,896 --> 01:51:47,424
no matter what name we give it.

1925
01:51:49,936 --> 01:51:51,699
Bravo!

1926
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:36,975
Why doesn't he say something?

1927
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:38,278
Shh!

1928
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:58,395
In Texas...

1929
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:00,370
they lynch Negroes.

1930
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,744
<i>My teammates and I

1931
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:09,077
saw a man strung up by his neck

1932
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:10,673
and set on fire.

1933
01:53:13,153 --> 01:53:17,214
We drove through a lynch mob,

1934
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:20,691
pressed our faces
against the floorboard.

1935
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:26,856
I looked at my teammates.

1936
01:53:26,933 --> 01:53:29,959
I saw the fear in their eyes...

1937
01:53:32,372 --> 01:53:35,341
and worse...

1938
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:36,703
the shame.

1939
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:42,540
What was this Negro's crime

1940
01:53:42,615 --> 01:53:45,049
that he should be hung, without trial,

1941
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:47,678
in a dark forest filled with fog?

1942
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,747
Was he a thief?

1943
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:54,953
Was he a killer?

1944
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:56,552
Or just a Negro?

1945
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:01,460
Was he a sharecropper?

1946
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:03,761
<i>A preacher?</i>

1947
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:06,896
<i>Were his children waiting up for him?</i>

1948
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:13,038
And who are we to just
lie there and do nothing?

1949
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:20,914
No matter what he did,
the mob was the criminal.

1950
01:54:20,987 --> 01:54:24,286
But the law did nothing,

1951
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:27,690
just left us wondering why.

1952
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:35,798
My opponent says

1953
01:54:35,902 --> 01:54:40,066
nothing that erodes the rule
of law can be moral.

1954
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:43,006
But there is no rule of law
in the Jim Crow South,

1955
01:54:43,076 --> 01:54:45,544
not when Negroes are denied housing,

1956
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:48,170
turned away from schools, hospitals,

1957
01:54:48,248 --> 01:54:50,478
and not when we are lynched.

1958
01:54:55,021 --> 01:54:56,420
St. Augustine said,

1959
01:54:56,489 --> 01:55:01,017
<i>"An unjust law is no law at all,"</i>

1960
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,991
which means I have a right,

1961
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:05,724
even a duty, to resist...

1962
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:12,766
with violence or civil disobedience.

1963
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:19,668
You should pray I choose the latter.

1964
01:55:33,059 --> 01:55:35,152
Bravo!

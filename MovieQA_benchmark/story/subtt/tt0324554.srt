1
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,760
Magnificent, aren't they?

2
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,560
God's tears.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Yeah.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
It's beautiful.

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,599
So are the others.
I, uh...

6
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,959
I guess I just...
have to make the right decision.

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,840
In the end, it's not your eye
that must decide.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
Yeah.

9
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,560
Did Rebecca call?

10
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,879
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant
in an hour to take you to the airport.

11
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,439
I put your tickets, passport, and
your new cell phone in your briefcase

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,159
and Hong will be there
in ten minutes.

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Thanks. See you in four days.

14
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,479
The second you land,

15
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,719
those guys are gonna start poking
and prodding to see what you're made of.

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Are you sure I'm the right guy
for this, Walter?

17
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm no good at this corporate stuff,
I hate flying--

18
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,840
and isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?

19
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,280
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.

20
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,000
Just don't eat anything
that wears a collar,

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,800
and if you need me, I'll be on the beach
in Cozumel screening my calls.

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Look...this is a big break for you.

23
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,759
But I'm giving you this account because
I think you're the right man for the job.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,159
Besides, you're gonna be a member
of the family soon, right?

25
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,719
Going down, please.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,639
Oh. Matthew, keep away
from the bang-bang girls

27
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,560
or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?

28
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,240
Matty.

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,759
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man.

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,960
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

31
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,039
Really good. Really good.
Good to see you. You look great.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,759
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,000
You still doing that whole
advertising thing in New York?

34
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,800
I moved back.

35
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,080
- When did you get back?
- Two months ago.

36
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,800
Two months? What are you doing?

37
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,240
You don't call your friend?
You could've called me.

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
I know. I just--I moved back
with a girl that I met in New York

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,439
and I'm working for her brother,
and it's...

40
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,280
That sounds serious.

41
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,919
Maybe. I don't know.
We'll see.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,319
You look very serious.
Look at you.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,719
I know, man.

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Hold on!

45
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,120
Listen, man,
I gotta go to a meeting.

46
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,360
Yeah, I need to probably
move my car, too.

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
And then I'm going to China tonight.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,199
- China? That's weird.
- Yeah, I know.

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Let me give you a call
when I get back. Monday?

50
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, sounds good--shut up!

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,159
All right, look, here's my card.
Don't wait two years--call me!

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
The old shop.

53
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,840
- All right?
- I will, man.

54
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
You look good.
That's a nice tie.

55
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,520
Good to see you.

56
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,879
Are you done? Come on!

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,480
He's very impressed
with what you've done,

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,040
and he assures you
that when you get to China,

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,399
you'll be met with much enthusiasm
and support.

60
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,439
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,920
Some champagne, please.
Excuse me.

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,839
Excuse you.

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Matthew is a, uh, photographer.
Beautifully, wonderfully creative man.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
And here's my favorite sister.

65
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,360
His only sister.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Mr. Hong, Ms. Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

67
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,879
Hey, Sweetie. How are you?

68
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,120
As you can see,

69
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,160
Matthew has managed to make himself
indispensable even away from the office.

70
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,560
Here, Sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

71
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,120
Mr. Hong would like
to propose a toast.

72
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,360
Oh, yes.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,839
To a long and prosperous marriage...

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
of our two companies.

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,839
Are you okay?

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,519
Yeah.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,120
Um, excuse me.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

78
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,360
I'll be right back.

79
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,120
Excuse me,
can I have the check, please.

80
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,560
Just a minute!

81
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,120
Sorry.

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,480
No, you listen!
And I don't feel like calming down.

83
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,519
It's over, okay?
That's why I wanted to meet.

84
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,879
No, actually I don't think
it was an accident.

85
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,560
It's in the paper!

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,519
I don't ever want
to see you again, Daniel.

87
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,800
Stop following me,
or I'll call the police!

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
Lisa.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
Lisa!

90
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,439
Whoa. Hey, come on.

91
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,240
Are you all right?

92
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,199
I pissed her off.

93
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
You wanna put that
on this card, please?

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,199
Oh! This stupid...

95
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
Need some help there, Mare?

96
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
- What's up?
- It's so frustrating.

97
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,399
I just can't work out
why there's no sound.

98
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
I just...

99
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,560
Matthew? Hello?

100
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,160
Anybody home?

101
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,800
I'll take this one, if you want.

102
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,440
Knock yourself out, kid.

103
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,639
Oh, my God.

104
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,519
Shit.

105
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,279
- They wanna know how long--hey!
- Mary, I'll be right back.

106
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,679
- Sorry.
- Where are you going?!

107
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,840
Oh, sorry!

108
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lisa.

109
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,840
See you inside.

110
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Hey.

111
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,639
Hey.

112
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,799
- Probably time to go, right?
- Yes.

113
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,039
Okay.

114
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,240
Pre-boarding call
for flight 752 to Munich.

115
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,679
All passengers should board
at this time at gate 5-A

116
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,360
I guess, uh, this is it.

117
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,600
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

118
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,919
No. No, I'm fine.

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,639
Okay. Well,
call me when you get there.

120
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay. I will.

121
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,440
I love you.

122
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,440
Me, too.

123
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,000
Bye.

124
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,120
Bye.

125
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
Your attention. please.

126
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,000
This is the final boarding call
for American Airlines flight 153

127
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
service to Shanghai.

128
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,360
All passengers should now
be boarding at gate 1 0-B.

129
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,559
Matthew Simon.
S-l-M-O-N.

130
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,840
Shit.

131
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,039
Yeah.

132
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Yeah. No, he's not on the plane.

133
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,080
He's...

134
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,399
He's sick.

135
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,600
No, he's very sick.
He has food poisoning.

136
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,919
No, he'll be there
in the next couple of days.

137
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,759
Lisa?

138
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
All right.

139
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,559
Hello?

140
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,799
Lisa?

141
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,480
Here. sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

142
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,200
That line--what it does to your calf--
that is what we call sexy.

143
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,879
Wanna try pink? Hmm?

144
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,840
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a seat.

145
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,240
Hey. There you are.
Where you been?

146
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,519
You look like shit.
I hope she was worth it.

147
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,639
Hey, do we have
a size ten in pink?

148
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Yeah, in the back.

149
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,559
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hey.

150
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,279
- I gotta talk to you.
- Lady Dragon Shoes.

151
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Ow. So, who is she?

152
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,679
You wouldn't believe me.

153
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,080
Betcha I do. I probably even know her.
What's her name?

154
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,559
That's the thing.

155
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,519
You don't know her name?
Oh, man.

156
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
I know that she's a dancer.

157
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,159
You mean, like a stripper?

158
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,039
No, shithead.
Like a real dancer.

159
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh, God.
I love a dancer's body. Ooh.

160
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,440
But her face is like...

161
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,960
Her eyes...

162
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
...and her...skin is just...

163
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,039
She just makes me all...

164
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
What is "wha" and "duh"? She just
makes you more inarticulate than usual.

165
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,120
You are obsessed,
which I don't understand.

166
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I mean, I don't know how
you decide on just one.

167
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,240
I mean, my customer over there--
she's got great legs. Ellie.

168
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,159
All right? There is
something hot about Ellie.

169
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,720
The blonde at the window.

170
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,279
I mean, come on.

171
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,440
What are you doing?

172
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,879
Matty, are you all right?

173
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,240
Lady Dragon Shoes.
Can I help you?

174
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,119
The blonde?

175
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,039
What are you doing?

176
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,279
Give me some shoes.

177
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,599
- Shoes?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,960
Got lots of shoes.

179
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm sorry I took so long.
Pink. It's my last pair.

180
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,279
Could I help you with anything?

181
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,839
Yes.

182
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,319
Those shoes in the window.

183
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
The black ones
with the red sole.

184
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,799
I'd like to try them on, please.

185
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,680
The blacks and reds. Okay.

186
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,319
I'll just go in the back
and get them for you.

187
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,839
That's where we keep them--
in the back--so...

188
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,119
I'll be right back.

189
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,440
Uh, Matty?

190
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,920
Maybe you'd like to ask the lady
what size shoe she wears.

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,359
- Right.
- 8 1/2.

192
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
Like Fellini.

193
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,799
Right.

194
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,319
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.
I don't know his shoe size, obviously.

195
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,519
8 1/2.

196
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,680
Shit.

197
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,000
What was that?

198
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,680
Fellini! What the hell
was I thinking?

199
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,359
I have no idea.

200
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,519
But you were right about one thing.
God, she's beautiful.

201
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,599
And you, my man,
are an idiot.

202
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,000
All right, look.
Here's the thing, all right?

203
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,400
You've obviously blown it,
she obviously hates you,

204
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,640
so you stay right here
and let the man take a shot.

205
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,160
- Shut up. Give me the shoes.
- All right. Go.

206
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,079
Just remember--
you're not funny.

207
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,319
Here we go.
Black and red.

208
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,880
What do you think?

209
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,160
They're too big.

210
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
Too big? Really?

211
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,279
Luke, these are 9 1/2s.

212
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,559
I'm sorry.
That's the smallest size we have.

213
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,119
Oh, well. Too bad.

214
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
Not--you know...
not necessarily.

215
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
We can order these for you.

216
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,240
Special order. And, uh--
I can, uh, if you leave your number,

217
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,519
I can give you a call personally
when they come in.

218
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,640
Do you normally spy on people?

219
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,880
What?

220
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,920
Are you really gonna tell me that
you're a huge fan of modern dance?

221
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,680
Look, I've never done
anything like that before.

222
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,599
Honestly--could you let me take you out
for a cup of coffee and explain?

223
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,200
I don't think so.

224
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,559
I'll stay on my side of the table.
I promise.

225
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,799
Just call me
when the shoes come in, okay?

226
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,759
Listen, I'm not
what you think I am, okay?

227
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,759
Shit.

228
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,279
"Tomorrow night. 6:00.
Café Tangiers on Kinzie.

229
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,359
Now you won't have to follow me. "

230
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,319
Well, my parents eventually split up,
and my mom moved back to Prague.

231
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,599
But my dad's still here.
He lives in California.

232
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
I wish I was in California right now.

233
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,160
So, why did you want
to become a photographer?

234
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,720
Fish.

235
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,160
Fish.

236
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,039
Tropical fish, actually.

237
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,559
When I was a kid, I used to go
to the library and pick out all the books...

238
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,119
...with tropical fish, you know.

239
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,920
Beautiful colors and shapes.

240
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,680
When I was eight years old, I realized
someone had to take pictures of the fish.

241
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,480
And I wanted that to be me.

242
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,079
But I grew up and I realized that...

243
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
things don't have to be extraordinary
to be beautiful.

244
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
The ordinary
could be just as beautiful.

245
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,559
Like what?

246
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,160
Well...

247
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,680
Like--you see the couple there?

248
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,640
Look at the way the girl
is holding on to him so tight.

249
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,960
But he can still drink his coffee.

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,880
It looks like she feels safe
wrapped around him.

251
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,440
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another one.

252
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,559
Take my picture.

253
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,920
I feel beautiful tonight.

254
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,519
Bye.

255
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,319
Bye.

256
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,319
Okay.

257
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,599
Ma'am?

259
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,319
I have your dry cleaning.

260
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,400
Shit.

261
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,799
Hey, you're not in China.

262
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,599
I didn't make it past O'Hare.

263
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,359
- What happened?
- I found Lisa.

264
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,000
Whoa.

265
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,200
Here it is.

266
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,079
This is the article she left behind.

267
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
The funeral's today.

268
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,039
I can't believe you're
blowing off Shanghai for this.

269
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,440
This isn't actually Lisa.
This is a compact.

270
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,720
What about your woman?
What's her name, anyway?

271
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,920
Rebecca.

272
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Yeah, I mean, isn't--
Matt. Matt!

273
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,559
Shit.

274
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
Is it broke?

275
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,920
You superstitious?

276
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,039
God, I am so stupid.
Here, give it to me--

277
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,119
- No, no. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,839
You're right.
This doesn't make any sense.

279
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,599
One minute I'm looking at rings,
and the next I'm here, doing this.

280
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,480
Whoa.
Whoa, looking at rings?

281
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,920
I didn't realize you were that serious.

282
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,359
Apparently, I'm not.

283
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
See, that's how the universe works.

284
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,119
The minute you make a decision--
you decide on anything--

285
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,440
along comes temptation.

286
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,720
What would you do?

287
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,200
Keep them both and hope they didn't find
out about each other is what I would do.

288
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,599
That's perfect.
Asshole.

289
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,039
I have to find out why she left.

290
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,920
She got scared.
Everyone gets scared.

291
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,599
No, not Lisa. She wouldn't have left
without an explanation.

292
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,319
Without some sort of letter
or a call or something.

293
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,319
She's not like that.

294
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,880
Something must've happened,
and whatever it was--

295
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,319
Screwed you up big time.

296
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,720
I know she loved me.

297
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
So let me borrow
your keys, okay?

298
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,480
Why?

299
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,079
The funeral's today.
It's the only lead I've got.

300
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,079
Oh...my car.

301
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,119
- Come on.
- Okay. I know. I'm sorry.

302
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
You just have to be back by 7:00.

303
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,599
I will. Thank you.

304
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
I've got a date.

305
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,720
You got a date?

306
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah, I got a date.

307
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,920
With who?

308
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,519
This actress that came into my shop
a couple weeks ago, and, uh...

309
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,359
God, I like her a lot,
so please do not be late with my car.

310
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,519
I won't be. 6:00.
I'll be back by 6:00, okay?

311
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,319
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

312
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,960
I have your powder case.
Call me at--"

313
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,839
Excuse me?

314
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,839
What can I do for you?

315
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,519
I found a hotel key
in the back yesterday.

316
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,640
A woman left it.
I don't know if you saw her.

317
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,680
She fell right over there.
Broke her heel.

318
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,759
Yesterday?
Yeah, that's right. I remember.

319
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,880
You wanted to leave
the keys with me?

320
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,880
No. Actually, l, uh...

321
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,279
could you give her this note
if she comes back in here?

322
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,960
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

323
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,079
Sure.

324
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,039
Lisa!

325
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,960
Lisa!

326
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,519
"Lisa. I returned your key
as you asked.

327
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,079
"You must let me see you
if only for one last time.

328
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,680
"Call me.
My heart can't stand it.

329
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,759
All my love. Daniel. "

330
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,279
Shit.

331
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,400
- Ass.
- I'm so sorry.

332
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
- Hey, I could explain.
- You are an asshole.

333
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,880
Do me a favor--
don't ask me for any more favors.

334
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,599
Come on.
Luke...

335
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,599
I found her. I think I found her.
I found her apartment, anyway.

336
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,319
I'm really happy for you, Matty.

337
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,359
I left a note under her door
to meet me at the park tomorrow.

338
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,720
Guess you guys
should have a picnic.

339
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,839
Jesus, man.
I said I was sorry.

340
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,359
My entire evening is screwed.

341
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,480
Look, I'm not really
that late, brother.

342
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,519
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me.
I've already left three messages.

343
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,920
Well, why didn't you take a cab?

344
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,799
'Cause I was waiting for you.
I was waiting for my car.

345
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,319
Luke, it's not that late.
You can still drive over there.

346
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,640
Go over there? And do what?
Throw little pebbles up at her window?

347
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,039
She's gone. It's over.
Just forget it.

348
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,159
Maybe not.

349
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,239
I hope, for our friendship,
this is who I want it to be.

350
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,440
Want to see how cool I am?
Three rings.

351
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,519
Hello?

352
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,519
Hey, how's it goin'?

353
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,280
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did you get my messages?

354
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,000
No, I lent my car to my buddy Matt,
and he was a little late coming home.

355
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,159
No, sure. He's right here.
Hold on a sec.

356
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,559
She wants to talk to you.

357
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,920
Fix it.
You have to fix it.

358
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,719
Hello?

359
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,559
He's full of shit. isn't he?

360
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,679
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.

361
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,079
Yeah. I knew it.

362
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,159
He didn't lend me his car. I took it.

363
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,519
I stole his keys.

364
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,119
That's good.

365
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,679
Why would you do that?

366
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Because I'm a selfish idiot.

367
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,039
And I had this whole thing
going on that...

368
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,800
I don't wanna bore you with it.

369
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,920
Please. I insist.

370
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,639
Okay.

371
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,719
Well, um...

372
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,840
I was looking for somebody.
A woman.

373
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,079
I wasn't thinking.

374
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,960
Got a little desperate.

375
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,880
Oh. I'm sorry.

376
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,119
No.

377
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,119
I should be apologizing to you.

378
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:41,840
And I am apologizing to you.
I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.

379
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,960
Did you find her?

380
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,360
I think so. Yeah.
I found where she lives.

381
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,760
Well. you should go back.
and you should look for her.

382
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,840
I think I will. Thanks.

383
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,599
You're boring now.
Give me the phone.

384
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,320
- Okay, Alex. I gotta go.
- Nice to talk to you.

385
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,239
Nice to talk to you, too.
Bye-bye.

386
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,079
She's nice, man.

387
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,239
Thanks.

388
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,119
Hello?

389
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,440
Okay. Why don't I just--
I'll pick you up at the theater.

390
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,360
I think not so, my lord.

391
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Dear lad, believe it,

392
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,000
for they shall yet belie thy happy years
to say thou art a man.

393
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,239
Prosper well in this,

394
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,920
and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
to call his fortunes thine.

395
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,400
I'll do my best to woo your lady...

396
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,880
...and yet a barful strife.

397
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,679
Whoe'er I woo,
myself would be his wife.

398
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,000
Alex, what's going on?

399
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,239
What do you mean?

400
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,800
Well, I'm sitting in the audience
and I'm getting nothing.

401
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,639
I figured maybe I'm missing something,
so I come, I take a closer look.

402
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,840
But you know what?
I'm still not buying it.

403
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,000
What the hell's
the matter with you today?

404
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,119
Look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo,
myself would be his wife"

405
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,039
defines your character.

406
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,519
You're in love with this guy,

407
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,239
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

408
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,400
You're upset, you're confused,
it's tearing you up inside!

409
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,480
We've gotta see the love,
but we've also gotta see the agony.

410
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,239
You have been in love before,
haven't you?

411
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,960
Yes. Sure.

412
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,800
Oh, good. Well, please,
share a little something with us, huh?

413
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,039
God. you sound so close.
Can't believe you're 7.000 miles away.

414
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,679
I know.
It's crazy, isn't it?

415
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,519
How's the weather?

416
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,599
I don't know.
It's still dark out.

417
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,000
Isn't it. Iike.
10: 00 in the morning there?

418
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,199
I--you know what?

419
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,079
I'm so zonked, I didn't
even open the blinds yet, and, uh...

420
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,559
you know what--it's actually a really
nice day out, now that I see it.

421
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,440
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

422
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,679
No. I'm just a little out of it,
that's all.

423
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,360
Well. you better get in it. because
today's meeting is very important.

424
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,079
You'll be fine. honey.
I'll speak to you later. okay?

425
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,000
I miss you.
Bye.

426
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,400
Bye.

427
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,800
"Lisa. I found your powder case.

428
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,199
"I have to see you.

429
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,519
"Meet me tomorrow at 3 : 00.
our usual spot.

430
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,599
Matt. "

431
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,199
Hello?

432
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,960
Lisa?

433
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,280
Fuck.

434
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,079
Lisa?

435
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,400
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry. It's okay.

436
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,280
I'm calling the police!
Where's the phone?

437
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,800
No! Don't call the police!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

438
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,360
- Get away from me!
- Okay! Okay! Calm down!

439
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,320
Calm down. It's okay.

440
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,880
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

441
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,000
A friend of Lisa's?

442
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,239
Yeah.

443
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,960
Is that supposed to be funny?

444
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:03,679
No. You can ask her
when she comes, okay?

445
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,679
I'm Lisa.
I live here.

446
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,079
Your name's Lisa?

447
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,239
Yeah.

448
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,440
And you live here?

449
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:17,840
Yeah.

450
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,800
No...

451
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,559
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, wait. Don't.

452
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,880
Hey, you see that letter there?

453
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,000
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

454
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

455
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Yeah...I was.

456
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,519
And you had a room at The Drake,
room 679?

457
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,679
Yeah.

458
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,079
How'd you know that?

459
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,000
I can't believe I did this.

460
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,960
I'm going crazy. Here.

461
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,559
That's yours.

462
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,960
It's broken.

463
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,559
I'd be happy to pay for it.
You know, my bad luck.

464
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,199
Wait.

465
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,639
Your hand.

466
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,719
It's bleeding.

467
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,679
It's all right.

468
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,559
I got this.

469
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,960
No, l...
I'll fix it. I'm a nurse.

470
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,960
Okay.

471
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,719
Thank you.

472
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,920
You know, at the restaurant,

473
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,480
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

474
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,840
But now seeing you here, you don't
really look that much like her at all.

475
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:49,239
Must be hallucinating.

476
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,480
I was crazy about her.

477
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,239
So, what about the, uh...
what's-his-name in the Cadillac?

478
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,320
- Daniel.
- Yeah. What's his story?

479
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:11,519
He's been stalking me.

480
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,440
He scares the hell out of me.

481
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,840
That's why I was staying in the hotel--
because I didn't want him to find me.

482
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,960
I hope he didn't follow you here.

483
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,800
I don't think so. No.

484
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,519
How's your hand?

485
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,000
It's okay.

486
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,320
I wasn't even hungry or anything.

487
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:35,840
Actually, you know what?

488
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,199
Thank you for everything.

489
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,159
For the bandage...

490
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,719
...not calling the cops...

491
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,800
...not beating me to death
with the little bronze ballerina, or...

492
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,880
You're leaving?

493
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,039
Yeah.

494
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,079
I'm late, you know.

495
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,440
Very late, actually, for China, so...

496
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,519
China. That's funny.

497
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,320
That's what my friend said, too.

498
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,880
Well, maybe you should wait.

499
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,079
I can't. I mean...
I gotta go.

500
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,000
Do you really think planes
are still taking off this late?

501
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,639
What are you doing?

502
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,039
I'm scared.

503
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,320
Of him.

504
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,280
I haven't stayed alone here
since his wife died, and...

505
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,199
Would you mind if you stayed?

506
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,360
Lisa, you don't even know me.
I broke into your apartment--

507
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,239
I know. I know. I know.

508
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,199
But--don't take this the wrong way,
but I just think you're a nice guy.

509
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:56,599
That's all.

510
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:05,599
Okay.

511
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:08,800
Good.

512
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,519
Where does a nice guy sleep?

513
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,920
A nice guy
sleeps on the couch.

514
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,360
What are you doing?

515
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:57,039
I'm watching you sleep.

516
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,480
Lisa!

517
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,079
Hey, how are you?

518
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,480
What are you doing here?

519
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:47,920
I gotta talk to you.

520
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,320
Now?

521
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,039
Yeah, it's kind of important.

522
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,719
Wanna go get a drink or something?
It's freezing out here.

523
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,599
- Okay.
- Okay? Come on.

524
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:04,880
My friend gave my stuff
to this head of the agency, and...

525
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,119
he liked it.

526
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,559
So...

527
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:09,679
he offered me a job in New York.

528
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,840
That's great.

529
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:16,559
It'll help me pay my rent, but...

530
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,480
But what? Why not?

531
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,000
Move in with me.

532
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,000
I--I know it's only been
a couple of months, but I just, um...

533
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,280
You're the reason
I don't wanna move to New York.

534
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,679
I wanna make my life
here with you.

535
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,960
Look, I'm really late for rehearsal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

536
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,000
Sure.

537
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,320
Matthew, trust me, okay?

538
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,880
Just meet me tomorrow
in the park. Same time.

539
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,559
Bye.

540
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,719
Have you seen Lisa?

541
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,039
Lisa?

542
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,119
She's gone on a European tour
of Cabaret.

543
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,119
It all happened real fast.

544
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,360
They came to our rehearsal and
just picked her out, and she was gone.

545
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,440
Like...did she say anything
before she left?

546
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,199
Like what?

547
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,400
Like, uh...

548
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:57,440
Cool. Thanks.

549
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,559
Okay.

550
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,159
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,880
You want a cup of coffee?

552
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,599
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

553
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:20,739
No.e

554
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:22,659
No.

555
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:27,460
No.

556
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,419
Yeah.

557
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,179
He broke all my cups.

558
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:44,539
That's original.a

559
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:49,939
Sugar?o

560
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,500
Thanks. Yeah.

561
00:53:58,939 --> 00:53:59,980
Thank you.

562
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:01,739
To us. 

563
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:28,019
Leaving?p

564
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,939
Yeah. I have to go to work.

565
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:33,619
I'm due at the hospital.

566
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:36,339
That's right.
You're a nurse.

567
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:38,139
I got a double shift.


568
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,819
You should stay.u

569
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:52,179
You have a key?t

570
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:53,299
Yeah.b

571
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,460
Well, I should be back by 10:00.

572
00:54:58,379 --> 00:54:59,980
Will I see you later?r

573
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:03,460
Maybe.,

574
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:05,619
Yeah.b

575
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:15,579
- Bye.
- Bye.c

576
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:29,699
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.i

577
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:33,739
Yeah. I was.

578
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:39,460
Hello?a

579
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:41,819
What happened to you?r

580
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:45,939
Hang on.
Just a minute!

581
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,139
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

582
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,019
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great. 

583
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,779
Well, I've gotta call Daniel first,
then I'll be right over.

584
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:55,179
- Okay.
- Bye.

585
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,500
Lisa!h

586
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,460
Oh, shit. Get up.

587
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:20,259
You know.
at the restaurant.o

588
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,819
I would've bet anything
you were this girI I used to know.

589
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:27,739
But now seeing you here. You don't
really look that much like her at all.

590
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,339
Hi.-

591
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,259
Come on, Lisa.
Let's just talk about this, all right?

592
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,979
Don't start shit like that.
Look, I don't have time...

593
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:34,739
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

594
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:37,420
Stop acting like a goddamn child
about this crap!

595
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,460
Stop screaming at me!

596
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,979
Lisa, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ. Be carefuI.

597
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:45,460
It's over. Get out of my house.

598
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:47,420
Stop! Enough!


599
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,339
Get back in here now!h

600
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,579
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Don't do it!

601
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:53,299
Lisa, stop this! 

602
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:56,659
Is this how you deal
with your problems?

603
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:59,059
Huh? You run away
and act like a child?r

604
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:02,139
Go home, and don't bother
calling me, okay?

605
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:03,259
Hi. 

606
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,859
- Goddamnit!
- Can I come in?

607
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:06,179
Of course.

608
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:10,420
I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but, um,

609
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,019
my... ex-boyfriend just told me
he's seeing someone else.

610
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:16,939
I took a chance.
I hope you don't mind.

611
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:18,460
No, not at all.h

612
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,579
Lisa, this is stupid, all right?
Come on!

613
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,219
Go home!s

614
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,899
Excuse me, are you leaving?
I'd like to park.

615
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:45,939
- Hey!
- Hey.p

616
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:54,059
I'm sorry I didn't call.
l, um...

617
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,979
Don't worry.
I've just been thinking.

618
00:59:58,139 --> 00:59:59,500
Are you okay? 

619
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:03,099
I'm going to London.

620
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:04,539
Why?

621
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,619
A friend of mine
started his own company.n

622
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:09,179
He's asked me to choreograph. 

623
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:12,259
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

624
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:13,979
When do you leave?

625
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:15,420
Tomorrow afternoon.g

626
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,420
Is it okay
if I stay another night?

627
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,619
Of course.

628
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,779
No, it has to be tonight.

629
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:23,659
Well, then I'd say
the 10:15 flight to Los Angeles

630
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:25,219
would be your best bet.

631
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:27,460
You can catch the flight
to Shanghai from there.

632
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,659
But there's only coach available;
your ticket's for first.

633
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:31,819
It's okay.

634
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:35,259
I'll tell you what.e

635
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:37,299
I think I can get you an upgrade..

636
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:40,059
Why don't you come back
in a few hours. Around 4:00.

637
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:42,500
Something should've
opened up by then.

638
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:43,619
Okay.


639
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:46,059
Thank you.
See you at 4:00.i

640
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:08,500
The hotel thing was just stupid.

641
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,859
I knew Daniel would find me.

642
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,219
So...n

643
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,899
Why don't you come with me?

644
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:26,779
Well, I've got great shifts
at the hospital now,

645
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:29,339
and, you know...c

646
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,059
And the guy who gave you that.

647
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:33,699
Yeah.e

648
01:01:36,979 --> 01:01:38,859
Well, come on. Tell me!.

649
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:44,819
Last night we did it
on the sofa in the doctor's lounge.

650
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:46,779
You little slut.
I'm jealous!

651
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:49,339
The bad part is
I'm already seeing his best friend.

652
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:51,699
Another surgeon.

653
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,579
He's adorable and he adores me,
but he's the clinging type.

654
01:01:56,899 --> 01:02:01,979
So she had the same name,
same perfume, same shoe size?

655
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:04,019
That's so hot.

656
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,899
Or... or maybe this is creepy.

657
01:02:06,979 --> 01:02:09,139
I think it's a little bit of both, actually.b

658
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:11,500
So, did you hit it??

659
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:16,979
No. Um... I slept on the couch,
you know.

660
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:18,899
When I woke up
in the morning, she was gone.

661
01:02:18,979 --> 01:02:20,899
- But you wanted to hit it, didn't you?
- Come on.

662
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:22,019
Come on.

663
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:25,739
I'm going to China tonight, I'm practically
engaged... do I need to remind you?

664
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:27,539
The lies we tell ourselves.

665
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:31,979
So, what about you and Alex...
how's that?

666
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:33,539
How was your date?7

667
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:37,259
- It was great.
- Good. 

668
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,379
I mean, what...
you wanna wanna hear about it?

669
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:41,500
I don't know. Sure.

670
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:47,420
Well. After I left you. I went
to pick up Alex from the theater. Right?

671
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,500
She has this director... the guy is
such a cheese ball. Not that impressive.

672
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:56,699
I mean. She should be on Broadway
or something. 'cause she was awesome.

673
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:59,500
It was super late
by the time she got changed.

674
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:27,379
So we went out.
had a couple drinks and a couple laughs.

675
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,139
On the way home. I told her the whole
sordid story about you and Lisa.

676
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:33,379
So now, finally, he's found her.

677
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:36,420
- Wow.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,339
And did she explain
why she disappeared?s

679
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,339
No, not yet.
He just wrote her this note.

680
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,579
They haven't actually spoken,
but they're supposed to speak soon.

681
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:54,899
You okay?-

682
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:02,059
No, I'm not. You know, I don't...
I don't feel very well.

683
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:04,739
You're kidding me.

684
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:06,659
No.n

685
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,579
Do you mind
just taking me home?

686
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:15,179
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

687
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,099
Thanks.


688
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:34,139
So, I was thinking,
maybe I could go upstairs with you

689
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:38,379
and I'll make you
a nice big cup of hot chocolate...

690
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:41,819
...put a bunch
of little marshmallows up on top.

691
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:44,219
We'll watch TV and just hang out.

692
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:46,739
Do you love me?

693
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,460
I just wanna be alone.e

694
01:04:52,899 --> 01:04:54,299
- Well...
- I'll call you.


695
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:55,819
I'll call you tomorrow.

696
01:04:56,899 --> 01:04:59,179
Alex.
Alex, wait a second.

697
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:00,699
You gotta be kidding me.

698
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:02,859
This girl's unbelievable.o

699
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:04,500
You know what?
Don't call me, okay?

700
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:07,379
Don't call me until you figure out
what you wanna do with your life,

701
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,859
'cause I can't deal with this.

702
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:11,579
Every time, it's a different story
with you, all right?

703
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,259
Wait, l... I'm sorry.

704
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:19,259
I'll call you tomorrow.

705
01:05:20,979 --> 01:05:22,139
God!r

706
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:28,659
This girl is ridiculous.

707
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:48,299
Taxi!r

708
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,219
And we had sex all night.

709
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,939
And the next morning.

710
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:07,979
I made her my dad's
world-famous breakfast, and...

711
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:09,699
I don't know.
It was pretty perfect.

712
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,179
That sounds really good, man.

713
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:14,420
It was pretty good.

714
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,819
When do I get to meet her?

715
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:19,059
Tonight.l

716
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:22,460
Yeah, tonight. Tonight is her...
she's got this play.n

717
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:25,019
It's the big opening.
It's Shakespeare.

718
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:26,859
Shakespeare.


719
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:30,019
Shakespeare. I know.
But it's supposed to be good. Trust me.

720
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:33,939
I'm supposed to leave tonight.l

721
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:35,179
Yeah, but it's early.

722
01:06:35,259 --> 01:06:37,179
You can go to the play,
then get on the plane.

723
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,339
Have you seen my compact?
You know, the silver one.

724
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:49,219
No, I haven't.

725
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:54,219
I hope I didn't leave it
at the hotel.

726
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:57,579
It was a gift from my grandmother.

727
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:06,379
Where did you get this?

728
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:11,500
Um... it's surgeon number two's.

729
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:13,379
He left it here last week.

730
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:17,019
Oh, my God.
It's so much like...

731
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,699
What?s

732
01:07:22,779 --> 01:07:24,099
Matthew.h

733
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:38,899
So you're not getting
into too much trouble?

734
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:41,379
Thanks.w

735
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,019
Take care of yourself, okay?

736
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,500
- Come on, let me film you.
- No. You first.

737
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:38,819
Come on, Alex. Are you shy? You can't
be shy if you wanna be an actress.

738
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:39,939
Here.h

739
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:42,739
- Shakespeare?
- This is your big break.

740
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:45,300
That's Shakespeare.
I can't do that. That's too hard.

741
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,859
Haply, when I shall wed.

742
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:50,460
that lord whose hand
must take my plightw

743
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,859
shall carry half my love with him,
half my care and duty.

744
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:59,579
Surely I shall never marry
like my sisters to love my father all.

745
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,059
So true, my lord.
In life... oh! I blew it.

746
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,779
I'm sorry. That was bad.


747
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:10,300
No, that was amazing.

748
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,420
You know, the thing with acting, Alex,
is you just have to commit.

749
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,260
Otherwise, you're just a phony.

750
01:09:20,019 --> 01:09:21,260
I can't hear anything.k

751
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,500
I know.

752
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:25,099
That's weird.o

753
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:31,779
- Is it hooked up right?
- Yeah.

754
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,579
Can you take it back?g

755
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:37,180
I know a place
I can get it fixed, actually.

756
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:43,420
Do you believe
in love at first sight?.

757
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,779
Well, who is he?.

758
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:48,699
Don't even try to lie about it.

759
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,460
I haven't met him yet.
I've just seen him.

760
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:55,219
I don't think he's got a girlfriend.
I can tell.

761
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,380
Don't wait.
The good ones go fast.

762
01:09:58,099 --> 01:10:01,460
Well, I gotta go get the video camera,
so I'll talk to you later.

763
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:02,659
All right..

764
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:05,659
Hey... promise you'll talk to him?

765
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:08,979
Yeah... I'll think about it.

766
01:10:09,059 --> 01:10:10,579
Okay. Bye.n

767
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,380
I'll be right back.

768
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,420
- Sorry.
- Matthew, where are you going?r

769
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,819
Sorry.a

770
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,979
My God.
it's so much like... Matthew.

771
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:30,739
Don't be silly.

772
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,299
It belongs to one of the doctors
at the hospital. 

773
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:37,380
Why would you think of Matthew?e

774
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,579
Could I borrow
your car again tonight?o

775
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:47,699
Oh, sure.

776
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,659
Thanks, Lisa.h

777
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:54,779
Well, I better go.
I'll see you later.

778
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:55,979
Okay.w

779
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,779
Hi, excuse me?
I was in here a couple of days ago.

780
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:06,420
I think I might have left a compact.
It's silver, engraved.

781
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,979
Um, let me ask.w

782
01:12:08,059 --> 01:12:11,299
Tony, did anyone turn in
a silver compact? 

783
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,779
No. Sorry.e

784
01:12:12,859 --> 01:12:14,579
Okay. Thank you.i

785
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:15,699
Lisa?a

786
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,659
Yeah?

787
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:22,460
A guy did come in here looking for you.
Said he found your keys. Oh! And...

788
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:26,779
He left you this.

789
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:28,100
- Thank you.
- Sure.o

790
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,779
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

791
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:36,659
"I have your powder case.

792
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:38,219
"Call me.s

793
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,420
Matthew. "e

794
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:32,180
Hey, Luke, can I talk to you
for a second?

795
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:35,460
Hey, Ellie, do me a favor.
Will you help her out?

796
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:36,699
Yeah, sure.j

797
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:37,939
How's it goin'?

798
01:13:38,019 --> 01:13:40,420
Hey. I just wanna say thanks
for everything

799
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,659
and, you know,
you've been great.

800
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:45,059
What about the play?
I thought you were comin' to the play.

801
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,019
I don't wanna miss
another flight, you know.

802
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,819
Listen, I'll make it up to you
when I get back. I promise.

803
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:54,299
Hey, taxi!t

804
01:13:55,059 --> 01:13:58,380
You have fun tonight, though, all right?
Say hi to Alex for me, and, you know.

805
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,380
- You're a lucky guy.
- You got plenty of time.

806
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:03,779
It's the late flight. I really want you
to come to the play. Please?

807
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:06,939
See, things, um... it's just not going
that well with Alex.

808
01:14:07,019 --> 01:14:09,260
I've been kind of
exaggerating a little.

809
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,219
What do you mean?

810
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:12,460
Well...

811
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:14,859
Lying.
Uh! I've been lying!

812
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:16,539
It's 'cause my life's so pathetic.

813
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,939
No all-night marathon?

814
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:20,420
God, I'm lucky if I get a kiss
at the end of the night.

815
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,100
So I was thinking that if you came
to the play, I think that would really help.

816
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,899
I mean, I'd be so much
more confident with you there.

817
01:14:26,979 --> 01:14:29,939
And then I can go to the bathroom
and you can tell her,

818
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:31,659
you know,
what a great guy I am

819
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:34,659
and rumor has it I'm really good
in the sack, and that, um...

820
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:37,100
I'm hung like a camel...
I don't know.i

821
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:41,460
Please? I wouldn't ask
if it didn't mean a lot to me.

822
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:44,500
- I'll be there.
- Oh, you're the best. Thanks, buddy.

823
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,380
7:30, all right?

824
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,619
- I got it.
- Good. There you go.

825
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,340
- See you, brother.
- Yeah.

826
01:14:52,139 --> 01:14:53,460
You the man. Thanks, man.

827
01:14:53,539 --> 01:14:57,460
Well, you're all set.
You're on flight 1559. First class.

828
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,460
Have a good trip.i

829
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,859
I will. Thanks a lot..

830
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:25,019
Um, I'm booked in a flight
to London today.

831
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,619
I'd like to postpone it
until tomorrow, please.n

832
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,219
Those shoes.
The black ones with the red sole.

833
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:36,180
I'd like to try them on. Please.

834
01:16:01,299 --> 01:16:05,859
Oh, excuse me, dear. Could you tell me
how to get to this museum from here?

835
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:10,059
I think it's...e

836
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:13,380
I think it's back here.o

837
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,460
- Let me show you. I'll walk you.
- Oh, thank you.

838
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:49,500
Alex, ten minutes!

839
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,100
This is it right up here.i

840
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,420
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

841
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,500
Thanks.w

842
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:09,260
How much better that man should fall
before the lion than the wolf.

843
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:12,979
The clock upbraids me
with the waste of time.o

844
01:17:14,619 --> 01:17:17,779
Be not afraid, good youth.
I will not have you.

845
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:19,859
And yet when wit and youth
is come to harvest,

846
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:22,420
your wife is like
to reap a proper man.

847
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,659
I'm right here. Sorry.

848
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,260
There lies your way.
Due west.

849
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,380
Excuse me.

good disposition attend your ladyship.

I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkst of me.

854
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,859
That you do... think...

855
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,500
Sit down.

856
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:53,939
- You are...
- Sorry.

857
01:17:55,299 --> 01:17:56,939
Not what you are.

858
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,579
Is that her?

859
01:17:59,659 --> 01:18:01,139
Yeah, that's my girl.

860
01:18:03,699 --> 01:18:05,299
Then think you right.o

861
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,659
I am not what I am.s

862

I would you were
as I would have you be.

863
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,979
Would it be better,
madam, than I am?

864
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:17,219
I wish it might,
for now I am your fool.

865
01:18:24,059 --> 01:18:25,380
You're in love with this guy.

866
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,939
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

867
01:18:28,019 --> 01:18:31,380
You're upset. You're confused.
it's tearing you up inside!

868
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,659
You have been in love before.
haven't you?

869
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:46,500
By my innocence, I swear,
and by my youth,

870
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:50,059
I have one heart,
one bosom, and one truth.

871
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:53,139
And no woman has,
nor never none shall,

872
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:55,859
mistress be of it
to save I alone.

873
01:18:56,579 --> 01:18:59,260
And so adieu, good madam.c

874
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:02,260
Nevermore will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

875
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,299
She's good.

876
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:22,059
Look, I should really get
to the airport.

877
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,260
Yeah. Yeah.
If you have to go, go.

878
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,260
I'm sure Alex is gonna be disappointed
she didn't get a chance to meet you.

879
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,579
Tell her she did a great job.
And I'll see you on Monday.

880
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,579
I will. Hey, Matt, thanks for everything.
It means a lot to me.

881
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,019
I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.

882
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:38,019
Yeah, me, too.

883
01:19:40,019 --> 01:19:42,299
- I'll see you around, huh?
- All right, man.

884
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,779
Hey, Alex..

885
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:11,340
Alex, it's me. 

886
01:20:12,299 --> 01:20:13,779
Please go away.

887
01:20:14,739 --> 01:20:16,260
C'mon, baby. Open the door.u

888
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,180
I don't want your friend
to see me like this.

889
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,500
He won't. He left.t

890
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:27,260
What? He left?
Did I scare him away?

891
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:29,059
Scare him away?
You blew him away.

892
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,779
You blew everyone away.
You were unbelievable.

893
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:34,260
He just had a plane to catch.

894
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,299
A slow one to China.
Open the door.r

895
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:39,539
Did he find her?c

896
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,500
What?i

897
01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:44,420
Your friend... did...n

898
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,859
Did he find Lisa?T

899
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:55,100
No, it just turned out to be some... psycho
with the same name, same everything.

900
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,180
He slept on her couch and ran away
as fast as he could.

901
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:00,819
Are you okay?p

902
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:05,779
Alex. You've gotta help me..

903
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,699
What's wrong?

904
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:11,819
Well, I booked this job...
a European tour of Cabaret.

905
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:13,380
Oh, wow! That's fantastic!a

906
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:16,139
I know. Some girl broke her ankle,
I'm taking over.m

907
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,979
But listen, I can't find Matthew.

908
01:21:18,019 --> 01:21:22,180
I've been looking all over for him,
and my plane's leaving in two hours.

909
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,260
Did you leave him a message?

910
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,819
I can't really leave this
on his machine, you know.

911
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,659
It's too complicated.

912
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,500
I wrote him a letter.
Do you mind giving it to him?

913
01:21:33,299 --> 01:21:36,139
I've never even met him.
He doesn't knowwho I am.

914
01:21:36,219 --> 01:21:39,539
It doesn't matter... just tell him
you're my friend. It'll be fine.

915
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:42,019
You know what,
and if he's not there...

916
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,260
just let yourself in
and leave it on his bed.

917
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:50,059
I really appreciate this.
Thank you so much.

918
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,059
Sure. Okay.d

919
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,180
All right.h

920
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:59,019
He asked me
to move in with him.

921
01:22:01,019 --> 01:22:03,420
Oh. What did you say?

922
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,019
I didn't really say anything.

923
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,260
I was late for a class,
and I just sort of ran away.

924
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,539
I said I'd meet him tomorrow.
If I don't show up, you know, he'll go nuts.

925
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:14,180
Anyway, I have to go.

926
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:17,100
Thanks again, and I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

927
01:22:17,139 --> 01:22:19,299
Are you gonna do it?

928
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,579
Of course.
I love him.

929
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:25,699
Bye.o

930
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:26,939
Bye.z

931
01:23:00,019 --> 01:23:03,180

Hey. It's me again.e

933
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:09,380
Where are you?


934
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,460
Did you get my letter?

Anyway. I'm in Paris.h

936
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:16,380

the number in my last message.

937
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,779
Matt. Please call me.e

938
01:23:18,859 --> 01:23:21,659
This is driving me crazy.
I need to speak to you.

939
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:25,859
Look. If you're angry at me.
then don 't be.

940
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:29,460
Just call... please.
Bye.

941
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:12,340
I don 't know
if I can stay with the show.e

942
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,500
I feel like I have to come home
and look for him.

943
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:16,939
No, I...,

944
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:21,340
I wasn't gonna say
anything before, but...r

945
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:24,939
...when I brought him the letter...

946
01:24:26,139 --> 01:24:28,100
...he wasn't expecting me, and... 

947
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:33,779
...I found him in bed
with another woman, Lisa.

948
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,699
l... I can't believe it.

949
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:43,619
Just... forget about him.i

950
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:46,779
The best thing for you to do
is stay with the show and...

951
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:48,219
just forget him.

952
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:55,019
I really thought I knew him.'

953
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,579
Just forget him.
He's not even worth it.t

954
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:13,939
Luke, I'm so sorry.o

955
01:25:14,019 --> 01:25:16,779
No. Shh... it's okay.y

956

No. Please, don't apologize.
Please. God.

958
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,260
I know you're doing the best you can.

959
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,299
I just...


960
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:36,019
I just want you to know that I...
that I love you.

961
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,739
All right? And I don't
wanna play games anymore..

962
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:44,380
What's the point?
I'm just terrible at them anyway.

963
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:42,659
Do me a favor.
Grab that, would you?

964
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,299
Hello?e

- Who's this?

967
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,180
This is Matthew.
Who is this?

968
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:57,420
Hello?s

969
01:26:58,059 --> 01:26:59,139
Hello?0

970
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:02,260
Hey, what's up, kid?
I thought you left.

971
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:04,500
No, uh...'

972
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:07,420
What are you still doing here?e

973
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
I'm over at the...

974
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:10,899
girl's apartment.i

975
01:27:11,739 --> 01:27:14,260
You went back
to the crazy girl's house?i

976
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,859
What the hell are you doing there?r

977
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:22,139
I'm really starting
to worry about you, man.

978
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,340
I'm starting to worry myself.

979
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:28,539
It's not just that..

980
01:27:29,139 --> 01:27:31,219
I couldn't even
get on the airplane.

981
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,619
The thing is....

982
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:39,059
...there's something
about this apartment.

983
01:27:44,899 --> 01:27:46,739
It's like Lisa's been here.

984
01:27:47,939 --> 01:27:51,299
I know this sounds insane. But...

985
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,500
I think this is her place. Man.

986
01:27:56,579 --> 01:27:59,260
Well. Maybe you're
just hot for this crazy girI.

987
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,659
First thing you gotta do is get out
of her apartment and get over here.

988
01:28:02,739 --> 01:28:04,539
I'll tell you about some stuff. Too.

989
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:08,699
I've had the most amazing night
of my entire life last night.

990
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:11,939
Okay. I'll be over. Just give me
a couple of minutes. Okay?

991
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,340
All right. I'll wait.
Later.

992
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,299
- Hello?
- Hi. Um...

993
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:25,819
May I speak to Matthew, please?

994
01:28:27,979 --> 01:28:29,299
Who is this?

995
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:31,779
Um... this is Lisa.

996
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:35,139
I'm a friend of his.
I'm calling about my compact.

997
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:36,859
I think he might have found it.

998
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:38,859
Uh... which Lisa is this?

999
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:40,260
Pardon me?

1000
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,059
Uh... I'll tell you what...

1001
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:48,460
he's actually supposed to be here
in a couple of minutes.

1002
01:28:56,299 --> 01:28:57,340
Hello?

1003
01:28:57,539 --> 01:28:58,579
Hello!c

1004
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:00,699
Hi.a

1005
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:01,899
Hi.t

1006
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,260
I'm sorry I didn't come back.
My, um...

1007
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:10,379
...double shift turned into a triple,
and I just couldn't get away.

1008
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,260
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

1009
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:14,379
Are you mad?

1010
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,739
No. Not at all.
I had a great time.

1011
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:19,819
Where are you?.

1012
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:23,219
Well, I'm still at work but, um,
I'm just leaving now,

1013
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:24,619
so why don't you wait?

1014
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:27,180
Yeah, I'll wait.

1015
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,579
Okay. Great.
I'll see you soon.d

1016
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:36,859
Let me. Uh...
let me grab your phone number

1017
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:40,340
and I will have him call you
when he gets in.

1018
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:46,059
Um, you know... actually, could you
just tell him to meet me at 3:00?

1019
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:48,979
He'd know where.
Um, I'll be waiting for him.

1020
01:29:49,059 --> 01:29:51,340
3:00. Okay.

1021
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,659
l... you know what,
it can't be him already,

1022
01:29:54,699 --> 01:29:56,219
but I'm expecting him.

1023
01:29:56,299 --> 01:29:58,859
Someone's at my front door.
so maybe it is him.

1024
01:29:58,939 --> 01:30:00,299
So hold on a second.

1025
01:30:07,579 --> 01:30:09,379
Matthew, trust me, okay?i

1026
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:12,899
Meet me tomorrow in the park.
Same time.m

1027
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:17,139
Bye.a

1028
01:30:25,899 --> 01:30:28,139
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It wasn't him. It was someone else.

1029
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:32,500
But I promise you
I will give him your message. Okay?

1030
01:30:32,539 --> 01:30:34,299
Oh. Okay. Thank you.o

1031
01:30:40,219 --> 01:30:42,379
I went to get cigarettes.
What's going on?

1032
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:46,219
Matthew. He didn't leave.

1033
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:49,139
He went back to that girl's house.
The crazy one. 

1034
01:30:49,219 --> 01:30:51,180
Oh, the plot thickens.

1035
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,340
Oh, yeah. It gets even better.
Listen to this.

1036
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,260
So I hang up the phone,
and five seconds later, Lisa called.

1037
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:01,979
The real Lisa.
The one from two years ago.

1038
01:31:02,059 --> 01:31:03,379
She wants to see him.

1039
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:07,180
You tell him?

1040
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:10,180
No, not yet.
I'll wait till he gets here.

1041
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,260
He's gonna be so happy,
he's gonna hit the moon again.

1042
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,500
I have to go!.

1043
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,340
- What do you mean?
- I'll call you later. I promise..

1044
01:31:17,379 --> 01:31:19,739
But I made breakfast.
My dad's famous potatoes.

1045
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,500
Lisa called.
She wants to see him.

1046
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:34,020
So, will you let me
meet your friends?

1047
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,739
Don't you have a store to run?

1048
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:37,420
Oh, okay.
I can take a hint.

1049
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,100
So we're going out tomorrow, right?

1050
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,180
- 7:00?
- Sure.

1051
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,299
Okay..

1052
01:31:42,379 --> 01:31:44,500
Bye, and thanks for the lift.i

1053
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:45,619
Bye.n

1054
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,979
Matty. Hey.
Matty!

1055
01:31:51,059 --> 01:31:53,460
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man!

1056
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:55,779
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

1057
01:31:55,859 --> 01:31:57,020
Really good. Really good.

1058
01:32:04,059 --> 01:32:07,340
Oh, excuse me. Could I order
an espresso while I wait for my friend?

1059
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,460
Absolutely.

1060
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:18,139
He's very impressed
with what you've done.o

1061
01:32:18,219 --> 01:32:21,859
and he assures you that
when you get to China...

1062
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:25,180
...with much enthusiasm
and support.

1063
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,939
I'm sitting over here.

1064
01:32:29,819 --> 01:32:30,859
Excuse me. Champagne.

1065
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,579
Excuse you.h

1066
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,180
No.i

1067
01:32:45,219 --> 01:32:47,379
Uh, Miss Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

1068
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,819
Shit, shit, shit!

1069
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:54,059
As you can see, uh...

1070
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:58,579
Here, Sweetie...

1071
01:33:08,899 --> 01:33:10,500
Hello. Bellucci's.
May I help you?

1072
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:12,619
Hello, may I speak
to my friend Lisa, please?

1073
01:33:12,699 --> 01:33:15,539
She's the blonde.
She's sitting at a table behind the bar.

1074
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:18,299
Yes. Just a minute. Please.s

1075
01:33:18,379 --> 01:33:21,100
Excuse me. Are you Lisa?

1076
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:22,939
Phone's for you.t

1077
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,939
It's a little noisy here. Why don't you
take the house phone around the corner.

1078
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,219
Okay. Thank you.

1079
01:33:27,299 --> 01:33:32,260
T o a long and prosperous marriage...
of our two companies.

1080
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:35,859
Excuse me. I'm gonna go make
a phone call. I'll be right back.

1081
01:33:35,939 --> 01:33:36,979
No.a

1082
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:40,379
No.o

1083
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,939
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisa. It's me.

1084
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,340
Hey. What happened to you?m

1085
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,579
I know. I'm so sorry.
I got stuck at work.

1086
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:49,100
Look. Daniel's found me
at the hotel.

1087
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:50,979
Hang on.
Just a minute!


1088
01:33:52,939 --> 01:33:55,619
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

1089
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:57,539
Yeah, of course. Um...

1090
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,819
Go there right now.
I'll... I'll meet you there.

1091
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,539
Hey.

1092
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:20,739
Hey.s

1093
01:34:24,059 --> 01:34:25,139
How are you, Lisa?

1094
01:34:25,219 --> 01:34:27,819
Good. How are you?


1095
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:28,939
Good.e

1096
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:32,460
Thought you'd be in China by now.e

1097
01:34:33,299 --> 01:34:35,219
That makes two of us.
Sit down.?

1098
01:34:38,779 --> 01:34:40,979
- What's that?
- It's a present.

1099
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,619
- For me?
- Yeah.

1100
01:34:44,539 --> 01:34:47,939
I saw that yours were...
yours were broken, so...

1101
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:50,859
Uh, wanna try them on?

1102
01:34:54,219 --> 01:34:56,260
That's very sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1103
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,619
Oh, that's okay.

1104
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:06,739
They're a little big.

1105
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:11,899
What size shoe do you wear?

1106
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,180
Seven.

1107
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:20,619
These are 8 1/2.

1108
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:32,460
I would've told you what size I was if I
knew you were gonna get me some shoes.

1109
01:35:33,579 --> 01:35:35,299
It's okay.
I could exchange them.

1110
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,739
You don't have to do that. I...

1111
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,779
Anyway, I told a friend of mine I'd
meet him for coffee before I left, so...

1112
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:48,899
What? You're leaving?

1113
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:51,180
Yeah.

1114
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,500
Bye.

1115
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:15,460
Hey, Luke. It's me.
Let's meet.

1116
01:36:45,139 --> 01:36:46,460
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:48,500
What are you doin'?
I thought you were comin' by.

1118
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:51,899
l, uh... I was comin' by.
I just lost track of the time.

1119
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:54,619
I got good news for you.
Let's go have a drink.

1120
01:36:54,699 --> 01:36:56,539
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

1121
01:36:58,739 --> 01:36:59,779
Come on.

1122
01:37:05,379 --> 01:37:08,899
Hey, babe. I came as soon as you called.
Look who I ran into. It's Matthew.

1123
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:10,979
Matthew, Alex.
Alex, Matthew.

1124
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:13,059
Finally you two meet.

1125
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,699
Hi.

1126
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:25,739
Hello.

1127
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:27,979
Have a seat.

1128
01:37:34,059 --> 01:37:35,219
Hi.

1129
01:37:35,299 --> 01:37:36,739
Hello.

1130
01:37:36,819 --> 01:37:37,979
Want a cocktail?

1131
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,059
Excuse me.

1132
01:37:41,779 --> 01:37:43,059
Hi, how can I help you?

1133
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,260
What do you want?

1134
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,260
A vodka rocks. Double.

1135
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:49,020
Wow.

1136
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,219
Baby?

1137
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:53,939
You know what? I'll have, um,
I'll have a Seven and Seven.

1138
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,899
Put it in a bucket. Not like a double,
but more like a one and a half.

1139
01:37:56,979 --> 01:37:59,100
He knows how to do it.
Thanks.

1140
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:00,219
You got it.

1141
01:38:00,299 --> 01:38:02,020
So what happened
with your psycho?

1142
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:08,260
You can say it in front of Alex.
She knows the whole story anyway.

1143
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,899
Sometimes when you see
someone from afar...

1144
01:38:16,539 --> 01:38:18,219
...you develop a fantasy.

1145
01:38:21,379 --> 01:38:22,779
Then when you see them up close,

1146
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:25,180
nine times out of ten,
you wish you hadn't.

1147
01:38:29,379 --> 01:38:32,939
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1148
01:38:36,219 --> 01:38:39,659
I was confused,
so I went back to her apartment, and...

1149
01:38:40,619 --> 01:38:46,779
...thought I'd find what I was looking for,
but I found something else.

1150
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:49,739
Did you talk to her?

1151
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:53,739
Just long enough for her
to convince me that she's a liar.

1152
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:56,659
No harm, no foul, though, right?

1153
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:01,979
What do you think, Alex?
I mean, you know the whole story.

1154
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:06,659
It's easy to stand back and judge.

1155
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:09,460
You don't know anything
about this woman.

1156
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:14,139
I know that she has no conscience
and no regard for anyone but herself.

1157
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:15,779
I mean, what else
do I need to know?

1158
01:39:15,859 --> 01:39:18,299
You make yourself
into such a victim.

1159
01:39:18,379 --> 01:39:21,460
Nobody made you be with her. You can't
even see what a hypocrite you're being.

1160
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,219
I'm being a hypocrite?
How am I being a hypocrite?

1161
01:39:23,299 --> 01:39:25,139
- Yes, you are!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1162
01:39:25,219 --> 01:39:26,579
You guys. Hey, relax.

1163
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:27,979
No, Luke. Hey, hold on.

1164
01:39:28,059 --> 01:39:30,939
Alex, I'd like you to explain to me
how I'm being a hypocrite.

1165
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:40,059
Who's to say this woman hasn't been
in love with you for a really long time?

1166
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:44,699
And now that she found you again,
she wasn't about to let you go twice.

1167
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,579
What?

1168
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:49,779
Maybe...

1169
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,659
the first time she saw you,

1170
01:39:51,739 --> 01:39:54,939
maybe she felt the way you did
the first time you saw Lisa.

1171
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,619
You remember that.

1172
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:01,699
Love makes you do crazy things.

1173
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:03,979
Insane things.

1174
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:08,139
Things in a million years
you never thought you'd see yourself do.

1175
01:40:10,539 --> 01:40:13,139
There you are doin' it.
Can't help it.

1176
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:17,299
Jesus Christ.
Lighten up, you guys.

1177
01:40:17,379 --> 01:40:20,539
This woman... she's a nut.
She's psycho.

1178
01:40:20,619 --> 01:40:23,579
She's cuckoo-bananas, all right?
End of story.

1179
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:25,779
Can we change the subject?

1180
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:27,899
I actually have something
to cheer you up.

1181
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:31,939
Did you, uh, leave a note
with the bartender here a few days ago?

1182
01:40:32,899 --> 01:40:34,619
Yeah, I did.
How do you know that?

1183
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:36,020
'Cause Lisa called.

1184
01:40:36,699 --> 01:40:37,859
What?

1185
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:42,779
Yeah! After you got off the phone.
She said to meet her at 3:00.

1186
01:40:42,859 --> 01:40:46,460
She couldn't wait long, 'cause she had
to get on a plane to London.

1187
01:40:47,899 --> 01:40:50,020
W-where am I
supposed to meet her?

1188
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,180
She didn't say.
She said you'd know.

1189
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:54,460
You don't know?

1190
01:40:55,779 --> 01:40:57,659
I think you know where.

1191
01:40:57,699 --> 01:40:59,420
It hasn't been that long, has it?

1192
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:00,619
What?

1193
01:41:01,659 --> 01:41:04,100
You know, uh...
I'll ask Tony.

1194
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:06,699
Maybe he'll know something.

1195
01:41:09,379 --> 01:41:11,219
You knew she was here
the whole time?

1196
01:41:21,579 --> 01:41:23,500
This belongs to you.

1197
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,180
It's from her.

1198
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:43,299
"Matt. Please don't think
that I'm running away from you.

1199
01:41:43,379 --> 01:41:46,619
"I was so overwhelmed
when you asked me to move in.

1200
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:48,859
"I couldn't speak.

1201
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:51,779
"My answer. Of course. Is yes.

1202
01:41:51,819 --> 01:41:54,899
I love you.
and can't wait to come home. "

1203
01:41:58,379 --> 01:42:00,699
I'm not going to apologize
for what I've done.

1204
01:42:04,219 --> 01:42:06,219
This is for me to live with now.

1205
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:13,180
Now you see me for who I am.

1206
01:42:21,379 --> 01:42:23,100
Yes, I do.

1207
01:42:34,299 --> 01:42:35,460
Hey. Where you goin'?

1208
01:42:35,539 --> 01:42:36,699
Hey.

1209
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:38,260
Where you goin'?

1210
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:39,819
I knowwhere she is.

1211
01:42:40,699 --> 01:42:42,340
All right.
Tell me what happens.

1212
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:47,299
That guy. He's um...

1213
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,579
more drama
than a Mexican soap opera.

1214
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:52,460
Luke! This...

1215
01:42:52,539 --> 01:42:53,699
This is over.

1216
01:42:53,779 --> 01:42:55,260
- What's over?
- Us.

1217
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:59,020
How can it be over?
We haven't even started yet.

1218
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,739
I'm not who you think I am.

1219
01:43:02,139 --> 01:43:03,460
I used you.

1220
01:43:18,619 --> 01:43:19,659
Taxi!

1221
01:43:21,139 --> 01:43:22,180
Come on.

1222
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,460
Hey!

1223
01:43:38,539 --> 01:43:40,020
Hey, come on!

1224
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:42,659
God!

1225
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:47,779
Hey!

1226
01:43:49,899 --> 01:43:51,619
Hey! Hey!

1227
01:43:55,739 --> 01:43:56,899
Sorry.

1228
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,020
Thanks.

1229
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,260
- Goin' to Wicker Park.
- Yeah, right away.

1230
01:45:01,659 --> 01:45:03,299
Your attention. Please.

1231
01:45:03,379 --> 01:45:06,739
Flight 862 service to London
is now boarding.

1232
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:34,659
Hi!

1233
01:45:36,059 --> 01:45:37,899
There you are!

1234
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:40,939
Where've you been?
Your flight got in an hour ago.

1235
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,859
I've been down
to luggage claim and back.

1236
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:45,699
- Rebecca.
- Hey.

1237
01:45:45,779 --> 01:45:46,979
l, um...

1238
01:45:47,059 --> 01:45:48,699
What's the matter?

1239
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:50,340
Rough flight home?

1240
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,819
Did you bring me back
that little Chinese dress?

1241
01:45:56,659 --> 01:45:58,460
- Rebecca...
- You okay, Sweetie?

1242
01:46:00,219 --> 01:46:01,699
I didn't go to China.

1243
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:05,139
What are you talking about?

1244
01:46:05,219 --> 01:46:08,299
Hi, Alex. You're never gonna
believe what happened.

1245
01:46:08,379 --> 01:46:10,100
Matthew's back in town.

1246
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:13,180
I can't marry you.

1247
01:46:14,139 --> 01:46:15,779
It would be a huge mistake.

1248
01:46:15,859 --> 01:46:18,539
You're gonna have to help me out, baby.
Did I do something wrong?

1249
01:46:18,579 --> 01:46:21,500
No, you didn't...
You didn't do anything wrong.

1250
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:22,619
Rebecca, I...

1251
01:46:23,939 --> 01:46:26,779
I've been doing something wrong
for the last two years.

1252
01:46:27,619 --> 01:46:30,219
I'm not...
I'm not this person.

1253
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,619
I can't go back with you.
I can't do this.

1254
01:46:33,219 --> 01:46:35,699
I was gonna meet him in the park,
but he didn't show up.

1255
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:39,059
Yeah... I know.

1256
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,460
What do you mean?

1257
01:46:40,539 --> 01:46:45,859
Lisa. I've been doing some really...
horrible and selfish things.

1258
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:47,659
What are you talking about?

1259
01:46:47,739 --> 01:46:49,819
I've been keeping you apart.

1260
01:46:49,899 --> 01:46:53,100
When we met two years ago,
I was in love with someone else.

1261
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:56,180
And she just came back
into my life.

1262
01:46:56,939 --> 01:46:59,500
She broke my heart...
and I'm sorry!

1263
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:01,420
Oh, my God.

1264
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,100
l... Rebecca, I know...

1265
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,020
I know that I'm still in love with her.

1266
01:47:12,819 --> 01:47:14,819
I just... I needed you to know.

1267
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:16,939
Knowwhat?

1268
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,100
Know what, Matthew?

1269
01:47:21,379 --> 01:47:23,420
That I'm not the girl
that can break your heart?

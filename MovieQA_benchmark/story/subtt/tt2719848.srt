1
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:09,016


2
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:14,766
Based on a true story.

3
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:20,384
1953
Enmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the
first climbers to summit of Everest.

4
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:25,379
Over the next 40 years. only professional
climbers attempted the same feat.

5
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:28,282
One in four died

6
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,196
1992
New Zealander, Rob Hall pioneered the concept of
commercial guiding on Everest for amateur climbers.

7
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,077
Over the next four years, his team, Adventure Consultants,
successfully led 19 clients to the summit

8
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,666
without a single fatality.

9
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:44,153
1996
Other commercial operators follow Rob Hall's lead,
including Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness.

10
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:49,444
More than 20 expeditions compete to summit
Everest in the same two week window.

11
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,624
Please listen up.

12
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,022
Guys.

13
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,141
We got 2000 feet (ft),

14
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,297
600 vertical metres (m)

15
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,434
to Camp 4.

16
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,667
Let's rope all the way,

17
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,805
so I know you can make it.

18
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:10,262
Alright, once we get to the
Yellow band, we're going to regroup.

19
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,095
Put on the mask,
turn on the gas.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,828
Make sense?

21
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,609
$325 a bottle,

22
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:09,543
- for oxygen.
(6 weeks ago...)

23
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,627
- It's daylight robbery.
(6 weeks ago...)

24
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:13,674
Yeah. Well, he's cornered
the market, he's got it

25
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,905
He reckon there's going to be
20 teams at Base camp this season.

26
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,983
20 teams?

27
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,499
I mean with all the
Sherpas and porters

28
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,703
it's going to be
squeeze up there.

29
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,929
Lets...
scrum on the ropes right there.

30
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,046
What is this?

31
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,194
It's Helen's.

32
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,096
It's a little decoration
for the mess in.

33
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,373
- Hey, you can wear them on your head, y'hear.
- I'll have it, thank you.

34
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,681
Okay, I got some news.

35
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,181
- We got Krakauer.
- Huh?

36
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,288
Oh, yeah!

37
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:38,826
- You stole him from Scott Fischer.
- No, he made his own mind.

38
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,703
Good job, Rob.

39
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,917
How much is he paying you, Rob?

40
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,201
Well, he's...
only paying for his airfare.

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,114
but we got 5000 words

42
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,088
in the magazine and our picture
in the front cover.  Huh.

43
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,854
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

44
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,333
Or if you get him to the top.

45
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,317
If... If...
How can you say that to me?

46
00:03:58,342 --> 00:03:59,415
- There you go.
- I got you.

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,179
You alright? Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

48
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,460
- Hey.
- Hi, Rob.

49
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:06,272
- Good to see you.
- Oh, yeah. How are you?

50
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:09,126
- I am good. Oh, look at you.
- I know.

51
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,871
- Big.
- Here you go.

52
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:11,859
You good?

53
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,044
- Yeh, you know.
- Okay.

54
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,729
Just going to miss you.

55
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,632
Let's go, Guy.

56
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,038
Just-Just go careful, alright?

57
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,781
- It's just...
- Please don't.

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,062
Come on, please don't worry.

59
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,757
It's just that doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

60
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:32,473
- You're not doing nothing.
- No, but...

61
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,114
What?

62
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,726
It's the waiting for you.

63
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:39,035
- For him.
- Ha ha.

64
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,035
- Her.
- Her.

65
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:46,708
Just, be back for the birth,
Rob Hall.

66
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:49,777
You try and stop me.

67
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,474
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

68
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,040
Go.

69
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,936
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

70
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,079
March 30th 1996

71
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,604
Here.

72
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:26,355
- That all you got.
- Yeah. That's it.

73
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,674
I think we're over here.

74
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,533
Hey...
What work outfit you guys with?

75
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:42,145
- Adventure Consultants.
- Uh, good, me too.

76
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,762
I'm Beck.
Beck Weathers.

77
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,250
Doug Hansen.

78
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,057
- Jon Krakauer.
- How're you doing?

79
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,468
- Okay.
- Are you...

80
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,672
Krakauer from Outside magazine.

81
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,360
- Yeah.
- Really?

82
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,551
What're you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

83
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:56,515
A little bit of both.

84
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,643
Well. I'll let you know
how the Summit goes, okay?

85
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:03,110
- No need, I'll be there.
- We'll see.

86
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,034
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

87
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,930
- What? Work?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:25,895
Uh, different things.
Carpenter. Mailman.

89
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,791
- Carpenter. Mailman.
- Yep.

90
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:32,714
- Seriously, you deliver the mail?
- Yep, I deliver the mail.

91
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:35,670
Mailman on Everest?

92
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,441
- Hope so.
- Ha ha. I like that.

93
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,557
Mailman on Everest.

94
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,597
There we go.

95
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,095
- Beck.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,416
You know, he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year.

97
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,627
- Who? Doug did?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:59,248
- That's pretty hot for a mailman.
- Yep

99
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:01,738
Brown's Peak,
McKinley.

100
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,653
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

101
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:05,705
I know.

102
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,508
- How did you know that?
- 89', right?

103
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,630
Ohhh.
You done your research.

104
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,513
That's what we do.

105
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,165
GARUDA HOTEL

106
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,782
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

107
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:27,000
A histroy made famous
by George Everest,

108
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,045
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary...

109
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,185
- And Rob Hall.
- lege...

110
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,215
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:35,591
legend... lege...
legends, all of them.

112
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,515
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Eh ha ha...

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,236
That's right.

114
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:41,298
For those of you who dare
face the dreams,

115
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:46,015
Adventure Consultants offer something
beyond the power of words to describe.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,826
And why don't we
describe it in the brochure.

117
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:52,601
Because it's mostly just pain.

118
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:53,908
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth.

119
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,665
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike.

120
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,470
And the odd missing toe.

121
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,342
There we go.

122
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,693
- Oh.
- Ooo.

123
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,514
To put it simply, guys.

124
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,479
Human beings
simply aren't built to function

125
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:10,446
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

126
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:14,060
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col.

127
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:17,336
Our bodies will be literally dying
and I mean literally dying.

128
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,516
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

129
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,974
So, the game is,
can we get you up to the top

130
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:26,472
and down to the bottom
before that happens.

131
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:29,069
- You sure can.
- Oh.

132
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:30,533
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

133
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,648
You might've noticed he's a
bit of a lone star state.

134
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:36,977
100% Texan right here, people.
100% Texan.

135
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,373
You met Mike Groom.

136
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,862
I like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
- Or Harold.

137
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,444
Harold had got out of Queenstown.

138
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,503
Taranaki actually,
originally Canada.

139
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:47,669
Helen and the rest of the team are
already on their way up to Base Camp.

140
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,125
They're setting it up
when we get there.

141
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,012
- Today is March 30th, people.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:54,232
I plan on going to
the Summit, May 10th.

143
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:56,495
It's been a lucky day for me
in Adventure Consultants,

144
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,152
and the weather is usually
pretty stable around then.

145
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:00,497
So that means,

146
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:04,240
We have 40 days,
to train your bodies and your minds

147
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,467
to go for it.

148
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,441
Now. I know there is a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room

149
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,903
you wouldn't be here without it.

150
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,959
- Stu, K2, Broad Peak.
- Nice.

151
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:16,769
John Taske,
1192m of Mount Kosciuszko.

152
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,257
- Ha ha ha...
- Eh ha ha...

153
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,705
- And Yasuko Namba.
- Oh.

154
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,089
- 6 of the 7 Summits.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,129
- An amazing woman.
- There you go.

156
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:25,777
- Let's make it 7.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:29,477
But, Everest though, is another beast.
Another beast altogether.

158
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,351
That's why you're here.
Isn't that right, Dougy.

159
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,438
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,003
So, listen.
Tonight, that's it for me.

161
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,633
Eat, drink, be merry.
Tomorrow we trek.

162
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:43,951
Alright, let's go.

163
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:49,562
Alright, folks, hang on.

164
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,640
Okay.

165
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:52,108
That's it.
Here we go, colonel

166
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,906
Alright, everybody, earbuds.

167
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,997
Take your seats.
Buckle in, everyone.

168
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:57,658
Thanks, bud.

169
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:59,644
Murdock, here we go.

170
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,636
Okay, everybody.

171
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,100
Hey, can you believe it.

172
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,937
Lukla : 9,383 ft
2,860 m

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,471
Take it easy.
Nice work.

174
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,060
Take it easy.

175
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,639
- Ready.
- Let's go.

176
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,558
You lead the way.

177
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,574
- Are you alright?
- Come on, man.

178
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,192
NAMCHE BAZAAR : 12,303 ft
3,750 m

179
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,464
Guys, man want to see
your climbing permits.

180
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,081
Need to see all
your climbing permits.

181
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,646
Thank you very much.
We'll see you on the way back.

182
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,354
Thank you very much.

183
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,651
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

184
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:37,931
- Yeah.
- Hey...

185
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,583
Thanks, Rob.

186
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:43,083
- Thanks for what?
- You know, the discount.

187
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,451
You're working 3 jobs, Doug.

188
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:47,989
It's the least I can do, right?

189
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:51,710
I know you didn't have to do it.
I appreciate it.

190
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,278
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

191
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:56,057
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,706
Yeah.

193
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,316
How're you feeling, Beck?

194
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,715
About a third to midland.

195
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,498
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.

196
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,815
Thought I was going to
acclimatize faster than this.

197
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,781
Uh.
You'll be alright.

198
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,063
Go on, critters

199
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,695
Woo.

200
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,975
- Well.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,633
How close did you get?

202
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,500
I got really close,
but...

203
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,897
got a lateness ,
pretty shot anyways, so...

204
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,071
I think I would have
made a run for it.

205
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,931
- Everyday I wake up thinking that.
- Then why didn't you do it?

206
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,099
Because I turned him around.

207
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,908
1:15 (PM) of the South Summit.

208
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:06,367
That condition, we weren't going to
make that 2 PM turn around.

209
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,304
It's all good more to make
the top, Beck.

210
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,884
but you pay me
to bring you down safely.

211
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,502
Remember that.

212
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,215
Okay.

213
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,863
What's eating him?

214
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,363
One of those Sherpas is Tenzing.
He had an accident.

215
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,596
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,923
... on the icefall.

217
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:36,811
It's not good,
had to bring him down.

218
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:56,103
TENGOCHE MONASTERY : 12,687 ft
3,867 m

219
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:18,102
Blessing at Tengboche Monastery

220
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:19,611
Namaste.

221
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,284
Namaste.

222
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:33,900
THE CLIMBERS' MEMORIALS, THOK LA : 16,000 ft
4,877 metres

223
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,390
EVEREST BASE CAMP : 17,600 ft
5,367 metres

224
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:25,440
Congratulation, you all made it.
Welcome to Base Camp.

225
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,537
It'll be a united nations
here this year.

226
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:30,468
We've the Allmax teams.
South africans.

227
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,356
And right up here,

228
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,752
in the best spot of all,

229
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,261
we have the Adventure Consultants
Base Camp.

230
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:41,384
- Hey.
- Hi, Helen.

231
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,121
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

232
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:45,652
- Welcome, nice to see you.
- Thank you.

233
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,156
- Hi, Rob.
- Hey.

234
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,498
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah, good. You?

235
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:52,151
- Yeah. You know, we're good.
- Yeah, it looks good.

236
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:53,438
For those of you that haven't met.

237
00:15:53,463 --> 00:15:55,932
This is Helen Wilton,
Base Camp manager.

238
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:59,478
She'll be your mom
for the next... few weeks.

239
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,584
Any problems take it to her,
and she'll sort it.

240
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:02,796
Alright.
Um.

241
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:05,806
Well, it's very nice to finally
meet you all in person.

242
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,311
Ang Dorjee, come here.

243
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,010
This is Ang Dorjee, everyone.

244
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,071
He's you climbing sirdar,
your lead sherpa.

245
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,978
- Hey, how are you?
- Okay.

246
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:17,876
- You... You speak English?
- Better than you, Mr. America.

247
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:21,572
- Bet you climb better than I do, huh?
- Yeah.

248
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:23,297
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

249
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:24,943
Ang summit it 3 times, Beck.

250
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:26,488
Alright, alright.
I hear you, I hear you.

251
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:28,716
Alright. Well, there's tea
in the mess tin

252
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:31,164
when you dumped your sacks.
And...

253
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,497
The comm's tent down the back.

254
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:35,131
That's the cooking tent
and over there

255
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:37,116
- is the toilet.
- All good?

256
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:40,803
It's a little bit drafty,
but just remember that...

257
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,209
When the wind gets
upheave, you got

258
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,775
the same view as
George Everest did.

259
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,746
For those of you who haven't
used crampons before

260
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,606
left and right are mark
you can't get it wrong.

261
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,176
- Alright, so, simple.
- Okay.

262
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,855
First of all, you push it
into the shoe, like this.

263
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,945
Unbelievable.

264
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,400
If it isn't the
mayor of Base Camp.

265
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,721
Scott Fischer,
Mr. Mountain Madness.

266
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:12,908
In the flesh.

267
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,502
You want a cup?

268
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:17,712
Sit down, man.
Acclimatize.

269
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,995
Okay. I'm normally a
tea man myself, but...

270
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,011
- Let's give it a go.
- Thank you so much.

271
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,611
Well, it's crazy this year, aye.

272
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,143
I know, man.

273
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,893
Some idiot kiwi goes and
advance Himalaya guide here.

274
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:37,998
Look what happens.

275
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,638
Yeah. Didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

276
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,926
Got to make a living, man.

277
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,009
You... went ahead and
fixed the ice post, I see.

278
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,641
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty messy up there this year.

279
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,185
- Yeah?
- The vasses are pretty big.

280
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,348
Strung 4 or 5 ladders across.

281
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,469
You use good ropes there, did you?

282
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:57,651
You ready?
Okay.

283
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,105
This is April 7th
about 10:30 am

284
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,057
This is Sandy Hill Pittman reporting
for Nbc Interactive Media

285
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,947
and we are official at
Everest Base Camp.

286
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,875
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,758
Someone went and stole my journalist
so I had to get another one.

288
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:16,561
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer, that's for sure.

289
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,358
Listen, just to be clear
I didn't steal your journalist.

290
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,759
Hey, man.
It's all good.

291
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,945
- Outside magazine gave me a call...
- Hey.

292
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,471
- They gave me a call...
- Hey!

293
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:25,594
-  said they wanted...
- It's all good.

294
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,217
they're going to sent
a journalist up the hill

295
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,564
and asked me if
I was interested.

296
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,870
It was his call in the end.

297
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,994
Alright.
Carol Mackenzie, team doctor.

298
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,595
Why don't you kick it off, Carol.

299
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,383
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Carol.

300
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,867
Hi, there.

301
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,895
- Hey, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

302
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,519
Um. So...
Rob and Harold and Mike

303
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:59,184
will tell you all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering.

304
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,422
but, from a medical stand of point,

305
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,874
getting you to the top of Everest
was really about oxygen.

306
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,660
and the lack of it.

307
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,553
To give you the best chance
of summiting,

308
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,897
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

309
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:14,754
So, over the next month
before the final ascend,

310
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,687
you are going to make
3 partial acclimatizing ascends,

311
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:20,809
returning here, to Base Camp,
after each one.

312
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:25,078
The bad news is that each ascend
begins and ends with the icefall.

313
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:28,240
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

314
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,145
There're millions of tons of glacier ice
continue moving day and night.

315
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,383
Your crevasses so deep they
probably don't even have a bottom.

316
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,834
It is not a place that you want to
get caught hanging out in,

317
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,721
especially when the sun hits it.

318
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:46,268
So, we're going to be up, nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

319
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,879
Now, the Sherpas are going ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

320
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,414
and we've made it
as safe as we possibly can.

321
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:54,421
But, that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

322
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:57,091
19 people have died
in that icefall.

323
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:00,635
- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Hold on.

324
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:02,767
Steady.

325
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,642
- You alright, Jon?
- You alright?

326
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,971
- I'm good. Okay.
- Alright, steady up.

327
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,573
So, remember,
we're a team,

328
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,533
let's look up for each other.

329
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:16,260
 - Lookout for hypothermia.
(CAMP ONE : 19,500 ft  : 5,944 m)

330
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:19,988
Things like slur speech
and irrational behaviour.

331
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,505
I've seen hypoxia climbers
ripped off all their clothes

332
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,576
at 8000 m because
they are feeling hot.

333
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,851
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

334
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:34,086
to the point of lost of motor
function and eventually death.

335
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,902
And pulmonary edema, which is
your lungs filling with fluid.

336
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,138
till you fatally drown.

337
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:43,538
The only cure is to get
down the mountain fast.

338
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,150
- Alright. Okay.
- Alright, buddy.

339
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:47,631
But, it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

340
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:51,322
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

341
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,274
and you will acclimatize naturally.

342
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,211
So, why don't we all,
give Carol a nice big thank you.

343
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:58,768
- Oh, you don't have to give me that.
- It's her first time here.

344
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,104
- Hey.
- Alright.

345
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:01,793
Nice job.

346
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:06,017
April 23rd

347
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,889
CAMP TWO : 21,300 ft
6,492 m

348
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,642
- Well done.
- Have a seat.

349
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:18,044
You want to get on the regulator
or you want to hear that

350
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:20,842
Can you get hosed.

351
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,755
- Yasuko.
- Beck.

352
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,456
- How're you doing, darling?
- Okay.

353
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:25,550
- Good?
- Yeah.

354
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:27,189
- Well done.
- Hang in there.

355
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:29,121
Help yourself with that.

356
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,744
In a situation like this,
you just want to catch your breath

357
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,946
go right up to 4, you should
start feeling pretty good.

358
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:35,153
Yeah, I can feel that already.

359
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,651
How did you boys go?

360
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,234
- Instant happiness.
- Hey.

361
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,984
- Amazing.
- Very happy.

362
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,322
- Doug, you okay?
- Huh?

363
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,809
When we get back to base,
I want you to...

364
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,049
get Carol to get
a look at you.

365
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,330
Nah, I'm alright.
I'm okay.

366
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,352
Then... do me a favor,
swinge another oxygen.

367
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:55,698
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

368
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,993
- You got enough?
- We got plenty.

369
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,448
Alright.

370
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,604
Get some tea in here.

371
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,290
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

372
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:06,840
Thank you.

373
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,976
Now, take a deep breath for me.

374
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,387
Just take one of those
in the morning

375
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,936
with a little bit of water
before breakfast.

376
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,442
Okay. thanks.

377
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,085
- Right, Beck. You're up.
- Sorry.

378
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,007
Yeah.
Go for it.

379
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:29,262
Read it and weep.

380
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,562
Take it easy there.

381
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,405
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

382
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,947
- You're in great shape, Beck.
- I'm in great shape.

383
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,041
- Yeah.
- 6 days a week in the gym

384
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,371
- ought to do it.
- Your wife must have love that.

385
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,369
Yeah, she does.

386
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:48,082
Oh no.
What's the date today?

387
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,589
- April 25th.
- No.

388
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,474
No.

389
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,399
I need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

390
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:02,770
You might want to look at this one first,
came in for you last night.

391
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,367
Happy Anniversary Beck
- Peach.

392
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:08,531
Lord.

393
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,819
What?

394
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,561
Can I-Can I use your satphone?

395
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:16,130
Woo. Well, if this did come in
last night, it is an emergency.

396
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:18,844
- It's...  25 bucks a minute, Beck.
- Yeah, fine.

397
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,677
- No. This one is on us.
- Seriously.

398
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,240
Thanks.

399
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:26,219
Rob.

400
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,923
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

401
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:31,451
What happened?

402
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,577
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm fine.

403
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:35,919
Where-Where are you?

404
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:38,976
I'm at Base Camp right now.

405
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,995
You're calling me from Everest?

406
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,711
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

407
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,914
Oh my god.
How much is that costing?

408
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:48,658
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem, Peach.

409
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,505
I'm sorry, we were
up at Camp 2 and

410
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,557
that's why I didn't send
you a fax yesterday.

411
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,444
Happy anniversary.
Okay.

412
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,002
- Get off.
- Mom.

413
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:03,625
- How're the kids?
- Fine.

414
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,164
- Hey.
- Peach.

415
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,372
- Get off.
- Bud's here.

416
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,988
Doing his homework
in the morning as per usual.

417
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,488
You want to say hi to him?

418
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:13,798
Yeah, of course I do.

419
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:14,969
- Hang on.
- Okay.

420
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,029
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad.

421
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,253
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

422
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,026
I miss you, buddy.

423
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,676
Oh, and Meg went
on her first date.

424
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:24,104
- Mom.
- ...last weekend. Well, you did.

425
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,811
- Wow. Really?
- Um-hum.

426
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:28,724
- Get off.
- Peach.

427
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,266
I missed you, honey.

428
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:35,511
Mom?
Mom.

429
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:37,516
Missed the kids...

430
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,881
a lot.

431
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,472
Peach.

432
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:46,525
Listen, I got to get
the kids to school.

433
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,702
So, I got to run.

434
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,190
Okay.

435
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:52,943
Yeah.
Go careful.

436
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:54,690
Bye bye.

437
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,552
Is Dad okay?

438
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,742
Just... he never calls.

439
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,220
He's...

440
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:06,715
I think he's scared.

441
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:13,435
? It's going nowhere
on the mantlepiece ?

442
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,695
? Well, do I lie like
a loungeroom lizard ?

443
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,001
Yeah.

444
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:21,310
Beck.
Come in mate, come on.

445
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,500
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

446
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:27,789
You don't dance.
You don't climb.

447
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,468
Come on, guys.
Beck Weathers.

448
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:31,604
- Yeah.
- Come on, Beck. Come on.

449
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:36,498
- Go dance.
- Go go.

450
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,962
? ... take the weather with you ?

451
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,105
? Everywhere you go,

452
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,361
always take the weather,
the weather with you ?

453
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,169
Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?

454
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:48,517
Yeah, you want some?

455
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:51,797
No. I'll...
I'll wait till we summit.

456
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:55,272
I don't know about that, Neal.

457
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:57,673
We'll get there.

458
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,177
I'm excited.

459
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:03,016
Anyway, me and Anatoli are here
to help you, you know.

460
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,581
It's too much competition, Anatoli.

461
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:14,038
We don't need competition
 between people.

462
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:21,673
This competition, between
every person and this mountain.

463
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:28,292
The last word always
belongs to the mountain.

464
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,457
LHOTSE FACE : 12,400 ft
7,132 m

465
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:54,301
- Ang Dorjee.
- Yeah!

466
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,973
Stay there, Beck.
Stay there.

467
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,364
Okay, I'm coming down.

468
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:05,185
Harold, Mike.
The rope.

469
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,959
This isn't happening, guys.

470
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:10,699
Let's turn him around.

471
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:13,399
Get him off the Face,
and back to the Base Camp

472
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,581
Turn around.

473
00:27:14,606 --> 00:27:16,285
Ang Dorjee. Come on,
we're going down.

474
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,535
Okay.

475
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,505
My hands!

476
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:28,817
Okay, make a fist again.
Just kind of keep clenching

477
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:30,752
to keep the blood flow.

478
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:35,125
What's going on, man?

479
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,534
Still waiting for the south Africans.

480
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,512
Taiwanese took forever as well.

481
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:44,665
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

482
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,908
Yeah, yeah.
Your yak fun money is coming.

483
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,632
- You serious man?
- Come on. Get a move on.

484
00:27:57,765 --> 00:28:00,271
- How long you're been waiting him?
- A good 45 minutes.

485
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:02,625
- Man, it's freezing.
- Yeah.

486
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,688
- Stinging, huh?
- Yeah.

487
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:07,722
- Hey, Rob, we got to get him over!
- We're working on it.

488
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:09,623
He's freezing, man.

489
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:12,691
- Are you set?
- Yeah.

490
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,536
- We're sending him over, mate.
- Do it.

491
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:24,075
Keep going, Beck.

492
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,768
Looking good.

493
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:36,099
- That's it.
- Now, head up, mate. Head up.

494
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:54,743
Hold on, Beck!

495
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,033
- Whoaaaa.
- Pull. Pull.

496
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:58,582
Help. Help!
Help!

497
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,547
Beck, you alright?

498
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,989
Are these ladders
going to take 2.

499
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,721
Yeah. I'll get a rope.
I'll belay you, okay!

500
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:06,229
- Stay right where you are, mate.
- I can't pull yourself up!

501
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:08,593
I'm going to
come after you.

502
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:11,487
Good-Good, Beck.
You're okay.

503
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:13,072
Untie these,
you got to tie me in.

504
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:14,199
Come and get me.

505
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:15,618
- On belay.
- Got it, on belay.

506
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:16,953
Let's go.

507
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:19,984
I'm coming after you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

508
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,816
Nice and easy,

509
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,425
- I can't feel my hands!
- Looking good.

510
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,457
Help me.

511
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:33,528
- Beck. Beck. Beck.
- Help me!

512
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,077
Stay right where you are, mate.

513
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:36,435
- Can't pull myself up.
- I'm right here. I'm here.

514
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,552
I can't pull myself up!

515
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,997
I got you.

516
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:50,599
You okay?

517
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,888
No guarantees to the Summit.
I get it.

518
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:55,971
I can get killed because
I'm waiting in line.

519
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,269
Like I'm in a freaking Wal-mart.

520
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,625
Not while I paid you $65,000

521
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,076
Now get me off of here.

522
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:08,658
That's it.
Plant your feet, one at a time.

523
00:30:14,754 --> 00:30:17,090
Alright, thanks for coming by.
(Meeting for guides, organizers)

524
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,362
Look. Base Camp as you know
is chalked up all this year, so...

525
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,590
I think it'll
all benefit us greatly

526
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,389
by coming together like this
and you know,

527
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,376
working out some kind
of plan and schedule.

528
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:28,989
- What, like some kind of rotor?
- Yes.

529
00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:30,717
On Everest.

530
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:35,347
Everyone knows Everest is a business
for you, Rob, but are you kidding?

531
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:38,049
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't.

532
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,072
I'm not telling you, man.
I'm asking.

533
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:42,547
If we know when everybody is
planning to summit, for instance...

534
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:46,104
You know we can avoid the chaos
that happened at the Icefall today.

535
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,772
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10th.

536
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,067
So are we, man.

537
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:52,493
- Us too.
- May 10th.

538
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:57,384
Okay, that's bumper to bumper
traffic on the Hillary step.

539
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:58,693
Yes it is, that's my point.

540
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:02,191
Look, this is ridiculous.
We summiting when we want.

541
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:06,190
Alright. And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

542
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:08,082
Ian, have you seen how
many people are here

543
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:10,012
- ... at Base Camp this year.
- We're finish here.

544
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,130
- Come on, lads.
- Hey, man.

545
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,453
Ah.
Come in, man.

546
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:30,844
- Hi.
- Ha ha.

547
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,296
- Have a drink, Rob.
- Yeah, have a drink.

548
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,707
Na zdorovye. (*To health.)

549
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:37,200
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)

550
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:39,919
- With a word. Yeh.
- Um-hum.

551
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,845
- You're a little crook, huh.
- I know, it's just a little.

552
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,552
- A little touch of the deli belly.
- He means Buddha belly.

553
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,354
What's going on Roberto?

554
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,076
I don't like the look of the
crowds on the ropes.

555
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:12,708
We ran into some trouble
once we're above Camp 3.

556
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,142
Well. You want to top
on the 10th, yeah?

557
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,013
- Yeah.
- So do I.

558
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,507
What're you saying,
we should team up?

559
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,811
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

560
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:26,246
Oh, man.

561
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,827
Oh, I don't know, man.

562
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:32,586
We have different styles, man.
Like...

563
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,291
All due respect,
you're a hand holder.

564
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:37,850
I mean the best, but...

565
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,192
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

566
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:42,677
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

567
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:45,471
You guide your team,
I guide my.

568
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,027
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

569
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:52,252
The only way we both summit, mate,
is that we work together.

570
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:54,755
Particularly fixing the ropes.

571
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:57,419
It's got to make sense.

572
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:01,489
Ah.

573
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,396
Why not.

574
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:09,165
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

575
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,415
Okay then.

576
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,867
- Thanks, Scott.
- Alright.

577
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:15,673
Who's going to lead
when we get up there.

578
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,784
Rob, if I say I want to lead,
could it be done?

579
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,619
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Okay, hey.

580
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:32,971
You got to work with Ang Dorjee.
'cause we're working together now.

581
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:38,195
He's just saying if both of us...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

582
00:33:38,706 --> 00:33:40,009
Okay.

583
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:41,937
Ang Dorjee.

584
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:44,942
We're all professionals here.

585
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,611
We work together and
we get the job done.

586
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,482
- Yes?
- Alright, yeah.

587
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:51,402
We're planning of stashing,
what 8 bottles of "O"

588
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:52,739
 over the South Summit.

589
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,081
- Well, I'm not using "O".
- What do you mean?

590
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:57,121
- You're not using oxygen at all?
- Come on man, you know you want it.

591
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,832
In his health, don't need it.

592
00:33:58,857 --> 00:34:01,415
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

593
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,648
You have people's lives
in your hands. It's a job.

594
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:06,599
Never used it.
Never will.

595
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:09,340
Bigger problems if you run out.

596
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,325
Okay.

597
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,039
I'll put some more
bottles of "O" up there.

598
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,207
- You know, that would be good.
- Alright.

599
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:16,742
Just as long as
you guys are clear.

600
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,523
You work for me you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

601
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:20,833
Hey, you don't have to ask me.

602
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:24,277
I've been up here before without "O"s, Rob.
I don't need to deal with clients.

603
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:26,465
- Alright. Next we have the fixed ropes.
- Yeah.

604
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,385
Particularly, above the Lhotse Face.

605
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,127
You let us start
make new fixed rope.

606
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,042
- And Southeast Ridge as well.
- Yes, it does.

607
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,212
Well. My idea is that
we work together

608
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:37,555
and we fix ropes together,
we share the duties.

609
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,773
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

610
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:40,358
Alright, you and Lopsang
maybe get together,

611
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:43,497
talk about who want to
fix what and where, okay?

612
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,421
Ah.
Only essentials.

613
00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:48,661
I'm not going to tell you what to pack,
but be brutal, okay.

614
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,659
1 pound down here
is like 10 up there.

615
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,923
Light and fast.
Light and fast.

616
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:58,971
What, and just like that
you-you killed my summit cappuccino.

617
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,813
Go go go.
Run.

618
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:04,461
That camera is totally daine.
( May 5th )

619
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:06,730
Alright, it's going to be a tough week.
( May 5th )

620
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:10,086
But, it's going to be the
best Friday of your lives.

621
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:12,398
Hey, what-what are we
doing in a boat?

622
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:15,001
- Summiting!
- Summiting!
- Summiting...!

623
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,112
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yeah, you.

624
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:20,143
 I take 3.

625
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:23,165
- It's from Jan.
- You can't look at my card.

626
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,025
I knew it was
going to be a girl.

627
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,123
I can't believe it.

628
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:29,484
It's a girl!

629
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:32,572
- Yeah!
- That's great.

630
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,058
Alright, good on you.

631
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,446
I know. I knew.
I knew she was.

632
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,165
- Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
- Cheers, mate.

633
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,824
When is she due?

634
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,398
Mid July.
As soon as I get back.

635
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:45,771
- You can't leave now, buddy.
- Yeah, that's true.

636
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,328
Hey, Rob.

637
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,768
 Yeah?

638
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,638
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

639
00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:54,206
Oh oh.
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

640
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:56,818
It's okay. I'm...
Jan's a climber, Jon. She gets it.

641
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,810
- Oh yeah?
- She is, Helen.

642
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,342
Now you, Doug.
What about your wife?

643
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,444
Oh, she's been fine with it
ever since we divorced.

644
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:06,464
- She's been great with everything since then.
- I'm so sorry, buddy.

645
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:07,991
- Oh, no, don't
- I'm sorry.

646
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,629
No no no.
I asked because

647
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:13,045
Peach said to me, "If you climb
1 more mountain, I will divorce you."

648
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,810
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip.

649
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:16,710
- Oh.
- Ow...

650
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:19,692
No no no. The worst-
The worst part of it is that, I...

651
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:22,532
I kind of forgot to tell her.

652
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,967
- No.
- Ha ha ha.

653
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:26,928
I forgot to tell her.
I did.

654
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,823
Alright.
It's all on the table here.

655
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:32,635
It hurts. It's dangerous.
It...

656
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,770
destroys relationships.
It's costing you all a small fortune.

657
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:37,407
- Were there any negative aspects?
- Yeah.

658
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:40,350
Come on, I got to ask the question.
You know I do.

659
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:42,263
Why?

660
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,295
Why?

661
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:47,127
Because

662
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:49,621
- Because it's there!
- It's there!
- It's there!

663
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:51,709
That's why.
Thank you Mr. Mallory.

664
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:54,261
Come on, guys,
I'm-I'm serious.

665
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:55,751
- Yasuko.
- Huh?

666
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,887
Why are you climbing Everest?

667
00:36:58,555 --> 00:36:59,565
Uh.

668
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,847
I'm 47 years old.

669
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:04,242
I have reached
6 of the 7 summits.

670
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:09,072
So. Of course, now I have to
reach the 7th.

671
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,288
- It's not an answer.
- Oh.

672
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,165
Why...
No, why any summits?

673
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,688
- Well. I...
- Doug.

674
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,318
Why?

675
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:19,066
- Come on. Tell him about the kids.
- What.

676
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,435
- Tell him about the kids.
- Yeah.

677
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,657
- Oh. I...
- You have kids?

678
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:25,476
Yeah, I have kids.
But...

679
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:29,720
I thought I told you their's...
their elementary school back home.

680
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:31,894
I've been going and talking
to the kids there and they

681
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:35,144
actual helped me raised some
of the money to come and...

682
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:38,312
gave me a flag to plant
on the Summit and...

683
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,735
so, I was thinking maybe it's...

684
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,811
they see an...a regular guy can,
you know, follow impossible dreams.

685
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:52,281
Maybe they will be inspired to
do the same, I guess.

686
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,441
I'm climbing Mount Everest
because I can.

687
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:04,457
Because, to be able to climb that high and
see that kind of beauty nobody ever sees,

688
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,810
it'll be a crime not to.

689
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,264
Yeh yeh, Dougy.

690
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,566
- There you go.
- I like that.

691
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:18,818
Hello.

692
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,476
Hey.
Did I wake you?

693
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,396
No.

694
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:26,090
I did to, you liar.

695
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:31,232
- You okay?
- Yeah.

696
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:34,536
Yeah yeah, I'm good.
I'm better. I'm better now.

697
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,659
I missed you.

698
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,020
We go for the final ascend tomorrow.

699
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:43,013
Oh. So, you're...
you summit on Friday?

700
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:44,976
Yeah.
10th.

701
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,813
- It's your lucky day.
- It is.

702
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,501
How's the weather?

703
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:52,518
It's good.

704
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,713
Yeah, I think we're going to
get a good window.

705
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,879
- So... It's a girl.
- Oh yeah.

706
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,565
And, did you go to the doctor?
Did you get your scan done?

707
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,246
- Did you see her?
- Yes, we're good.

708
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,919
And?
Come on, what does she look like?

709
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:11,872
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile.

710
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:15,283
Perfect height-weight ratio,
she's going to be a great climber.

711
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:20,851
She's there, Rob...
already.

712
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:23,670
- Wow.
- Me and you.

713
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,930
And a little bear, huh.

714
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,774
And in one day,

715
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,819
you,
me,

716
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,254
and our little Sarah, we'll all
go climbing together. Huh.

717
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,160
Sarah?

718
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,518
Yeah.
What do you think?

719
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,643
- No way.
- Come on.

720
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:44,102
- No.
- Please, think about it.

721
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:46,119
- No.
- Huh.

722
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:53,713
- You're still there?
- Of course I'm still here.

723
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,095
I love you.

724
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,388
I love you too.

725
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,292
Sleep well, my love.

726
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,673
Alright.
Bye.

728
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,991
Take it easy now,
you're going to be okay.

729
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,039
Okay, we're going to get
you down the hill. Alright.

730
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,814
Hey, Neal.
You okay?

731
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,149
Yeah. 
Dale, he doesn't look too good.

732
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:35,800
- I need to take him down.
- Yeah.

733
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:37,972
You can't get Scott 
on the radio?

734
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:41,026
No.
No, I think he's-he's up ahead.

735
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,692
Best not to stay
too long at the Summit.

736
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,827
It's a long way to go, man.

737
00:41:57,263 --> 00:42:00,604
Head down,
one step at a time.

738
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:02,736
You got it, boss.

739
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:06,768
You seen Dale?

740
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:09,727
Yeah, and he wasn’t
looking too good, but...

741
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:12,979
Neal seem to have
handle the situation.

742
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:14,364
Try to use your radio.

743
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:16,855
- You kidding me.
- No.

744
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:19,443
Guess it's not working, huh.

745
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:21,823
I'm going down to Camp 1.

746
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:23,801
If he's not doing so well,
I'm going to take him down to Base Camp.

747
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:25,169
and I'll head back up.

748
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:28,026
- You guys alright?
- Yeah.

749
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,046
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

750
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,853
Yeah.
I'll make it down in half the time.

751
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,957
I'm going to catch him.
Woo.

752
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,591

There you go,

761

Listen, I think you're on the
wrong mountain there.

762
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,630
Look, I can't talk and
we got to get out of here.

763
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:20,141
Alright, mate. Oh, listen.
You take care on the kiddy slope.

764
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,126
I ought to get back
 to the real thing.

765
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,932
Hey, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

766
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:36,439
Aye!
Watch out!

767
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:38,770
Aw!

768
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,414
ROB!

769
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:43,599
- Rob!
- I got you.

770
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:55,808
Harold, you okay?

771
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:00,735
Is everyone okay?

772
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,492
We're okay!

773
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:09,436
Come here, come here, come here.
Sit. Sit down, sit.

774
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:11,059
I'm fine.

775
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:13,926
Look at me.

776
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,172
- Look at me!
- I'm fine, mate.

777
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,355
Look at me, Harold.

778
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,187
Look.
I'm tell you, I'm alright.

779
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:20,174
- Okay.
- I'm alright.

780
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:23,848
- Harold.
- Thank you.

781
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:25,947
Don't do that to me again, aye.

782
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,926
Rob, I'm sorry.

783
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,085
Okay, mate.

00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,141
I'll get drop back with Frank,
he's struggling, alright?

785
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,533
- Alright.
- Okay.

786
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,800
- Alright. Straight here.

Hey, man.
Scott here.

791
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:52,933
I've been down to Base Camp
and I'm back to Camp 1.

792
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,302
I'm catch you tomorrow.

793
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:57,046
What? You not going to
rest up a day first, huh?

794
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:02,123
Scott, you sound a little rough.
Hey, take an extra day.

795
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:05,324
No way, Jose.
What, miss out on all the fun.

796
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:09,636
It's a lot of up and down in...
one day even for you, Scott.

797
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,071
You know what they say, man.

798
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,131
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

799
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:18,492
You sure you're 
going to be okay?

800
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:19,815
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

801
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,802
Just taking a shot of
dexamethasone now.

802
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:25,674
Just don't push yourself too hard.

803
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,812
Okay?
Over and out.

804
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,718
Rob, I've just been over the Miles
to get a weather update.

805
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:42,520
It's moving fast.
It's changed course slightly

806
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:46,246
and it could still go north but
if it doesn't

807
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:50,712
It's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

808
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,970
Get some weather forecast, Helen.

809
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:57,156
The mountain makes it's own weather.

810
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:59,118
We're keeping an eye on it.

811
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:01,458
Yeah, sure.
Just, letting you know.

812
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,223
Appreciate it, Helen.

813
00:46:05,782 --> 00:46:08,590
Why we do this to ourselves?

814
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:14,356
Oh, this is crazy.

815
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,581
You know I never told
Krakauer this.

816
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:24,285
When he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

817
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,089
When I'm at home...

818
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:30,199
I just got this big...

819
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,409
black cloud following me.

820
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:35,535
You know, like a depression.

821
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,282
When I'm out here...

822
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:40,894
on a mountain,
any mountain,

823
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:44,977
it's just like it's a cure.

824
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:48,546
Feel like I'm reborn.

825
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,038
So, you're happy now?

826
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,739
Now I'm starting to wonder.

827
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:59,483
This is suffering, man.

828
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:02,979
This is suffering.

829
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:04,788
Yeah.

830
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:07,569
Suffer a few more days.

831
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,435
The rest of your life, you'll be the guy
that climb to the top of Everest.

832
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:18,917
I just hope I get there.

833
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:21,514
Yeah.

834
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:25,094
Just hope I get there
and get home.

835
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,185
What do you think, Mike?

836
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:39,780
Almost pretty good.
A little bit of wind up high.

837
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:42,269
I mean, if it picks up, we can
always come back down.

838
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:45,102
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

839
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:47,823

842
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:47,606
- You, okay?
- Not good!

843
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:55,658
I'm hoping it's going to
die down after sun down.

844
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,650
Been doing that.

845
00:48:57,805 --> 00:48:59,360
I don't like this.

846
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:02,576
We don't go
if it doesn't calm.

847
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:06,731
- I talk to Scott when he come's here.
- Okay.

848
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,378
Scott!

849
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:23,530
- Scott!
- Anatoli, here.

850
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:36,639
Anatoli, where is Rob?

851
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:39,196
Where are they?
Did he go down?

852
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:43,132
Where's Rob?
What's Rob's team doing?

853
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:46,923
Rob will see
if it passes.

854
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:49,375
If he wait.

855
00:49:51,895 --> 00:49:54,735
- We wait.
- Okay.

856
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:59,197
Friday 10th May

857
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:03,249
00:30 AM

858
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:10,215
Hey, guys.

859
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,311
Come out and take a look.

860
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:29,012
At least somebody 
up there loves us.

861
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:30,610
Nothing.

862
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:36,019
Where the storm go?

863
00:50:36,612 --> 00:50:38,329
Exactly.

864
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:42,649
- That's crazy.
- You ready to saddle up?

865
00:50:45,012 --> 00:50:47,223
Okay, everyone.

866
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:49,175
We got a window.

867
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:51,428
We don't know how long
it's going to last.

868
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,702
But we're going to go for it.

869
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,887
Be ready in half an hour.

870
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:58,390
We have a 2 PM turn around.
Let's climb this thing.

871
00:50:58,415 --> 00:50:59,933
Okay.

872
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:06,436
So, today's the day, huh?

873
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:08,227
Yeah.

874
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,524
Now or never.

875
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:16,399
Oh boy.

876
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,919
The south Africans were
laid out at Camp 3.

877
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:24,223
They never made it into Camp 4.

878
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,915
Probably got caught up in it.

879
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,199
- Maybe it blew though early.
- Yeah. Well, it hit us all night.

880
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:33,074
But that was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

881
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:35,468
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

882
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:38,478
I'll radio Ed,
tell him you're continuing.

883
00:51:39,214 --> 00:51:41,234
Any messages?

884
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:44,448
Yeah. Ring Jan, tell her that
we're heading out.

885
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:47,800
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the Summit.

886
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,783
Turn around is 2 PM.

887
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:51,724
Good luck and
god speed to you all.

888
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:53,590
Okay. Thanks, Helen.
Bye bye.

889
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:54,917
I'll see you guys up there.

890
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:56,257
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

891
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,274
I get a couple of hours of sleep
and I'll be right behind you.

892
00:51:58,299 --> 00:51:59,494
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

893
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,397
- Have fun, Pittman. Yeah.
- You get some rest, okay.

894
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:03,566
See you there.

895
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:06,545
- You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?
- Yeah.

896
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

897
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,496
Okay.

898
00:52:18,578 --> 00:52:22,477
THE BALCONY : 27,600 ft
8,412 m

899
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:25,538
04:30 AM

900
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:28,133
Can we go any faster?

901
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:29,882
Not a chance we can
go faster here.

902
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:33,321
It's too difficult.
This could take a while.

903
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,334
We're losing time.

904
00:53:02,498 --> 00:53:04,525
Beck, what's wrong?

905
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,336
I don't know.

906
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:12,312
I had a operation couple 
of years ago on my eyes.

907
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:14,023
That might be it.

908
00:53:14,048 --> 00:53:15,624
I don't know.

909
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:19,341
Okay.
Guys, go in front of us.

910
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:22,108
- Alright, Beck, let's sit you down.
- Okay.

911
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:30,954
Beck.
Look at me.

912
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:34,079
I need to send you down
with someone.

913
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,803
- No. I don't want to go down, Rob.
- No, you got to go down.

914
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:37,933
I don't want to go down.

915
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:42,988
Okay.

916
00:53:45,747 --> 00:53:48,757
Alright, Beck.
Listen.

917
00:53:48,782 --> 00:53:50,952
You can wait here for half and hour.
Beck, listen to me.

918
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:56,259
If it gets better by then,
join in the queue and keep going up.

919
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:57,494
If it doesn't get better, Beck,

920
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,291
- I'm sorry, mate. It's over.
- Okay.

921
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:03,128
Sherpas are going to go and drop off the
extra oxygen on the south side while they can.

922
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:06,382
I'm going to send one of them
down for you. Is that clear?

923
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:08,654
- Yeah?
- Alright.

924
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,825
Okay, mate.
Alright.

925
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:16,944
God speed.

926
00:54:17,975 --> 00:54:20,174
Sandy, do you want to go down?

927
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:22,831
What?
No, no way.

928
00:54:22,856 --> 00:54:24,946
Look, Lopsang, I'm going
to make it to the top.

929
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:27,070
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

930
00:54:27,095 --> 00:54:30,584
- I'm not going back, okay?
- Okay.

931
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:34,511
THE SOUTH EAST RIDGE

932
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,607
Hey, where are the ropes?

933
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:46,129
There is no rope.
No rope.

934
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:48,012
Yeah?
They should have been fixed.

935
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,667
Do you have more 
in your pack.

936
00:54:49,692 --> 00:54:52,329
Lopsang has the ropes.
He's not here.

937
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:55,819
- Harold, no ropes?
- No.

938
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:58,472
- Harold.
- Neal.

939
00:54:58,497 --> 00:54:59,817
Hey, Rob.

940
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,667
Listen, we got a 
problem here, mate.

941
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:05,409
There's no fixed ropes on the
crevasse to Hillary Step, over.

942
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:06,955
Where is Ang Dorjee and Lopsang?

943
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,247
Yeah, I got Ang Dorjee here
but there's not sign of Lopsang.

944
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:14,385
So, me, Neal, Anatoli are going
to set some new ones, over.

945
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,780
- Fine then.
- Yeah.

946
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:18,139
- Good.
- Let's do it.

947
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:25,773
- What's going on?
- No fixed rope.

948
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:27,446
What?

949
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,948
That's it.

950
00:55:57,973 --> 00:56:00,338
1 step at a time, Doug.

951
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,640
Come on, Dougy.
Deep breaths, Dougy.

952
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:12,577
Come on, mate.
Keep it on. Keep it on.

953
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,662
- Rob.
- Deep breaths, Dougy. Hang on.

954
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,205
Hang on.

955
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:26,073
You can do this , Dougy.

956
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:28,897
- I know you can, pal.
- Yeah?

957
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,832
I don't want to see you
back here a third time, mate.

958
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,940
John.
You heading back down?

959
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:55,377
There's a hold up.

960
00:56:55,402 --> 00:56:57,463
There's no fixed ropes 
above the South Summit.

961
00:56:57,488 --> 00:56:58,818
Yeah.
I know, mate.

962
00:56:58,843 --> 00:57:00,782
But we are sorting that
situation out now.

963
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,133
Ran out of juice waiting.

964
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:05,699
Go.
I'm sorry, Rob.

965
00:57:05,724 --> 00:57:07,848
That's your call, pal.

966
00:57:10,611 --> 00:57:13,291
I don't want to run out
of oxygen up there.

967
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:15,597
Sorry, Rob.

968
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,666
We've a little bit of a set back.

969
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:26,865
Lou, Stuart and John Taske
just turned back, just...

970
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,922
just below the South Summit.

971
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:32,066
- How are the conditions so far?
- Cold and windy.

972
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:36,038
- Okay, let me know, Rob.
- Okay, Helen. Thanks, bye bye.

973
00:57:37,322 --> 00:57:39,030
I hope we're not looking 
at another year

974
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,493
with no clients at the top.

975
00:57:41,853 --> 00:57:43,969
Well, if that ain't going to
move them pretty soon.

976
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,114
They're out of time, aren't they?

977
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:48,107
Yeah.
And...

978
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:51,698
What's Jon going to say
about that in his article.

979
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:53,739
- It's Rob.
(THE HILLARY STEP : 28,740 ft  : 8,760 m)

980
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:54,842
- Guy.
(THE HILLARY STEP : 28,740 ft  : 8,760 m)

981
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:57,171
- We just lost Lou, Stuart and John Taske.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

982
00:57:57,196 --> 00:57:59,341
What's going on?
What's the hold up?

983
00:57:59,372 --> 00:58:01,019
Yeah, yeah, mate.
We...

984
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:05,259
We sent Anatoli and Neal
to the top of the Step

985
00:58:05,284 --> 00:58:07,457
fixing the ropes.

986
00:58:07,482 --> 00:58:10,776
We're at the-
at the Face's Step, over.

987
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,158
Rob, Mike.

988
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:15,454
- How's Doug doing?
- Doug's just behind me.

989
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:17,756
I left him behind
to scoot forward.

990
00:58:17,781 --> 00:58:19,756
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now.
Yep, that's me.

991
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,771
Let's move this

992
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:24,041
as quickly as possible, over.

993
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:27,709
We'll start moving everybody up
as soon as we get the all clear.

994
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:31,456
Rob to base. Rob to base, Hel.
Copy, Helen.

995
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,637
- You alright?
- Copy. Base camp to Rob.

996
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:35,505
Have you... Have you
heard from Scott?

997
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,356
Anyone manage to find
out where he is, over.

998
00:58:38,457 --> 00:58:41,385
Woo-Eee!
Yo, dude.

999
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:44,647
Look. Where are you, mate? We got a
real logjam here at the Hillary Step, over.

1000
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:47,038
- I'm more than an hour behind.
- Just chill.

1001
00:58:47,063 --> 00:58:49,788
People just sitting there
using up their oxygen.

1002
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:51,871
Get here as soon as you can.

1003
00:58:53,844 --> 00:58:55,863
- Oh my god. You okay, Beck?
- Yeah.

1004
00:58:55,888 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh I got a little problem with my eyes.
You guys turning back?

1005
00:59:00,025 --> 00:59:02,441
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step.

1006
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:05,474
It's crazy.
Come down with us.

1007
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:08,658
No, I can't.
Promise Rob I'd wait for him.

1008
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:10,025
- Your call.
- I'm good.

1009
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,665
See you down there.

1010
00:59:12,436 --> 00:59:15,035
Neal.
Andy.

1011
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:17,278
Okay, Anatoli.

1012
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,923
I'm done.

1013
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:23,484
All through.
Safe to climb.

1014
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:24,881
Okay, we're climbing up!

1015
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:26,166
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

1016
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,073
- You mind if I go first?
- Why.

1017
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,305
I'm running pretty low on "O".

1018
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:33,561
Rob, it's Mike here.

1019
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:36,147
Eh. We have the all clear
on this end.

1020
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:40,231
I'm going to stay here with Yasuko
till we got a clear line.

1021
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:43,874
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug. Over and out

1022
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:41,398
* 01:14 PM *

1023
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:43,211
We did it.

1024
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:02,961


1025
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,216
We did it!

1026
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:23,068
Thank you very much.

1027
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:25,323
Thank you, Mom.

1028
01:01:26,464 --> 01:01:29,509
* 02:00 PM *

1029
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:38,995
Yasuko.

1030
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,515
- Seven.
- Seven.

1031
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,223
- 7 summits.
- 7 summits.

1032
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:46,444
Come here.

1033
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:51,026
I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
So proud.

1034
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:52,835
Thank you.

1035
01:01:53,831 --> 01:01:57,663
Thank you.
Thank you.

1036
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:00,594
Rob to base.
Rob to base.

1037
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,766
Rob, this is Helen.
Hello, where are you?

1038
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:08,242
I'm at the top of Everest, Helen.
We made it.

1039
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,579
- Yeah.
- They did it.

1040
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:11,055
Copy us, over.

1041
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,160
Oh, we copy you 
loud and clear, Rob.

1042
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:15,925
It's wonderful to hear
your voice up there.

1043
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,255
Who are you with again, Beck?

1044
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,435
At the moment
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

1045
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,010
Good job, man.

1046
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:22,914
Rob, see you.
Thank you.

1047
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,669
Jon and Kasischke have
already been and gone.

1048
01:02:25,694 --> 01:02:27,614
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

1049
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:29,636
And-And what about Beck?

1050
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:32,360
Beck was having a problem
with his eye sight.

1051
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:36,827
He waited on the Southeast Ridge,
on the Balcony.

1052
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:39,008
For the first people 
who came back, over.

1053
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:42,192
And I... I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

1054
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,813
Moving off in a few minutes
just as soon I see Doug,

1055
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:46,645
we'll be heading 
back down, over.

1056
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,612
Alright, understood.
Oh, that's terrific, Rob.

1057
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:51,920
We're all keeping
our fingers cross for Doug.

1058
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:53,924
Over and out, Helen.

1059
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,062
- Congratulation.
- You're welcome.

1060
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:11,048
Yeah, ladsy.
You did it.

1061
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,332
Woo yee!

1062
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,687
You look terrible.

1063
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,060
My stories,
not so good, man.

1064
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:54,619
- You see Doug?
- Oh, yeah. He's way way...

1065
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:57,497
way back there, man.

1066
01:03:57,522 --> 01:04:00,810
Hey, Roberto.
Where're the rest of your guys.

1067
01:04:00,835 --> 01:04:04,281
'Cause I'm pretty sure
my whole team

1068
01:04:04,306 --> 01:04:05,619
made it up, yeah.

1069
01:04:05,644 --> 01:04:07,453
Heh heh heh.
I saw them.

1070
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:09,643
Don't worry.
I won't tell Krakauer.

1071
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:12,244
Hold on, mate.
I know it's bad, huh.

1072
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,315
I'll have to give you this year.

1073
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,679
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

1074
01:04:16,704 --> 01:04:18,108
- Lopsang.
- Yeah.

1075
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:20,348
Come, mate.
Let's get him down.

1076
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:28,601
Alright.

1077
01:04:28,813 --> 01:04:30,339
Let's go.

1078
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,515
Harold.
What're you doing?

1079
01:04:57,982 --> 01:05:00,211
I'm just trying to
sort out the "O".

1080
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,713
I can't find any full ones.

1081
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,593
There's full bottles,
I saw them on the way up.

1082
01:05:04,618 --> 01:05:05,697
No.

1083
01:05:05,722 --> 01:05:07,504
So I pretty sure you
should have another look.

1084
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,934
- No. They just have, they're not full.
- Harold. Listen, I saw...

1085
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:14,012
Look, Mike.
I've checked twice, alright.

1086
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:17,493
Yeah.
Alright, man.

1087
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:20,231
I'm going down.

1088
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,149
Harold.

1089
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:30,302
03:15 PM

1090
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,182
Doug. Doug.
Doug.

1091
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,894
- It's over, mate.
- No.

1092
01:05:35,919 --> 01:05:37,795
I' sorry.
No no no no.

1093
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,241
Doug.
You're too late, okay.

1094
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:43,545
You guys keep going, mate,
I'll catch up.

1095
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,306
Doug. Doug.
Doug, listen to me.

1096
01:05:45,331 --> 01:05:47,107
- It's way too long, it's over.
- No, it's not.

1097
01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:49,940
Now, listen to me, mate.
I'm sorry.

1098
01:05:49,965 --> 01:05:52,351
But I got to turn you around.

1099
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:53,878
Okay.

1100
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:56,441
I can do it.

1101
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:01,144
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1102
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:05,075
I'm not coming back next year, man.
It's my last chance.

1103
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:10,969
You got to let me do this.

1104
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:14,279
Let me do this.

1105
01:06:14,718 --> 01:06:16,419
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

1106
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:19,328
- Let's do it. Let's get it done.
- Alright.

1107
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:21,663
- Come on.
- Thanks, man.

1108
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,279
Alright, Doug.

1109
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:51,131
And there's no hope,
I get it.

1110
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:55,639
My double wide trailer.

1111
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:01,362
- Beck?
- What?

1112
01:07:01,387 --> 01:07:04,526
- Are you okay?
- Who is there?

1113
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:07,821
- It's Jon.
- I'm not seeing too well, Jon.

1114
01:07:07,846 --> 01:07:09,828
I'm freezing.

1115
01:07:10,747 --> 01:07:12,763
Mike's just behind me.

1116
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:14,722
He's back there with Yasuko.

1117
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:18,027
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1118
01:07:18,052 --> 01:07:19,835
You okay?

1119
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,673
I'll see you then.

1120
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:27,248
04:00 PM

1121
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:29,171
- There she is.
(04:00 PM)

1122
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:31,198
Almost there, mate.

1123
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:34,991
Dig deep, Doug.
Dig deep.

1124
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:36,653
There you go.

1125
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,807
There you go.

1126
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:53,556
Yehhhh!

1127
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,305
Huh, you made it.

1128
01:08:03,274 --> 01:08:04,964
You did it.
Huh.

1129
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:07,844
Yeah.
Because of you, man.

1130
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:19,561
Guy to Rob.
You read me, mate?

1131
01:08:21,983 --> 01:08:24,226
Guy to Rob.
Are you there?

1132
01:08:26,795 --> 01:08:28,735
This going to the kids.

1133
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:32,359
Yehhh!

1134
01:08:35,406 --> 01:08:37,253
Hang in there, Doug.

1135
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:38,816
Come on.

1136
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:40,908
Easy.
Here, I got it.

1137
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:43,402
Yeah.
I'm okay.

1138
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:45,399
Yeah, I got it.

1139
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:49,753
- Come on, let's get you up.
- I need...

1140
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,051
- Huh?
- Need more "O".

1141
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:52,358
No, Doug.
We can't give you more "O".

1142
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:54,977
We got to get down
to the South Summit, come on.

1143
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:03,524
Guy calling to Everest Base Camp.
Are you there, Helen?

1144
01:09:03,705 --> 01:09:05,846
Guy, this is Helen.
How is it going?

1145
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,262
Yeah, I'm fine.

1146
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:09,280
I got a clear view of the Summit
and...

1147
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:12,596
you know, we still got climbers up there.
They are not any of ours, right?

1148
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,049
We got 3 up and
they're all on their way down.

1149
01:09:15,074 --> 01:09:16,745
Well. What are they 
doing there so late?

1150
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,044
And there's 2 o'clock turn around time,
they're way past it.

1151
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:23,097
Here we go. Cloud coming out
of the valley. It's a lot of it.

1152
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:25,546
Thanks.
I'm calling them now, Guy.

1153
01:09:29,157 --> 01:09:31,377
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1154
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:35,760
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1155
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:43,860
Whoa!

1156
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:47,894
Easy. Easy. Easy, Dougy.
There you go. There you go.

1157
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:51,140
We're going to go
around the corner.

1158
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,063
That's it.

1159
01:09:56,629 --> 01:09:58,521
Rob, is that you?

1160
01:09:59,455 --> 01:10:00,833
Beck?

1161
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:02,659
It's Mike, mate.

1162
01:10:02,684 --> 01:10:05,531
- What're you doing here?
- I can't see, it's bad.

1163
01:10:05,578 --> 01:10:06,956
You guys alright?

1164
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:08,494
We got a problem with Beck.

1165
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:10,629
Hey, Mike.
We're getting low on "O".

1166
01:10:10,654 --> 01:10:12,021
We got to move.

1167
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:13,733
I'll get you to stand up, okay.

1168
01:10:13,758 --> 01:10:16,476
- I'll take Yasuko.
- That's it.

1169
01:10:18,698 --> 01:10:20,352
I got you.

1170
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:23,312
You're okay.

1171
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:28,916
Doug, come on.
Come on.

1172
01:10:36,009 --> 01:10:37,828
I'm cold.

1173
01:10:38,122 --> 01:10:40,263
<i>Oxygen level : 0</i>

1174
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,591
Mike, Harold, Ang Dorjee,

1175
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:47,355
put the brakes on, guys.
We got a problem.

1176
01:10:48,888 --> 01:10:50,656
- We're out of gas, Doug.
- Alright.

1177
01:10:50,681 --> 01:10:52,955
We're out of gas. We need to 
keep moving, come on.

1178
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,306
Come on.

1179
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:59,336
Mike, Harold, do you copy?
I need someone...

1180
01:10:59,361 --> 01:11:02,453
I need someone to come 
back up with oxygen, over.

1181
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:07,319
Somebody, please.
I'm begging you.

1182
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:11,252
Doug, come on, mate.
Come on!

1183
01:11:12,387 --> 01:11:14,784
Harold, do you copy, over.

1184
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:19,399
Has anyone got eyes
 on Ang Dorjee?

1185
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:23,406
Mate, I have just had Ang Dorjee
go past me heading down, over.

1186
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:25,142
He's going down.

1187
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,697
Can you stop him?
Can you turn him around?

1188
01:11:26,722 --> 01:11:28,483
I need someone
to come back up now.

1189
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:31,409
Hey!
Ang Dorjee.

1190
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,528
Ang Dorjee!

1191
01:11:34,553 --> 01:11:36,523
Base camp, do you copy, over.

1192
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:38,643
Helen to Rob.
Go ahead.

1193
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:40,054
Helen, please.

1194
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:43,396
I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

1195
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:45,403
I can't get him down 
without it.

1196
01:11:45,428 --> 01:11:47,549
I'm really stuck.

1197
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,322
Understood.

1198
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:53,188
That you need a bottle of oxygen
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

1199
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:55,708
We're sending it up to you
as soon as we can.

1200
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:58,911
At the top.
At the top.

1201
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:01,362
The last thing I said to
Ang Dorjee was please

1202
01:12:01,387 --> 01:12:04,001
bring 2 bottles of gas
at the South Summit.

1203
01:12:04,026 --> 01:12:07,360
Yes, uh.
Copy that, Rob.

1204
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:11,429
Boys. There's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

1205
01:12:11,454 --> 01:12:14,111
No, Rob!
This is Harold.

1206
01:12:14,136 --> 01:12:18,572
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1207
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:20,974
Repeat.
No "O".

1208
01:12:21,793 --> 01:12:24,979
Ang Dorjee stashed
4 bottles there, Harold.

1209
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:27,137
Harold, where are you?

1210
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:31,418
Can you hear me, Harold?

1211
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:33,158
Harold.

1212
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,089
Harold, can you hear me?

1213
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:36,597
Figure it'll take me about

1214
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:39,490
half an hour to get back up 
to the South Summit.

1215
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:44,214
Okay.

1216
01:12:44,472 --> 01:12:46,077
I'm coming.

1217
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:48,906
If you don't have oxygen, mate,

1218
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,918
don't come up, don't come up.
We're moving on.

1219
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,927
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

1220
01:12:54,164 --> 01:12:56,837
Doug, come on, mate.
Come on!

1221
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:04,726
Rob, this is Base Camp.
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1222
01:13:05,513 --> 01:13:07,412
I copy you, Carol.

1223
01:13:07,437 --> 01:13:10,093
Rob, can you get yourself down?

1224
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:13,839
Carol, we're not 
at that point yet.

1225
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:16,614
Rob, can you let us know
who you're with?

1226
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:19,332
I'm with Doug.

1227
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:20,868
We're both listening.

1228
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:23,673
Come on, Dougy. Come on, mate.
One more alping, come on.

1229
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:26,029
Rob, what is Doug's 
state of consciousness?

1230
01:13:26,054 --> 01:13:27,858
He's really weak.

1231
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,927
He collapsed after he
ran out of oxygen.

1232
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:35,622
Okay.
Give him 8 mg of dexamethasone.

1233
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:38,142
That's 2 tablets, Rob.

1234
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:40,156
Guy to Rob.

1235
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:42,554
Go ahead Guy.
I got you, mate.

1236
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:45,091
Rob, I suggest
you get yourself down.

1237
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,749
You know you're doing
no good up there.

1238
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:48,505
And we got people we can
send up there to help Doug,

1239
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:51,802
but you got to get
yourself down, you understand?

1240
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,492
I mean, come on, mate.
We're playing with a man's life here.

1241
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:57,314
There's no way 
I'm leaving Doug behind.

1242
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:01,048
We got to keep moving, mate.

1243
01:14:01,073 --> 01:14:03,773
We got to keep moving,
we are in some trouble.

1244
01:14:03,798 --> 01:14:07,466
Yeah, Helen gonna... need some help.
So I'm gonna try make my way back.

1245
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:08,835
- Okay?
- Okay.

1246
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,342
Alright.
Go on.

1247
01:14:20,342 --> 01:14:22,979
Hey, Scott.
Scott.

1248
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,674
You okay?

1249
01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:30,375
Lopsang.

1250
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:32,396
Lopsang.

1251
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:36,146
I'm done, pal.

1252
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:39,197
I'm done.

1253
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:44,348
You go,
send Anatoli.

1254
01:14:44,926 --> 01:14:48,035
Send Anatoli back with some "O".

1255
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:50,940
- Okay.
- Go.

1256
01:14:50,965 --> 01:14:52,515
Okay.

1257
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:56,263
I will send back, Anatoli.

1258
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,849
- Let's go.
- You go down.

1259
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,577
No, mate.

1260
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,210
No. I'm not leaving
you behind, Doug.

1261
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:08,870
- Come on.
- Got to rest.

1262
01:15:08,895 --> 01:15:10,765
No, Doug! Come on!
Come on with me!

1263
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,603
I need 10 good minutes, Doug.
Come on.

1264
01:15:17,349 --> 01:15:19,302
Please, let me go.

1265
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:22,667
Damn it.
We're at the bottom of the Step.

1266
01:15:22,876 --> 01:15:26,406
Come on, this leg.
This leg, Dougy, come on.

1267
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:28,361
Come on.

1268
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,639
Here we go.

1269
01:15:50,156 --> 01:15:51,854
Oh no.

1270
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,720
Oh no.

1271
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:56,482
Hey. Hold it down.
Hold that down.

1272
01:15:56,507 --> 01:15:59,425
Come on, come on.
Get the chairs.

1273
01:16:39,506 --> 01:16:42,070
No, no, no.
Come on, Dougy!

1274
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:44,627
Go, let's go!
Hurry up!

1275
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:23,898
Doug. I'm going to go to
the South Summit to get oxygen.

1276
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:26,808
Okay.
Got to find oxygen.

1277
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:29,436
But, you got to stay here!

1278
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,765
Okay, stay here!
Don't move, I'll be back!

1279
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:41,381
Rob.
Rob.

1280
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:00,033
Hey, Rob.

1281
01:18:38,808 --> 01:18:41,235
Hey!
Stop!

1282
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,646
That's the wrong way!

1283
01:18:44,357 --> 01:18:45,601
Hey!

1284
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:47,743
Turn back!

1285
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,017
Easy.

1286
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:22,898
Hey, Rob!

1287
01:19:23,477 --> 01:19:25,284
Hey, Rob!

1288
01:19:36,581 --> 01:19:38,315
Rob!

1289
01:19:39,684 --> 01:19:41,077
- I got...
- Harold?

1290
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:43,239
I got oxygen.

1291
01:19:43,264 --> 01:19:47,764
Here.
I found some half empty ones.

1292
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:50,786
Where's Doug?

1293
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:53,888
Doug's gone.

1294
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,265
What?

1295
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,874
Gone.

1296
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:12,090
- Come on.
- Go!

1297
01:20:12,115 --> 01:20:13,877
Come on!

1298
01:20:15,671 --> 01:20:17,298
Camp 4 is that way.

1299
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:20,841
Get up!
Let's go.

1300
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,864
Come on.
Beck.

1301
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:35,349
I'll get help!

1302
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,604
Neal!

1303
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:18,454
Neal!

1304
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:21,739
- Anatoli.
- Where-Where are they?

1305
01:21:21,764 --> 01:21:23,969
They're still out there.

1306
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:33,641
Jon!
I need help!

1307
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:34,856
What?

1308
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,477
Get out there!
I need help!

1309
01:21:37,502 --> 01:21:39,900
I can't.
I can't see, Anatoli.

1310
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:41,827
I'm snow blind.

1311
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:45,360
Beck.
Doug.

1312
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:48,660
They need help.
They're still out there.

1313
01:21:50,658 --> 01:21:54,602
I go find them.
You stay here.

1314
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:02,155
12:00 AM

1315
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:10,443
Good job.

1316
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:26,008
Hey!

1317
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:31,619
Anatoli!

1318
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:35,203
Need "O".

1319
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:40,517
- Can you walk?
- I can't!

1320
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:44,408
I'll come back!

1321
01:22:44,724 --> 01:22:46,742
I'll stay!

1322
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:54,159
Give me that, come on.

1323
01:22:54,184 --> 01:22:57,326
- It won't budge. It's frozen!
- Take this.

1324
01:22:58,613 --> 01:23:00,308
The gloves.

1325
01:23:01,373 --> 01:23:03,397
I'm sorry.

1326
01:23:15,317 --> 01:23:16,837
Come on, mate.

1327
01:23:17,685 --> 01:23:19,353
Come on, Harold.

1328
01:23:21,355 --> 01:23:23,569
Thanks for coming back.

1329
01:23:44,781 --> 01:23:47,197
- Hello, Base Camp.
- Helen, it's Jan.

1330
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,288
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why hasn't anybody call me?

1331
01:23:50,313 --> 01:23:54,434
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1332
01:23:55,587 --> 01:23:59,414
- Where is he?
- We don't know exactly. But...

1333
01:23:59,454 --> 01:24:01,350
He was still on the Summit at 4:00.

1334
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,659
Oh no.
Can he get down?

1335
01:24:04,684 --> 01:24:07,657
Rob can,
but Doug can't.

1336
01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:11,099
There's at least 13 people
stranded up there and...

1337
01:24:11,124 --> 01:24:13,745
while the storm is getting worse.

1338
01:24:17,163 --> 01:24:18,215
Helen!

1339
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,988
Get Ang Dorjee up there.
He'll bring them down.

1340
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:24,385
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen. Give me an update.

1341
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,416
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1342
01:24:27,441 --> 01:24:29,297
Jan, yep.
We will get him.

1343
01:24:29,322 --> 01:24:32,285
And I will call you
the minute I hear from him.

1344
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,456
- As soon as I hear from him.
- Thanks, Helen.

1345
01:24:34,481 --> 01:24:36,494
- Alright.
- Okay.

1346
01:24:36,525 --> 01:24:38,432
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1347
01:24:38,457 --> 01:24:41,226
- Okay, I'll get him.
- I've been trying.

1348
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:43,212
- Guy.
- Just hang on, hang on.

1349
01:24:43,237 --> 01:24:45,349
Rob, it's Guy.
Where are you?

1350
01:24:45,374 --> 01:24:47,529
Guy, I've been doing
that for the last 2 hours.

1351
01:24:47,554 --> 01:24:50,019
Alright. Alright.
Rob, it's Guy.

1352
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,796
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1353
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,035
Once you catch a break, you move.
You know the drill.

1354
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,681
Hey, Guy. We got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1355
01:24:58,722 --> 01:25:00,931
- Whoever needs it can have it.
- That's the way, thank you.

1356
01:25:00,956 --> 01:25:03,543
Faust's team are gonna go up,
they got a man to search,

1357
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:04,991
as soon as they can.

1358
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:08,763
Anyone who is going, we're going to 
leave at dawn with the commity.

1359
01:25:08,788 --> 01:25:09,920
That's right, David.

1360
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:12,132
Go and let Ed knows what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1361
01:25:12,157 --> 01:25:13,652
- Camp 4, come in.
- Okay, great.

1362
01:25:13,677 --> 01:25:15,990
Hey, Rob.  Rob, can you hear me?
( 03:00 AM )

1363
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:21,879
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen
at the South Col that we can use.

1364
01:25:21,903 --> 01:25:25,458
Alright, mate. Well, we're all organizing
a team, we're coming to get you.

1365
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:50,118
Burning up.

1366
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:11,829
No.
No.

1367
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,767
Yasuko.

1368
01:26:15,585 --> 01:26:17,551
Ohhh.

1369
01:26:17,575 --> 01:26:19,408
Andy!

1370
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,753
Come on!

1371
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:26,044
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.
( Saturday, 11th May )

1372
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:33,534
- Pick up, mate. Please
( 05:00 AM )

1373
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:02,717
Was there any word 
from the others?

1374
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:07,477
Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back
from the South Col last night. But...

1375
01:28:07,502 --> 01:28:10,154
Beck and Yasuko
are still out there.

1376
01:28:10,186 --> 01:28:11,495
They're trying 
to mount a search

1377
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,417
but everyone who's been 
up there is exhausted.

1378
01:28:16,448 --> 01:28:18,787
- Base.
- Rob, is that you?

1379
01:28:19,664 --> 01:28:22,638
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1380
01:28:23,718 --> 01:28:25,774
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1381
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:31,008
I can't.

1382
01:28:31,033 --> 01:28:34,678
Can't move anymore.
Can't move anymore

1383
01:28:35,585 --> 01:28:37,412
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1384
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,524
You got to keep on moving.

1385
01:28:39,549 --> 01:28:41,284
Hands...

1386
01:28:41,309 --> 01:28:44,860
I can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.

1387
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:49,916
There's "D" ice on the ice.

1388
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:52,414
I got "D" ice in my mask.

1389
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:54,986
That's good. You got to get
that mask working. You got to.

1390
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,534
The sun's going to 
come up and...

1391
01:28:56,559 --> 01:28:58,879
you know you can get warmer
and you can get moving.

1392
01:28:58,904 --> 01:29:00,928
- Guy.
- Yeah.

1393
01:29:00,953 --> 01:29:02,267
Guy.

1394
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:04,992
Harold was here.
Where did he go?

1395
01:29:05,017 --> 01:29:07,577
Rob.
Is Doug with you?

1396
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:14,370
Doug.
Doug's gone.

1397
01:29:16,061 --> 01:29:18,222
Harold is gone.

1398
01:29:21,196 --> 01:29:23,830
I'm going to need
a little help.

1399
01:29:24,857 --> 01:29:26,939
Okay.
Rob, you got to get yourself down.

1400
01:29:26,964 --> 01:29:28,620
Where are you?

1401
01:29:33,611 --> 01:29:35,337
Guy.

1402
01:29:35,362 --> 01:29:37,813
I'm in the...
in the little...

1403
01:29:37,838 --> 01:29:41,067
in the little dip just below
the South Summit.

1404
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:42,921
Alright, you can do this.

1405
01:29:42,946 --> 01:29:45,283
You just got to, you know,
pull yourself out of that dip,

1406
01:29:45,308 --> 01:29:47,523
and slide the rest of the way.

1407
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,646
Guy, send them boys.

1408
01:29:49,671 --> 01:29:53,621
Okay. I'm going to 
need a little help.

1409
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:56,821
I got some Sheapas coming
up there with tea and oxygen.

1410
01:29:56,846 --> 01:29:58,731
You just got to
come on down, mate.

1411
01:29:58,756 --> 01:30:00,802
Aye, come on down.

1412
01:30:02,662 --> 01:30:04,173
Rob.

1413
01:30:08,752 --> 01:30:10,907
Can you patch Jan through?

1414
01:30:10,932 --> 01:30:13,599
- To Rob?
- Pat-Patch her through.

1415
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:15,443
Let's-Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1416
01:30:15,468 --> 01:30:19,096
put the satphone next to the radio
and uh.

1417
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:22,213
If anyone can motivate him
to move, and Jan will.

1418
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:24,919
Guy to Rob.

1419
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,803
Guy to Rob.

1420
01:30:29,454 --> 01:30:32,159
Guy to Rob.
Can you read me?

1421
01:30:37,555 --> 01:30:40,004
- Rob, are you there?
- We're getting him now.

1422
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:44,300
Rob, this is Helen.

1423
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,718
Copy.

1424
01:30:47,925 --> 01:30:51,057
Rob, I got Jan for you.

1425
01:30:52,554 --> 01:30:54,308
My Jan?

1426
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,663
Yeah. She's just here.

1427
01:30:55,688 --> 01:30:58,151
- Jan, you're on.
- Okay.

1428
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:01,297
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

1429
01:31:04,613 --> 01:31:06,667
Hi, my love.

1430
01:31:06,692 --> 01:31:07,839
I'm a bit

1431
01:31:07,864 --> 01:31:10,008
a bit cold.

1432
01:31:10,269 --> 01:31:12,186
My love, I'm okay.

1433
01:31:12,211 --> 01:31:14,039
I know you are.

1434
01:31:14,064 --> 01:31:16,701
But the sun will warm you soon.

1435
01:31:17,092 --> 01:31:21,106
Sweetheart.
You got to get moving.

1436
01:31:21,269 --> 01:31:23,646
You got to come on down.

1437
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:26,610
My hands...

1438
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:30,782
frozen.

1439
01:31:32,068 --> 01:31:33,193
My...

1440
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:36,313
My feet are frozen.

1441
01:31:36,718 --> 01:31:40,494
We're sending people up to you
with tea and "O"s

1442
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:43,795
But, you got to get moving, Rob.
Can you hear me?

1443
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,419
You got to get
your circulation going.

1444
01:31:46,444 --> 01:31:48,550
Okay, my love.

1445
01:31:48,787 --> 01:31:52,292
You do it.
Do it right now!

1446
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:56,199
I love you.

1447
01:31:57,063 --> 01:31:59,117
Over and out.

1448
01:32:08,716 --> 01:32:10,534
Come on, Rob.

1449
01:33:00,406 --> 01:33:02,626
We can't carry them.

1450
01:33:03,856 --> 01:33:05,954
That's not possible.

1451
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:07,811
He's correct.

1452
01:33:09,009 --> 01:33:10,942
It's going to take "O"

1453
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:13,229
just to get ourselves down.

1454
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,540
Oh, damn it.

1455
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:24,813
Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?

1456
01:33:25,665 --> 01:33:27,460
Come in, Mike.
What do you got?

1457
01:33:27,485 --> 01:33:30,291
Yasuko and Beck,

1458
01:33:30,316 --> 01:33:32,877
did not make it 
back to camp.

1459
01:33:37,317 --> 01:33:39,986
Okay, Mike.
Thanks for letting us know.

1460
01:33:51,802 --> 01:33:54,769
<font color="#ff8080">[NOT RETURNED]</font>
[SOUTH COL, CAMP 4]

1461
01:34:14,886 --> 01:34:16,393
Meg.

1462
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:20,505
Bud.

1463
01:34:53,096 --> 01:34:55,449
Hello, Base Camp.
Hello, Base Camp.

1464
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,291
Hello, Base Camp.

1465
01:34:58,133 --> 01:34:59,992
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

1466
01:35:00,017 --> 01:35:02,266
We have to turn back!

1467
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:05,518
There is the very 
bad storm again.

1468
01:35:06,269 --> 01:35:08,296
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

1469
01:35:08,321 --> 01:35:11,461
We'll try to do again,
when the storm pass.

1470
01:35:11,486 --> 01:35:13,667
We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here.

1471
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:15,242
Sorry.

1472
01:35:21,828 --> 01:35:24,498
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1473
01:35:25,644 --> 01:35:27,154
Okay.

1474
01:35:35,923 --> 01:35:37,245
Hey, Rob.
It's Guy, mate.

1475
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,867
Guy.

1476
01:35:40,623 --> 01:35:44,420
I can't stop shaking, Guy.

1477
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,604
The boys hit a bit of a high wind.
And...

1478
01:35:47,637 --> 01:35:50,615
your best shot is going
to be to get lower.

1479
01:35:53,511 --> 01:35:55,832
Let me think about it.

1480
01:35:57,763 --> 01:36:01,070
Don't think I can hang out
here another night.

1481
01:36:06,318 --> 01:36:08,943
We'll try again first thing, okay.

1482
01:37:17,448 --> 01:37:18,679
Helen?

1483
01:37:18,704 --> 01:37:20,083
Yeah.

1484
01:37:20,473 --> 01:37:22,617
Yeah, he's still there.

1485
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:26,316
He's just below the South Summit.

1486
01:37:26,644 --> 01:37:29,357
He's got oxygen
but...

1487
01:37:29,382 --> 01:37:31,333
it's iced up.

1488
01:37:31,358 --> 01:37:34,287
We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.

1489
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:38,674
Is anybody with him?

1490
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:40,219
No.

1491
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,146
No.

1492
01:37:42,843 --> 01:37:46,241
You have to get him down before dark.
He won't survive another night.

1493
01:37:46,365 --> 01:37:47,983
We know.

1494
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:52,903
But the storms come back,
real bad.

1495
01:37:53,337 --> 01:37:56,383
We can't get anyone
up to him tonight.

1496
01:37:56,408 --> 01:37:58,279
We tried.

1497
01:38:01,607 --> 01:38:04,051
He might as well 
be on the moon.

1498
01:38:06,784 --> 01:38:08,026
Uh.

1499
01:38:09,974 --> 01:38:12,328
Can you put me on
with him again?

1500
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:14,172
Of course.

1501
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:19,763
Guy.
Get Rob.

1502
01:38:23,624 --> 01:38:25,565
Hi, Rob.
It's Guy.

1503
01:38:26,549 --> 01:38:28,708
I've got Jan for you.

1504
01:38:29,282 --> 01:38:30,746
Hold on.

1505
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:33,077
Give me a second.

1506
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:49,357
Okay.

1507
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:00,074
Hi, sweetheart.

1508
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:02,911
How are you?

1509
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,584
I'm thinking about you.

1510
01:39:11,437 --> 01:39:13,429
Please say, "I'm good."

1511
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,918
Are you warm, my love.

1512
01:39:18,592 --> 01:39:21,442
I might have a little frostbite.

1513
01:39:23,276 --> 01:39:26,462
I'm looking forward
to making it all better.

1514
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:31,819
Can't wait for you
to come home.

1515
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,926
How's Sarah?

1516
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:38,730
Sarah?

1517
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:41,216
Yeah.

1518
01:39:42,523 --> 01:39:44,584
Yes, Sarah is good.

1519
01:39:46,082 --> 01:39:48,789
Will you call her that for me?

1520
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:50,956
Yes, I will.

1521
01:39:53,538 --> 01:39:56,970
I don't think I'm going
to get to meet her.

1522
01:40:00,053 --> 01:40:02,712
I'm so sorry.

1523
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:08,853
Don't say that.

1524
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,550
If anyone can make it, you can.

1525
01:40:13,575 --> 01:40:15,214
Remember.

1526
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:20,855
I love you.

1527
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,366
Please don't worry too much.

1528
01:40:31,096 --> 01:40:33,739
Good bye, my love.

1529
01:40:46,842 --> 01:40:49,297
I love you, Rob.

1530
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:54,772
I love you.

1531
01:42:37,392 --> 01:42:41,060
(Come on.)
(Come on.)

1532
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:56,888
(Come on, Dad.)

1533
01:44:18,512 --> 01:44:20,001
Beck.

1534
01:44:23,335 --> 01:44:25,544
Helen, it's Mike here.

1535
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:27,911
Helen, do you copy?

1536
01:44:27,936 --> 01:44:29,737
Mike, come in.

1537
01:44:29,762 --> 01:44:31,586
Beck's still alive.

1538
01:44:31,611 --> 01:44:33,749
He walked himself into camp.

1539
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:36,219


1540
01:44:36,244 --> 01:44:39,162
I got to get him down to Camp 1.

1541
01:44:40,527 --> 01:44:42,408
Thanks, Mike.

1542
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:50,259
We don't even know how,
but he is alive.

1543
01:44:50,529 --> 01:44:52,174
The thing is, Peach,

1544
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:53,950
we can't get him down the Icefall.

1545
01:44:53,975 --> 01:44:55,427
Oh no.
I'll get him down.

1546
01:44:55,452 --> 01:44:57,645
- I'll get him down. Okay.
- Dad.

1547
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:00,669
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1548
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:05,881
Yeah, but they can't a helicopter up
that high because the air is too thin.

1549
01:45:05,906 --> 01:45:08,659
We should try, but it is
one heck of a rescue.

1550
01:45:08,684 --> 01:45:10,545
And he's not in a
 good way, Peach.  So...

1551
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:13,499
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1552
01:45:18,335 --> 01:45:20,131
1 step at a time.

1553
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:24,602
- You got to keep moving.
- I'm tired.

1554
01:45:24,627 --> 01:45:26,059
- I know.
- I'm tired.

1555
01:45:26,084 --> 01:45:28,496
I know you are.
I know you are. Come on.

1556
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:32,098
Slow and steady.

1557
01:45:33,482 --> 01:45:35,607
Come on, keep moving.

1558
01:45:35,968 --> 01:45:40,567
Yes, I like the number of the
American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1559
01:45:40,722 --> 01:45:41,954
Yes, Nepal.

1560
01:45:41,979 --> 01:45:44,589
Ambassador, please.
No. Sweets, I can't hold.

1561
01:45:44,614 --> 01:45:45,806
No.
You listen, sir.

1562
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:48,757
My husband has already died once
as you've seen on the news.

1563
01:45:48,782 --> 01:45:53,208
Trust me. Having him die a second
time is not going to play well on CNN.

1564
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:55,754
There we go, buddy.

1565
01:45:56,234 --> 01:45:58,614
That's it, alright.

1566
01:45:59,445 --> 01:46:02,575
CAMP TWO

1567
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,678
- Beck.
- Uh-huh.

1568
01:46:06,473 --> 01:46:07,605
How're you doing?

1569
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:10,453
Oh, you know,
third amendment.

1570
01:46:10,662 --> 01:46:12,102
Warming up?

1571
01:46:13,046 --> 01:46:15,023
I'm not sure yet.

1572
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:17,689
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1573
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,921
How's Rob doing?

1574
01:46:24,633 --> 01:46:27,352
Rob's still up there right now.

1575
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:32,117
And Doug,
what's he up to?

1576
01:46:36,663 --> 01:46:38,629
Doug's gone, Beck.

1577
01:46:54,562 --> 01:46:57,249
I don't know. No one's ever try
to fly higher than Base Camp before.

1578
01:46:57,274 --> 01:46:59,173
They gonna give it a go.

1579
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:01,687
And find an LZ. Just mark up
with whatever you can.

1580
01:47:01,712 --> 01:47:03,362
Okay.
Worth a try.

1581
01:47:03,401 --> 01:47:04,780
Thanks, Guy.

1582
01:47:04,807 --> 01:47:06,673
Grab a Gatorade.
Got a chopper coming in.

1583
01:47:06,698 --> 01:47:08,289
We need to make a LZ

1584
01:47:08,314 --> 01:47:10,892
We got a chopper coming in!

1585
01:47:11,547 --> 01:47:14,115
- Clear the rope back to the tents!
- Okay.

1586
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:15,201
Thanks.

1587
01:47:15,226 --> 01:47:17,816
Keep it clear.
Keep this whole area clear.

1588
01:47:18,461 --> 01:47:20,101
Come on.
Come on.

1589
01:47:25,103 --> 01:47:27,157


1590
01:47:27,182 --> 01:47:29,291
We're doing fine.

1591
01:47:34,992 --> 01:47:37,066
It's not possible.

1592
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:40,126
You land here,
we'll never get back up.

1593
01:47:46,356 --> 01:47:48,654
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1594
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:09,361
- That's it.
- Can't get any more out.

1595
01:48:09,386 --> 01:48:11,552
it's as light as
we're going to get it.

1596
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:15,420
- Tango to Charlie.
- Tango to Charlie.

1597
01:48:26,349 --> 01:48:28,663
Right here!
Right here!

1598
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,300
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1599
01:49:01,544 --> 01:49:02,913
Come on, Beck.

1600
01:49:02,938 --> 01:49:04,479
Nearly there.

1601
01:49:07,356 --> 01:49:09,118
Okay.
Come on.

1602
01:49:11,719 --> 01:49:12,891
1 person.

1603
01:49:12,916 --> 01:49:15,662
- Only 1 person.
- Just him, just 1.

1604
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:18,251
- Alright.
- There you go.

1605
01:49:21,519 --> 01:49:22,969
You good?

1606
01:49:23,298 --> 01:49:26,470
I'm going to lift the tail up.
Fly us over the edge.

1607
01:49:26,642 --> 01:49:28,763


1608
01:49:28,788 --> 01:49:31,172
- Is that okay with you?
- I'm with you.

1609
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:32,992
Good, man.

1610
01:50:51,818 --> 01:50:54,293
Get yourself inside, go on.

1611
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:59,911
It's alright, Anatoli.

1612
01:51:05,511 --> 01:51:07,909
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1613
01:51:08,425 --> 01:51:10,793
Come on.
Let's get you inside.

1614
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:34,315
Hi, Peachy.

1615
01:51:38,842 --> 01:51:40,272
Beck.

1616
01:51:53,028 --> 01:51:55,429
Thank you so much, darling.

1617
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:18,160
Oh, Jan.
I'm so sorry.

1618
01:52:46,671 --> 01:52:55,969
Rob's body remains on the mountain
alongside the others who lost their lives.

1619
01:52:57,136 --> 01:53:01,876
Scott Fischer

1620
01:53:03,519 --> 01:53:08,362
Andy 'Harold' Harris

1621
01:53:09,743 --> 01:53:14,697
Doug Hansen

1622
01:53:16,278 --> 01:53:21,136
Yasuko Namba

1623
01:53:22,162 --> 01:53:29,689
Adventure Consultants Team 1996

1624
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:37,135
Beck Weathers lost both hands and his nose.

1625
01:53:38,597 --> 01:53:43,433
He still lives in Dallas with his wife, Peach.

1626
01:53:44,712 --> 01:53:50,441
In July 1996, Jan gave birth to a baby girl.

1627
01:53:51,898 --> 01:53:57,633
She named her Sarah.

1628
01:54:01,827 --> 01:54:07,631
Sarah Arnold-Hall

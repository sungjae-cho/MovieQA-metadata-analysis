00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,560
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

2
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,243
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

3
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,438
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

4
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,686
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

5
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:31,764
I haven't seen that face for a while.
How was Miami?

6
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,761
We opened Saturday.

7
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,319
I hope you packed snowshoes.
JFK took me three hours.

8
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,641
-You in town for a while?
-Next stop is Tokyo.

9
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,357
-You're taking over the world!
-That's the idea.

10
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:44,518
Merry Christmas.

11
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:57,685
Central Mexico

12
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,240
How long have you
been following me?

13
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,480
Since you took my innertube.

14
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,799
I was going to return it.
I hope you don't mind.

15
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,123
-Keep it. He's in love with you.
-Shut up!

16
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,526
How can you be in love
with someone you just met?

17
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,637
When I am eighteen, I will come
to Las Vegas and find you.

18
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:12,719
When you're eighteen,
I will be forty.

19
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,484
Are you going to marry
the policeman?

20
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,320
I wish I knew...

21
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,607
Am I on the right floor?

22
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:39,438
Who are you and why
don't you work for a living?

23
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,203
-He's back.
-Mr. On Time and Under Budget.

24
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,201
Long time, no see!

25
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,724
-Why the fish?
-It's a keychain.

26
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,563
Why the party?
We still design nightclubs?

27
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,401
Not during the holidays.

28
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,162
-Merry Christmas.
-Sushi?

29
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,960
Yo, Hemingway!
Hold up. Not so fast.

30
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,164
I see your divorce
left you shattered.

31
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:12,280
I found two women who understand
my pain. Don't go in there.

32
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,520
-Why?
-Charlie Peters got Tokyo.

33
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,408
He leaves tomorrow.
You're taking Vegas.

34
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,959
-I was supposed to get Tokyo!
-You do not want Tokyo!

35
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,882
I don't?
I want Las Vegas?

36
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,327
Everything famous about
Las Vegas is about leaving it!

37
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,647
That movie, the song.
The mob left Las Vegas.

38
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,285
Just get in there!

39
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,967
Look.
This could get me fired.

40
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,680
This morning, I closed a deal
to buy a 50,000 square foot space...

41
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,079
...across from the Royalton.

42
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:53,801
If you play your cards right, you come
home to the sweetest gig ever.

43
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:57,644
-The Midtown Club.
-And who'll still be eating sushi?

44
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,800
Charlie Peters!

45
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,206
We have conference rooms.

46
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,198
He just needed a hug, sir.

47
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,559
It's the holidays that--
It's just so hard. Excuse me.

48
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,679
I'm afraid I need you in Vegas.

49
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:36,044
Did you say Vegas?
That's my favourite city in the world!

50
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:31,240
It's a family business. Everybody
in town tried to steal this guy.

51
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:35,038
That's why I want him.
Thanks for the hustle!

52
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,008
Your keys.
I got you groceries.

53
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,809
Are you sure you don't prefer a hotel?

54
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,562
Too many distractions.

55
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,085
Hot! Hot! Hot!

56
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,004
It's January, for chrissake!

57
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:22,562
Chuy, I'm not ready for marriage.
And I love you, but not like that.

58
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,963
I think we should see other people.
What do you think?

59
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,321
Lose the part about seeing
other people. You're right.

60
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,717
My great-grandmother said
I should wait for a sign.

61
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,688
That necklace he got me?
It broke.

62
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,120
I must pee. I'll talk to you
when I get home.

63
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,400
I haven't stopped since Nogales!
Okay? I got to go. Bye.

64
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,889
-Excuse me, I was here.
-I would have noticed.

65
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,082
I was on the phone, the line moved.
I couldn't move with it...

66
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,639
...because the cord
wouldn't stretch that far!

67
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,723
I'd like to believe you,
but your nose is growing.

68
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,077
Come on!
That was pretty good.

69
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,041
-You realize I could die for this?
-I pee really fast.

70
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,201
I have five brothers, three cousins
and one bathroom.

71
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,567
-I pee faster than anybody.
-A gold medalist.

72
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,327
This I have to see!

73
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,165
I was just about to say that.

74
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,408
I said not to be a pig
in front of our new priest.

75
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,560
-That's Father Alex, to you.
-I'm lsabel.

76
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,319
All that "waiting for a sign" stuff...

77
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,686
...is that religious or cultural?

78
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,200
Do you always listen
to other's conversations?

79
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,246
Do you want to go
to the end of the line?

80
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,758
-Why do you want to know?
-It sounded a little deep for--

81
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,085
It just sounded a little deep
for a Friday night.

82
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:36,286
Religion is important in our culture,
at least in my family.

83
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,441
Your destiny
has already been decided.

84
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,157
You just have to read the signs.

85
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,526
You don't believe that?

86
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,403
If a bus hits a guy,
it's because he wasn't looking.

87
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,765
Not because of a master plan.

88
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,605
It wasn't fate that you were in
this line when I got off the phone?

89
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,242
No, I think it was more
of a bladder thing.

90
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:09,078
That's too bad.
Because, you see...

91
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,719
...l think there's an explanation
beyond reason, beyond all logic...

92
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,964
...that brought you
to this very spot...

93
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:25,449
...at the exact same time
I showed up at this very spot.

94
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:30,044
-You do?
-Absolutely.

95
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,882
And why would fate go
to all that trouble?

96
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:39,319
So I wouldn't have
to wait in line.

97
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,638
Thanks.

98
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,043
3 Months Later

99
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,158
Thank you.

100
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:18,677
-We meet Tracy, 5:30 at your place.
-Alcoholic Beverage Commission?

101
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,638
-The power this woman abuses!
-I know she's important!

102
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,244
She sounded blonde.
Audibly blonde.

103
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,685
She's married to the
county supervisor.

104
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,119
-Don't hit on her.
-I'll get wine.

105
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,679
-Don't hit on this woman!
-I'll make it expensive.

106
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,199
He's going to hit on her.

107
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,403
Incoming!

108
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,320
It's a long story....

109
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,883
-I'm looking for Alex.
-You know, he just ducked out.

110
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,405
Shoot!
I thought I might catch him.

111
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:09,406
We've been trading calls for months,
but he's always so busy.

112
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,404
-Leave him a note. There's a pad.
-No, no that's okay.

113
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:20,762
I'm Catherine Stewart.
Our families are old friends.

114
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,364
-Alex.
-He went to the store.

115
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:27,079
-His car's outside.
-He took a bulldozer, okay?

116
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,248
-He's always in three places at once.
-That is our Alex.

117
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,120
-You've been avoiding that?
-Since third grade.

118
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:52,038
No one plans to end up in Vegas.
It kind of sneaks up on you.

119
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,041
It's the fastest-growing city.

120
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:59,363
The economy is booming! Business too.
I'm drowning in paperwork.

121
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:04,760
Frankly, it's not a whole lot of fun.

122
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,209
Are you a whole lot of fun?

123
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,799
Jeff said we may have problems
with our liquor license.

124
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,603
I'll talk to the county supervisor.

125
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:23,524
I'd pay more attention
to the ABC investigation.

126
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,768
They'll ask personal questions.

127
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,559
They'd love to catch you
with your pants down.

128
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,647
Then they should look into Jeff.
He actually heads up our...

129
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,003
...pants down department.

130
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,205
Will you get some ice?

131
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:50,159
And put some scotch in it!

132
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,722
One scotch, coming up.

133
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:58,359
I'm afraid I'm out of scotch,
so let's go eat.

134
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,005
Quid pro quo, pal.

135
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:07,721
-Give it to her, she gives it to us.
-I can't do this!

136
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,278
Hello.

137
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,726
I thought....

138
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,686
-I must have the wrong house.
-No! Wait!

139
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:27,317
-If you want Alex, he's inside.
-He is?

140
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,441
Excuse me. Alex?

141
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,125
-You have a visitor.
-I do?

142
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:41,688
-Excuse me.
-Well, don't be long.

143
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,118
Isabel!

144
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,562
You remembered.

145
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,165
How could I forget?
I've looked all over for you.

146
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,799
I would have called,
but you disappeared on me.

147
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,239
I didn't know what to do.
I never did anything like that before.

148
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,164
-Going home with a stranger.
-You and me both!

149
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:17,526
It was just one of those great...

150
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,888
...phenomenal...

151
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,527
...spontaneous things.

152
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,601
Yes, it was.

153
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:34,637
-So, how long has it been?
-Three months.

154
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,922
Do you mind if I have some?
My stomach is not so good.

155
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,560
Go ahead, help yourself.
Want something to drink? I've got...

156
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,278
...water.

157
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,201
Yeah, water's fine.

158
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,641
You've done a lot here.

159
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,124
Yeah, I've been kind of busy.

160
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,248
You look great.

161
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,404
Thank you.

162
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,279
So, how you been?

163
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:18,088
-Pregnant.
-Really? Pregnant?

164
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:22,722
Well, that's great. Terrific.
Congratulations.

165
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,725
Thank you. It's yours.

166
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:40,521
Mine?
We were together one night.

167
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,841
-That's all it took.
-And I used a condom.

168
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,043
-Lots of them.
-One didn't work.

169
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:53,806
But, its job is to work!
lts reason for being is to work!

170
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,723
Look...

171
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,444
...I've thought about this a lot.

172
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,920
And there's only one thing to do.

173
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,207
Oh, dear God!

174
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,638
I mean...l understand.

175
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,285
-And I respect your decision.
-You do?

176
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:20,045
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

177
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,486
Good. Because I choose
to keep this baby.

178
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,039
I don't want your money.
The honourable thing to do would be...

179
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,963
...to come here and tell you
in person that I am pregnant.

180
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,084
That I'm keeping this baby.

181
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,082
And that it's yours.

182
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:48,483
But-- Yeah, I'm glad you....

183
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm feeling neglected out there!
It's time we went to dinner.

184
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,881
Tracy, could you give me
a minute, please?

185
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,442
-Sorry, I came at a bad time.
-I'll go get my purse.

186
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,202
I'll let myself out.

187
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,082
I know the perfect place.

188
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,164
If you recommend it,
it'll be great.

189
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,925
I'll catch up with you. I've got
a bit of a family emergency.

190
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,081
What are you doing?
What're you doing?

191
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,247
Alex, don't! Alex!

192
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,124
Alex is going to meet us there.

193
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:18,518
Shit! Sorry!
Shit!

194
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,722
Oh, my God!

195
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,644
Don't jump!

196
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,240
-What're you doing here?
-Stay off the ledge!

197
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,402
I won't kill myself! But if you come
closer I'll throw you over!

198
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:53,087
You walked out on me at 5 a.m.
I never heard from you.

199
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:57,163
Months later you show up pregnant,
and I'm supposed to know what to do?

200
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:01,288
I'm sorry, but I don't know
exactly what to do!

201
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,243
That's the best thing
you've said all night.

202
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:17,167
-This is incredible.
-I love it here.

203
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,159
My great-grandfather helped build it.

204
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,485
He came from Aguascalientes
in the '30s.

205
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,439
Really?
Where?

206
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,081
Central Mexico.

207
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,641
My great-grandmother is still there,
in a 400-year-old hacienda.

208
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:37,680
Every time I drive back,
I make a wish at the state line.

209
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,160
-Right in the middle of the dam.
-Does it ever work?

210
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:43,002
It depends on the wish.

211
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,766
My father's going to kill me.

212
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,362
He doesn't know?

213
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:07,567
No. Nobody does.

214
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,966
Except Lanie, my roommate.

215
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:14,598
He can be very passionate
about his only daughter.

216
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:17,726
Isabel, what can I do?

217
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,644
-I'll deal with it.
-No. Really. I want to help.

218
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,607
Maybe one thing.

219
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,442
Come meet them.

220
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:35,447
-Your family?
-I want them to know you.

221
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,284
Later, when they ask me
who the father is, I can say:

222
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:42,965
"You met him, remember?
I brought him home once."

223
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:48,804
No problem. You just say when
and we'll go.

224
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:49,998
When.

225
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,803
-You eat with your family weekly?
-It's like a tradition.

226
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:58,041
-Why? Don't you?
-No.

227
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,167
-Holidays and stuff.
-That's it?

228
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,445
With my parents, that's a lot.

229
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:06,128
How'll we do this?

230
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,328
Act like we've been dating
for a few months.

231
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:13,323
And don't tell them I picked you up
outside a bathroom.

232
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:17,521
I thought I picked you up.

233
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,644
We've been dating a couple months.

234
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:29,477
-Who are you?
-Oh, well, let's see.

235
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:33,284
I am a camera girl at Caesar's.
"Would you like a souvenir?"

236
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,562
That pays the bills. I'm doing
a photography book on the desert.

237
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,319
I have five brothers.
The oldest one is Antonio.

238
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:46,404
Then Carlos, Juan, Miguel,
Fernando and I am the baby.

239
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:49,801
But anyone messes with me,
I take care of myself.

240
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:54,043
Tio Roberto is my favourite.
He's married to Tia Rosa.

241
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:57,759
She loves compliments.
But talk to her on her left...

242
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:01,126
...because she's stone-deaf
on her right ear.

243
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:04,361
Never say "Jesus Christ"
in front of my mother.

244
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,238
My sister-in-law, Petra, and Antonio
have a baby named after me.

245
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,845
-Any questions?
-What's your last name?

246
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,001
Fuentes. Isabel Fuentes.
And you're Alex....

247
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,839
-Whitman.
-Right. Alex Whitman.

248
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:20,608
Isabel Fuentes.

249
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,607
It's nice to meet you.

250
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:32,644
Hi! I was getting ice.
Everyone's around back.

251
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:35,079
Who's this?
New boyfriend?

252
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:39,368
Juan, this is Alex.
Alex, this is my nosy brother, Juan.

253
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,482
-Nice to meet you.
-Does Dad know about him?

254
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,886
And I wasn't going to come!

255
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:47,803
Good luck!

256
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,926
So, your father,
is he a big man, or...?

257
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:54,319
Come on, let's do this.

258
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,967
-This is a family dinner?
-A lot of people couldn't come.

259
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:26,117
Tough room.

260
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:31,486
What's wrong with everyone?
Can't I bring a guy to dinner?

261
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,088
Hello, lsa.

262
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,282
Hi, Chuy.

263
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:46,838
Fine.

264
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:51,159
It's been a long time
since you came to one of these.

265
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:56,319
-I was afraid we'd never be friends.
-That's where we started, isn't it?

266
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:02,767
Alex, this is Chuy.
He's a good friend of the family.

267
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,522
We grew up together.

268
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,886
Chuy, hi. Luke Skywalker.
How are you?

269
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,881
Sorry.
You probably get that a lot.

270
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:27,283
Yes, Chuy. He is my boyfriend.
Do you have a problem with that?

271
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:36,642
It's a pleasure to meet you, Alex.
You're a very lucky man.

272
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:41,645
There's nobody like lsa.
Nobody.

273
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,125
What happened to the music?

274
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:02,686
Seems like a nice guy.

275
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,207
He's going to kill me.

276
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:10,408
He's not the one
you should worry about.

277
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,037
My beautiful baby!

278
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,528
Who is this?

279
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:25,562
Mama, Papa,
this is Alex...Whitman.

280
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:30,441
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Isabel talks about you all the time.

281
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:33,647
Funny, she's never said
a word about you!

282
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:35,322
Tomas, behave yourself.

283
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:39,528
One minute she's engaged,
then she brings a man with a tie!

284
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,760
I was not engaged!

285
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,283
I was not engaged!

286
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:49,880
That's one of my favourite things about
her. She's always full of surprises.

287
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:58,640
Come on, Alex.
We'll be safer in the other room.

288
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:03,360
Let me take your jacket.

289
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:09,167
You'll have to excuse my husband.

290
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:14,119
Sometimes I think he wishes
lsabel was still 6 years old.

291
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,805
When you're a father,
you'll understand.

292
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:25,641
-These pictures are incredible.
-They're lsabel's.

293
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,840
-Haven't you ever seen her work?
-Yes, yes, yes, I have.

294
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:34,406
It's just that
when I see her pictures...

295
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,678
...it's like it's the first time.

296
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:45,287
-That must be the house in Mexico.
-Aguascalientes. And that...

297
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,920
...is lsabel's great-grandmother.
They have a special connection.

298
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:54,208
You can see it in the eyes.
That same wild spirit.

299
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,246
-I can handle my love life.
-Since when?

300
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,639
I think that runs in the family.

301
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,678
This is terrific!
The taste is amazing!

302
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:18,922
You can't get tamales like this
in New York City!

303
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,401
Why is he yelling at me?

304
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,361
He thinks you're Rosa.

305
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,447
This one's Rosa.

306
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:54,727
She's beautiful.

307
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,648
Would you hold her
while I fix myself a plate?

308
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:06,167
-No, I don't think I should.
-You can.

309
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:10,085
-Hold her head.
-Why? Does it come off?

310
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,487
You'll do fine.

311
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:59,838
How can so much stuff
come out of something so small?

312
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,197
-Thank you for doing this.
-Are you kidding? They're great.

313
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,124
I had no idea that families
actually talked at dinner.

314
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,925
I'm glad they got to meet you.

315
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:30,328
-They're going to hate me.
-No. I won't let them.

316
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:31,841
Don't.
You'll just make it worse.

317
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,842
Let me give you a number
so you can reach me.

318
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,280
It's better this way.

319
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:42,238
No complications.
Please, just don't.

320
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,158
So...

321
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:54,923
...take care.

322
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,158
I will.

323
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:02,564
You too.

324
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,565
What're you doing?
Get out of the way!

325
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:39,247
Don't do this!
There's nothing to say!

326
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,440
Wait a minute.
There might be.

327
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:48,203
This afternoon I couldn't decide
between a burger and tuna.

328
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:52,203
But my life made sense.
You know?

329
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:58,919
Now I know exactly what I want
and my life doesn't make any sense!

330
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:06,879
I was doing fine this afternoon.
It was me then!

331
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,007
Now, I don't know
what happened...

332
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:13,525
...but between the tuna
and your aunt's tamales....

333
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,799
I actually worried I had met
the woman of my dreams...

334
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,318
...at the dry cleaners
and didn't notice.

335
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:24,999
But then you show up
and I realize that's not true.

336
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:28,201
Because you're the one.

337
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:33,644
You are everything I never knew
I always wanted.

338
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm not sure what that means...

339
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:42,599
...but I think it has
to do with the rest of my life.

340
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,120
I think we should get married.
Right now!

341
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:04,799
Look who decided
to grace us with his presence.

342
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,358
Sorry, Jeff.
Could not be helped.

343
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:13,001
You're not getting off so easy.
So?

344
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:14,877
Who is she?

345
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:18,519
I open the door and you're off
on a date with Jessica Rabbit.

346
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,921
Her name is lsabel.
And it wasn't exactly a date.

347
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,605
Okay.
That's informative.

348
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,478
Jeff, what the hell is dating?

349
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:32,961
A process of elimination where
you both present your best side...

350
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,760
...and hide the real you.
That can only last three months.

351
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:40,728
Then you spend three months
getting to know your real selves.

352
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,042
Then one of you wants a commitment,
the other doesn't so you start over.

353
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,358
I mean dating...

354
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,998
...dating is stupid!

355
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,284
What have you done
with my best friend?

356
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:56,442
You and Karen dated five years before
you married. Look what happened.

357
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:59,487
Wait, you're using the " M" word?

358
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:02,766
There's a woman on line one.
She says she's your wife.

359
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,762
The only wife around is my ex.
And I am not in.

360
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:09,081
Ask her if I can call her back.
Get her phone number!

361
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,599
You married her?
The one with the body?

362
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,528
You're married?

363
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,441
Alex, does my life
mean nothing to you?

364
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:25,045
-It'll be okay.
-No, it won't!

365
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:27,849
-Who says it will?
-You gamble either way!

366
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:31,843
You're pissed I won on the first pull
instead of putting quarters...

367
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,846
...in the wrong machine
for 5 years!

368
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:38,480
Those were silver dollars. And that
slot machine now owns my house.

369
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:43,727
-She says it's urgent.
-It's urgent. The nightmare begins.

370
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,802
I can't believe it.
What were you thinking?

371
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:49,563
It's out of character
for you.

372
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:52,721
Why marry her...unless
you knocked her up?

373
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:58,602
-You knocked her up?
-That had nothing to do with it.

374
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:04,961
Not to burst your bubble,
but do you know this baby's yours?

375
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:10,044
-Did you do a blood test?
-She's my wife. It's not like that.

376
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,399
-You don't know her.
-Neither do you!

377
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:19,718
Fool!

378
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:34,768
I welcome you in my home
and this is how you repay me?!

379
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,519
Stealing my only daughter?!

380
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:41,568
Getting married in that joke
of a chapel!

381
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,442
Without a priest?!

382
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:47,204
Without her family?
Without my consent?

383
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:55,280
You are not a man.
You are a thief, that's what you are!

384
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:04,162
Jesus.

385
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,601
In-laws.

386
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,608
He disowns me? Fine.
I disown him twice.

387
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:14,602
Me and the baby disown him.
See how he likes that.

388
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,524
Elvis gave you away.
Can you blame him?

389
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:22,398
-How'd your mom take it?
-I'm a sinner. She went to church.

390
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:25,447
-That bad.
-She's lit every candle in the city.

391
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,443
-Hello, my wife.
-Hello, my husband.

392
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:33,604
-Did you decorate the house yourself?
-I realize it is a little dull.

393
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:38,365
-It's the cosy institutional thing.
-Not after I spice it up.

394
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:43,364
-It's just for the next 4 months.
-Then you turn back into a frog?

395
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,568
No, then we go back
to New York.

396
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,484
-We what?
-We go back to...

397
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,118
...New York.

398
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:56,958
You don't live here?

399
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:05,282
-No, I live in Manhattan.
-I live here. I like it.

400
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:10,927
My family, friends and work are here.
You can't raise a baby there.

401
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:15,088
People do it all the time.
Have you ever been there?

402
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,804
-No.
-Well, there you go.

403
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:23,440
You've never been off the strip.
There's more to Nevada than Vegas.

404
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:28,684
-Like legal prostitution?
-That's a guy thing to say.

405
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:32,325
If it's any consolation,
I hated it at first.

406
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:36,084
But Vegas grows on you
after a while.

407
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:40,080
Let me explain something.
Las Vegas is a sandbox.

408
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:44,368
A sandbox for adults with money.
New York is New York.

409
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:48,358
You got culture, museums,
and the Yankees!

410
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:51,840
Every New York guy thinks
there's nothing west of the Hudson!

411
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:54,523
-Every Las Vegas girl--
-Shut up.

412
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,043
We'll let them talk.

413
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,927
I've saved to do
this book for five years.

414
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:04,401
I just paid off my camera equipment.
My life is here.

415
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:11,240
And my work
is in New York.

416
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:15,448
This is what usually
happens on the second date.

417
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:57,797
Small, ugly thing biting me!
Small, ugly thing biting me!

418
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,599
Stop it!
Stop it. Stop it, baby.

419
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:04,278
Hi.

420
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:06,884
This is Che, my dog.
I mean, our dog.

421
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:11,520
-Welcome home.
-I can't believe it's the same house.

422
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:16,206
I know! lsn't it great?
It's their wedding present.

423
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,963
See, not everyone
feels like my father.

424
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:22,884
They wanted to do something
special for us. Say "thank you."

425
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:26,758
Thank you! It's very special.

426
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,761
You don't like it.

427
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,645
I just never lived in anything
so bright and--

428
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:37,368
Jesus Christ!

429
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:40,281
Isn't it beautiful?

430
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:44,283
It's been in my family for centuries
and will protect us.

431
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,565
Can't we just trade Cujo
for a Doberman?

432
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:51,246
That isn't funny, Alex.
You're hurting my baby's feelings.

433
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,124
What did your parents say?

434
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:58,045
I forgot they went to
Europe for the summer.

435
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:02,681
-It's April.
-They like to get there early.

436
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:07,839
So you did all this in one day?
I should hire you to build the club.

437
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:10,284
I don't know that you can afford us.

438
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:14,600
You are so cute.

439
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,525
Here. I'm going to get my camera
and take a picture of my family.

440
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,008
What are you looking at?

441
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:12,362
So this is where you go every day.

442
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:14,884
It opened last night.
I got complaints.

443
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:19,162
The fact that there are no
walls upset people.

444
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,766
It's going to be wonderful.
I can tell.

445
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:29,325
I wanted you to be the first guest
at our best table.

446
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,838
And I'm very honoured.

447
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,158
Oh, Alex, this is so romantic.

448
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:42,208
The candles....

449
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,963
And the wine.
I mean, the milk.

450
00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:46,927
And pizza.

451
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:49,248
It's perfect.

452
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:53,437
Perfect would be New York
and a Gray's Papaya hot dog.

453
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,762
-What's a Gray's Papaya?
-Four blocks from my apartment.

454
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,842
The best hot dog in the world.

455
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:06,724
And if we were in Mexico
we would be eating...

456
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:10,201
-...albondigas.
-Albondigas.

457
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:14,007
They're this sort
of meatball soup.

458
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,843
My great-grandmother
is famous for them.

459
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:20,163
You have to come
with me one day.

460
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:25,847
You'd love it. There are no
phones, no electricity, no people.

461
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:27,408
No kidding.

462
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:34,719
There's a spot in Central Park,
the Bethesda Fountain...

463
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:39,724
...where if you sit there long enough,
the entire city walks by.

464
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:45,767
And I know a canyon
where if you sit there long enough...

465
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:48,762
...nobody finds you.
And you die.

466
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:51,718
Really?

467
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:54,363
I couldn't believe it.

468
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:57,880
The whole night he changed
the subject to New York.

469
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,207
What do you expect?
His life is not your life.

470
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:05,038
-You're on my side?
-He has a family to support.

471
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,160
We can do it together, here.

472
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:09,758
Marriage is about finding
a middle ground.

473
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:12,199
Learn to pick your battles.

474
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:17,559
-I sure picked one this morning.
-What did you do?

475
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:20,848
I had the guys drop by
to take him shooting.

476
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:24,357
Alex is alone with your brothers?

477
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,202
And Chuy.

478
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,608
I better light another candle.

479
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:39,841
Isabel said there's some interesting
canyons here.

480
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,723
One in particular where people
go to die?

481
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:44,807
That's the other way, right?

482
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,728
What's this about you taking
lsabel to New York?

483
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:51,918
That's just an idea.
There's nothing carved in stone.

484
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,167
She won't go.
I bet my life on it.

485
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:58,759
No one here expects someone
to give up his life.

486
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:00,846
Do they, Chuy?

487
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:07,808
What'll you be? lsabel Fuentes?
lsabel Whitman?

488
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:10,398
Or do a Hilary and be lsabel
Fuentes-Whitman?

489
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:12,566
That's Mrs. Alex Whitman to you.

490
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,838
Pardon me.

491
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:16,040
I'm sorry, excuse me.

492
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:17,478
Excuse me.

493
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:23,484
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
Did you just say "Alex Whitman"?

494
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:28,684
-From Connecticut?
-I think that's where he's from.

495
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:32,718
Late 20s, 6 feet tall,
dark hair, talks with his hands?

496
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:34,567
That's him.

497
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,768
I'm sorry, I'm Cathy Stewart.
Our families are old friends.

498
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:45,041
You're kidding!
Oh, that's fantastic.

499
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:48,526
I don't know any of his friends
so I'm glad to meet you.

500
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:50,322
I'm lsabel, this is Lanie.

501
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:57,164
I've missed Alex the last couple
of trips out here.

502
00:49:57,449 --> 00:50:00,361
He's always so busy.
How do you know him?

503
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:05,565
-I'm his wife.
-I beg your pardon?

504
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:09,409
Alex and l,
we're married.

505
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:13,163
And they're having a baby.

506
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:16,359
A baby?
Really?

507
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,160
Well, congratulations.

508
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:24,680
Isn't this a surprise!

509
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:37,919
This is some back yard.
I can see why you like it up here.

510
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,520
It must've been fun growing up.

511
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:49,728
You know, all these rocks,
the open space, the view...

512
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,681
...the birds...

513
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,764
...the snakes.

514
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:12,760
Do not move.

515
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:17,245
Okay, everybody.
We do this on three. Ready?

516
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:23,962
-Wait!
-One.

517
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,728
-What're you doing?
-Two.

518
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:27,283
-What?
-Three.

519
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,640
I'm coming!

520
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:41,918
Lucy, you've got
some 'splaining to do!

521
00:51:42,289 --> 00:51:45,087
Oh, my God.
What did you do to him?

522
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,280
He fell into some cactus.

523
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:49,958
A lot of cactus.
We gave him tequila.

524
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:54,322
-The desert made a big impression.
-I told you to make it special!

525
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,008
Not to kill him!

526
00:51:57,049 --> 00:52:00,678
Get out! Get the hell out of here!
You too! Come on!

527
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:03,637
Baby?

528
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,842
Honey?

529
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:12,080
Whatever you do,
don't turn over.

530
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:14,599
I'll get the tweezers.

531
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:34,767
I'm confused.

532
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:39,199
If babies only see in black
and white, then why...

533
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:44,358
-...is Barney purple?
-Dinosaurs come later, tontito.

534
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,447
Wait, don't sit there.

535
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:50,368
-I'm doing the floors.
-Again?

536
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:54,324
I read about this.
This is the nesting period, isn't it?

537
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:58,522
It must be, because I can't get
this place clean enough.

538
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:09,598
-I'm sorry. Poor baby.
-I think there's still one in there.

539
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:15,122
Then we'll have to take the pants
off so that I can take a closer look.

540
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:19,203
-Whatever you say, doctor.
-I forgot to tell you...

541
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:23,198
...l ran into an old friend of yours.
Cathy something.

542
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:24,524
Cathy Stewart?

543
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,319
Really? When?

544
00:53:27,649 --> 00:53:32,165
Last week. The day of the cactus.
I think she's jealous.

545
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:34,407
Really?

546
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:36,684
I'll get it.

547
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:43,804
Coming!

548
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,927
-Surprise!
-Mom!

549
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:50,198
Dad!

550
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:53,447
This was her idea.

551
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:56,960
Cathy said we just had
to get out here...

552
00:53:57,249 --> 00:54:01,447
-...and see what you were up to.
-She insisted. What is that?

553
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:03,724
A squirrel?

554
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:07,920
-Who is it?
-I got it, hon.

555
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,922
Now that is a housekeeper.

556
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:14,842
Did we come at a bad time?

557
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:19,285
She's just cleaning the oven,
and the fumes are....

558
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:23,647
Well, you're here.
You're really here.

559
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:36,681
-Are you going to introduce us?
-Yes. Yes. This is....

560
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:44,844
-Isabel.
-Isabel, right. Right.

561
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:48,167
It's nice to meet you.

562
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:51,646
I'm Alex's mother, Mrs. Whitman,
and this is Mr. Whitman.

563
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:54,682
Oh, my God, you're his parents!

564
00:54:55,289 --> 00:55:00,079
My God, look at me. I'm a mess.
It's so great to finally meet you.

565
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:04,002
But please, come in.

566
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:06,043
Very friendly.

567
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,520
You must be exhausted.
Want a drink?

568
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,085
That is a great idea.
Why don't you get the drinks.

569
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:16,042
I love you.
And I'll think of something.

570
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:17,808
Who wants a cold beer?

571
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,205
-Terrific.
-I'd love one.

572
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:23,761
Don't tell them anything
until I come back.

573
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:25,886
She is wonderful.

574
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:30,765
There must be a lot of good help
here, so close to Mexico.

575
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:34,323
-Such a warm people.
-Is this a company house?

576
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:37,646
You'd think they could afford
a decent decorator.

577
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:41,281
Dad, Mom, why don't you sit down?

578
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,198
What is this?

579
00:55:48,249 --> 00:55:51,082
Honey, is there something wrong?

580
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:59,926
Yes. I have to tell lsabel
where the bottle opener is.

581
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:03,560
So how was Europe?
You came back soon.

582
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:08,161
-Europe?
-Alex said you went for the summer.

583
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,805
You know better.
We hate Europe in the summer.

584
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,637
-Too many tourists.
-Europe in the summer.

585
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:21,084
You lied to me.
All this time.

586
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,038
Listen--

587
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:35,721
-What does that mean?
-You're a liar and a coward.

588
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:42,242
It sounded much prettier
in Spanish.

589
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:44,527
Will you excuse me?

590
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:50,237
Sounds like somebody's
about to get fired.

591
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,239
-I was going to tell them.
-When?

592
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:01,124
-After the baby's born?
-I didn't want to on the phone.

593
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:05,965
My father won't even speak to me!
But I told him the truth.

594
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:10,766
But you don't even have the balls to
call and let them know!

595
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:12,443
What is it?

596
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:17,567
Do you want out?
I'm not good enough for you?

597
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:22,207
My family's not like yours.
I never see them.

598
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:26,118
Excuses, excuses, excuses.
You should have told them!

599
00:57:26,489 --> 00:57:30,607
I wanted to in person. Why is that
so hard for you to understand?

600
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:37,800
Here is your big chance.

601
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:45,288
Mom, Dad...

602
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:49,964
...l have some interesting
and exciting news.

603
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,718
I'd like you to meet
lsabel Fuentes...Whitman.

604
00:57:58,609 --> 00:57:59,803
Oh, my God!

605
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:13,119
I let them come.
That doesn't mean I have to like it.

606
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,242
-Mama, do something.
-Why're you being difficult?

607
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:21,080
They aren't her in-laws
because she's not married!

608
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:23,599
If she's not married,
she has no in-laws!

609
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:27,518
Why am I celebrating Cinco de Mayo
with strangers?

610
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,118
They're strangers
because you won't talk to them!

611
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:32,238
Tomas...

612
00:58:32,529 --> 00:58:37,205
...either you act like the man I
married, or sleep with the dogs!

613
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:48,197
I hope you have plenty of lotion on.

614
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:52,965
The desert sun kicks off this water
like a mirror.

615
00:58:53,649 --> 00:58:57,961
No, I think that if we just stay
in the shade, we'll be fine.

616
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:01,525
Suit yourselves.
Pity you didn't bring suits.

617
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,687
Well, we didn't exactly plan for this.

618
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,679
Jesus Christ, is it hot!

619
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:18,606
Senor, I'd like to tell
you something.

620
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:23,640
I don't think these kids have a clue
what they are getting into.

621
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:25,727
I couldn't agree more.

622
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:27,522
-Really?
-Absolutely.

623
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:30,277
Marriage is a serious commitment.

624
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:34,482
I think that it's terribly romantic.

625
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:38,047
Hon, you're not helping.

626
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:39,887
I must agree with her.

627
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:43,798
You men forget how foolish
you once were chasing us.

628
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:46,683
This is different.
They are different.

629
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:50,325
They come from a different culture,
a different world.

630
00:59:50,609 --> 00:59:54,761
It's hard enough to make a marriage
work without adding to it.

631
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,643
Listen to the man, Alex.
He has a point.

632
00:59:58,049 --> 01:00:01,166
I think they're going to
start spelling words soon.

633
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:05,368
-Can't you just be happy for us?
-I'm afraid for you.

634
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:08,766
This wouldn't have happened
if he hadn't gone after you--

635
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:14,328
Wait just a second, Tomas.
It takes two to tango.

636
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:18,841
-She's as guilty as he is.
-Now let's just calm down, shall we?

637
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:24,518
They fell in love.
And love is a beautiful thing.

638
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:30,208
Ask yourself. Where will you live,
how will you raise your child?

639
01:00:31,409 --> 01:00:32,762
We don't know yet.

640
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,038
You see?

641
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:37,401
Let's start with the economics.
They'll live in New York.

642
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:42,007
-Because that's where his job is.
-And the religion must be Catholic.

643
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,248
Says who?

644
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:48,761
The mother is Catholic.
Whatever the mother is, the baby is.

645
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:54,249
-What is the matter with Presbyterian?
-That is not a religion.

646
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,566
-I beg your pardon?
-Thomas, Tomas, whatever....

647
01:00:58,009 --> 01:01:02,241
This country was founded by people
escaping religious persecution.

648
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:05,123
The Whitmans were one of them!

649
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:08,287
When the west was stolen
from Mexico...

650
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:10,321
...the Fuentes made a vow.

651
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:13,965
Even though they took our land,
they'd never take our culture!

652
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:16,479
Culture?
You call this culture?

653
01:01:16,769 --> 01:01:20,045
Guacamole and a ghetto blaster
in the middle of a desert?

654
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:24,288
You're offending Amalia's dip?
What's wrong with it?

655
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:29,484
In case you didn't notice,
the white people are melting out here!

656
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:57,207
It was 1 1 2 degrees.
I fried an egg on my head.

657
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,559
And he didn't mean "white."

658
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:03,999
-He meant, not tan.
-Don't go there.

659
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:07,645
Your father wasn't helpful
with that Catholic talk.

660
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:11,445
Alex, the first time I realized
I was pregnant...

661
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:15,961
...l got stopped at a stoplight
in front of Saint Viviana's.

662
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:18,843
You know what it was?
It was a sign.

663
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:22,326
-Of what?
-That the baby would be Catholic.

664
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:26,568
-At least it wasn't before an IHOP!
-Think that's funny?

665
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:30,046
Religion is the opiate
of the masses, okay?

666
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,763
Country clubs
are filled with racists.

667
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:37,241
Right, I agree. Do you think
a crucifix will protect you?

668
01:02:37,529 --> 01:02:41,283
Yes, I do. I believe
because I am a woman of faith.

669
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:45,448
The faith I have
in that crucifix and in us...

670
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,038
...comes from the same place
inside me!

671
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:50,445
Now you, on the other hand...

672
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:54,481
...you're not an active Presbyterian.

673
01:02:54,769 --> 01:02:59,718
So, why don't you want me to carry
my faith and belief to our child?

674
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:05,129
-It's a good thing to do!
-It's not the only thing to do!

675
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:08,158
Where're you going?

676
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:11,646
-You aren't my favourite person now.
-Well, you either.

677
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:17,125
Do you want my advice? Get out now.
I'll even file for you.

678
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:21,242
-Who said lawyers don't have hearts?
-What did you expect?

679
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:23,804
Your relationship
is built on heat.

680
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:27,525
It's like Vegas.
Why didn't they build it on the sun?

681
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,800
You're not the guy to talk to.

682
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:32,808
I'm the perfect guy.
I know what you are trying to do.

683
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:36,320
The longer you put this off,
the worse it'll be.

684
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:39,248
Put what off?
I just said we had a fight.

685
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:42,362
You said a lot more than that.
Look...

686
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:46,405
...we're here to get a job done
and we're behind schedule.

687
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,645
Cinco de Mayo fell
on a Tuesday!

688
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:53,445
-The shit's going to hit the fan.
-Why? What's up?

689
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,082
We had a visit from OSHA.

690
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:58,998
Talk to the foreman. We came close
to a red-tag shutdown.

691
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:03,083
Jesus.

692
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:06,765
-I'll handle this, okay?
-Good.

693
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:20,964
-May I help you?
-Isabel Fuentes...Whitman.

694
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:30,599
-I thought you had work.
-I do, but I need to talk to you.

695
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:32,800
I need to talk to you too.

696
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:35,967
I feel really bad
about how things have been.

697
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:38,803
Oh, no.
No, it was my fault.

698
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:43,239
I haven't been honest with you.

699
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:48,283
And I was thinking
on the way over....

700
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:50,438
Hello, lsabel.

701
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:53,687
-How are we today?
-We are fine.

702
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:58,448
-You're the father. I'm Lisa Barnes.
-Alex Whitman.

703
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,243
You're in time for the show.

704
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:05,083
You want to watch?
Come over.

705
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:12,246
-Will that hurt?
-Oh, no. It tickles.

706
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:19,327
What is that?

707
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:23,568
-That's your baby's heartbeat.
-It's so fast.

708
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:24,758
It's normal.

709
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:26,038
Neat, huh?

710
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:32,002
There's the head.

711
01:05:33,449 --> 01:05:34,928
There's a leg.

712
01:05:37,009 --> 01:05:38,283
Wait a minute.

713
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:40,802
Is that his...?

714
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:43,405
Actually, I think that's an arm.

715
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,408
It's too early to determine
the baby's sex.

716
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:52,442
Let's take the first picture
of your baby.

717
01:05:57,969 --> 01:05:59,448
I'm sorry.

718
01:06:00,889 --> 01:06:02,038
Me too.

719
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:07,960
I could hear its heartbeat
going " ba-doom-boom."

720
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:12,037
I spoke to New York.
Who's three weeks ahead of schedule?

721
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:15,287
-Charlie Peters doesn't have a life.
-I'm just saying.

722
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:19,482
-Where the hell is my crane?
-Foreman says tomorrow morning.

723
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:22,522
Hello!

724
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:26,399
What are you doing here?

725
01:06:26,689 --> 01:06:28,839
I've come to kidnap you.

726
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:33,362
-This is really not a good day.
-Don't make me hurt you, gringo.

727
01:06:33,649 --> 01:06:36,846
It's his birthday
and I won't take no for an answer.

728
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:38,602
Will you cover for me?

729
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:42,366
-Please?
-Have a good time.

730
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:45,045
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

731
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:50,842
Where are we going?

732
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:53,717
It's a surprise.
Big surprise.

733
01:06:58,089 --> 01:07:00,842
The very first time I came here...

734
01:07:01,129 --> 01:07:05,486
...my father told me about a family of
squirrels that lived on the plateau.

735
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:09,048
He said that one day
the canyon split.

736
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:12,403
Half the squirrels were
on the north rim...

737
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:14,526
...and the other half
on the south.

738
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,682
Over time, the two families
became different.

739
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:20,642
Each one adjusted
to their environment.

740
01:07:20,889 --> 01:07:26,407
The ones to the north are dark,
bushy-tailed, and have bigger ears.

741
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:31,809
The ones to the south are leaner,
meaner and much prettier.

742
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:37,248
Even though they look different
and they act different...

743
01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:40,959
...they are the exact same squirrel.

744
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:44,958
They just grew up
on different sides.

745
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:50,125
And this canyon between them...

746
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,322
...will they be able to cross it?

747
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:57,397
Well....

748
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:02,046
I've been thinking
of making you a deal.

749
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:05,965
If we can stay here
until the baby's born...

750
01:08:06,609 --> 01:08:09,681
-...I'll move to New York.
-That's so great!

751
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:13,518
I'm not saying I'll like it.
But I'll give it a try.

752
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,162
You got a deal.

753
01:08:16,449 --> 01:08:19,361
Good, then I can give
you your present.

754
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:22,600
You mean there's more?

755
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:28,918
I called my new mother-in-law
and asked her to do me a favour.

756
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,602
This arrived today.

757
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,365
I can't believe you did this.

758
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:53,844
Who said you can't have
the best of both worlds?

759
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:01,847
This is the most wonderful birthday
I've ever had.

760
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:11,442
You think this is good
wait till you try these.

761
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:14,763
Let's see.

762
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:26,247
This is good.

763
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:33,605
You've got five men without hardhats,
no load statement...

764
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:36,483
...the bathroom doesn't meet
handicapped standards...

765
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:40,239
...and I told your foreman
two weeks ago to build that ramp.

766
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:46,126
-I'm going to have to shut you down.
-Would you excuse us for a minute?

767
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,969
Stanley, Stanley, walk with me.

768
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:52,207
You're putting 25 guys out of work?

769
01:09:57,449 --> 01:10:02,443
I mean it. You got one week.
Anything goes wrong, it's your ass.

770
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:06,881
If anything else goes wrong,
I'll red-tag this place myself.

771
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,761
Let's go to lunch.

772
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:16,723
What happened?

773
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,840
-Jimmy, get over here!
-We could take my car.

774
01:10:21,249 --> 01:10:23,888
-It was a sign.
-Of course.

775
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:26,729
God was saying to quit
and stay with you.

776
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:31,002
No, Mama, it was
a real sign, with neon.

777
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:34,483
Then it was a miracle
nobody got hurt.

778
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:37,966
-When does your husband come home?
-Tonight.

779
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:41,480
-He doesn't sound very good.
-Oh, wait.

780
01:10:41,769 --> 01:10:45,478
Which candle am I lighting?
To keep the job or lose the job?

781
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:47,564
To keep.

782
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:55,367
I should have sent you to Tokyo.

783
01:10:55,609 --> 01:10:59,158
Judd, I can open Vegas
in three weeks.

784
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:05,358
If you could pull that off...

785
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:10,081
...l might have to
give you the Midtown Club.

786
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:16,441
-You'd still give it to me?
-You're the best field man I've got.

787
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,480
We break ground July 1 st.

788
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,919
Jeff said it wasn't starting
until October.

789
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:24,120
Want me to give it to someone else?

790
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,328
It's just that the baby's
due in October.

791
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:34,765
-And I promised--
-Is there a problem?

792
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:39,160
There's no problem.

793
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:55,284
Look what Petra and Antonio got us.
Isn't it cute?

794
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:03,364
We have clubs in New York.

795
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:07,927
We have clubs in Dallas, in Hawaii.
We have clubs everywhere.

796
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:11,122
So with your help,
and yours, and yours...

797
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:14,845
...this can be the most successful
club we've ever had.

798
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:48,123
Honey, let him get the club opened.

799
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:52,564
He's changed, Lanie.
I can't reach him.

800
01:12:53,689 --> 01:12:57,728
-Something happened in New York.
-He's got a lot on his mind.

801
01:12:58,009 --> 01:13:02,161
No, it's more than that.
He's in trouble, but won't tell me.

802
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:05,839
-Think he wants out?
-I don't know.

803
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,169
-I've worried about you.
-Me too.

804
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:08,407
You shouldn't worry.
It's your big night.

805
01:14:10,809 --> 01:14:14,040
Now that the club's open,
we should talk--

806
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:17,520
I am so proud of you, Alex.
This looks fantastic.

807
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:24,079
-Why aren't you more excited?
-Well, it's been a little hectic.

808
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:27,202
It's been a lot going on.

809
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:29,921
You look great.

810
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,761
I look fat.

811
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:36,401
Feel this.

812
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:41,878
The baby likes the music.

813
01:14:44,289 --> 01:14:47,998
There's a teeny little problem
in the kitchen.

814
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:51,127
I'll see you?
See you.

815
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:59,523
You and Jeff seem
to be getting along.

816
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:02,721
I hate talking to men
prettier than I am.

817
01:15:03,009 --> 01:15:04,158
Right.

818
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:06,478
You okay?

819
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:11,207
-This baby seems to be mad at me.
-Here. Come on, sit down.

820
01:15:11,489 --> 01:15:13,161
Let's go.
Excuse me.

821
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:15,758
-I'll get Alex.
-No, you won't.

822
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:20,088
-Just wait a minute. It'll pass.
-I'll get you some water.

823
01:15:42,849 --> 01:15:44,248
There you are.

824
01:15:45,449 --> 01:15:50,000
Judd, this is my wife, lsabel.
This is my boss, Judd Marshall.

825
01:15:50,849 --> 01:15:54,046
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

826
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:55,923
Nice to meet you.

827
01:15:56,249 --> 01:15:58,319
You're in for an adventure.

828
01:15:59,169 --> 01:16:00,807
It has been so far.

829
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:04,798
I knew if I dangled the Midtown Club
before Alex he'd get on track.

830
01:16:05,089 --> 01:16:07,159
-We don't need to talk--
-Excuse me?

831
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:12,079
By this time next week
you'll both be New Yorkers.

832
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,884
Great work,
but I must get out of here.

833
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:19,242
Nightclubs give me a headache.
See you next week for dinner.

834
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:20,723
Nice meeting you.

835
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,203
I'll walk you out.

836
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:33,440
There was nothing I could do.
It starts July 1 st.

837
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:34,638
Have them wait.

838
01:16:34,809 --> 01:16:36,561
-I can't.
-Or won't?

839
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:39,482
-I have worked too long to--
-To what?

840
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:43,523
To share your life
with someone who loves you?

841
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:51,127
-You have to be there, every day!
-Why've I been killing myself?

842
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:54,879
You knew about this for a month,
but you don't include me.

843
01:16:55,329 --> 01:16:57,524
Why are you afraid of me?

844
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:02,719
-Why do you alienate me?
-I don't, I don't know!

845
01:17:07,049 --> 01:17:09,199
I told you in the beginning...

846
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:13,243
...l have no problem raising
this child on my own.

847
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:18,601
-I thought we were a family!
-You don't understand the concept.

848
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:22,882
To you it's something you put up with
on national holidays.

849
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:25,444
Love, it's a gift, Alex.

850
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:30,161
-Not an obligation.
-Look, this is the brass ring.

851
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:32,599
I've worked my entire life
for this opportunity.

852
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:36,165
I won't give it up
because I put a $5 ring...

853
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:38,969
...on your finger in front of Elvis!

854
01:17:58,129 --> 01:17:59,357
Come here.

855
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:31,364
Hello?

856
01:18:35,049 --> 01:18:36,368
What happened?

857
01:18:39,769 --> 01:18:41,919
-Maternity?
-Second floor.

858
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:51,282
-Are you okay?
-I'm all right.

859
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,600
Is the baby okay?

860
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,002
There is no baby.

861
01:19:04,969 --> 01:19:06,288
What?

862
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:11,246
If I hadn't been pregnant,
I wouldn't have gone to your house...

863
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:14,327
...and we wouldn't have
gotten married.

864
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:17,686
The baby was the reason
for us to be together.

865
01:19:18,809 --> 01:19:21,118
-Not true.
-I thought it was fate.

866
01:19:21,409 --> 01:19:24,401
But it was just a stupid,
superstitious dream.

867
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,805
There are no signs, Alex.

868
01:19:27,769 --> 01:19:33,241
-We're different and always will be.
-So what are you saying?

869
01:19:33,529 --> 01:19:37,681
-We're not meant to be together.
-Don't do this. Not now.

870
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:42,087
-Alex, this is not going to work.
-Let me help you!

871
01:19:43,249 --> 01:19:44,762
Get out, Alex.

872
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,565
Get out!

873
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,321
Get out!

874
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:27,317
Now, come on,
don't be a putz.

875
01:23:27,489 --> 01:23:31,277
I can't believe you're turning down
seats to a Yankee game.

876
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:34,282
-I have work to do.
-You are killing me.

877
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:37,805
The girls come two to a bag.
You can't date one without the other.

878
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:40,403
I am not up for it.
Okay, Jeff?

879
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,717
Well, get up for it, okay, Alex?

880
01:23:43,889 --> 01:23:47,120
You know, this monk thing
is getting old.

881
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:51,282
-Alex Whitman?
-That's me.

882
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:54,003
Then this is for you.
Sign here.

883
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,207
-What is this?
-Divorce papers.

884
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:03,044
You have six days to contest.
Have a nice day.

885
01:24:03,649 --> 01:24:05,321
You too.

886
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,999
There you go. Life sucks.
Welcome to the club.

887
01:24:09,289 --> 01:24:12,247
Now, about Friday.
Come with us.

888
01:24:18,609 --> 01:24:20,520
Nanita, it was the right thing to do.

889
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:24,563
It is not your faith that has
betrayed you. It is your fear.

890
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:26,840
I got lost...that's all.

891
01:24:27,249 --> 01:24:29,717
But now I make my own decisions.

892
01:24:30,129 --> 01:24:33,599
How selfish you are. To presume you
know better than love.

893
01:24:36,849 --> 01:24:41,001
He never would have left
if he knew I was still pregnant.

894
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:44,441
He wanted to go.
I let him off the hook.

895
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:46,441
No. You let yourself off the hook.

896
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:50,364
You denied your heart and lied to the
man you love. Why?

897
01:25:01,289 --> 01:25:06,079
Because I had to. If I didn't leave
him, he would have left me.

898
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:11,766
And I really don't think
I could've handled that.

899
01:25:17,169 --> 01:25:22,448
You will never know love
unless you surrender to it.

900
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:45,325
-Whitman.
-It's Cathy. Is this a bad time?

901
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:47,201
Cathy Stewart.

902
01:25:48,329 --> 01:25:53,119
-Your timing is impeccable.
-I heard about you and your wife...

903
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:56,685
...and I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

904
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:02,118
Okay, so listen. Your parents
are coming this weekend.

905
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:06,004
Is there any chance
you couldjoin us?

906
01:26:07,809 --> 01:26:10,004
-Hello?
-You know what?

907
01:26:12,249 --> 01:26:13,921
You've got a date.

908
01:26:33,129 --> 01:26:34,960
There are signs everywhere.

909
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:47,807
-What did you say?
-You look lost.

910
01:26:48,129 --> 01:26:52,202
There are signs everywhere
to help you find your way.

911
01:27:34,929 --> 01:27:36,681
South Street heliport.

912
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:31,918
There you are.

913
01:28:35,089 --> 01:28:36,761
Hi, darling.

914
01:28:37,449 --> 01:28:39,440
Isn't this fun?

915
01:28:39,809 --> 01:28:44,439
I was telling Diane I can't remember
the last time we got together.

916
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:49,044
Hear you've been doing
great things with that club.

917
01:28:52,089 --> 01:28:55,923
-Wait till you see Bruce's new boat.
-A weekend toy.

918
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:59,599
-Let's get this show on the road.
-Let's go.

919
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:03,007
A perfect weekend.

920
01:29:08,169 --> 01:29:11,878
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am.

921
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:15,886
I just have a thing
about helicopters.

922
01:29:16,969 --> 01:29:19,688
Well, you just stick by me then.

923
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:22,568
Here, let me....

924
01:29:24,329 --> 01:29:25,523
Thank you.

925
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:39,360
Isabel!
Come back inside!

926
01:31:18,489 --> 01:31:19,808
Tamazula?

927
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:23,608
How do I get there?

928
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:38,086
What the hell's a "tranvia"?

929
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,121
That bus over there.

930
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:34,240
No, she's not here. She went home to
give birth to your baby.

931
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:37,006
I don't understand that.

932
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:39,322
To Las Vegas.

933
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:42,768
You must be kidding.

934
01:32:43,049 --> 01:32:46,166
So you are lsabel's great love...

935
01:32:47,489 --> 01:32:49,286
...my dear sweet boy.

936
01:33:16,089 --> 01:33:17,488
Lanie, please.

937
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:21,125
I'm probably flying over her now.
When did she call?

938
01:33:21,409 --> 01:33:25,084
A few hours ago. She was in Nogales,
so she'll be here at 8.

939
01:33:25,489 --> 01:33:26,808
Why? What'll you do?

940
01:34:37,329 --> 01:34:38,887
What, are you nuts?

941
01:34:41,089 --> 01:34:42,522
Get off the road!

942
01:34:42,809 --> 01:34:46,358
What the hell!
Are you trying to get us killed?

943
01:34:47,569 --> 01:34:49,685
I'm not giving you a divorce!

944
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:53,681
-You're too late.
-No, I still got till 1 2.

945
01:34:55,849 --> 01:34:59,205
-It's over!
-Get the hell off the road!

946
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:02,845
There was a priest!
He said there were signs!

947
01:35:03,129 --> 01:35:04,164
What priest?

948
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:07,964
By the hot dogs! You add
the Chihuahua, the Grand Canyon...

949
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:12,925
...the child named lsabel.
There were signs everywhere!

950
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:16,679
-I don't believe in signs, anymore.
-You do.

951
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:19,119
Yes, you do!
And you were wrong.

952
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:22,685
The baby didn't bring us together.
It was something bigger!

953
01:35:22,969 --> 01:35:28,805
-I just didn't believe in it till now.
-Don't do this.

954
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:34,643
I love you.
I love you so much it hurts.

955
01:35:35,929 --> 01:35:38,079
What's going on
with your stomach?!

956
01:35:38,369 --> 01:35:41,486
-Oh, Alex, just go home!
-You're still pregnant!

957
01:35:42,289 --> 01:35:44,757
-You're still pregnant!
-I know!

958
01:35:45,049 --> 01:35:49,122
-How could you lie to me?
-I was afraid, all right?

959
01:35:49,409 --> 01:35:54,085
I tried to reach you, but l--
You lied to me, so I lied to you!

960
01:35:54,369 --> 01:35:55,722
I know, I know.

961
01:35:56,009 --> 01:35:59,718
But I was wrong and I'm sorry.
I'm here now.

962
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:03,360
Don't you know what this means?
We have a baby!

963
01:36:03,649 --> 01:36:08,120
No. I'm having a baby.
You call 91 1 .

964
01:36:08,409 --> 01:36:11,560
-Why?
-Because my water just broke.

965
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:15,327
But we're on a dam!

966
01:36:25,649 --> 01:36:29,278
Excuse me. The ambulance
should be here in 1 0 minutes.

967
01:36:29,569 --> 01:36:31,048
Is this your wife?

968
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:34,005
Can we move you
to the main building?

969
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,325
The contractions are
on top of each other.

970
01:36:36,609 --> 01:36:38,884
The contractions are
on top of each other!

971
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:41,558
I'm not deaf, I'm in labour!

972
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:46,085
-We're having a baby!
-I hate you! I hate you!

973
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:48,644
-I hate you!
-They always say that.

974
01:36:49,409 --> 01:36:52,526
You can do this.
You're the bravest person I know.

975
01:36:56,089 --> 01:36:59,638
-What'd she say?
-She loves me. Can't live without me.

976
01:36:59,929 --> 01:37:04,161
Looks like we're going to have
this baby right here, right now.

977
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:05,802
Give her some air!

978
01:37:06,809 --> 01:37:11,644
-The baby's coming. But I'm here.
-Go away. You're bad luck.

979
01:37:11,929 --> 01:37:16,923
-I'm never leaving again.
-Get away from me!

980
01:37:17,849 --> 01:37:22,604
Oh, baby, don't go, please.
I'm so sorry for everything.

981
01:37:22,889 --> 01:37:24,527
I need you so much.

982
01:37:24,809 --> 01:37:26,527
I love you. I love you.

983
01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:29,365
You're breaking my hand!

984
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:31,401
I need you to start pushing.

985
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:35,725
There's a blanket in my car.
It's for the baby.

986
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:37,965
-I'll get it.
-Push, push.

987
01:37:41,049 --> 01:37:45,486
-Oh, please, say anything.
-I rode a mule.

988
01:37:45,769 --> 01:37:49,557
-No wonder you stink.
-Your great-grandmother kissed me.

989
01:37:50,889 --> 01:37:53,119
You went to Aguascalientes?

990
01:37:55,329 --> 01:37:56,444
The blanket.

991
01:37:57,569 --> 01:38:01,642
-The head's out.
-Okay, breathe. This is it.

992
01:38:01,929 --> 01:38:03,157
Breathe!

993
01:38:06,209 --> 01:38:08,200
One more big push.

994
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:26,200
-It's a girl!
-She's so beautiful.

995
01:38:27,889 --> 01:38:29,959
Oh, baby.

996
01:39:28,609 --> 01:39:33,319
-That was a little superstitious.
-I don't want to tempt fate.

997
01:39:43,489 --> 01:39:49,485
-Think she'll like living in New York?
-Not as much as camping in the desert.

998
01:39:51,249 --> 01:39:54,127
With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs.

999
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:01,518

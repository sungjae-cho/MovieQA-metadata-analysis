That you were forced
to retire...

152
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,851
because of,

153
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,978
um, a sex scandal.

154
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,455
A homosexual scandal,
you mean.

155
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,152
For me to answer
a question of that magnitude,

156
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,855
you'll have to remove
both your shoes and socks.

157

You're a dirty old man.

158
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,564

159
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,042
Oh, it is kind of you
to indulge your elders in their vices,

160
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,609
just as I indulge the young
in theirs.

My only other vice.

163
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,232

a fuller answer to that question.

out of the papers.

who George Cukor is,

and I'll tell you all about it.

173
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,854
George is famous for
his Saturday dinner parties.

174
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,858
Great writers, artists,
society folk,

175
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,588
all rubbing elbows
with Hollywood royalty.

176
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,665
But how many of those
oh-so-proper people...

177
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,666
know about the Sunday brunches
that follow?

178
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,169
Armies of trade
eating up the leftovers,

179
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,799
followed by some strenuous
fun and frolic in the pool. [Snickers]

180
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,672
Can we talk about
the horror movies now?

181
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,610
Certainly.

182
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,616
Is there anything in particular
that you want to know?

183
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,186
Will you tell me
everything you remember...

184
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,187
about making Frankenstein?

185
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,587
[Whispers]
Ohh.

186
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,490
Can that count
as one question?

187
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,962
- Of course.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

188
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,207
Just like going swimming,
isn't it?

189
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,212
Well, maybe you'd like a swim
when we're through.

190
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,943
I don't swim myself,
so the pool tends to go to waste.

191
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,951
Okay.
Frankenstein.

192
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,783
Who came up with
the monster's makeup and look?

193
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,790
Oh, my idea, mostly,
from my sketches.

194
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,792
Big, heavy brow.

195
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,352
The head flat on top so you could take
out the old brain and put in the new...

196
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,398
like tinned beef.

197
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,834
[Laughs] He's one of
the great images of the 20th century,

198
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,372
more important
than the Mona Lisa.

199
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,407
Oh, don't be daft.

200
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,342
Is just makeup and padding
and a big actor.

201
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,675
Is hardly the Mona Lisa.

202
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,477
Boris Karloff.

203
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,484
How did you ever think of casting him
as the Monster?

204
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,819
He'd never even starred
in a movie before that.

205
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,129
Mr. Whale?

206
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,200
Is something the matter?

207
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,637
- [Grunts]
- Mr. Whale?

208
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,640
Please excuse me.

209
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,571
Are you all right?

210
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,578
[Groaning]

211
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,978
Just...

212
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,313
need to lie down.

213
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,081
- Studio. There's a day bed
in the studio.
- [Gasps]

214
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,091
Oh, my God. Mr. Whale,
wh-whas wrong? Is it your heart?

215
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,491
No, head, not heart.

216
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,801
Water.
Glass is in sink.

217
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,803
Which ones?
I bring them all.

218
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,805
Luminal.

219
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,685
Mr. Kay,
you're not dressed.

220
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,896
I was gonna go swimming.

221
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,761
So you were.

222
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,529
Mmm.
You should probably go home.

223
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,298

You must think I'm terrible,

00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,812
I don't think
you're anything anymore.

228
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,319
Just back from the hospital,
already you're chasing after boys.

229
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,823
Oh, shut up.
All we did was talk.

230
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,829
Perhaps I should get you uphill
before the pills knock you cold.

231
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,023
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, no.

232
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,066
Let me stay here.

233
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,936
Thank you.

00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,091

- [Man] Mr. Whale?

00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,288
- [Mother]
Jimmy, privy needs cleanin'.
- Mr. Whale.

238
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,895
Open your eyes.

239
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,534
Now look left.

240
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,767
Thas right.
And breathe out.

241
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,773
Good.
Les see what we've got.

242
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,781
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Whale.

243
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,783
Whatever damage was done
by your stroke,

244
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,786
it left your motor abilities
relatively unimpaired.

245
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,618
Yes, Dr. Payne, but what about
from the neck upwards?

246
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,716
- Whas the story there?
- Thas what I'm trying to explain.

247
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,057
The central nervous system
selects items...

248
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,063
from a constant storm
of sensations.

249
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,325
Whatever was killed
in your stroke...

250
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,665
seems to have short-circuited
this mechanism.

251
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,442
So you're saying there's an electrical
storm going on inside my head.

252
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,169
Well, thas as good a way
as any to describe it.

253
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,213
- I've seen far worse cases.
- What about all the rest?

254
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,977
The killing headaches.
The phantom smells.

255
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,018
My inability
to close my eyes...

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,317
without thinking of
a hundred things simultaneously.

257
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:23,156
I've never encountered the
olfactory hallucinations before,
but I'm sure they're related.

258
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,254
- So, what do I do?
- Take the Luminal to sleep...

259
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,833
and whenever you feel
an attack coming on.

260
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:33,337
What you're saying is that this isn't
just a case of resting until I'm better,

261
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:38,398
but that my condition will continue
to deteriorate until the end of my life.

262
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,914
You will take them all,
Mr. Jimmy.

263
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,917
Yes.
Don't you worry, Hanna.

264
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,919
- Good night.
- Thank you.

Shit.

270
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,842
Everything all right,
Mr. Boone?

271
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,004
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean
to disturb you. It got away from me.

272
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:54,346
I was just going to buzz Hanna
to bring down some iced tea.

273
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,354
I'd like it very much
if you'd join me.

274
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,653
I kinda stink to high heaven
right now.

275
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,489
Let me ask Hanna
to bring tea for two.

276
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,620
Or would you prefer
a beer?

277
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,632
Uh, no. Thanks.
But tea is fine.

278
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,032
Splendid.

279
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,834
Come in, Mr. Boone.

280
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,147
This is my workshop,
my studio.

281
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,184
Hardly somewhere where a sweaty workman
should feel out of place.

282
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,555
- Are these your paintings?
- Uh, yes. Yes.

283
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,626
Excuse me,
but, uh, are you famous?

284
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,425
Oh, well, you know what they say:
If you have to ask...

285
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,365
Look, I'm just a guy
who cuts lawns, but, uh,

286
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,368
some of these
do look familiar.

287
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,303
Thas because they were familiar
when I painted them.

288
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,205
The one you're looking at
is a copy of a Dutch still life...

289
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,711
done nearly 300 years ago.

290
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,246
And there's a Rembrandt
here somewhere.

291
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,512
Yeah, copies.
l-l... I got ya.

292
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:06,080
But before I retired, you might say
I had my time in the sun.

293
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,284
Fame, as it were.

294
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,386
- Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
- Yeah, sure. Everybody does.

295
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,126
- Why? Were you an actor?
- Oh, good Lord, no!

296
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,634
No... Well, actually,
I was, in my youth.

297
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,103
But never in Hollywood,
no, no.

298
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,071
No, here I was merely
a director.

299
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,404
Really?

300
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,980
- What were some of your movies?
- Oh, this and that.

301
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,744
The only ones you may have heard of
are the Frankenstein movies.

302
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,945
Frankenstein? And, um, uh,
Bride of Frankenstein?

303
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,956
- And Son of, and the other ones too?
- Uh, no.

304
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,619
I-I just directed the first two.
The others were done by hacks.

305
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,096
Yeah, but still, I mean,
th-those were big movies.

306
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,099
- You must be rich.
- Merely comfortable.

307
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,297
Look, Hanna's here with our
refreshments. Could you get the door?

308
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,930
Y-Yeah. Uh...

309
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,243
How are you feeling,
Mr. Jimmy?

310
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,786
How's your mind today?

311
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,585
My mind is lovely.
And yours?

312
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,492
Uh, remember what
the doctor tells us.

313
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,623
Yes, yes, yes. I have invited
Mr. Boone in merely for a cup of tea.

314
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,133
[Sighs]

315
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,831
We'll have a brief chat,
and then he'll finish the yard.

316
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,340
I am not forgetting
your last "brief chat."

317
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,606
Will you go away?
We can manage.

318
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,305
He looks plenty big.

319
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,247
He won't need my help
if anything goes "flooey."

320
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,751
Go.

321
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,522
Avaunt.

322
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,319
[Chuckles]

323
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,327
Comic maid.

324
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,263
No, she's a love,
Hanna.

325
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,861
But when they're in your employ
too long, servants begin to
think they're married to you.

326
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,668
Please sit down,
and do help yourself, Mr. Boone.

327
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,610
So, what did she mean
by things going all "flooey"?

328
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,516
I'm recently returned
from a spell in hospital.

329
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,350
- What happened?
- Nothing serious.

330
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,891
Touch of stroke.

331
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,892
Huh.

332
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,066
You must excuse
my staring,

333
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,074
but you have
the most marvelous head.

334
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,576
- Huh?
- To an artistic eye.

335
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,248
- Have you ever... modeled?
- What, you mean, like,
posed for pictures?

336
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,876
Sat for an artist?
Been sketched?

337
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,284
Mmm, n...

338
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,823
[Laughs]
Whas to sketch?

339
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,485
You have the most...

340
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,825
architectural skull.

341
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,592
And your nose,
is... very expressive.

342
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,737
- Broke is more like it.
- Mmm.

343
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,376
Oh, sorry to go on
like this.

344
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,378
Is just
the Sunday painter in me.

345
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,414
I quite understand
your refusal.

346
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,416
Is a great deal
to ask of anyone.

347
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,749
You mean, you really
want to draw me?

348
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,288
I would pay for the privilege
of drawing that head.

349
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,120
Is just my head
you want to draw? Nothin' else?

350
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,126
And what are you
suggesting?

351
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:35,928
That you'll charge extra if I include
a hand or a bit of shoulder?

352
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,135
No, I mean,
you don't wanna...

353
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,331
draw pictures of me
in my birthday suit, do you?

354
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,773
I have no interest
in your body, Mr. Boone.

355
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,936
I can assure you of that.

356
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,606
Well, uh...
[Chuckles]

357
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,651
Yeah.
Why not?

358
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,688
I mean, hell,
I could use the money.

359
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,380
Excellent.

360
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,511
Here are the trade papers
you wanted.

361
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,217
Hello? Hi.
I know you already paid me.

362
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,227
- I'm just here to...
- The master is waiting for you.

363
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,728
He's down in his studio.

364
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,730
Here.
Take this with you.

365
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,733
Uh, I'm sorry, lady.
You're gonna have to take this.

366
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,235
I'm just here
so he can draw my picture.

367
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,705
I'm keeping away. What you are doing
is no business of mine.

368
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:54,472
- What are you talking about?
- What kind of man are you?
Are you a good man?

369
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,548
Yeah. Something about me
make you think I'm not?

370
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,950
- You will not hurt him?
- I'm gonna sit in a chair,
and he's gonna draw my picture.

371
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,544
- You will not hurt him?
- I'm gonna sit in a chair,
and he's gonna draw my picture.

372
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,586
Is that gonna hurt him?

373
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,087
No.

374
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,092
I'm sorry.

375
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,129
Forget everything I said.
I will take the tray.

376
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,130
Yeah, you do that.

377
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,268
Ah, Mr. Boone.
Come into my parlor.

378
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,497
Ah, Hanna.
Good.

379
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,505
Thank you.

380
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,869
And, Hanna, good-bye.

381
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,380
Now, I'm sure you'd like
to wet your whistle while I work. Hmm?

382
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,382
Oh. Beer.

383
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,419
And we'll take it, uh,
slowly today...

384
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,421
because this is
your first time modeling.

385
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,423
- Oh, hey, did you see this?
- Hmm?

386
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,426
- They're showing one of
your movies tomorrow night.
- You don't say.

387
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,928
- Which picture?
- Uh, Bride of Frankenstein.

388
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,931
Ah. Mmm.

389
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,934
No, I much prefer
The Invisible Man or Showboat.

390
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,936
Right.
Now, shall we begin?

391
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah. I'm, uh...
I'm ready when you are.

392
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,978
- Oh, that shirt, Mr. Boone.
- Hmm?

393
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,809
Oh, is new.

394
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,144
Yes, I-I am sorry. Is just too white.
Is too distracting.

395
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,686
W-W-Would it be asking you too much
to take it off?

396
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,414
Well, I'm not wearing
an undershirt today.

397
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,855
Oh, pish posh.
I'm not your Aunt Tillie. [Laughing]

398
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,951
You did say that you just
wanted to draw my face, right?

399
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,964
Oh, well, if is going
to make you feel uncomfortable,

400
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,297
perhaps we can find
something else for you to wear.

401
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,964
Now, um...

402
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,909
Yes, we could drape this
across your shoulders like a toga.

403
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,504
Would that help you overcome
your schoolgirl shyness?

404
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,674
All right, all right.

405
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,718
I'll take the shirt off.

406
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,421
Kinda warm in here anyway.

407
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,755
Oh, yes.
Thas better.

408
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,556
Now...

409
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:57,800
And if you'd like to sit
slightly sideways... to me.

410
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,998
Thas right. And then
just put your arm on the box there.

411
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,241
Just so.

412
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,250
Why don't you take a picture?
lll last longer.

413
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,087
Thas exactly
what I'm going to do.

414
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,561
[Mutters]
Yeah.

415
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,564
Mm-hmm.

416
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,240
Is just like
being at the doctor.

417
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:42,245
You have to remain perfectly still
while I examine and scrutinize you.

418
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,248
[Sniffing]

419
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,484
Dripping.

420
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,213
Huh?

421
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,025
Do you ever eat dripping
in this country?

422
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,523
The fats
from roast and such...

423
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,531
kept congealed in a jar...

424
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,329
and then used like butter
on bread and toast.

425
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,528
Sounds like something
you'd feed the dog.

426
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,869
Yes, it is.
Only the poorest families ever et it.

427
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,966
We used to keep ours
in a large, blue crockery jar.

428
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,945
Your family ate,
uh, dripping?

429
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,450
Oh, of course not.
No, no.

430
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,712
As I said,
only the poorest families.

431
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:29,086
Oh, God, is ironic.

432
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,752
What is?

433
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:35,890
I've spent much of my life
outrunning the past,

434
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,901
and now it floods
all over me.

435
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:43,667
There's something about
the openness of your face that
makes me want to tell the truth.

436
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,677
Yes, our family
et dripping.

437
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,179
Beef dripping.

438
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,249
And four to a bed.

439
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,376
And a privy out back
in the alley.

440
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,580
Are you also from the slums,
Mr. Boone?

441
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,489
Well, we weren't rich,
but w-w-we weren't poor either.

442
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,721
No, well, you were
middle-class, hmm?

443
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,729
Like all Americans,
hmm?

444
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:12,235
Well, I don't know.
I guess you could say we lived
on the wrong side of the tracks.

445
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,737
Well, in Dudley,
in the north of England,

446
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,366
there were more sides to the tracks
than any American could imagine.

447
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,376
Every Englishman
knows his place,

448
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,878
and if you forget,
there's always someone to remind you.

449
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,882
Our family had no doubt
about who they were,

450
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,545
but I was an aberration
in that household, a freak of nature.

451
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:34,089
I had imagination,
cleverness, joy.

452
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,490
Now, where did I get that?

453
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,085
[Chuckles]

454
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,427
Certainly not from them.

455
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,262
They took me out of school
when I was 14...

456
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,739
and put me in a factory.

457
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,743
They meant no harm.

458
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,645
They were like a family of farmers
who've been given a giraffe...

459
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,118
and don't know what to do
with the creature except
to harness him to the plow.

460
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:09,083
Hatred was the only thing
that kept my soul alive...

461
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:13,289
in that soul-killing place.

462
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,827
And amongst the men
I hated...

463
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,838
was my own poor,
dear, dumb father,

464
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,009
who'd put me into that hell
in the first place.

465
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,914
Mr. Whale?

466
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,825
[Groans]

467
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,197
I apologize, Mr. Boone.
l...

468
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,274
Since my stroke,

469
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,675
I am often overcome
with nostalgia.

470
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,180
Well, I'm not that crazy about the
old man myself. You know what I mean?

471
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,680
Um...

472
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,090
Shall we just have a break
for five minutes, hmm?

473
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,095

00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,265
[Woman] Spooky movie.
Just what this place needs tonight.

475
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,004
Couldn't get any deader,
doll. Set me up.

476
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,165
Your friend want one?

477
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,505
Yeah. One for
whas-his-name here.

478
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,046
Thanks, doll.

479
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,549
I say we let lover boy
watch his movie...

480
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,051
and be grateful
he's not cuttin' Shirley Temple's lawn.

481
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,555
- Why is everyone
breakin' my balls tonight?
- Jesus, Boone.

482
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,057
You walk in here
proud as a peacock...

483
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,061
'cause some old coot
wants to paint your picture.

484
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,427
We're just bringin' you
back to Earth.

485
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,363
Sounds screwy to me.

486
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,368
Can't imagine a real artist wanting
to spend time lookin' at that kisser.

487
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,539
Oh? Yeah?

488
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,474
Well, this kisser wasn't so bad that you
couldn't lay under it a couple of times.

489
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,477
[Man Laughing]

490
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,379
I bet he's just some fruit
pretending to be famous...

491
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,974
so he can get into
the big guy's pants.

492
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,748
- What makes you say that?
- Just thinkin' out loud.

493
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,620
Well, just keep
your dirty thoughts to yourself.

494
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,354
All right, then. He's interested
in you for your conversation.

495
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,192
We all know
what a great talker you are.

496
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,734
Fuck you.

497
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,101
Not anymore, you don't.

498
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,036
We're watching
the damn movie, Harry.

499
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,270
- We're gonna watch the movie.
- Calm down.

500
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,609
We'll watch it.

501
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,413

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,598
James Whale!

503
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,756
Right there. Huh?
Whad I tell ya? Huh?

504
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,068
[Woman]
What should I do then?

505
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,001
No!

506
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,903
This looks corny.

507
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,101
If you don't wanna watch it,
just go wash some glasses.

508
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,175
[Growls]

509
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,342
Good old Una.

510
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,353
- [Screaming, Hooting]
- Gobbling like a turkey hen.

511
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,549
[Laughs,
lmitates Una Screaming]

512
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,821
Oh, that monster.
How could you be working with him?

513
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,159
Don't be daft, Hanna.
He's a very proper actor.

514
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,166
And the dullest fellow
imaginable.

515
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,300
To a new world
of gods and monsters. [Laughs]

516
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,080
- [Laughing]
- [Man On TV] The creation
of life is enthralling.

517
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,114
Simply enthralling,
is it not?

518
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,514
These old movies
were such a hoot.

519
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,019
They thought they were being scary,
but they're just funny.

520
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,021
Maybe is
supposed to be funny.

521
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,648
Scary is scary. Funny is funny.
You don't mix them.

522
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,057
Woman.

523
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,062
Friend.

524
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,956
Wife.

525
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,467
Sick stuff.
Necrophilia.

526
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,631
The monster's lonely. He wants a friend.
A girlfriend, somebody.

527
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,504
Whas so sick
about that?

528
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:24,013
[Man On TV] Do you know who
Henry Frankenstein is, and who you are?

529
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,279
[Monster]
Made me from dead. I love dead.

530
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,255
Hate living.

531
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,257
[Man On TV] You are wise
in your generation.

532
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,926
[Frankenstein]
Is beating perfectly.

533
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,176
[Gasps]
Oh, she's horrible.

534
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,942
The bride of Frankenstein.

535
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,854
She's beautiful.

536
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,350
[Monster]
Friend?

537
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,755
- [Monster Mutters]
- [Screams]

538
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:17,129
- You don't want him.
- [Frankenstein] I can't leave them!

539
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,932
Yes. Go.
You live!

540
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,972
[Growls]

541
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,341
[Sniffs] Ugh.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jimmy.

542
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,553
- Your movie is not my teacup.
- ?? [Finale]

543
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,559
Still, glad it has
a happy ending.

544
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,960
The bad people are dead,
and the good people live.

545
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,437
[Applause]

546
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,675
[Applause Continues]

547
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,684
My God!

548
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,984
Is the audience to presume
that Colin and I have done her hair?

549
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,992
I thought we were
mad scientists, not hairdressers.

550
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,154
Only a mad scientist
coulïve done this to a woman.

551
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:23,995
Oh, no, my dear.
You look absolutely amazing.

552
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,832
There's no way I can compete with you.
The scene is yours.

553
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,838
In the sequel,
James,

554
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,875
two lady scientists
should make a monster,

555
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,877
and our monster
would be Gary Cooper.

556
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,380
I'd have thought Mr. Leslie Howard
would be more your line.

557
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,212
- [Laughs]
- More your line, I think.

558
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,880
My line nowadays
runs to Rin Tin Tin.

559
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,651
- [Giggles]
- Colin! Here! Is time!

560
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,659
- How is he tonight?
- Stiff as a board.

561
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,663
Yes, Colin, come see
what they've done to our Elsa.

562
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:58,326
I'm not quite myself today, Jimmy.
A touch of the flu, you know.

563
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,267
Now, you just relax,
dear boy.

564
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,204
You can do this scene
in your sleep.

565
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,207
Hmm? Yes.

566
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,473
I gather we not only
did her hair,

567
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,013
but dressed her.

568
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,017
What a couple of queens
we are, Colin.

569
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,020
Yes, thas right.
A couple of flaming queens.

570
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,421
Pretorius is a little bit in love
with Dr. Frankenstein.

571
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,425
You know?
Hmm?

572
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,427
Uh-huh?
Yes.

573
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,089
I think we're pretty close.
Mm-hmm.

574
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,100
- Shall we give it a go?
- Why not?

575
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,102
Okay.
Thanks.

576
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,105
- Quiet on the set, please.
- [Bell Rings]

577
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,370
Lights!
Sound!

578
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,172
- [Man] Okay for sound!
- And camera.

579
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,440
Scene 215,
take one.

580
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,753
Action.

581
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,304
The bride
of Frankenstein.

582
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,053
Well, that was
a weird movie.

583
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,061
Les take
a little walk, huh?

584
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,189
What do you say?
A little walk and talk?

585
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,200
I really feel
like talking tonight.

586
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,873
This old guy's exactly the sort
of person I expected to meet
when I moved here.

587
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,411
He's really done things
with his life.

588
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,414
Do you realize you're more interested
in this old goober...

589
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,416
than you ever were
in me?

590
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:58,420
Thas different... he's a man. Besides,
you got no business callin' him a homo.

591
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,854
- It never crossed your mind?
- He's an artist.

592
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,791
But he's too old
to be thinkin' about sex.

593
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,295
All the old men I know
think about nothing but sex.

594
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,663
Hey, hey, hey.
What is eating you tonight?

595
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,169
- You picked up that girl
right in front of me.
- I didn't mean anything by that.

596
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,398
No, I'm actually glad
it happened.

597
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:20,204
It made me wonder what the hell
I was doin' with my life.

598
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,075
I still have time
to get things right, get married again.

599
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,519
Y-You don't mean...

600
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,521
[Giggling]

601
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,063
You're not
marriage material.

602
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,428
You're not even
boyfriend material.

603
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,433
You're a kid.

604
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,699
A big, fun,
irresponsible kid.

605
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,707
- No, I'm not a kid.
- No? What are you, then?

606
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,743
Whall you be ten years from now?
Still cuttin' lawns?

607
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,575
Still bangin' horny divorcees
in your trailer?

608
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,581
Huh?

609
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,948
So I guess this means
you don't want to fuck.

610
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,789
Is that all this conversation
means to you? Whether I put out or not?

611
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,795
Yeah, you're damn straight.
I'm tired of playin' games.

612
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,040
Hey. Hey, Betty.
This is comin' out all wrong.

613
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,075
- Betty!
- Forget it, Boone.

614
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:31,079
From now on, you're just another loser
on the other side of the bar.

615
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,843
Hey. Hey!
Hey, Betty!

616
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,851
Oh...

617
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,309
[Man]
We are friends, you and I.

618
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,173
[Man]
We are friends, you and I.

619
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,107
[Monster]
Hurt my poor friend.

620
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,111
[Woman]
Isn't the monster dead yet?

621
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,613
- [Elsa Laughing]
- [Monster] Alone...

622
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,981
- [Elsa/Shelley] Perfect night
for mystery and horror.
- bad.

623
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,078
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- Friend good. Friend! Friend!

624
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,657
[Elsa/Shelley] The air itself
is filled with monsters.

625
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,043
[Thunder Crashes]

626
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,351
[Electricity Buzzing,
Crackling]

627
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,804
[Snorts, Groans]

628
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,282
- [Water Running]
- [Urinating]

629
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,979
Does the yard man
come today?

630
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,626
Of course.
This afternoon.

631
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,528
Hey!

632
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:07,764
- Can I do something for ya?
- The master wants to know
if you are free for lunch.

633
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,535
I tell him you'll be having
other plans, but he insists I ask.

634
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,578
Well, I do have a lawn this afternoon,
but I'm free until then.

635
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,581
Expect nothing fancy.

636
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,313
- [Door Closes]
- The master is dressing.
I'm to offer you a drink.

637
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,250
There is whiskey.
There is iced tea.

638
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,089
Yeah, tea's fine.

639
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,097
No, no, you're a guest now.
Go sit in the living room.

640
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,759
Um, I'm more comfortable
in here, Hanna.

641
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,768
It is Hanna, isn't it?

642
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,770
[Sighs]

643
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,143
So, uh, Hanna, how long have you
worked here for Mr. Whale?

644
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,076
- Oh, long enough. Fifteen years.
- Yeah?

645
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,514
You have people,
Boone?

646
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,018
Yeah. They're all back
in Joplin, Missouri.

647
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,957
- Oh, your wife?
- Uh, I'm not married.

648
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,152
Why?

649
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,855
I don't know. I guess because, uh,
no girl in her right mind would have me.

650
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,694
A man who is not married
has nothing.

651
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,701
He is a man of trouble.
You need a woman.

652
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,301
Are you proposing what I think
you're proposing?

653
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,800
I'm a little bit young
for you.

654
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,010
Oh, men! Always pulling legs.
Everything is comedy.

655
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,487
Oh, how very amusing.
How marvelously droll.

656
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,760
So, uh,
have you ever been married?

657
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,424
- Of course. I'm married still.
- What does your husband do?

658
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,367
He's dead now.
Twenty years.

659
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,964
- Then you're as single as I am.
- No, I have children,
and grandchildren too.

660
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,042
I visit when I can.

661
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,544
Of course, now Mr. Jimmy cannot
be left alone for long,

662
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,047
so I do not get out much.

663
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,709
[Sighs]
Poor Mr. Jimmy.

664
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,585
There is much good in him,
but he will suffer the fires of hell.

665
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,590
- Is very sad.
- You sure of that?

666
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,990
Thas what the priests
tell me.

667
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,995
His sins of the flesh
will keep him from heaven.

668
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,531
- Hell, everybody's got those.
- No.

669
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,533
His is the worst.

670
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,997
The unspeakable.

671
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:32,274
The deed no man can name
without shame.

672
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,475
What is
the good English?

673
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,645
All I know is "bugger." He's a bugger.
Men who bugger each other.

674
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,221
A homo.

675
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,291
[Chuckling]
Yes! You know.

676
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,292
That is why
he must go to hell.

677
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,797
I do not think is fair,
but Goïs laws is not for us to judge.

678
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,800
So, what you're telling me is,
Mr. Whale is a homo.

679
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,427
You did not know?

680
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,634
Uh... Ye... l...
N-No. I wasn't very sure.

681
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,333
You and he are not...

682
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,310
Oh, no, no, no. Hanna.

[Gasps]
Thas what I hope.

684
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,777
I did not think
you were a bugger too.

685
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,615
[Whale]
Hanna?

686
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,621
Oh.
You must go in quickly.

687
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,124
[Whispering] He would not like
to think I've had you in the kitchen.

688

- [Clears Throat]
- Oh. How are you, Mr. Boone?

689
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:32,105
- I'm all right, I guess.
- I'm so glad you could come for lunch.

690
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,210

in the motion picture industry."

692

at the home of Mr. George Cukor."

693
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,387

694

[Sighs] Horning in on
the Queen's little sister,

695
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,860
and then offering to share her
with the whole damn Raj?

696
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,295
This is a world
I finished with long ago.

697
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:59,028
I've paid them no mind, and I
expect them to return the compliment.

698
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,306
Cheers.

699
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:17,047
I, uh, I watched your movie
the other night with some friends.

700
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,384
- Did you, now?
- Yeah.

701
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,286
Did anyone laugh?

702
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,859
- No.
- Pity.

703
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,055
People are so earnest
these days.

704
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,894
- Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
- Yes, of course.

705
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,458
A picture about death, I had to
make it interesting for myself, you see.

706
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,470
So, a comedy about death...

707
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,607
The trick is not to spoil it for anyone
who's not in on the joke.

708
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,780
But the monster never
receives any of my jibes.

709
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:49,181
He's noble.
Noble and misunderstood.

710
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,225
In Korea, Mr. Boone,

711
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,761
did you kill anyone?

712
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,399
I don't like
to talk about that.

713
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,401
Is nothing
to be ashamed of.

714
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:10,064
In the service of one's country,
something to be proud of.

715
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,607
Any jerk with a gun
can kill someone.

716
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,007
Well, thas true,
yes.

717
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,637
Hand-to-hand combat
is the true test.

718
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,007
- Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
- No.

719
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,951
But I could have, though.

720
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,684
Yes,
I believe you could.

721
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,655
How free is your schedule
this afternoon?

722
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:40,703
Well, I gotta trim the hedges, and then
I got another lawn out on La Cienega.

723
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,204
Suppose we say "phooey"
to the hedges.

724
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,935
Can you spare an hour
after lunch to sit for me?

725
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,508
Um,

726
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,241
I can't.

727
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:58,722
I'll pay you our going rate,
plus whatever you would have
got for the hedges.

728
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,657
I-I just don't feel like
sittin' still today.

729
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,988
All righty.

730
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,229
I understand.

731
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,214
You ever been married,
Mr. Whale?

732
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,256
No.

733
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,257
Well,
not in the legal sense.

734
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,418
What other sense is there?

735
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:42,089
Well, one can live as husband and wife
without getting the law involved.

736
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,225
So then you did have
a wife?

737
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,600
Or a husband,
depending on which of us you asked.

738
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:52,106
My friend David
lived here for many years.

739
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,677
Oh.

740
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,474
Does that surprise you?

741
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,444
No, um...

742
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,576
You're a homosexual.

743
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,312
Mmm!

744
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,652
If one must use
the clinical name.

745
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,157
I'm not, you know.

746
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,160
I never thought you were.

747
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,131
You don't think of me
that way, do you?

748
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,328
And what way would that be?

749
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,634
Well, the way
that I look at women.

750
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,141
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

751
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,144
I know
a real man like you...

752
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,680
would break my neck if I so much as
laid a finger on you.

753
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,552
Besides,
you're not my type.

754
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,463
So we understand
each other.

755
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,193
Hey.
Live and let live.

756
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:58,740
I hope this has got nothing to do
with your refusing to sit for me today.

757
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,673
Oh, no. No, no.

758
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,302
What are you afraid of,
Mr. Boone?

759
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,347
Surely not
a frail old man like me.

760
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,558
Tell me more about yourself,
Mr. Boone.

761
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,685
Have you
a steady companion?

762
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,524
- Not at the moment.
- Oh? Why not?

763
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,228
Well, 'cause I guess you gotta kiss ass
just to get a piece of it.

Mmm.

Thoreau...
with a lawn mower.

768
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,413
I like it.
Yes.

769
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,749
But do be careful,
Mr. Boone.

770
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,085
Freedom is a drug, you know,
much like any other.

771
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,682
Too much
can be a very bad thing.

772
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,696
Is that why you and, uh,
your friend split up?

773
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,266
- 'Cause he wanted to be free?
- Yes, I suppose.

774
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,961
I know is why
I stopped making pictures.

775
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,538
You might not think it
to look at me now,

776
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,540
but there was a time when I was
at the very pinnacle of my profession.

777
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,542
The horror movies
were behind me.

778
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,875
I'd made Showboat.
Major success. Big box office.

779
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,915
So now I was to do
something important.

780
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,417
The picture was called
The Road Back.

781
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,454
It was an indictment of the Great War
and what it did to Germany.

782
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,456
It was going to be
my masterpiece.

783
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,584
- What happened?
- The fucking studio butchered it.

784
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,594
They took the guts
out of my picture.

785
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,358
They brought in another director
to add some slapstick...

786
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,331
and the movie laid an egg.

787
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,335
A great, expensive bomb
for which I was blamed.

788
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,202
And after that
I was out of fashion.

789
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:42,244
I could no longer command
the best projects, so I walked away.

790
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:47,180
Why should I spend my time working
in this dreadful business?

791
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,878
- Do you miss it?
- Mmm.

792
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,079
Oh, it was
all so long ago.

793
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,088
Fifteen years.

794
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,827
Making movies is
the most wonderful thing in the world.

795
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,061
Working with friends,
entertaining people.

796
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,070
Yes,
I suppose I miss it.

797
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,100
But I chose freedom.

798
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:18,044
David, of course,
was still in the thick of it,

799
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,082
a life chockablock with anxiety
and studio intrigue.

800
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:25,518
I didn't fancy spending my golden years
as "the friend,"

801
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:30,218
so I finally drew down the curtain
and closed the show.

802
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,663
And, um,

803
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,165

are loosened,

don't you think?

805
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,567
Oh, there was a time when this house
was full of young men.

806
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,544
Some of them even posed for me,
right where you're sitting now.

807
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,342
Of course, they weren't
nearly so bashful.

Oh, no, this studio

Mmm.
Hard, arrogant pricks.

Okay, just cut it out.
Okay?

you're a fuckin' fairy?

843
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,687
Thank you, Hanna.

844
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,522
I wanna sit for you
again.

845
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:33,329
Only if you promise to ease up
on the locker room talk, okay?

846
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,707
Scous honor.

847
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,470
- [Chuckles]
- I'm curious, Mr. Boone.

848
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,969
What convinced you
to come back?

849
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,571
I don't know.
I like your stories, I guess.

850
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,174
Oh, everyone's
got stories to tell.

851
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,980
Not me.

852
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,987
Hmm.

853
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,650
And the fear that you displayed
at our last session...
how did you overcome that?

854
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,250
More like disgust.

855
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,262
Oh, same difference,
Mr. Boone.

856
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:05,198
Disgust, fear of the unknown...
all part of the great gulf
that stands between us two.

857
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:09,499
Am I right in assuming
that you have little experience
with men of my persuasion?

858
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,567
- No teammates in football?
- No.

859
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,372
No comrades in Korea?

860
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,880
You must think that
the whole world is queer.

861
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,883
Well, you know what?
Is not.

862
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,885
And war certainly isn't.

863
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,081
Oh, there may be
no atheists in the foxholes,

864
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,988
but there are,
occasionally, lovers.

865
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,584
You're talkin'
through your hat now.

866
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:36,062
- No, I'm not.
I was in the foxholes myself.
- You were a soldier?

867
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,565
I was an officer
in the trenches.

868
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:42,501
- Was this World War I?
- No, my dear, the Crimean War.
Well, what do you think?

869
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,505
The Great War.

870
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:48,134
There were trenches when I arrived and
trenches when I left two years later.

871
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:51,145
Just like in the movies,
only the movies, ahh...

872
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,842
They never get
the stench of it all.

873
01:00:54,951 --> 01:01:00,287
The world reduced to mud and sandbags
and a narrow strip of rainy sky.

874
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,658
What were we talking about?

875
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,695
Oh.

876
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,029
Love.
Love in the trenches.

877
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,193
Barnett.

878
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,136
Was that his name?

879
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,141
Leonard Barnett.

880
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,746
He'd come straight to the front
from school.

881
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,183
From Harrow.

882
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,455
And he looked up to me.

883
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,518
Wasn't like the others.

884
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,530
He didn't care that I was
a working-class man
impersonating my betters.

885
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:48,363
How strange to be admired
so blindly.

886
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,734
I suppose he loved me.

887
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,272
[Whale]
I remember one morning in particular,

888
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,474
a morning
when the sun came out.

889
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:05,680
Is odd how, even there,
there were days when the weather
was enough to make one happy.

890
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,188
He and I stood
on the fire step.

891
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:12,853
I was showing him the sights
of no-man's-land. It was beautiful.

892
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,362
Beautiful.

893
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:21,199
And I was shoulder-to-shoulder
with a tall, apple-cheeked
schoolboy who loved me...

894
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,701
and trusted me.

895
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:43,187
You will not do this to me again,
Mr... [Gasps] Mr. Boone.

896
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,989
- You will not set me on
another walk down memory lane.
- l...

897
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,462
I won't.

898
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,328
I absolutely refuse.

899
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,870
[Sniffles] Why do I tell you all this?
I never told David.

900
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,372
- I never even remembered it
till you got me going.
- You started in on this...

901
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:02,308
You can't understand.
You just sit there. You let me talk.

902
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:06,313
"Yes, the poor old man," you're thinking
to yourself. "The crazy old poof."

903
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:10,681
Why are you here? Les get
this straight. What do you want from me?

904
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,846
You wanted me to model.
Remember?

905
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,187
Well, of course I remember. What do
you think I am, so fucking senile?

906
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,331
Uh, uh, Mr. Whale?

907
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,908
[Murmuring Quietly]
Oh, I'm so stupid.

908
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,943
Stupid, stupid.

909
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,240
Mr. Whale,
you all right?

910
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,517
What was I thinking about?

911
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,014
Oh, would you go?

912
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,684
I'm sorry. Please.

913
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,693
Why don't you just go?

914
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,863
I just don't get it.

915
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,866
First you creep me out
with this homo shit.

916
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,333
Then you hit me
with war stories.

917
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,736
And now you're upset with me because
I listened to you? What do you want?

918
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,036
I want...

919
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,046
More than anything else,
I want a glass of water.

920
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,945
Sick.

921
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,457
Thank you.

922
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,789
I do apologize.
I'm...

923
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,795
No harm done.

924
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:31,856
I have no business
snapping at you.

925
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,103
It was foolishness
to start this portrait, you know.

926
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,746
You don't want me
to sit for you anymore?

927
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,812
No.

928
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,299
Would you like to come
to a party with me?

929
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,596
A reception
for Princess Margaret.

930
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,268
I thought you said
you weren't gonna go.

931
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:16,402
l-lf you don't mind driving,
I'd like to take you as my guest.

932
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,174
Yeah, sure, I'm game.
Why not?

933
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,581
Very good, Clayton.
May I call you Clayton?

934
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,585
Clayton?

935
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,950
Yeah, sure.
Clayton's fine.

936
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:36,431
Mr. Boone,
he's an interesting friend.

937
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,932
I'd hardly call our yardman
a friend.

938
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:42,128
Oh, no, but someone
you can talk to.

939
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,671
That needs pressing,
hmm?

940
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,675
Do you miss having someone
to talk to, Hanna?

941
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,235
I have my family.
Also our Lord, Jesus Christ.

942
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:55,044
Ah. Tell me, how is
the old boy these days?

943
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,753
We need a hat with that.
There's a panama.

944
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,186
- Maybe in your old room.
- [Telephone Rings]

945
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,690
No, no,
in the storage closet.

946
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,193
- [Sighs]
- [Ringing Continues]

947
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,293
Hello.
Oh, Eva. Mmm.

948
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,836
[Speaking
Scandinavian Language]

949
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,356
Hmm.

950
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,420
- [Soldiers Shouting]
- [Gunfire, Explosions]

951
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,967
[Whale]
Gas masks on!

952
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,970
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Gunfire, Explosions Continue]

953
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,779
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
That is my daughter.

954
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:07,788
She and her husband
are coming to town this afternoon.

955
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,790
Here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jimmy.

956
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,792
I will
make it short.

957
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,853
I will be out myself
this afternoon. Remember?

958
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,771
I suppose
you'd like the top down.

959
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,773
If thas all right
with you.

960
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,775
Nothing
would please me more.

961
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,780
[Engine Starts]

962
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,748
[Speaks

963
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,495
[Whale]
Oh, good old George.

964
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,191
He loves to put on the dog.

965
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,234
Slim pickings.

966
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,236
Mind you,
is early yet.

967
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:00,604
Perhaps this is a good time
for us to go and pay our respects, hmm?

968
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,802
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

969
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:05,505
Charming.
[Gasps]

970
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,082
I had no idea
you'd be here.

971
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,084
- How are you?
- Fine.

972
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,381
I'm just fine.
And Your Royal Highness?

973
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,389
Splendid, now that I know
that you're around.

974
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,755
Can we get together
while I'm in town?

975
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,523
- I so badly want to sit for you again.
- Sit?

976
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,122
I've changed my hair, you see,
since our last session.

977
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,328
Those old snaps
look rather dowdy now.

978
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,600
Oh, dear.
Have I made a blunder?

979
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:39,737
The pleasure is mine.
James Whale.

980
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:43,841
I am such a goose.
I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.

981
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,886
Is the hat.

982
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,548
You're wearing
one of Cecil's hats, you know.

983
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,888
George, James Whale.
David Lewis's friend.

984
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,928
Oh.

985
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,055
- I used to make pictures myself, ma'am.
- [Cukor] Yes, of course.

986
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,566
One can't throw a rock
in this town...

987
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,501
without hitting one of us
old movie directors.

988
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,835
[Both Chuckling]

989
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:10,143
Ma'am, may I introduce
Mr. Clayton Boone.

990
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,771
My gardener.

991
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,941
- How do you do? Clay... Clay Boone.
- Quite.

992
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:19,714
- I adore gardens.
- [All Chuckling]

993
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,620
He's never met
a princess.

994
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,625
Only queens.

995
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,732
Well, George, ma'am,
this has been an honor,

996
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,463
and one that I shall remember
for the rest of my life.

997
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,781
Great place.

998
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,350
Mmm.
[Chuckles]

999
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,351
Hello.

1000
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:58,858
- What was that all about?
- Oh, don't worry.
Nothing of any importance.

1001
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:02,362
Just two old men
slapping each other with lilies.

1002
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,695
- I'm sorry.
- [Woman Laughs]

1003
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,395
- Who's that?
- David.

1004
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:12,201
- The friend I thought was in New York.
- No, l-l... The girl.

1005
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,141
- Oh, is Elizabeth Taylor.
- Oh, thank you.

1006
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,348
Yes, David produced
her last picture.

1007
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,851
- What are you doing here?
- I was just going to ask you
the same thing.

1008
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,354
Thought you were
still in New York.

1009
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:29,947
I was,
until last night.

1010
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,959
I was going to call.

1011
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,961
- David Lewis.
- Hey. Clay Boone.

1012
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,466
Our yardman, who's been kind enough
to serve as my escort...

1013
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,467
to George's little do.

1014
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,971
Should you be drinking
in your condition?

1015
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,475
Oh, David, will you
stop being a nanny.

1016
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,512
I think I'm gonna
go and get another beer.

1017
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,816
[Giggles]

1018
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:59,149
You shoulïve seen George's face
when he saw Clayton.

1019
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,086
Oh!
[Giggles]

1020
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,091
- You didn't, Jimmy.
- I did.

1021
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:08,220
Mind you, Princess Margares
an absolute doll.

1022
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,892
Well, we're all equals in her eyes,
as commoners, I presume.

1023
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,902
You only
embarrass yourself.

1024
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:18,906
- Oh, dear. I'll never
work in this town again.
- You know what I mean.

1025
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:22,910
- Your reputation.
- I have no reputation.

1026
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,946
I'm as free as the air.

1027
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,573
But the rest of us
aren't.

1028
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,685
- Can't you remember that?
- No.

1029
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,379
I never could.

1030
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,890
I suppose you regret
having got me invited here.

1031
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,818
I didn't ask George
to invite you.

1032
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,329
Oh.
Well, then, who did?

1033
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:46,333
I have people here
I need to speak to.

1034
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:50,337
- You'll be all right on your own?
- Yes, yes, perfectly.

1035
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,340
I'll drop by tomorrow
for breakfast.

1036
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,342
Oh, yes.

1037
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,679
Oh.

1038
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,683
Oh, I say.

1039
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,685
Thank you very much.

1040
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,687
Just the one.

1041
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,342
[Sighs]

1042
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,288
Mr. Whale!
Mr. Whale!

1043
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,922
[High-Pitched Giggle]

1044
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,398
- Mr. Whale.
- Mr. Kay.

1045
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,902
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again. [Laughs]

1046
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,405
- I didn't know if you'd be well
enough to come to this party.
- You didn't?

1047
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:03,638
I'm the one who got you
on Mr. Cukor's guest list.

1048
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,680
You, Mr. Kay?

1049
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,376
But how do you know
George Cukor?

1050
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,817
I interviewed him
after I met you.

1051
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,820
I'm his
social secretary now.

1052
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:17,221
Well, assistant
to his secretary.

1053
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,987
Yes, I commend you.

1054
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,028
If you're going to
pursue poofs,

1055
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,997
go after those
who can do favors for you.

1056
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:28,661
You just waste everyone's time
when you court dinosaurs.

1057
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,171
Don't think like that,
Mr. Whale.

1058
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,173
I love your movies.

1059
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,904
Thas why I wanted you to come...
so I could see you with your monsters.

1060
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,740
My monsters?

1061
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,315
Don't go away.
[Giggles]

1062
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,618
- Uh, excuse me. Miss Lanchester, l...
- Yes?

1066
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,633
- How are you?
- Mmm.

1067
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,447
[Giggles]

1068
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,450
I saw Una O'Connor
a few weeks ago.

1069
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,385
She said you'd been
under the weather.

1070
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:22,480
Oh, well, nothing
out of the ordinary. Getting old.

1071
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,992
Nonsense! Ah,
whas our pesky friend up to now?

1072
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,994
Mmm?

1073
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:31,088
- [Elsa] Is that Boris?
- [Whale Sighs]

1074
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,227
- Our little chum appears
to be arranging a reunion.
- Oh, dear.

1075
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:38,431
- Boris, darling.
- Elsa. Elsa!

1076
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,203
And James.
James.

1077
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,336
- How good to see you.
- I didn't know you were here.

1078
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,382
These public revels
are hardly up your alley.

1079
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,648
Actually, I'm here
for the sake of Miranda,

1080
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:55,018
my great-grandniece.

1081
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,954
- Koochie-koo. [Chuckles]
- [Baby Coos]

1082
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:59,857
And what do you make
of our royal visitant?

1083
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,931
Perfectly charming.
A real lady.

1084
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,660
- What did you expect,
a hussy in tennis shoes?
- [Laughs]

1085
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,931
Hey, you, with the camera.
We got a historical moment here.

1086
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:11,938
Come,
get a picture of it.

1087
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,477
This is Mr. James Whale, who made
Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein,

1088
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:20,912
and this... forget the baby a second...
is the Monster...

1089
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,143
and his bride.

1090
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,050
Oh, Karloff.
Right.

1091
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,759
Don't you just love
being famous?

1092

of gods and monsters.

01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,810
- Are you all right, Jimmy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1095
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,517
Got it.

[Clay]
Mr. Whale.

1097
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,399
- Are you okay?
- I'm tired. I'm a bit tired.

1098
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,932
Are you
enjoying yourself?

1099
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,872
No. Actually, l... I feel
a little out of place here.

1100
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,433
Well, neither of us
really fits in here.

1101
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,006
That musve been funny for you,
seeing your monsters again.

1102
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,176

The only monsters are here.

Oh, fuck.
We left the top down.

1106
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,990
- You wanna run for it?
- [Whale] "Run for it"?

1107
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,996
Is raining.

1108
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,192
- [Woman] Hurry! Hurry!
- Whoo!

Mr. Whale.

Les get out
of this fuckhole.

1113
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,301
You sure you don't
want to wait it out?

1114

We aren't made of sugar.
We won't melt.

"Oh, that this too,
too solid flesh would melt."

I'm getting you home before you
catch your death of pneumonia.

1118

Well, if we soil your floors,
is your own bloody fault!

01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,050
Oh, I don't believe it.

1127
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,713
Don't worry, she'll be back.
She just can't say "no" to her daughter.

1128
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:17,121
Well, you certainly have better things
to do than to baby-sit an old man.

1129
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:20,160
I didn't have anything
planned.

1130

and I'll get you something dry to wear.

Oh, yes.

- Mr. Whale?
- Huh?

1141
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,478
Yes, of course,
uh, Clayton.

1142
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,917
Do come in. Now, I promised to
get you some dry clothes.

1143
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,649
The trouble is, you're so large.
You wouldn't want to attempt
to get into my pants.

1144
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,056
- Uh, n-no. Definitely not.
- Very good, Clayton.

1145
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,424
Now...
Oh, I know!

1146
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:31,328
This... This absolutely
swims on me,

1147
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:35,267
so that should deal
with your upper half.

1148
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,828
And now we just need to deal
with the rest, don't we?

1149
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,841
- Do you have any baggy shorts
or pajama bottoms?
- Uh, no.

1150
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,844
I'm sorry. Uh, my pajamas
are all tailored.

1151
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,847
Would it be too distressing
for you to continue with that towel?

1152
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,850
Is hardly more immodest
than a kilt, you know.

1153
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,079
Yes?
How very sporting of you, Clayton.

1154
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,588
Say, is this, um, the...

1155
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,592
Yes, is the only memento
I ever kept.

1156
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,162
My original sketch
for the Monster.

1157
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,731
- Uh, shall we?
- Yeah.

1158
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:17,109
[Thunder Continues]

1159
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,875
When we've finished eating,
if Hanna's not back, shall we
try a few more sketches?

1160
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,883
I thought you'd given up
on my drawing.

1161
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,885
Yeah, but I'd like
to try again.

1162
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,286
Ill give us something to do
while we wait.

1163
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,754
Tell me something,
Clayton.

1164
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,461
Do you believe
in mercy killing?

1165
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,228
I never really gave it
much thought.

1166
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,465
You musve come across
such situations in Korea.

1167
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,975
A wounded comrade,
or perhaps even an enemy.

1168
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,808
You know, someone for whom death
would be a blessing.

1169
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,516
I never went to Korea.

1170
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,519
I never even made it
through boot camp.

1171
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:03,682
- But you said...
- That I was a marine, which is true.

1172
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,725
You filled in the rest.

1173
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,296
Oh, I see.

1174
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,294
My old man was a marine.

and he enlisted.

1176
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,306
- Is this the Great War?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1177
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:23,809
By the time he was ready to ship out,
all the fighting was over,

1178
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,813
so he felt like
he'd missed out.

1179
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:30,510
- Well, it was
a very lucky thing he did.
- Thas not the way he saw it.

1180
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:34,248
To him it was like his life
never really got started.

1181
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:37,416
Nothing else
seemed to matter.

1182
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,493
Certainly not his family.

1183
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:43,189
Is that why you became a marine,
for your father's sake?

1184
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:46,232
I figured id be
the next best thing.

1185
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,235
I mean, but I loved it too.
I really... I did.

1186
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,738
It was a chance to be
a part of something important,

1187
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,741
something thas bigger
than yourself.

1188
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,868
So, what happened?

1189
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:59,708
Didn't have the guts for it.

1190
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,907
- Hmm?
- Literally.

1191
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,577
My appendix burst.

1192
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,119
They gave me
a medical discharge.

1193
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,488
The only thing I can think is,
how the hell am I gonna tell my father?

1194
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,328
And you know what happened
when I finally did tell him?

1195
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,633
He laughed at me.

1196
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,407
Well, them's the breaks,
huh? So...

1197
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:36,416
No war stories for this pup.

1198
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:43,289
Thas where you're wrong,
Clayton.

1199
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:47,986
You just told me one.

1200
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,529
A very good story indeed.

1201
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,033
- [Thunder Continues]
- Whew.

1202
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,103
This storm
is getting worse.

1203
01:22:56,204 --> 01:23:00,140
"A perfect night
for mystery and horror.

1204
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,810
The air itself
is filled with monsters."

1205
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:08,508
- Thas from one of your movies, right?
- Very good.

1206
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,720
"The only monsters
are here."

1207
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,654
Don't remember that one.

1208
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,655
James Whale.

1209
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:19,090
This afternoon at the party when
you said, "The only monsters are here,"

1210
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,754
I was wondering
which "here" that was.

1211
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,763
No, I d... I don't recall.

1212
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:29,064
Memories of the war,
perhaps.

1213
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,075
Barnett.

1214
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,272
Barnett on the wire.

1215
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,316
Your friend.

1216
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,317
Yes.

1217
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:48,354
He caught his one night
coming back from reconnaissance.

1218
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,357
I wouldn't take him,
but McGill did,

1219
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:55,020
"just to give the laddie
a taste."

1220
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,032
They were nearly home
when a Maxim gun opened fire.

1221
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:07,373
Barnes body landed on this wire
that was as thick as briers.

1222
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,875
It was hanging there
the next morning.

1223
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,879
It was only a hundred yards
from the line,

1224
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:16,883
but too far...
for anyone to fetch it.

1225
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,685
So we saw him every morning stand-to
and every evening stand-to.

1226
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:28,024
"Good morning, Barnett,"
we used to say to him.

1227
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:33,726
"How's Barnett looking today?"
"He seemed a little peaked.
Looks a little plumper."

1228
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:38,135
And he hung there...
[Exhales]

1229
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,140
well, at least
until we were relieved.

1230
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,336
We introduced him to the new unit
before marching out,

1231
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,347
speaking highly
of his companionship.

1232
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:53,712
God, we were a witty lot.

1233
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,050
Laughing at our dead,

1234
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,557
feeling that
it was our death too.

1235
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,323
But I tell you,
for each man who died I thought,

1236
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,331
"Better you than me,
poor sod."

1237
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:12,037
You know, a whole generation
was wiped out by that war.

1238
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,540
- [Thunder Continues]
- You survived it.

1239
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,803
Can't hurt you now.

1240
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,742
No good to dig it up.

1241
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,247
Oh.

1242
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,408
Friend,
is digging itself up.

1243
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:27,453
There is nothing in the here and now
to take my mind off it.

1244
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,854
The parties...
Well, you were there.

1245
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:37,521
Reading... I can't...
I-I can't concentrate.

1246
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,532
There's no work, of course,

1247
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:43,536
and, uh, love
and, uh, painting and, uh...

1248
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,368
Drawing, I mean.

1249
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,715
Look.

1250
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,252
Your portrait, Clayton.

1251
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,794
Is all gone for me now.
All gone.

1252
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,699
They're nothing but
the scribblings of an infant.

1253
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,869
There's nothing.

1254
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:18,700
Nothing.

1255
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:49,702
You said you wanted
to draw me like a statue.

1256
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,874
Okay.

1257
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,868
Is going to happen
after all.

1258
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,961
What did you say?

1259
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,768
No, it won't do.

1260
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,675
- What won't do?
- You're much too human.

1261
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:34,304
Well, what do you expect,
bronze?

1262
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,044
Don't move.

1263
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,492
[Grunting Noise]

1264
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:56,166
- I want you to wear this.
- Why?

1265
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,171
So I can see
the artistic effect.

1266
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,265
Your very human body
against the inhuman mask.

1267
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,867
- Oh! Very striking. Mmm.
- I don't know.

1268
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:07,072
Oh, come on, Clayton. Just for a minute,
so I can see the effects.

1269
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:10,116
- From the first World War, isn't it?
- Mmm, yes.

1270
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,619
Fasten this around the back.
Let me help you.

1271
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,552
There.

1272
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,488
Hmm?

1273
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,061
[Sniffing, Gasping]

1274
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,925
Uh...

1275
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,522
now what?

1276
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,760
All right,
les take it off.

1277
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,030
Uh, is too tight.
I can't breathe.

1278
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,198
Oh, no, l-l-leave it.
I'll help.

1279
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,208
Leave it to me.

1280
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:41,806
Wha... Can you...

1281
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,816
I'm still here.

1282
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,852
All right.

1283
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,222
Mr. Whale.

- [Panicked Breathing]
- Oh, what steely muscles
you've got there.

1285
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,895
Just take the fuckin' mask
off me now, okay?

1286
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,932
- What a solid brute you are.
- Hey... Oh...

1287

Hey... Hey, just get
your fuckin' hands off me!

1288
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:06,072
Is no use, Clayton.
I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.

1289
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,836
Oh, well, then,
maybe this.

- Ohh!
- Yes!

- Now I've got you! How will
you ever get yourself back?
- Get off me!

I told you, I'm not that way! Get it
through your fuckin' head, all right?

with you... [Gasps]

kissing you. I even touched your prick!

to live with yourself?
- What do you want from me?

1304

to choke the life out of me.

Oh, God.

Every day a new piece of it goes,
and soon there'll be none of it left.

But if you kill me,

death will be bearable.

Please, do it now.

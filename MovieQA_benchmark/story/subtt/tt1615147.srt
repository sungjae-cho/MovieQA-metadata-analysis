1
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,021
Is that them?

2
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:39,461
Jesus Christ.
Are they gonna do it right here?

3
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,761
Have you guys
ever been through this before?

4
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,642
No.

5
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:53,140
It's best to ignore it.
Keep your head down, go back to work.

6
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:55,402
Go on.

7
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,482
Don't watch!

8
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,775
Timothy Singh?

9
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:24,206
Yes.

10
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:27,762
I'm afraid we have to
speak with you. Come on.

11
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,021
Eric Dale?

12
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,422
- Excuse me?
- Eric Dale?

13
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:48,723
- Um... no.
- Sorry?

14
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,502
I'm not Eric Dale.

15
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,140
Oh. I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:55,707
He's my boss, he's down the hall.

17
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,021
Thanks.

18
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,982
Excuse me?
Mr. Dale?

19
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,803
This way.

20
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:25,642
Okay.

21
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,402
I am obviously sorry...

22
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,822
that we are here today,

23
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:11,381
but these are extra ordinary times
as you very well must know.

24
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,602
Look, I run risk management...

25
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,523
I don't really see,
how that's a natural place to start..

26
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,184
- cutting jobs.
- We hope you understand...

27
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,485
that this is in no way personal.

28
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,743
The majority of this floor
is being let go today.

29
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:27,322
Ms. Bratberg is now going
to run through the details,

30
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:28,723
of what the firm is offering.

31
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,427
Okay.

32
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:36,367
Mr. Dale the firm is offering you
6 months severance, at half your salary.

33
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:39,641
You will keep all unvested options
that you currently hold.

34
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,707
Health will be extended
through that period.

35
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,886
You have till tomorrow at...
4:47...

36
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,383
to either take the offer
or it will be revoked.

37
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,962
Do you understand?

38
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:51,848
Yes.

39
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,342
Unfortunately Mr. Dale, due to the highly
sensitive nature of your work here,

40
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:58,543
the firm has to take
certain precautions...

41
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:03,444
for security purposes
that may seem punitive in nature.

42
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:09,587
I hope considering your...
over 19 years of service to the firm,

43
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,167
you will understand that these measures
are in no way...

44
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:15,042
a reflection of the firm's feelings
towards your performance...

45
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,824
or your character.

46
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,787
- I don't understand.
- She's apologizing...

47
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,268
for what's about to happen.

48
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,188
Your company email,
access to the server,

49
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,168
access to the building,
and your mobil data and phone service...

50
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,302
will all be severed as of this meeting.

51
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,743
And, this gentleman,
will take you to your office.

52
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:39,444
So, you can clear out
your personal belongings.

53
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,464
What about the, um...
what I'm currently working on?

54
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,903
I'm in the middle of something...

55
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,304
The firm has worked out
its transition plan.

56
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,005
And is prepared to move forward.

57
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:53,423
But, we do we appreciate your concern.

58
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,342
We understand
that this is very difficult,

59
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,543
and here is my card.

60
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,243
Please contact me over the next
few weeks, if you need any assistance...

61
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:03,044
with this transition in your life.

62
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:09,645
Sir.

63
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:17,646
Well...

64
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,147
Okay.

65
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:49,748
Hey...

66
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,263
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,767
- You still alive?
- Uh-huh... for now.

68
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,363
Congratulations.

69
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,723
- It's a bloodbath.
- I heard.

70
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:10,448
Listen Eric?

71
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,644
If there was something I could've done,
I would've done it.

72
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,945
- I know.
- Alright?

73
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:15,946
Yeah.

74
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,447
I know.

75
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:18,948
Okay.

76
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,724
Just tell me...

77
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,444
who was it?

78
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,370
Come on, Bill.

79
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,009
- Rogers?
- I'm not gonna side, you know me.

80
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,904
Robertson?

81
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,584
That cunt. I knew it. I knew
I shouldn't have fucking...

82
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,869
- gone to her last year.
- It wasn't anyone.

83
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,324
Eric, you know what it was?
It was bad luck. And that's all it was.

84
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,025
Yeah...
Yup.

85
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,183
Alright, well, good luck.

86
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:48,084
Bill...
come here.

87
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,029
I was just in the middle
of a lot of shit here...

88
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,830
that I think
somebody needs to take a look at it.

89
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,565
Eric, listen...

90
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,985
They're telling us that everybody
needs to get outta here...

91
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,486
and just leave their stuff.

92
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:04,205
And while we appreciate your concern,

93
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,206
this is not your problem anymore.

94
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,964
Good luck.

95
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,906
- Eric, I'm very sorry.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,505
Did they say
what's gonna happen with us?

97
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,584
- Jesus Seth.
- What?

98
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,028
It's gonna get pretty ugly
around here for a while...

99
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,384
but, you know?
You guys will be alright.

100
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,785
- I'm gonna go.
- Alright.

101
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,045
- I'll see you around, okay?
- Alright.

102
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,825
Thank you.

103
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,249
Hey...

104
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,325
I just...
wanted to say thanks.

105
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,127
- It's not necessary.
- Well, it is.

106
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,345
You were the person around here,
that I...

107
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:43,346
I know.

108
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,890
Hang on...

109
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,965
I was working on something,
but they wouldn't let me finish it.

110
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:51,966
So...

111
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:53,785
take a look at it.

112
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,705
Be careful.

113
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:29,710
Robertson?

114
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,306
Sarah Robertson?

115
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:32,507
Sarah!

116
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,566
You shut off my phone?

117
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,866
Eric, I didn't do anything.

118
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,265
Fuck you!

119
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:05,406
Well, that was fucking hideous.

120
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,526
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

121
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,327
You think?

122
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,210
Much.

123
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:16,285
You got any Nicorettes?

124
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,225
I'm outta Nicorettes.

125
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,925
Which means, in about...

126
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,966
ten minutes.
I'm gonna kill someone.

127
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,565
You alright Sam?

128
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,746
My dog is dying.

129
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:38,467
I'm sorry?

130
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,505
Just got off the phone to the vet,

131
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,705
it's some fucking tumor on the liver.

132
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,965
I must've paid almost a 1000 bucks
a day already, just to keep her alive.

133
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,765
I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

134
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:57,865
Well they're all...
they're all gone.

135
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,707
So?

136
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:05,707
How many do we have left?

137
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,270
About, thirty-three.

138
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,807
Well, make sure they're all out there,
I gotta say something.

139
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:12,607
Yeah, I know.
They're ready.

140
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,008
They're ready for you.

141
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,607
Alright, Let's hear it!

142
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,527
You're all still here for a reason...

143
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:41,466
eighty percent of this floor
was just sent home... forever.

144
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:44,267
We spent the last hour
saying our good-byes...

145
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,927
they were good people
and they were good at their jobs...

146
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:48,926
but you were better.

147
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:52,187
Now they're gone.
They're not to be thought of again.

148
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:55,807
This is your opportunity.

149
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:00,086
On every floor of this building and in
every office from Hong Kong to London

150
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,287
the same thing's happening.

151
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:02,827
By the time we're done...

152
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,332
three of every seven guys,

153
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:09,426
who were standing between you
and your boss's job... are gone.

154
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,566
That is your opportunity.

155
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:19,248
I've been at this place for
thirty-four years.

156
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,286
And I can tell you,
this is not the last time...

157
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,387
you're gonna go through this.

158
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,587
But you are all survivors.

159
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:28,488
And that is how this firm
over 107 years,

160
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,427
has continued to grow stronger.

161
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,306
So, keep your heads high.
Get back to work. Let's hear it.

162
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,532
Everyone's going out, man.
You should... come on.

163
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,128
Oh, I'm cool. Thanks.

164
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,508
Okay. Well, uh, if you change your mind,
just give me a call.

165
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,308
I will.

166
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:35,847
Come!

167
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,088
- Where you guys going?
- The Grand.

168
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,066
I will call you when I am done.

169
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,167
Alright.

170
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,807
Hey!
Be glad, you're still alive.

171
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:50,988
I am.

172
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,089
- Will you connect me?
- I did.

173
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:04,455
Fuck me.

174
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:05,756
Fuck.

175
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:17,950
- Hello.
- Hey.

176
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,829
Billy, I can't hear you.

177
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,808
Uh... can you go outside,
uh... it's too loud.

178
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,809
Alright, hold on

179
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,075
Alright, what's up?

180
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,894
- Hey, uh... where are you?
- Lugo.

181
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,974
- Okay, are you with Will?
- Uh... yeah, Will Emerson?

182
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think he is...

183
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:38,876
I think he's still here.
Why?

184
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,896
Alright, I need you to get Will
and I need you guys to come back up here.

185
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,890
- Go where?
- To the office.

186
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,351
- What?
- I'm serious.

187
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:50,495
Wait a second, you want me...
you want me to get our boss's boss...

188
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,835
out of a club
and bring him back to the office...

189
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,436
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

190
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:54,754
Well, our boss just got axed,

191
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,355
so technically he is our boss, and yes
that's what I want you to do.

192
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:58,649
Why?

193
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:01,995
Look...man, just trust me, okay?
I need you guys back here, now.

194
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:03,188
Alright, we'll be there in ten.

195
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,589
Have I ever told you
how much I love your bike?

196
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,790
Not really, I... do you have, uh...
a little dress that matches it?

197
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,891
Yeah, I guess, you could...
you could bounce 'em around there...

198
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,192
like a fucking girl.

199
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:37,290
Hey!... Look who's burning
the candle at both ends.

200
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:39,169
Why didn't you come out with us?

201
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,650
There's no more cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my ass.

202
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,330
I frankly, don't even know,
what it is you guys do.

203
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,710
Will, I'm really sorry
I had to bring you guys back here, but...

204
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:48,811
That's alright.

205
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,712
- What's going on?
- Look at this.

206
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,511
Eric gave me this file before he left.

207
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:54,712
And?

208
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,211
Well, and... and he told me
he couldn't quite figure it out...

209
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,350
and the last thing he said to me
before the elevator closed,

210
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,651
is 'be careful'.

211
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:03,391
- He said, Be careful?
- Yeah.

212
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:04,892
So, obviously, I'm little curious.

213
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,491
I get into it a bit and I realize
that the only thing missing...

214
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,491
- This is not good, Will.
- Yeah, so what're you doing here?

215
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:11,592
Um...

216
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,430
No, no, go to model four,
it makes more sense.

217
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,531
Okay.

218
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:17,189
- Got it.
- What is this?

219
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:20,694
This is basically everything
that we have in our books.

220
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,794
At any given time.
But what Eric was trying to do...

221
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:25,316
is to work this numbers
for levels of volatility,

222
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,516
that fall outside
the standard VAR model.

223
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,456
What are those levels?

224
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:30,751
- It's, uh... fairly complicated...
- Simplify.

225
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,592
Uh... the volatility levels
are set using...

226
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,011
historic patterns basically,

227
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,612
and then stretching those patterns out
on a 10-15%... roughly.

228
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,415
- Alright, so?
- So, we are starting to...

229
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,216
test those historic patterns.

230
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:44,117
When?

231
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:45,911
- Today?
- Tuesday.

232
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,111
Monday...

233
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:50,610
- last friday and wednesday...
- Two Fridays ago.

234
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,130
Alright, I get it.

235
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,509
Fuck me. Once this thing
gets going in the wrong direction...

236
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,510
This is, uh...

237
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,691
- this is, fucking huge.
- How huge?

238
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,812
Well, the losses are greater
than the current value of the company.

239
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,872
Projected loses...
they're projected losses, Will.

240
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,692
- This is just our floor?
- Yes.

241
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:15,476
- Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
- I don't know.

242
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:16,876
I tried to call him, his phone's off.

243
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:17,770
What do you mean?

244
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:19,771
They turned everbody's phone off
that got axed today.

245
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:21,170
Fucking ruthless.

246
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,256
Did you try his personal cell?

247
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,256
Yeah, I called his cell phone,
it's not on.

248
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:27,475
- Call his home.
- At this hour?

249
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,592
- Yeah... do we even know if he's right?
- Looks pretty fucking right to me.

250
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:32,693
Yeah, it does.

251
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:37,011
Mrs. Dale, it's Will Emerson.

252
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,691
I'm fine, thank you.
May I speak with Eric?

253
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,751
No, we tried that.
His phone appears to be off.

254
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:47,252
Listen, could you have him call me?

255
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:50,251
The moment he comes in.
The moment he walks through the door.

256
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:53,712
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

257
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,371
- Where the fuck is he?
- Doesn't he have like three kids?

258
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,372
So?

259
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,112
Well, I don't know, would you go home?

260
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,332
I know where he is.

261
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,896
I need you two, to go and get him.

262
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,316
There be a car waiting for you
downstairs. You need to go.

263
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,397
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

264
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,911
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna call Sam.

265
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:19,452
Fuck me.

266
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,078
- Yes?
- It's Will.

267
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,056
It's 11 o'clock at night?

268
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,492
I know, I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have called...

269
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,393
What's the problem?

270
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:46,071
I think, you need to get back here.

271
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:47,872
What?

272
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:52,056
- Sam, listen...
- It's 11 o'clock at night!

273
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,611
I'm well aware
of the fucking time, Sam!

274
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:55,112
I'm telling you...
you need to see this.

275
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,337
See what?

276
00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:00,452
- It's, uh...
- E-mail it to me.

277
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:04,292
I don't think,
that would be a good idea.

278
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,012
I'm on my way.

279
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,291
Look at these people.

280
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:19,972
Wandering around,
with absolutely no...

281
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,073
idea, what's about to happen.

282
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,173
Right?

283
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:29,474
Well, I... I try not to let work
get to me like that.

284
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:32,593
I've noticed that about you.

285
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:36,372
Come on, I mean look,
we're 23 years old...

286
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:40,373
- I'm 28.
- Alright 28, well that's the same thing.

287
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:45,633
I made... nearly,
1/4 million dollars last year...

288
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,177
Fuck! For what?...

289
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,678
I... I push numbers around
on a computer screen,

290
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:53,418
so a bunch of glorified crack addicts
could take that information...

291
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,519
and pretend to understand it,

292
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:55,617
and then make a bet against
some other jock,

293
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:58,217
half way around the world doing...
You know, if he wasn't doing this?

294
00:23:58,218 --> 00:23:59,318
He'd be heading out to be somewhere,

295
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,319
putting it all on number 7,
it looks like.

296
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,533
And at the end of the day,
one guy wins, one guy loses.

297
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,713
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that, right?

298
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:11,213
Yeah.

299
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,773
It's Will. He wants to know
if we've found him, what do I say?

300
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,493
I would say...
that we haven't found him, yet.

301
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,159
- Hey.
- Hey. So?

302
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,053
- Eric Dale.
- Oh, Jesus...

303
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,672
Before he leaves the building,
escorted by fucking security...

304
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:58,272
- I had nothing to do with that.
- I know.

305
00:24:58,473 --> 00:24:59,373
I'm sorry. Go on.

306
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,053
Before he leaves the building
he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

307
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,517
- Who's Peter Sullivan, again?
- Don't matter. It's one of Eric's guys.

308
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:05,893
- Right.
- But before,

309
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:07,294
the elevator doors are closing...

310
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,652
the last thing he says is...

311
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,853
'Be Careful'

312
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:12,738
'Be Careful'?

313
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,139
Yeah.

314
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,340
- 'Be Careful'?... Why?
- Yeah.

315
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,632
Take a look.

316
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,254
Oh Jesus. You know I can't fucking
read this things...

317
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,455
just speak to me in English.

318
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,814
Basically, this kid, Peter Sullivan,

319
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,915
gets all inspired by you pep talk.
Nice job! By the way

320
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,013
And he goes straight in, after work.

321
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,613
- And I think he nailed it.
- Nailed it?

322
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,333
Yeah, I think he figured out
what Eric was missing.

323
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,832
- And?
- It's not good, Sam.

324
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,914
These here are the historical
volatility index limits, which...

325
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:49,218
of course, our entire trading model
relies on pretty fucking heavily...

326
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:53,354
And well, we are now so levered up.
But once it gets outside of these limits,

327
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,475
it gets ugly in a hurry.

328
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,575
And how close to those limits
have we gotten?

329
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:01,074
Oh, Sam, we're beyond close...

330
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,414
We broke through these limits
5 or 6 days over the last 2 weeks.

331
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:08,315
Now somehow, we've managed to stay
on the right side of it, for now...

332
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,316
For now?

333
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,954
Well, look what happens
when we get on the wrong side of it.

334
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,299
What am I looking at?

335
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,554
You're looking at this figure here.

336
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,619
- Whoa! Is that?
- Yeah.

337
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,614
And that would not be a bad day
for us to start, historically speaking.

338
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,634
- Is that figure right?
- I don't know, probably so.

339
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,674
Where is Eric Dale?

340
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,359
- We shut his phone off.
- Of course we did.

341
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah, so I called his wife,
who says, he's not home.

342
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,534
He's probably crying
in some fucking beer...

343
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:40,735
- somewhere.
- That's not how it was.

344
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,794
- Where's the kid who did this?
- I send him out to find Eric.

345
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,235
You think he knows what he's doing?

346
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,936
- I don't know, what do I know.
- Get him back here. Get him back.

347
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,178
What do these girls make in a night?

348
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:05,873
1500?

349
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,154
2 grand.

350
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:17,155
2 grand?

351
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:22,556
Well...
that's pretty great.

352
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,257
They been paying off the city.

353
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,358
Will.

354
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Yeah.

355
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:38,001
No. No, no, we ask,
but nobody seen him.

356
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,694
Okay.
Yeah.

357
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,700
Alright, so what do you think
Rogers makes in a year?

358
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:02,079
- Uh... I have no idea?
- Come on, play along.

359
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,480
- What'd he have...I don't know.
- Last year.

360
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,194
I guess, 3 quarters of a million?

361
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:09,954
Come on.

362
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,454
- What?
- That's not even close.

363
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,755
- More?
- Much more.

364
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,655
A million?

365
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:18,475
Will... Will Emerson made...

366
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,576
two and half million last year.
- Fuck you.

367
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
- Fuck me?
- Fuck you.

368
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:23,335
- How do you know that?
- He...

369
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:25,735
told me.

370
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:26,936
- He just told you?
- No, I ask him.

371
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,037
He never told me.

372
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,055
- You think that's true?
- Yeah probably.

373
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:36,495
- That's fucked up.
- Why, why's that fucked up?

374
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,055
Does that seem right to you?

375
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,456
Right?
I mean right is... right is...

376
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,015
Jesus.

377
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,194
So, what do you think that means
Rogers puts away?

378
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,195
I have no idea, Seth.
This traffic's a fucking nightmare.

379
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,494
Gentlemen?

380
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,641
- Will.
- Mr. Rogers.

381
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:19,295
Come with us, please.

382
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,356
Sam this is Seth Bregman
and this is Peter Sullivan.

383
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:29,257
Sir.

384
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:35,716
Where we going?

385
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,435
We're going to get a second opinion
on your work, Peter.

386
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:15,837
So Sam what you have for us?

387
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:18,697
Well... they'll be here in a minute.
Finding someone in the copy room...

388
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:20,398
at this hour
was a little bit of a challenge.

389
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:22,295
Okay, let's go right into introduction.

390
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:25,380
This is Sarah Robertson who you know,
chief risk assessment officer...

391
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:29,435
Ramesh Shah from upstairs and David Horn
one of the firm's in house council.

392
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:31,820
Nice to meet you all.
This is my head of trading, Will Emerson,

393
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:35,221
and this is, Peter, uh, Sullivan,
and Seth Bregman.

394
00:30:35,222 --> 00:30:37,322
- They work in our risk department.
- Where is Eric Dale?

395
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,516
He was let go today.

396
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:43,935
Who you have left
in your risk department?

397
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:46,556
As of today that would be...

398
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:48,917
Peter and our junior analyst Seth.

399
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:52,301
Will.

400
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,936
- Uh... Will Emerson?
- Yes please, just hand it out.

401
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:58,337
Let's see.

402
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:11,575
Apparently Eric had been
working on this for some time...

403
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:12,776
but was unable to finish it,

404
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,356
This morning, as he left the building;

405
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:17,077
He handed the program to Peter here,
and asked him to take a look at it.

406
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,157
Peter did.

407
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,457
He put in a few things out that
Eric seemed to be missing...

408
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,376
and this is what came out.

409
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,076
Peter, Is this your work?

410
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,277
Mostly Mr. Dale's...

411
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:31,181
Is this your draft?

412
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:33,015
Yes, um...

413
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:37,461
Again, expanded on original work
of Eric's. But yes.

414
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,517
- What's your background?
- My background?

415
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:40,941
- Your CV.
- I've been with the firm...

416
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,741
for 2 and half years
working with Eric that whole time...

417
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:44,761
But I hold a doctorate in engineering,

418
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,462
speciality in propulsion, from MIT,
with a Bachelors from Penn.

419
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,935
What is a specialty in propulsion,
exactly?

420
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,798
My thesis was a study
in the way that friction ratios...

421
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,899
effect steering outcomes in aeronautical
use under reduced gravity loads.

422
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,198
- So, you're a rocket scientist?
- I was.

423
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:04,622
Interesting.
How did you end up here?

424
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,502
Well it's all just numbers really,
just changing what you're adding up...

425
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,903
but if I may speak freely:

426
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,195
The money here,
is considerably more attractive.

427
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:20,761
What time is it?

428
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:22,657
2:15.

429
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,558
Oh, really?

430
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:28,416
And I'm guessing, by the fact
that you 2 haven't said anything...

431
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,717
that the math checks out?

432
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,778
Look, we need some time
to go over this,

433
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,302
but Mr. Sullivan here, seems like
he knows what he's doing.

434
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,496
So, it would appear we have a problem.

435
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:39,697
Thank you for that.

436
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:42,063
- What time is it?
- 2:16.

437
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:43,057
Fuck me.

438
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,658
Fuck me.

439
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:54,577
Sam...

440
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,677
How long under normal operations,

441
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,078
would it take your people
to clear that from our books?

442
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:03,616
What?

443
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,397
- All of it?
- Yes.

444
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,138
I don't know, weeks.

445
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,818
- Weeks?
- Yeah, weeks.

446
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:15,337
But you'd certainly know
our business is selling and buying.

447
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:18,361
Doesn't work for very long
without both components.

448
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:20,057
We suddenly stop buying
for a day or two,

449
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:23,158
that's not something you can
hide under the rug, that gets out...

450
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:25,336
and when it does,
this whole this thing...

451
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,437
comes to a end...
and right quick.

452
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,977
- I understand.
- Do you?

453
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:34,956
Yes.

454
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:40,182
How many traders do we have left
between your floor and Petersen's?

455
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,842
- I don't know, what? Sixty?
- Sixty.

456
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:43,518
Jared, as I look at this more closely,

457
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,019
it is these VAR numbers
that are setting this thing off.

458
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,920
Excuse me a second.

459
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:02,882
I want you on this

460
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:03,782
Please...

461
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:06,084
As I was saying and I'm speaking
completely off the record.

462
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:07,282
It's only a matter of time...

463
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:09,082
before someone else
starts putting these in.

464
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,078
And they come up
with exactly the same results.

465
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:13,062
And look exactly
what we're looking at right now.

466
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:14,862
- if they haven't already.
- Understood.

467
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:16,757
And Sarah, what value...

468
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,658
would you allow to be placed
on those assets...

469
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,559
that might remain on the books,
if they had to?

470
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,639
Why would they still be on the books?

471
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,237
Because suddenly nobody
wants to fucking buy them.

472
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:25,338
Fuck you Sam!
Will you give me...

473
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,839
- a fucking break here?
- Excuse me, Jerry.

474
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:28,977
Without an active market,
it would take weeks or months...

475
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:31,078
for me to come up
with an accurate value on them.

476
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:32,439
You got to go block by block.

477
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
Hey, look, Jared,
it's a very simple business, right?

478
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,641
- We talked about it.
- Sam!

479
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,342
Uh... well,
Peter and uh...

480
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,443
- What the fuck is his name?
- Seth.

481
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,043
Thank you.
Seth, uh...

482
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:43,817
could you please,
give us for a few moments.

483
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:46,778
And Peter?

484
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,542
- Has anyone else has seen this?
- No, no one aside from us.

485
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,437
- And Eric Dale?
- Yes.

486
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:56,038
And can it really be possible
that we don't know, where Eric Dale is?

487
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,099
I called his wife.
He hasn't come home yet...

488
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,200
and we turned off his phone today.

489
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:04,259
Perfect.
Well, I'd like to know where he is.

490
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:17,078
Jesus fucking Christ!
Who... who is that guy?

491
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:21,398
- He's Sam's boss.
- He looks like he's fifteen years old.

492
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:24,597
- He's Forty.
- Yeah, how does that happen?

493
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,658
Oh, it happens all the time.

494
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:35,760
Except to me.
He's a fucking killer.

495
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:39,918
What are they talking about, in there?

496
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:46,479
It ain't pretty.

497
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,198
Uh, what ain't pretty?

498
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:52,998
If people suddenly stop buying
what we're selling.

499
00:35:57,744 --> 00:36:02,923
Jared... you cannot be doing
what you are thinking of doing?

500
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:04,379
Well, I don't see any other choice.

501
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:06,080
What do you... what does that mean?
We don't have a choice.

502
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,043
Fuck you, you don't have a choice!

503
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:10,504
Fuck me? Did you even
look at the numbers Sam?

504
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:11,803
Yeah, but what do I know.

505
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,500
Correct me, if I'm wrong, Mr. Shah.

506
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,644
But, uh... these number,
they don't add up.

507
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:17,244
One and one, no longer makes two.

508
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:18,838
- If I may, I would like...
- Jared,

509
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,989
a little more time.
- We can't tell without considering...

510
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:23,699
- We have talked about this.
- We need a little more time...

511
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,944
to give you our conclusion.

512
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:27,279
Okay...
we meet again in 45 minutes.

513
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:30,020
- Sam, do you have the file?
- Yeah.

514
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:47,639
What're you gonna do?

515
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,580
You're gonna call him?

516
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:58,599
I already have.

517
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:14,117
Ooh, Jesus.

518
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,621
Wow. It's gorgeous.

519
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:30,560
It's a long way down.

520
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,119
Yes, it is.

521
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:46,640
Don't do that, whoa, wait.
Stop that. Come on.

522
00:37:49,426 --> 00:37:51,480
You know the fear
that people experience...

523
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,081
when they stand on the edge like this
isn't a fear of falling.

524
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:57,160
It's a fear that they might jump.

525
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:01,120
Well, that's very deep
and depressing, thank you.

526
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:03,340
Yeah, well,
I'm a little dark sometimes.

527
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,860
Come down, please, Will.
Please, come on.

528
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,061
Will?

529
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:08,779
Yeah, fuck it!

530
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Woo!

531
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,020
Not today.

532
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,984
It looks like,
they're gonna make us dump this shit.

533
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,280
What?

534
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:25,404
You watch.

535
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:26,600
How?

536
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,861
- You'll see!
- How could they do that?

537
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,681
They can't... it's impossible.
But they'll figure a way.

538
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,360
I been in this company for ten years
and I've seen some things you wouldn't...

539
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,220
you wouldn't believe...

540
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:39,800
when all is said and done...

541
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,901
they do not lose money.
They don't mind if everyone else does,

542
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,080
but they don't loose.

543
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:54,800
Will?

544
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,746
Did you really make
two and half million last year?

545
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,140
Yeah, sure.

546
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:04,959
How did you spend it all?

547
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:06,920
Goes by quickly.

548
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,265
You know, you'll learn to spend
what's in your pocket.

549
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:10,686
Two and half millions goes quickly?

550
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:11,901
Alright, let's see.

551
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:16,202
So the tax man takes half up front.
So, you're left with one and a quarter.

552
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:19,060
My mortgage takes another 300 grand.

553
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:22,180
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know, to keep them going.

554
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:23,840
- So, what's left?
- Eight hundred.

555
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:24,841
Right, eight hundred.

556
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,480
I spend 150 on a car.

557
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:29,745
About 75 in restaurants.

558
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:32,699
Probably... 50 on clothes.

559
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:35,004
I put 400 away for a rainy day...

560
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:36,100
That's smart.

561
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:39,181
Yeah, as it turns out.
It looks like the storm's coming.

562
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,621
You still got 125.

563
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:47,402
Yeah, I did spent 76,520 dollars
on hookers,

564
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:49,603
booze and dancers.
But mainly, hookers.

565
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,623
76,5?

566
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,641
I was a little shocked initially,

567
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,042
but then I realised that I could claim
most of it back, as entertainment.

568
00:39:58,043 --> 00:39:59,043
It's true.

569
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:05,044
- What was that?
- Holy shit.

570
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,345
The cavalry is here.

571
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,341
How old are you?

572
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,521
43.

573
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,102
This is bizarre.

574
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:31,101
It's like a...
dream.

575
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:39,061
Well, I don't know, seems like
we actually may have just woke up.

576
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,160
Come in.

577
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:44,461
How do we look?

578
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:46,745
I should go.

579
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,786
No, you should stay.

580
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:49,282
So?

581
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:51,080
It's legit...

582
00:40:51,486 --> 00:40:52,880
the kid killed it.

583
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,341
The formula is worthless.

584
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:57,287
What does that mean?

585
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,266
It's broken.

586
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,201
There are 8 trillion dollars of paper...

587
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:03,727
around the world
relying on that equation?

588
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,142
- We were wrong.
- No, You mean...

589
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,462
- you were wrong.
- Don't get me started...

590
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,507
We discussed this!

591
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,005
- I'm heading to the conference room.
- No, I want you to hear this.

592
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:15,002
I don't wanna hear this.

593
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,861
How do you think
I've stuck around this place so long?

594
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:27,621
I called Tuld.

595
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,022
You have a contingency plan here?

596
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,422
A contingency plan?

597
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,582
- Yes.
- No, we went all in on this one.

598
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,282
So, we've gotten ourselves quite
exposed here, haven't we?

599
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,361
To Tuld or the market?

600
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:48,522
To both.

601
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:11,324
He's here?

602
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,325
Mh-hm.

603
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,288
- Tuld's helicopter just landed.
- I know, come with us.

604
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,803
- Where's Sam?
- I don't know.

605
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:47,204
- You sure you want all of us?
- Yes.

606
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:57,402
Just one piece of advice
for everyone before we go in there.

607
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:58,822
This could get a little ugly.

608
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,647
But whatever you do,
just tell the truth.

609
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:03,148
No sugar coating.
Do not change a word of it.

610
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,542
No one here is smart enough...

611
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:06,403
including the rocket scientist.

612
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,804
- Mr. Told.
- Good morning.

613
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:18,324
This way please.

614
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:25,083
He's already in there waiting for you.

615
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:27,022
Excellent!

616
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,583
Please sit down.

617
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:57,724
Welcome everyone.

618
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:00,783
I must apologize for dragging you all
here at such an uncommon hour;

619
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,061
But from what I've been told,
this matter needs to be handled urgently!

620
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,623
So urgently in fact, it probably should
have been addressed weeks ago.

621
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:09,903
That is spilled milk under the bridge!

622
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:13,883
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

623
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,202
Mr. Tuld, uh...
as I mentioned earlier...

624
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:20,587
if you compare the figure
at the top page 13...

625
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:23,142
Jared, it's irrelevant now,
just speak to me in plain english.

626
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,228
Okay.

627
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:28,328
But I'd like to speak to the guy
who put this together.

628
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:29,629
Mr. Sullivan is it?

629
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:30,728
Does he speak English?

630
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:31,588
Sir?

631
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:35,384
I like to speak with the analyst who
seems to have stumbled across this mess.

632
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,984
Certainly, that would be Peter Sullivan.
Right here.

633
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,504
Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you're here!
Good morning.

634
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,145
Maybe you could tell me...
what you think is going on here.

635
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,803
And please, speak as you might
to a young child...

636
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,743
or golden retriever.

637
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:52,383
It wasn't brains, that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

638
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:55,907
Well, um...

639
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:01,429
sir, as you may or may not know,
I work... here for Mr. Rogers...

640
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,503
as an associate in the risk assessment
and management office at GSMBS.

641
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,505
Please, just relax, stand up,
tell us in clear voice...

642
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,104
what is the nature of the problem?

643
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:15,309
Okay, uh...

644
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,723
well as you probably know over the last
36 to 40 months the firm has begun...

645
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:24,443
packaging new MBS products,

646
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:29,164
that combine several different
trounces of rating classification...

647
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:30,665
in one tradable security.

648
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,084
This has been enormously profitable...
as I imagine... you noticed.

649
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,043
I have.

650
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:38,969
Well, the firm is currently doing...

651
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,670
a considerable amount
of this business every day.

652
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,889
The problem, which is I guess
why we're here tonight is...

653
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,563
that it takes us... the firm,
about a month...

654
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,588
to layer these products correctly.

655
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:54,084
Thereby posing a challenge
from a risk assessment standpoint.

656
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,364
And, Sullivan that challenge is?

657
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,810
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

658
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:01,890
Yes.

659
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:04,984
But the key factor is here is,
these are essentially just mortgages,

660
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:07,970
that has allowed us to
push the leverage considerably...

661
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:11,009
beyond what you might be willing
or allowed to do,

662
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,843
in any other circumstance,
thereby pushing the risk...

663
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:15,844
profile without raising any red flags.

664
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,163
Now. Thank you, sit down.

665
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:21,664
What I am guessing,
your report here says,

666
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,305
- I'm act...
- Give me some rope.

667
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,084
What I'm guessing it says, is that...

668
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,723
considering then, shall we say?

669
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:30,845
Bumpy road,
we've been on the last week or so.

670
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,744
But the figures your brilliant
co-workers up the line...

671
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:35,345
ahead of you come up with...

672
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,624
don't make much sense anymore.

673
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:40,404
Considering what's taking place today?

674
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,429
Actually not taking place today...

675
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,909
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

676
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,164
So, you are saying,
this has already happened?

677
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,444
Sort of.

678
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,384
And, Mr. Sullivan, what does
your model say what that means...

679
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,345
for us here?

680
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:00,925
Well, that's where
it becomes a projection.

681
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,126
But, uhm...

682
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:07,285
You're speaking with me,
Mr. Sullivan.

683
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:09,286
Well, sir...

684
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,585
if those assets decrease by just...

685
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,443
25 percent, and remain on our books...

686
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,484
that loss...

687
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:20,644
would... be greater than the
current market capitalization...

688
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:21,945
of this entire company.

689
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:28,983
So...
what you're telling me...

690
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:31,246
is that...

691
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,426
music is about to stop...

692
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:39,265
and we're gonna be left holding...
'the biggest bag of odorous excrement'...

693
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:44,784
ever assembled in the history of...
capitalism?

694
00:47:48,891 --> 00:47:50,324
Sir, I'm not sure that I would...

695
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:52,965
put it that way, but let me clarify...

696
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,086
using your analogy,

697
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:57,005
what this model shows...

698
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:01,064
is the music so to speak,
just slowing.

699
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:04,165
If the music were to stop,
as you put it,

700
00:48:04,712 --> 00:48:06,745
then this model
wouldn't be even close.

701
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:10,645
To that scenario,
it would be... considerably worse.

702
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:16,345
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Sullivan.

703
00:48:18,052 --> 00:48:22,590
Do you care to know,
why I'm in this chair with you all?

704
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:24,486
I mean, why I earn the big bucks?

705
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,370
Yes.

706
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,485
I'm here for one reason
and one reason alone.

707
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,865
I'm here to guess, what the music
might do, a week, a month,

708
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,705
a year from now.

709
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,164
That's it!

710
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:40,885
Nothing more.

711
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,025
I'm standing here tonight...

712
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:51,965
I'm afraid that,
I... don't... hear... a... thing...

713
00:48:54,452 --> 00:48:59,126
just... silence!

714
00:49:14,432 --> 00:49:17,466
So... now that we know
the music has stopped,

715
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:18,567
what can we do about it?

716
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:21,587
Mr. Cohen,
Ms. Robertson,

717
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:25,925
I'm afraid, I think, this is where you're
supposed to step back in.

718
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,686
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

719
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,126
What do you have for us?

720
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,469
What have I told you...

721
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,186
since the first day
you stepped into my office?

722
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:48,865
There are three ways
to make a living in this business.

723
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,425
Be first, be smarter, or cheat.

724
00:49:53,112 --> 00:49:54,290
Now, I don't cheat...

725
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,627
and although I like to think,

726
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:59,328
we have some pretty smart people
in this building.

727
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:03,451
It sure is a hell of a lot easier,
to just be first.

728
00:50:04,352 --> 00:50:06,086
Sell it all...
today!

729
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:10,346
Is that even possible, Sam?

730
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:12,906
Yes, but at what cost?

731
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,045
I'll have to pay.

732
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:18,846
Really?

733
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:20,767
I think so.

734
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,866
Where is this gonna come back to us?

735
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,267
Everywhere.

736
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:30,667
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
what your boy here had just said.

737
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:36,066
If I made you...

738
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:38,306
how would you do this?

739
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:46,831
Well, you call the traders in
for their normal 6:30 meeting...

740
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:47,771
and be honest with them.

741
00:50:47,772 --> 00:50:49,246
Because they're gonna know
it's the end either way.

742
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,391
So you have to throw 'em a bone,
and a pretty big one.

743
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:55,126
And then, you gotta
come outta the gate storming.

744
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,107
No swaps, no nothing.

745
00:50:57,832 --> 00:50:59,451
40 percent done by 10:15.

746
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:01,552
By 11 o'clock
all your trades have to be gone...

747
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:04,253
because by lunch-time,
words gonna be out.

748
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:08,651
And by 2 o'clock you'll be selling at
65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky.

749
00:51:08,952 --> 00:51:11,892
And the feds are gonna be in here
up your ass, trying to slow us down.

750
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:14,071
- Ramesh?
- They can slow you down...

751
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,847
but they can't stop you.
It's yours to sell.

752
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:18,687
John... even if...

753
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:23,306
we manage to... pull that off,
and that's saying something?

754
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:25,568
The real question is...

755
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:27,168
who are we selling this to?

756
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:30,185
The same people we've been
selling to for the last 2 years...

757
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:31,786
and whoever else will buy.

758
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:34,147
But, John, if you do this...

759
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:38,786
you would kill the market
for years. It's over.

760
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:43,731
And you're selling something
that you know has no value.

761
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:45,868
We are selling to willing buyers...

762
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,088
at a current fair market price,

763
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:52,147
so that "we" may survive!

764
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:55,752
You'll never sell anything
to any of those people ever again.

765
00:51:55,753 --> 00:51:58,052
- I understand.
- Do you?

766
00:51:58,053 --> 00:51:59,068
Do you?

767
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,166
This is it!

768
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:03,447
I'm telling you.
This is it!

769
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:15,968
Now it's 4:00 o'clock.

770
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:19,833
Jared, you got 'till 5:00,
to break this down and draw me up a plan.

771
00:52:19,834 --> 00:52:22,373
Is there anybody else
who knows what's in here...

772
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:24,074
at the moment, block by block?

773
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,668
Eric Dale.

774
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:27,667
Where is he?

775
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:30,748
As of today
he is no longer with the firm.

776
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:33,568
We have been, uh...
trying to locate him.

777
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,167
- Carmelo?
- Yes?

778
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:40,668
Get me Eric Dale here
by 6:30.

779
00:52:40,693 --> 00:52:41,752
It's done.

780
00:52:42,053 --> 00:52:44,008
We meet back here in an hour.

781
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:48,287
Sam, let's talk.

782
00:53:00,773 --> 00:53:02,007
This is a hell of a town.

783
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:05,772
I've always loved this place.

784
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:08,388
Since the day I arrived.
Everything about it.

785
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:18,907
Sam, are you gonna go with me on this?

786
00:53:21,715 --> 00:53:23,088
I don't know John.

787
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:26,947
This one is very ugly.

788
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:30,528
You and I we're salesmen.

789
00:53:31,454 --> 00:53:34,033
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

790
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:35,133
Exactly.

791
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:36,928
And you know damn well...

792
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:38,332
you don't sell anything to anybody,

793
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,133
unless you think
they're gonna come back for more.

794
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:44,068
That's the lesson we learned
and tomorrow... we're done.

795
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:45,369
This is it, Sam.

796
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,070
You keep saying that,
what's that suppose to mean?

797
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:48,769
This is the big one.

798
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:52,188
Most of us
aren't gonna make it outta this one.

799
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,673
- Us?
- The street.

800
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,812
What're you talking about?

801
00:53:57,413 --> 00:53:59,908
This isn't the last 'situation'
I'm gonna have to deal with this week.

802
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,131
This is just the start.

803
00:54:01,732 --> 00:54:03,813
It's the start,
'cause you are starting it.

804
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:05,392
Maybe, but I don't believe that.

805
00:54:05,593 --> 00:54:06,590
Not this time.

806
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:09,872
And the numbers
they just don't add up anymore.

807
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,908
I agree with you there,
I've been saying that for years.

808
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:15,968
I mean, this kid out there
can come up with this thing.

809
00:54:17,356 --> 00:54:20,114
Look, I just don't think I can walk
in there, knowing what I know...

810
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:21,915
and put the hammer down on these guys.

811
00:54:22,615 --> 00:54:24,808
When did you start
getting so soft, Sam?

812
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:28,048
Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

813
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:32,688
If you're the first outta the door,

814
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:34,828
that's not called panicking.

815
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:43,208
Well, you're obviously operating
with more information than I have.

816
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,849
But I think
this will destroy this firm.

817
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:50,509
No one will ever trust you again.

818
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:53,009
Knowingly putting people outta business,
full stop.

819
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:57,288
You let me deal with that, Sam.

820
00:55:12,314 --> 00:55:13,469
How'd that go?

821
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:16,328
This is a fucking shit show.

822
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:19,250
- They're gonna go with it?
- Probably.

823
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,869
Jesus!

824
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:24,649
Remember this day boys.

825
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:28,929
Remember this day.

826
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:45,629
So, what's the strategy here?

827
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:49,109
Well that's where we're headed right now,
downstairs to work on it with my guys.

828
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:51,889
No, not you and I, with John.

829
00:55:56,915 --> 00:56:00,230
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

830
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:02,588
Please.

831
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:06,689
Listen, he knows
where we still on this.

832
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:08,769
All along.

833
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,210
That's exactly my point.

834
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:13,510
And knowing what was discussed...

835
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:18,835
by both you and I. I don't think
this could provide you with anything.

836
00:56:19,036 --> 00:56:21,069
Other than, false sense of comfort.

837
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:23,768
I'm not looking for sense of comfort,
per say.

838
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:27,528
I think there's one to be found.

839
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:40,709
So again, what's the strategy here?

840
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:45,209
Well, I'm just not sure
there's much more to do in this.

841
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,630
It's very simple.

842
00:56:48,415 --> 00:56:50,729
Don't even think about
of fucking me on this.

843
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,908
Because if we're going down...

844
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,310
then you damn well know
we'll be together.

845
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,369
No, I'm not sure, that I do know that.

846
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,970
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

847
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:41,630
What you guys think
Tuld made last year?

848
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,071
Would you shut the fuck up.

849
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:47,610
86 million.

850
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:50,890
In bonuses and salary.

851
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:53,816
- Really?
- Sure, it's public record.

852
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:58,451
He was worth a billion.

853
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:00,076
Was?

854
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,011
'Till today.

855
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:06,912
- Tonight?
- We'll see.

856
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:12,713
I'm gonna get some coffee,
does anyone want something else?

857
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,850
- No.
- I could use some real air.

858
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:17,530
- Probably a good idea.
- Is it alright, Will?

859
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:19,331
Hey, Will, uh...
is there anything you need?

860
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:20,832
Our cause ic not important.

861
00:58:21,232 --> 00:58:22,532
You want me to hold your Hand?

862
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,033
Why'd they put all this fruit away?

863
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:40,650
Hello, Will Emerson.

864
00:58:41,376 --> 00:58:42,331
Hello?

865
00:58:46,095 --> 00:58:46,995
Right.

866
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:50,850
No, thank you.
Alright, I understand.

867
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:55,291
No, we'll...
we'll be discreet.

868
00:58:56,692 --> 00:58:57,592
Thank you.

869
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:00,016
- What?
- Eric's wife.

870
00:59:00,657 --> 00:59:04,091
He's alive, he's home. He doesn't wanna
speak to us. He doesn't know she rang me.

871
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:05,776
- Where does he live?
- Heights.

872
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:07,351
Should I call Tuld's guy?

873
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,636
No, it's Eric,
the last thing we need...

874
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:11,237
is those guys going over there.
Now you two go get him...

875
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:13,238
try to bring him in,
but you gotta be back by 6:00 am.

876
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,239
Alright.

877
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:18,689
I hate Brooklyn.

878
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:25,071
May I come in?

879
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:27,150
Of course.
Please, sit down.

880
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:33,817
So...

881
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:39,192
we're gonna do this thing.

882
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:43,951
Okay.

883
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:46,451
It's gonna be tight.

884
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:50,171
Is Sam on board?

885
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:51,631
Not yet.

886
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:56,651
Sarah,

887
00:59:57,437 --> 00:59:58,471
I need a head...

888
00:59:59,256 --> 01:00:01,851
to feed to the traders
on the floor and the board.

889
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:07,311
Is it me or Cohen?

890
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:08,671
It's you.

891
01:00:18,257 --> 01:00:19,252
Of course you're...

892
01:00:20,238 --> 01:00:22,212
well aware that I filtered
several warnings...

893
01:00:22,213 --> 01:00:24,713
to you and Cohen about this,
a year ago.

894
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:29,371
I really don't think that's the best path
for you to take at this point.

895
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,711
You're gonna be
well taken care of, really.

896
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:42,597
Obviously it is...
quite complicated.

897
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,851
John I was told
that in no uncertain terms...

898
01:00:44,877 --> 01:00:46,793
It was always a very grey area.

899
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:49,572
Actually it was made
very clear at the time,

900
01:00:49,577 --> 01:00:51,851
by you me and Cohen.

901
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:57,171
I really appreciate it,
if you didn't fight me on this.

902
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:10,632
We all fucked this one up pretty good.

903
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:12,933
Yeah.

904
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,432
We need you to stay here 'till this
is finished and the markets close.

905
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,652
I understand.

906
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:25,333
They'll go over the numbers with you
downstairs.

907
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:27,773
Good luck.

908
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:46,778
Back there,

909
01:01:47,979 --> 01:01:49,412
What's the boy wonder want?

910
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:56,637
You got a minute?

911
01:01:56,638 --> 01:01:59,278
- We're just off to pick up Eric.
- Yeah I know, it'll only take a second.

912
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:00,973
Alright, what is it?

913
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:03,632
Tuld and I have concerns that Sam,

914
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,133
may not be willing to step up
and do the right thing here.

915
01:02:06,979 --> 01:02:08,196
It's never been a problem.

916
01:02:08,397 --> 01:02:09,392
No, it hasn't.

917
01:02:09,716 --> 01:02:12,312
But sometimes, in an acute situation,
such as this...

918
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,052
often what is right...

919
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,233
can take on, multiple interpretations.

920
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:22,997
Sam will step up.

921
01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:24,492
Oh, I know he will.

922
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:28,413
But if he doesn't...
if he doesn't...

923
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:30,232
we need to know, that you will.

924
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:33,798
Tank you.

925
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:35,113
You need to know that I will what?

926
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:37,172
That you'll step up.

927
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,158
I have not doubt,
that Sam will make the right decision.

928
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,637
But, just to make it clear.

929
01:02:43,738 --> 01:02:46,453
He and I've always have the same
interpretation, of what's right.

930
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:50,654
No matter how acute, the situation.

931
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:31,618
Jesus, that's a nice place.

932
01:05:31,919 --> 01:05:33,813
Yeah, it is, he just bought it.

933
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,035
I hope it was with cash.

934
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,695
Fuck me. You're a heartless
little shit sometimes.

935
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:43,734
And it wasn't.

936
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,334
Don't touch any of the buttons!

937
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,394
What're you doing here?

938
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:56,854
Hey?

939
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:05,334
So, Peter finished that model
you were working on.

940
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,659
Really?

941
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,494
Caused a shit storm.

942
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,196
I bet it did.

943
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:13,655
You think he's right?

944
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:15,654
I know he's right.

945
01:06:18,555 --> 01:06:19,455
Fuck.

946
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,019
So, Jared Cohen called
an emergency meeting...

947
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,320
of the senior partners last night.

948
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,175
Based on your findings...

949
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,674
they decided to liquidate
our entire position.

950
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,155
Today!

951
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:42,575
I'm very sorry about that.

952
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:51,020
They're worried about
you being out here...

953
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:52,321
and they want me to bring you back.

954
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:55,579
- Jesus!
- I'm just saying.

955
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,480
Fuck that.

956
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,715
- Fuck 'em
- Don't be rash.

957
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:00,816
Forget it, I signed my paper.
I'm out!

958
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:02,017
- They'll pay you.
- Not me.

959
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:04,194
They'll pay you.

960
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:06,174
I've been paid enough, already.

961
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,876
You know I built a bridge once?

962
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,941
- Sorry?
- A bridge.

963
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:22,316
No, I didn't know that.

964
01:07:23,101 --> 01:07:24,516
I was an engineer by trade.

965
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,975
It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio
to, uh... Moundsville, West Virgina.

966
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:33,795
It spans 912 feet
above the Ohio river.

967
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,375
12,100 people use this thing a day.

968
01:07:37,342 --> 01:07:38,814
And It cut off 35 miles...

969
01:07:38,841 --> 01:07:42,614
of extra driving each way,
between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

970
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:43,894
That's a combined...

971
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:46,516
847 thousand miles of driving,

972
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:47,995
a day.

973
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:52,900
Worth 25 million
410 thousand miles, a month.

974
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,954
And 304 million
920 thousand miles a year.

975
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:00,515
Saved.

976
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:05,375
Now, I completed that project in 1986,
that's 22 years ago.

977
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:10,235
So, over the life of that one bridge,
that's 6 billion, 708 million...

978
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:13,035
240 thousand...

979
01:08:14,202 --> 01:08:15,796
miles, that haven't had to be driven!

980
01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:19,576
At... what? Let's say...
50 miles an hour?

981
01:08:19,621 --> 01:08:25,195
So, that's what? That's a... 134 million,
164 thousand 800 hours...

982
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,454
or...
559 thousand 20 days.

983
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:30,656
So, that one little bridge...

984
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:32,957
has saved the people of those
2 communities a combined,

985
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:36,258
1 thousand 5 hundred
and 31 years of their lives...

986
01:08:37,382 --> 01:08:38,916
not wasted in a fucking car.

987
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:46,541
1 thousand 5 hundred and 31 years!

988
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:47,736
Jesus.

989
01:08:58,861 --> 01:09:00,594
Well, I guess,
you better get back over there.

990
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:06,196
Yeah.

991
01:09:10,182 --> 01:09:11,281
Thanks for coming by.

992
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:12,937
You're welcome.

993
01:09:17,402 --> 01:09:18,695
Who the fuck is this?

994
01:09:19,102 --> 01:09:21,415
Well, I would imagine,
it's the firm's people.

995
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:22,681
What?

996
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:24,355
Tuld don't want any loose ends.

997
01:09:26,802 --> 01:09:27,775
He fired me.

998
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:29,520
Fuck them. Fuck them.

999
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:31,456
I totally agree, fuck 'em.
So, come back.

1000
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,936
Take the money,
you'll be home by five.

1001
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:36,035
Otherwise, they're gonna fight you
on everything,

1002
01:09:36,036 --> 01:09:39,136
they're gonna fight you on the
package, the options, the whole... huh?

1003
01:09:39,961 --> 01:09:40,877
Be smart.

1004
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:45,078
Good luck.

1005
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:48,956
Well...
you're a better man than me.

1006
01:09:50,303 --> 01:09:51,421
That's always been true.

1007
01:09:51,422 --> 01:09:52,516
Yes, it has.

1008
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,076
The house looks good.

1009
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:02,136
Thanks.

1010
01:10:03,802 --> 01:10:04,716
Hey Eric...

1011
01:10:05,843 --> 01:10:08,078
don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, alright?

1012
01:10:10,182 --> 01:10:12,116
Some people like driving
the long way home.

1013
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:14,696
Who the fuck knows, right?

1014
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:46,976
Ah...
there he is.

1015
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:49,797
John.

1016
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:52,576
How's it looking?

1017
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,777
Cohen's done a nice job,
it could work.

1018
01:10:56,903 --> 01:10:57,817
What's that mean?

1019
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:03,257
It means...
as you very well know,

1020
01:11:04,523 --> 01:11:07,018
that you're a very important piece
of this puzzle.

1021
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:09,219
Mmm.

1022
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:39,423
That's very generous.

1023
01:11:40,324 --> 01:11:41,358
It's not a gift.

1024
01:11:41,984 --> 01:11:44,177
I need to know you're with me on this.

1025
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:49,117
I'm with the firm, John.

1026
01:11:52,143 --> 01:11:55,436
I won't get what I need from your boys
on the floor, unless they believe you.

1027
01:11:57,783 --> 01:12:00,497
Unless they believe in you completely.

1028
01:12:04,423 --> 01:12:05,557
Are you in, on this?

1029
01:12:07,785 --> 01:12:09,503
I've told you my reservations.

1030
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:11,638
You can't have reservations!

1031
01:12:12,823 --> 01:12:14,357
And I need to know now.

1032
01:12:16,902 --> 01:12:19,197
Look John,
I'm completely with the firm,

1033
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:21,398
as I always have been.
Excuse me.

1034
01:12:48,784 --> 01:12:51,219
Alright, Will, am, am I getting fired?

1035
01:12:51,944 --> 01:12:52,878
I don't know.

1036
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:00,078
Yeah...
almost definitely, yes.

1037
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:04,918
- Are you?
- No.

1038
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,437
Seth, its nothing you did. You're just
in a wrong firm, in a wrong time.

1039
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:12,722
You young guys are always
the first to get called.

1040
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,822
Listen, nothing I'm gonna say
is gonna make you feel any better.

1041
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:18,277
It's just gonna suck for a while...
and then you'll be fine.

1042
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:24,599
You alright?

1043
01:13:26,645 --> 01:13:27,764
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1044
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:32,498
For what its worth,
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

1045
01:13:33,925 --> 01:13:35,744
Don't be.
You didn't do it to me.

1046
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,624
Still, at least you're gonna have
some nice cash to walk away with.

1047
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:40,343
I guess.

1048
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:42,558
Shit, this is really
gonna effect people.

1049
01:13:42,559 --> 01:13:44,959
- Yeah, it's gonna affect people like me.
- No, no...

1050
01:13:45,603 --> 01:13:46,918
I mean, real...
real people.

1051
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:48,338
Jesus, Seth.

1052
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:50,899
Listen, if you really
wanna do this with your life.

1053
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,000
You have to believe you're necessary.
And you are.

1054
01:13:53,444 --> 01:13:56,099
People wanna live like this, in their
cars and their big fucking houses,

1055
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,700
that they can't even pay for.
Then, you're necessary.

1056
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:01,659
The only reason, that they all get
to continue living like kings...

1057
01:14:01,665 --> 01:14:04,283
is because we got our fingers
on the scales in their favour.

1058
01:14:04,784 --> 01:14:05,879
I take my hand off.

1059
01:14:06,744 --> 01:14:09,257
Well, then the whole world
gets really fucking fair,

1060
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:11,558
really fucking quickly
and nobody asks you one shite.

1061
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:12,759
They say they do but they don't.

1062
01:14:13,304 --> 01:14:14,899
They want what we have to give them..

1063
01:14:15,304 --> 01:14:16,759
But they also wanna, you know,

1064
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,660
play innocent and pretend
they have no idea where it came from.

1065
01:14:19,744 --> 01:14:22,398
That's more hypocracy than I'm willing
to swallow, so, fuck -em.

1066
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:24,018
Fuck normal people!

1067
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,379
You know, the funny thing is.
Tomorrow, if all of this goes tits up.

1068
01:14:28,526 --> 01:14:31,144
They're gonna crucify us.
For being, too reckless.

1069
01:14:31,845 --> 01:14:32,859
But if we are wrong...

1070
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:35,159
and everything gets back on track.

1071
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:38,778
Well then, the same people gonna laugh
until they piss their pants.

1072
01:14:38,785 --> 01:14:41,697
'Cause, we're gonna look like the biggest
pussies, God ever let through the door.

1073
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,737
You think we're gonna be wrong?

1074
01:14:50,325 --> 01:14:51,718
Nah, there all fucked.

1075
01:15:07,184 --> 01:15:08,118
Good morning.

1076
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:09,998
Peter...

1077
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:11,599
you want one?

1078
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:13,803
I don't smoke.

1079
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:15,799
Well, that's good.
I don't much either.

1080
01:15:28,285 --> 01:15:29,220
You tired?

1081
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:31,519
Of what?

1082
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:33,283
Remember,
I don't work as hard as you do.

1083
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:35,885
- Oh, that's not true.
- No it is, actually.

1084
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:42,299
- We're all getting fired tonight?
- Probably.

1085
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:45,119
They gonna fire you?

1086
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:48,080
Well, they won't exactly call it that.

1087
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:53,460
It'll be a mercy killing really.
You don't have to stand out here for me.

1088
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:58,740
No, I know. I really don't wanna
go back in there, just yet.

1089
01:15:59,826 --> 01:16:01,019
I understand that.

1090
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:04,700
I think I know your son.

1091
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:06,578
Really?

1092
01:16:06,985 --> 01:16:09,339
Not well but, he always seemed
like a nice person.

1093
01:16:10,706 --> 01:16:11,979
He is a nice person.

1094
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:14,739
I guess you could say
worse things about a guy.

1095
01:16:16,646 --> 01:16:17,940
Does he know what's about to happen?

1096
01:16:19,504 --> 01:16:20,400
What do you mean?

1097
01:16:22,046 --> 01:16:23,147
Did you talk to him?

1098
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:26,619
No, I hadn't even thought of it.

1099
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,404
Ah...

1100
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:35,539
They're all coming in now.

1101
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:38,041
Yes they are.

1102
01:16:43,205 --> 01:16:44,760
You ever done anything like this?

1103
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:48,680
No, never, not even close.

1104
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:52,481
- No.
- Yeah.

1105
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:58,340
Are you sure it's the...
the only...

1106
01:16:59,826 --> 01:17:01,120
or the right thing to do?

1107
01:17:04,826 --> 01:17:05,780
For who?

1108
01:17:08,686 --> 01:17:09,621
I'm not sure.

1109
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:11,860
Neither am I.

1110
01:17:45,287 --> 01:17:46,487
Oh, no...

1111
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:52,901
You alright?

1112
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:56,800
You're about to fire me.

1113
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:16,641
You know, this is...
this is all I ever wanted to do.

1114
01:19:23,267 --> 01:19:24,361
Really?

1115
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,387
They're almost ready for you,
Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.

1116
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:00,267
You as well, huh?

1117
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:01,922
Yes.

1118
01:20:02,808 --> 01:20:04,421
- Jesus!
- I know.

1119
01:20:06,692 --> 01:20:08,787
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1120
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:25,121
I didn't think they were really
be able to get you back here.

1121
01:20:28,688 --> 01:20:30,941
They told me they were gonna
drag me through hell on everything...

1122
01:20:30,987 --> 01:20:33,502
in the next two years...
my options, my healthcare...

1123
01:20:34,628 --> 01:20:36,242
or I could come back here and make...

1124
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,822
uh... 176 thousand...
4 hundred and 71 dollars an hour...

1125
01:20:41,867 --> 01:20:43,344
to sit quietly in this room.

1126
01:20:45,688 --> 01:20:47,043
I couldn't see that much of a choice.

1127
01:20:48,568 --> 01:20:49,821
It never is.

1128
01:20:54,367 --> 01:20:55,861
Obviously looking back,

1129
01:20:56,006 --> 01:21:00,702
it was expressed with...
insufficient urgency.

1130
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:03,722
But your point was passed on.

1131
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:05,203
I need you to know that.

1132
01:21:06,348 --> 01:21:07,286
Eric.

1133
01:21:07,287 --> 01:21:10,467
Its okay, I understand, believe me.

1134
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:12,223
There's nothing else
you could've done.

1135
01:21:13,209 --> 01:21:14,243
I guess.

1136
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,823
At the time it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

1137
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:22,342
It never does.

1138
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,588
You have kids, yeah?

1139
01:21:35,589 --> 01:21:36,489
Mh-hm.

1140
01:21:44,389 --> 01:21:46,443
So, uh... what's your package
gonna be like?

1141
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,022
I don't know,
that's what I'm waiting for now.

1142
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:54,063
Probably gonna be pretty good.

1143
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:57,422
It better be.

1144
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:15,102
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning.

1145
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:17,546
I know yesterday was pretty bad...

1146
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:19,546
and I wish I could say
that today is gonna be less so,

1147
01:22:19,547 --> 01:22:20,842
but that isn't gonna be the case.

1148
01:22:21,889 --> 01:22:23,848
Now, I'm supposed to read
this statement to you all here,

1149
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:25,244
but why don't you just read it
on your own time...

1150
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:26,845
and I'll just tell you
what the fuck's going on here.

1151
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:30,282
I've been here all night...

1152
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,104
meeting with the executive committee.

1153
01:22:33,969 --> 01:22:35,203
And the decision has been made...

1154
01:22:35,204 --> 01:22:37,804
to unwind a considerable portion
of the firm's holdings...

1155
01:22:37,805 --> 01:22:39,805
in several key asset classes.

1156
01:22:43,068 --> 01:22:45,784
The crux of it is...
in the firm's thinking.

1157
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:48,243
The party is over as of this morning.

1158
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:51,703
There's gonna be considerable
turmoil in the markets...

1159
01:22:51,704 --> 01:22:52,904
for the foreseeable future.

1160
01:22:54,029 --> 01:22:59,383
And they believe... it is better,
that this turmoil... begin with us.

1161
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:01,543
As a result...

1162
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:04,064
the firm has decided to liquidate...

1163
01:23:04,928 --> 01:23:07,644
its majority positions
of fixed income MBS...

1164
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:09,404
today.

1165
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:11,964
These are your packets.

1166
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:15,583
You will see what accounts
you're responsible for... today.

1167
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:19,203
I'm sure
it hasn't taken you long to...

1168
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:22,922
understand the implications
of this sale.

1169
01:23:23,469 --> 01:23:26,122
On your relationships with your
counter-parties and as a result...

1170
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,549
on your careers.

1171
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,083
I have expressed this...

1172
01:23:31,889 --> 01:23:32,784
reality...

1173
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,490
to the executive committee
and they understand.

1174
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:36,789
As a result,

1175
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:40,464
if you achieve a 93% sale
of your assets...

1176
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:45,803
you will receive
a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

1177
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,383
If the floor as a whole...

1178
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:55,624
achieves a 93% sale you will get an
additional 1.3 million dollars a piece.

1179
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:59,082
For those of you who've never been
through this before,

1180
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,204
this is what the beginning
of a fire sale looks like.

1181
01:24:02,588 --> 01:24:06,128
I cannot begin to tell you how important
the first hour and half is gonna be.

1182
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:08,490
I want you to hit
every bite you can find.

1183
01:24:08,691 --> 01:24:10,424
Dealers, brokers, clients...

1184
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:12,424
your mother, if she's buying.

1185
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,863
And... no swaps.

1186
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,843
It's outgoing only, today.

1187
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:24,164
Obviously, this isn't going down the way
that any of us would've hoped, but...

1188
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:28,069
the ground is shifting below our feet.

1189
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:31,184
And apparently,
there's no other way out.

1190
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:56,124
Christ... this is obviously a very,
very unique situation.

1191
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:58,744
If we are successful today...

1192
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,823
We will have been successful
in destroying our own jobs.

1193
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:06,364
I can not promise,
that any of you, all of you...

1194
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:10,424
some of you
would be repositioned within the firm.

1195
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:16,303
But I can tell you, that I'm very proud
of the work we have done here today.

1196
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:20,646
I've been in this place...

1197
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,304
34 years.

1198
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,650
And I can tell you from experience,

1199
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:27,851
that people are gonna say
some very nasty things...

1200
01:25:27,852 --> 01:25:29,052
about what we do here today.

1201
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:32,244
And about what you've dedicated
a portion of your lives to.

1202
01:25:34,051 --> 01:25:38,785
But...
have faith that in the bigger picture,

1203
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,844
our skills have not been wasted.

1204
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:42,924
We have accomplished much...

1205
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,602
and our talents...

1206
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:46,523
have been used...

1207
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:49,924
for the greater good.

1208
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:52,984
Here's your packets, get to work.

1209
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,371
- City... this is Eric.
- Give me Elliott.

1210
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:32,566
- City.
- Hey, it's Will Emerson.

1211
01:26:32,713 --> 01:26:34,190
William, how are you?
- I'm alright,

1212
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:36,491
- how's the trouble at scribes?
- Busting my ass, as always.

1213
01:26:36,511 --> 01:26:37,670
You see,
that's what I try to tell you.

1214
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:38,970
John, why do you thing I'm single?

1215
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:39,871
I know you did.

1216
01:26:40,072 --> 01:26:40,931
What can I do for you?

1217
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:42,709
Listen,
I just got a tap on my shoulder,

1218
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:44,689
we've got some risk over here,
we need to move.

1219
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,790
So, today looks like
my loss is your gain.

1220
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:48,208
What kinda size you're talking about?

1221
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:50,091
Should be on your screen,
I just sent it.

1222
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:53,245
- Jesus, where's this laying?
- 96 on a dollar.

1223
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:55,185
- 91?
- Hold three we're done at 94.

1224
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,625
- 93 and a half?
- Done!

1225
01:26:59,031 --> 01:27:00,866
- This is trading?
- Hello, gorgeous.

1226
01:27:00,973 --> 01:27:03,890
- Will, what's happening over there?
- Well, today's moving day.

1227
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,630
What's the fuck are you guys
so worked up about?

1228
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,330
You think they tell me anything,
all I know is...

1229
01:27:07,331 --> 01:27:10,410
that today, my loss is your gain.
Now, you're friendly...

1230
01:27:10,411 --> 01:27:12,931
so, I'm coming to you first.
I got two seventy mill...

1231
01:27:12,932 --> 01:27:15,451
at fifteen a year,
paying at a twenty half a part.

1232
01:27:15,452 --> 01:27:17,770
- Where's it from?
- Where's it from? Do you care?

1233
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:20,751
No, not really.
Now, where's the trade?

1234
01:27:21,052 --> 01:27:23,711
- I'm hearing, that you guys...
- Elexus, I'm only sharing this...

1235
01:27:23,712 --> 01:27:25,230
with you, right now!

1236
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:28,910
- 85...
- Done.

1237
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:31,931
Deutsche?

1238
01:27:31,932 --> 01:27:33,311
It's Will Emerson.

1239
01:27:33,312 --> 01:27:34,990
Fuck you, you lying bastard.

1240
01:27:34,991 --> 01:27:36,591
Come on,
you're still angry about that?

1241
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:38,250
Word's out, I'm hanging up.

1242
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:41,470
- Merryll?
- Lawrence.

1243
01:27:41,671 --> 01:27:43,589
What the fuck,
are you guys doing over there?

1244
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,952
- Just a little spring cleaning.
- That is not what I'm hearing.

1245
01:27:45,953 --> 01:27:49,346
- Alright, Lawrence, are you a buyer?
- I'm not sure anymore. Where at?

1246
01:27:49,372 --> 01:27:51,127
Well, it sounds like
I should be asking 'Where at'.

1247
01:27:51,128 --> 01:27:52,328
What have we got

1248
01:27:52,353 --> 01:27:55,465
375 mill, at third eight mixed.
- Fuck me..

1249
01:27:55,552 --> 01:27:56,832
You with me on this?

1250
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:59,951
- 63 cents?
- Oh, fuck you, I'm hanging up.

1251
01:28:00,052 --> 01:28:01,211
Sixty three.

1252
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:04,111
Let it go, my man.
I'll come back to you at five.

1253
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,506
Maybe, fifty five and five.

1254
01:28:06,271 --> 01:28:08,145
Well, alright then, stay on the line.

1255
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:10,225
Sam, pick up the phone.

1256
01:28:11,272 --> 01:28:12,691
Sam, get on the line!

1257
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:15,270
- Yeah, I got Lawrence in now.
- Where are we?

1258
01:28:15,271 --> 01:28:17,405
- Sixty three six.
- Jesus, and what?

1259
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:19,106
Tree seventy five and next up.

1260
01:28:19,273 --> 01:28:20,886
Get me sixty five and hit it.

1261
01:28:20,973 --> 01:28:22,606
Are you fucking kidding me on this?

1262
01:28:22,913 --> 01:28:26,032
What is that? That's a 131 million
dollar loss on a single trade.

1263
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:28,450
I understand...
hit it.

1264
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:32,031
Hey, Lawrence.
We'll fill a kill at sixty five.

1265
01:28:32,832 --> 01:28:33,845
It's filled.

1266
01:28:56,393 --> 01:28:57,327
Well done.

1267
01:29:04,391 --> 01:29:05,526
I just wanna give you heads up.

1268
01:29:05,527 --> 01:29:08,127
I know, they're gonna start sending
a few people home now.

1269
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:13,965
- Now?
- Yes, I know this ends.

1270
01:29:20,632 --> 01:29:21,632
Of course.

1271
01:29:23,033 --> 01:29:27,133
Hey, for what it's worth, uh...
you're still good.

1272
01:29:30,434 --> 01:29:33,834
Yeah. I guess, I'm going upstairs
for the lightshow.

1273
01:30:25,932 --> 01:30:26,832
Sam!...

1274
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,186
Please sit.

1275
01:30:29,812 --> 01:30:31,566
Congratulations are clearly in order.

1276
01:30:32,933 --> 01:30:34,166
We did the best we could.

1277
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:37,166
You did a hell of a job.

1278
01:30:37,513 --> 01:30:39,067
And I thank you for it.
Come on sit.

1279
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:41,607
Excuse me for eating, but...

1280
01:30:43,474 --> 01:30:44,687
it's been a long day.

1281
01:30:45,234 --> 01:30:47,228
- Can I get you something?
- No, nothing, Thanks.

1282
01:30:51,353 --> 01:30:53,826
- So, what can I do for you?
- I want out.

1283
01:30:56,173 --> 01:30:57,367
I'm done, I want out.

1284
01:31:00,173 --> 01:31:02,767
- It's a very difficult day for all...
- I need you to release my options,

1285
01:31:02,813 --> 01:31:05,612
if they're worth anything today,
I want my bonus, I'm out.

1286
01:31:05,613 --> 01:31:07,267
You'll get your bonus, your options...

1287
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:08,306
and keep a calm face.

1288
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:11,107
But I need you to stay with me
for next 24 months, okay?

1289
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:20,447
And... you did some good today,
you said that yourself.

1290
01:31:21,455 --> 01:31:22,568
You know...

1291
01:31:22,654 --> 01:31:25,268
I'm starting to feel a little better
about this whole thing.

1292
01:31:26,693 --> 01:31:29,367
You're one of the luckiest guys
in the world, Sam.

1293
01:31:29,394 --> 01:31:31,227
You could've been digging ditches
all this years.

1294
01:31:32,538 --> 01:31:33,533
That's true.

1295
01:31:33,834 --> 01:31:37,127
And if I had, at least there be
some holes in the ground to show for it.

1296
01:31:39,854 --> 01:31:43,347
I just don't know how we fuck this up,
quite so much?

1297
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:50,207
When did you start feeling so sorry
for yourself, it's unbearable.

1298
01:31:50,508 --> 01:31:51,408
I'm not.

1299
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:54,311
So, you think we might've put
a few people out of business today.

1300
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:56,407
It's all for naught.

1301
01:31:57,613 --> 01:32:01,588
But you've been doing that,
everyday, for almost 40 years, Sam.

1302
01:32:02,493 --> 01:32:06,007
And this is all for naught, and...
so is everything out there.

1303
01:32:09,114 --> 01:32:10,548
Its just money.

1304
01:32:11,454 --> 01:32:12,468
It's made up.

1305
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:16,290
Pieces of paper with pictures on it.
So, we don't have to...

1306
01:32:16,415 --> 01:32:18,129
kill each other,
just to get something to eat.

1307
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:20,853
It's not wrong.

1308
01:32:21,554 --> 01:32:23,747
And certainly not different today,
then it's ever been.

1309
01:32:26,093 --> 01:32:31,307
1637, 1797, 1819, 37... 57

1310
01:32:32,053 --> 01:32:33,189
84,

1311
01:32:34,835 --> 01:32:36,629
1901, 07...

1312
01:32:37,215 --> 01:32:40,208
29, 1937... 1974...

1313
01:32:40,995 --> 01:32:43,628
1987, Jesus!
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1314
01:32:43,996 --> 01:32:46,768
92, 97, 2000...
whatever we wanna call this.

1315
01:32:46,935 --> 01:32:50,089
It's all just for same thing,
over and over... we can't help ourselves.

1316
01:32:51,593 --> 01:32:52,849
And you can I can't...

1317
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:57,788
control it, or...
stop it, or even slow it.

1318
01:32:57,789 --> 01:32:59,889
We even haven't it slightly altered.

1319
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:02,008
We just react.

1320
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:04,828
We make a lot of money,
if we get it right.

1321
01:33:05,515 --> 01:33:07,708
And we get left by the side of road,
if we get it wrong.

1322
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:10,193
And there has always been,
and always will be,

1323
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:11,693
the same percentage
of winners and losers...

1324
01:33:11,694 --> 01:33:12,989
happy fucks and sad sacks.

1325
01:33:13,376 --> 01:33:15,389
Fat cats and starving dogs,
in this world.

1326
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:18,893
Yeah...

1327
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:22,728
then maybe more of us today,
than there ever been...

1328
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,408
but... the percentage is,

1329
01:33:25,215 --> 01:33:26,948
they stay exactly the same.

1330
01:33:45,395 --> 01:33:47,609
I'll do it John,
not but because of the little speech,

1331
01:33:49,136 --> 01:33:50,609
but because I need the money.

1332
01:33:52,514 --> 01:33:57,309
Hard to believe, after all this years..
But I... I need the money.

1333
01:34:08,054 --> 01:34:09,229
You gonna keep the kid?

1334
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:13,529
Keep him?
He's getting promoted.

1335
01:34:14,494 --> 01:34:16,068
It's all hands on deck now, Sam.

1336
01:34:16,395 --> 01:34:18,814
There's gonna be a lot of money
to be made, coming outta this mess.

1337
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:21,149
And they're gonna need all the brains,
we can get around here.

1338
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:44,050
Hello?

1339
01:35:45,551 --> 01:35:48,151
- I called the police.
- Mary...

1340
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:50,852
- Sam.
- Yeah.

1341
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:54,453
What're you doing?

1342
01:36:10,354 --> 01:36:12,354
Sam, what are you doing?

1343
01:36:14,255 --> 01:36:15,355
Stella died.

1344
01:36:40,275 --> 01:36:43,329
I was carrying her home from the vet
and I couldn't think of where else to go.

1345
01:36:46,076 --> 01:36:47,250
She belongs here.

1346
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,316
I know,

1347
01:36:48,717 --> 01:36:51,310
but Sam you don't live here anymore.

1348
01:36:56,877 --> 01:37:00,930
Are you alright?
You don't look so good.

1349
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:05,031
Yeah, it's been a rough day
all the way around.

1350
01:37:05,356 --> 01:37:06,775
I know, Sammy called.

1351
01:37:07,676 --> 01:37:08,571
Is he alright?

1352
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:09,615
They got hammered,

1353
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:11,414
but, they got out alive.

1354
01:37:11,615 --> 01:37:12,510
Good.

1355
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,816
Well, I'm gonna go back inside and...

1356
01:37:24,517 --> 01:37:25,850
go back to bed.

1357
01:37:27,297 --> 01:37:29,991
The alarm is on
so don't try to break in.

1358
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:40,090
Take care of yourself.

00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,880
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully...

367
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,382
Abraham Lincoln.''

368
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:00,566
That boy is alive.

369
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,231
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

370
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:08,412
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

371
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,472
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,261
We expected 32 tanks
on the beach.

373
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,422
27 didn't make it.

374
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:27,760
Miller, Charlie Company.

375
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:28,924
Go on in, Captain.

376
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,433
I understand
your situation,

377
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,936
but if we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

378
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,767
we're gonna have
an entire division

379
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,774
stuck at Carentan with
its pants around its ankles.

380
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,776
Well, you let me know.

381
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,778
Have Charlie Company
hold at Vierville

382
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,939
until we can get
some armor up there.

383
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:45,778
Yes, sir.
Runner!

384
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,751
[Truck lgnition Grinding]

385
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,284
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door

386
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,791
for the rest of us.

387
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:55,951
lnstead they misdropped,

388
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,460
scattered all their
sticks into the wind.

389
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,621
What's your situation?

390
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:01,290
Uh, yes, sir.
Sector 4 is secure.

391
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,300
We, uh...

392
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,700
we took out towed 88s

393
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,795
here, here...

394
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:08,964
and here.

395
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,803
They'd already gotten
4 of our Shermans

396
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,308
and a number of our
deuce-and-a-halves.

397
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,811
These 2 minefields
are actually one big one.

398
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,813
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

399
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:19,315
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field--

400
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:20,817
little bit of everything.

401
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,477
Sprengmine 44s,
Schumine 42s,

402
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,818
pot mines, A-200s--
the little wooden bastards

403
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:27,824
that the mine detectors
don't pick up.

404
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:29,826
This road here...

405
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:31,828
they placed big mushrooms--
Teller mine 43s,

406
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,488
I guess for our tanks--

407
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:35,999
from here right up
to the edge of the village,

408
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:37,329
right here.

409
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,336
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

410
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:40,666
Resistance?

411
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,831
We had higher support
expectations, sir.

412
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,341
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

413
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,846
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

414
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,676
We ended up
with 23 prisoners.

415
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,012
We turned them over
to M.P.s from the 29th.

416
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,688
What about our casualties?

417
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,054
Well...

418
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,854
the figures...

419
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,361
were 35 dead...

420
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,692
times 2 wounded.

421
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,197
They just...

422
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,530
didn't wanna give up
those 88s.

423
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,871
lt was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

424
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,372
Yes, sir.

425
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:18,871
John...

426
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:23,705
I've got another one
for you.

427
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:24,873
Yes, sir.

428
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,144
This one's straight
from the top.

429
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:33,256
Miller:
I wish.

430
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,417
You and I are taking
a squad over to Neuville

431
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:37,757
on a public relations mission.

432
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,763
Horvath:
You leading a squad?

433
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:42,925
Some private in the 101st
lost 3 brothers,

434
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,593
and he's got a ticket home.

435
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:46,102
How come Neuville?

436
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,762
They think he's up there
somewhere,

437
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,773
part of all
those airborne misdrops.

438
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,274
It's not gonna be easy

439
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:52,775
finding one
particular soldier

440
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,277
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

441
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:56,279
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

442
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,939
But what about
the company?

443
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,779
We take the pick
of the litter,

444
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:01,785
and the rest get folded
into Baker.

445
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,286
Jesus Christ.

446
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:05,618
They took away
your company?

447
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,954
lt wasn't my company,
it was the army's.

448
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,960
So they told me, anyway.

449
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,461
Give me Reiben on B.A.R.,

450
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,793
Jackson, Wade, Beasley
and Caparzo.

451
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,457
Beasley's dead.

452
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,125
All right.
Mellish then.

453
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:18,634
We got anybody speaks French?

454
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,295
Not that I know of.

455
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,634
What about Talbot?

456
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:23,639
This morning.

457
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,640
Oh.

458
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:25,801
All right.

459
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:27,811
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

460
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,313
Assemble at Battalion
Motor Pool on the beach.

461
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:31,313
Yes, sir.

462
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:32,815
What are we gonna do?

463
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:33,816
Listen up-- What?

464
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:34,977
What we gonna do?

465
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,486
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

466
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,146
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo.

467
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,156
I thought you liked it
in the ass.

468
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:41,350
What?

469
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:43,394
Attention!

470
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:44,894
As you were.

471
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:46,725
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham...

472
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,730
Timothy E.

473
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,788
I'm Upham, sir.

474
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,561
I understand you speak
French and German.

475
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:51,567
Yes, sir.

476
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:52,728
How's your accent?

477
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:54,237
Just a slight one
in French,

478
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,738
but my German's clean.
A touch of Bavarian, sir.

479
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,240
Very good. You've
been reassigned to me.

480
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:58,400
Grab your gear.

481
00:39:58,476 --> 00:39:59,670
We're going to a place
called Neuville.

482
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,676
Yes, sir.

483
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:01,803
When was this updated?

484
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,244
Updated as of 0830
this morning.

485
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:04,338
Uh, sir...

486
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:05,905
this is
the 12th S.S. Panzer.

487
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,746
These are the 2 axis
that advance south.

488
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,252
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

489
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,753
That's what I understand,
Corporal.

490
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,255
Um, sir,

491
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,257
there are a lot of Germans
in Neuville.

492
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,758
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

493
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:16,919
No, sir.

494
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,757
Just if you consider
I've never been in combat.

495
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,263
I make maps,
and I translate.

496
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,265
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

497
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:23,265
Yes, sir.

498
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,767
My 2 guys were killed.

499
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,269
It's just that
I haven't held a weapon

500
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,770
since basic training, sir.

501
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,773
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

502
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:30,933
Yes, sir.

503
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,771
Well, then get your gear.

504
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:33,776
Yes, sir.

505
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,177
Sir, may I br--

506
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,786
May I bring
my typewriter, sir?

507
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,789
Yes, sir.

508
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,798
Thank you very much, sir.

509
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:56,299
That a souvenir?

510
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,629
Uh, no, sir.

511
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,465
Take your time, Corporal.

512
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,137
You should look

513
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:06,801
on the bright side
of things, Corporal.

514
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:07,810
Yes, sir.

515
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,141
For one thing...

516
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:11,647
you don't need
to carry those.

517
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,149
You'll need that.

518
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:14,809
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that.

519
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:06,067
[Sheep Bleating]

520
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:12,841
Hey.

521
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,172
Oh. Hey.

522
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:16,179
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

523
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:17,680
Don't you ever
fuckin' touch me

524
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:19,181
with those little
rat claws again.

525
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,683
Get the fuck back
in formation.

526
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,345
I was wondering
where you're from,

527
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:25,354
that's--

528
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,194
Caparzo, is it?

529
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:33,855
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

530
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,023
Got you.

531
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,191
And another thing,

532
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,700
every time you salute
the captain,

533
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,702
you make him a target
for the Germans.

534
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,203
Do us a favor.
Don't do it.

535
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,206
Especially when
I'm standing next to him,

536
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:44,206
capisci?

537
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,207
Uh, capisci.

538
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,868
Corporal,
what's your book about?

539
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:48,036
Hey, watch your rifle.

540
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:49,238
Sorry.

541
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:51,213
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

542
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:54,217
that develop between
soldiers during war.

543
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:55,217
Brotherhood?

544
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:56,719
[Laughter]

545
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:58,220
What do you know

01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:47,343
Yeah, well, he could
walk faster on his hands.

1087
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,947
He could run faster
on his hands than...

1088
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:57,288
Vecchio.

1089
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,793
Yeah.

1090
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,797
Caparzo.

1091
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:09,099
You see, when...

1092
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:14,266
when you end up killing
one of your men, you see,

1093
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:17,438
you tell yourself
it happened

1094
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:21,609
so you could save
the lives of 2 or 3

1095
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:24,619
or 10 others.

1096
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:26,780
Maybe a hundred others.

1097
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:34,058
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

1098
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,062
How many?

1099
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:37,395
94.

1100
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:41,164
But that means
I've saved the lives

1101
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:43,467
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

1102
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:46,531
Maybe even 20, right?

1103
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,042
20 times as many?

1104
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,048
And that's
how simple it is.

1105
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,315
That's how you...

1106
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:00,583
That's how you

1107
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:02,521
rationalize
making the choice

1108
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,720
between the mission
and the men.

1109
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:08,730
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

1110
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:14,501
This Ryan
better be worth it.

1111
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,508
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

1112
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:24,706
or invent a longer-lasting
lightbulb or something.

1113
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:26,578
'Cause the truth is,
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

1114
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:29,482
for one Vecchio
or one Caparzo.

1115
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,520
Amen.

1116
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:32,554
[Grunts]

1117
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:35,648
Look.
There it goes again.

1118
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:37,158
Sir...

1119
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:40,195
are you all right?

1120
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,535
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in 2 hours.

1121
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:49,468
Why don't you
get some sleep?

1122
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:52,269
Reiben: I don't know
how he does it.

1123
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,433
Mellish: What's that?

1124
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:54,771
Falls asleep like that.

1125
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,175
I mean, look at him.

1126
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:59,339
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

1127
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:00,746
Clear conscience.

1128
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:03,411
Yeah, what's that saying?
''lf God's on our side,

1129
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,420
who the hell could
be on theirs?''

1130
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,685
''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''

1131
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:10,248
Yeah, what did I say?

1132
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:11,486
Wade: Well, actually,

1133
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:15,258
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

1134
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:17,231
Mellish:
How is that, Wade?

1135
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,097
Wade: Well, when my
mother was an intern,

1136
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:22,331
she used to work late
through the night,

1137
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:23,929
sleep through the day.

1138
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:25,371
So the only time

1139
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:26,669
that we ever got
to talk about anything

1140
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,232
was when she'd get home.

1141
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:30,905
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

1142
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,345
and try to stay awake
as long as I could,

1143
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:36,351
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

1144
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:38,250
the faster
I'd fall asleep.

1145
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:41,586
Yeah, well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

1146
01:09:41,657 --> 01:09:44,023
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

1147
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:46,618
chatted me up till dawn.

1148
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:48,891
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

1149
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:50,899
Yeah, that's probably
the only time

1150
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,834
she could get a word in.

1151
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:57,335
Funny thing is,

1152
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:00,500
sometimes she'd
come home early,

1153
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:03,067
and I'd pretend
to be asleep.

1154
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:05,943
Mellish: Who?
Your-- Your mom?

1155
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:07,107
Yeah.

1156
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:11,713
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

1157
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:15,816
And I would just
keep my eyes shut.

1158
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:22,154
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

1159
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:24,028
that she came home early...

1160
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:29,099
just to talk to me.

1161
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:32,499
And I still wouldn't move.

1162
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:35,135
I'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

1163
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:45,049
I don't know why I did that.

1164
01:10:58,601 --> 01:10:59,932
Miller:
We only got a couple hours.

1165
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,936
Shut up and go to sleep.

1166
01:11:11,013 --> 01:11:12,674
Captain?

1167
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,477
Upham: Sir?

1168
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:17,349
Corporal?

1169
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,025
How you doin' there?
You all right?

1170
01:11:25,094 --> 01:11:30,225
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

1171
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:32,597
Really?

1172
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:33,828
How is that?

1173
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,570
''War educates
the senses,

1174
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:42,634
calls into action
the will,

1175
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:45,806
perfects the physical
constitution,

1176
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:48,816
brings men into such
swift and close collision

1177
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:52,320
in critical moments
that man measures man.''

1178
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:55,653
Yeah, well, I guess
that's Emerson's way of...

1179
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:57,215
finding the bright side.

1180
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,784
You know Emerson, sir?

1181
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,523
I know some.

1182
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:07,768
So where are you from,
Captain?

1183
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:09,930
What'd you do
before the war?

1184
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:13,442
What's the pool up to?

1185
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,045
You know, I think
it's around 300, sir.

1186
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:23,483
Well,
when it gets up to 500,

1187
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,952
I'll give you the answers
and we'll split the money.

1188
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:27,956
How about that?

1189
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:29,753
Well, if that's
the way you feel, sir,

1190
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:31,816
I feel it's my duty
under your command

1191
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,225
to suggest that we wait

1192
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,889
until it gets up
to a thousand, sir.

1193
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:40,131
What if we don't
live that long?

1194
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:43,929
500?

1195
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:46,497
500 would be good,
yeah.

1196
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:47,542
Yes, sir.

1197
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:48,907
Yeah.

1198
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:52,840
Get some sleep,
Corporal.

1199
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:54,075
Yes, sir.

1200
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:01,974
Soldier:
Who's got sulfa powder?

1201
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:07,555
Soldier: Medic!
My buddy's bleeding!

1202
01:14:07,623 --> 01:14:09,056
He needs a tourniquet!

1203
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,057
Wade.

1204
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:11,150
Wade: Yes, sir?

1205
01:14:11,227 --> 01:14:12,558
See what you can do.

1206
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:13,560
Yes, sir.

1207
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:14,721
Hold on, fellas.

1208
01:14:14,797 --> 01:14:16,264
lt won't be
much longer.

1209
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:17,765
How we doing here?

1210
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:20,365
All right.

1211
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:22,904
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

1212
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:24,940
Doc's in town.

1213
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,338
Jackson: It's all right.
It's all right.

1214
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:27,841
Don't worry, fellas.

1215
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,138
The 29th lnfantry's
breaking through.

1216
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:30,337
They'll be here soon.

1217
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:32,880
Soldier: Plasma.
Anybody got plasma?

1218
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:34,973
Captain.
Hey, Captain.

1219
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,711
Soldier,
you want to fill me in?

1220
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:38,754
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant Dewindt, sir.

1221
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:40,083
99th Troop Carrier Squadron

1222
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:42,681
carrying in
327th Glider lnfantry.

1223
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:44,191
This one was mine, sir.

1224
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,591
I was the pilot.

1225
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:46,650
22 men dead.

1226
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:48,663
I ended up over there
without a scratch.

1227
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:50,028
lt took my copilot's head
right off.

1228
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,964
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

1229
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,899
Well, the guys
we came in with, sir,

1230
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,369
they headed off first night.
Haven't seen them since.

1231
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,633
Meantime, other guys
keep showing up,

1232
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,470
1, 2, half-dozen
at a time.

1233
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:03,512
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

1234
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:06,013
head off to make trouble, sir.

1235
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:07,981
We're looking for
a Private James Ryan.

1236
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,348
He was in Baker Company
5-0-6 of the 101st.

1237
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:11,647
No, you got me, sir.

1238
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,085
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

1239
01:15:13,155 --> 01:15:14,281
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1240
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:17,291
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

1241
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,190
Yes, sir.

1242
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:20,353
Reiben.

1243
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:22,624
Smell that leg
right there.

1244
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:24,757
Find out if it's
south of cheese.

1245
01:15:29,772 --> 01:15:31,069
[Sniffs]
Phew.

1246
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,198
Wade: What?

1247
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:35,071
Juden.

1248
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:37,811
Juden.

1249
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,246
Soldier: Keep moving.
Keep moving!

1250
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:41,874
Juden.

1251
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,249
I'm Juden,
you know?

1252
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,584
Ju-den.

1253
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:48,247
Yeah, I couldn't
pry him out of there

1254
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,757
hard as I tried.

1255
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:51,087
I'd need a winch.

1256
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,149
Horvath: Yeah.

1257
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:56,655
Horvath: Stars.

1258
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:59,963
Yep,
Brigadier General Amend,

1259
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:02,697
deputy commander, 101st.

1260
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:05,296
Some fucking genius
had the great idea

1261
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:06,807
of welding a couple
of steel plates

1262
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,844
onto our deck to keep
the general safe

1263
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:10,310
from ground fire.

1264
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:12,074
Unfortunately, they forgot
to tell me about it

1265
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:14,308
until we were just
getting airborne.

1266
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:16,408
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train.

1267
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:17,747
OK?

1268
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,082
Gross overload.

1269
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:21,918
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

1270
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:24,983
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

1271
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,255
And when--
And when we released,

1272
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:29,490
you know, I cut
as hard as I could,

1273
01:16:29,565 --> 01:16:31,089
tried to gain
some altitude

1274
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:33,100
and still keep her
from stalling.

1275
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:35,159
We came down
like a fucking meteor.

1276
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:38,070
And this is how
we ended up.

1277
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,199
And the others,

1278
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:42,904
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

1279
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:45,708
We were just--
We were just too damn heavy,

1280
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:46,941
you know?

1281
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:49,280
The grass was wet.

1282
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:51,785
Downward slope and all.

1283
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:54,618
22 guys dead.

1284
01:16:56,725 --> 01:16:58,625
All that for a general?

1285
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:00,855
One man.

1286
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:04,225
Lot of that going around.

1287
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,858
FUBAR.

1288
01:17:05,935 --> 01:17:07,300
FUBAR.

1289
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:08,734
FUBAR.

1290
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:10,135
FUBAR.

1291
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:12,332
Y'all got that right.

1292
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:15,070
I looked up ''FUBAR'' in
the German dictionary.

1293
01:17:15,144 --> 01:17:16,736
There's no ''FUBAR''
in there.

1294
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:17,836
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1295
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:19,403
There's more paratroops
out there.

1296
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:20,607
Find out
if one of them's Ryan.

1297
01:17:20,683 --> 01:17:21,707
Yes, sir.

1298
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:24,844
Oh, you might want to
check these out, sir.

1299
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,683
Dog tags.

1300
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:29,349
More than I really
want to count, sir.

1301
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:33,484
I've-- I've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

1302
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:35,621
Miller: Jackson...

1303
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:37,256
start going
through those.

1304
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:38,391
Yes, sir.

1305
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:41,702
I'll help.

1306
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:44,797
What do you think,
Jackson?

1307
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:46,067
Do you think that
little prick's in there?

1308
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,075
Well, if he is,
I'm gonna find him.

1309
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:49,440
I bet that
son of a bitch is.

1310
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:51,069
Reiben: I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

1311
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:53,376
Mellish: 10 bucks
says I nail him first.

1312
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:54,939
Let's see
who we got in here.

1313
01:17:55,017 --> 01:17:56,348
You mugs don't
stand a chance.

1314
01:17:56,418 --> 01:17:58,147
All right, you think this little
shit bird's in here or what?

1315
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,017
Just keep looking.

1316
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:02,523
All right.
Gary lanico.

1317
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:03,956
Ben Rubino.
Mike Cessacchio.

1318
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:06,221
I swear, all the guineas
are buying it, huh?

1319
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:08,627
Mellish: Oh, come on,
not the right name.

1320
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:10,892
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

1321
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:13,161
Reiben:
We gotta find this prick.

1322
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:19,805
Where is
this son of a bitch?

1323
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,536
Don't mix them up,
Jackson, all right?

1324
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,577
Keep them in your
own fucking pile.

1325
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:25,010
How am I supposed
to know who we got?

1326
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,878
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

1327
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,212
Mellish:
Everybody be friends.

1328
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:30,911
Reiben:
Cranky there, huh?

1329
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:33,618
I think
I got a winner.

1330
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,179
What are you
talking about?

1331
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:36,724
Ryan.

1332
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:37,816
Ryan?

1333
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:39,793
Take a look at that,
Mellish.

1334
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:41,489
You know what? You're a genius.
You really are.

1335
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:43,394
R-l-E-N-N-E.

1336
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:45,399
That's Rienne.
And that's French, all right?

1337
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,934
You know what that means?

1338
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:48,264
Jackson:
It's means nothing.

1339
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:49,736
Mellish:
What beats 3 of a kind?

1340
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:51,170
Jackson:
I got shit here.

1341
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,730
I got all guys
from New York.

1342
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:54,241
Reiben: Do you need
a hand with that?

1343
01:18:54,309 --> 01:18:55,742
Mellish: Ah,
I got a full house.

1344
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:57,836
Reiben: Got you beat.
Straight flush.

1345
01:18:57,913 --> 01:18:59,881
You were looking
at my tags.

1346
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,245
You're cheating.
You know?

1347
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:02,408
Ryan.

1348
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:04,145
Reiben: Fuckin' unreal,
this guy.

1349
01:19:04,219 --> 01:19:05,618
Do you need a hand
with that?

1350
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:06,949
Can you read that shit?

1351
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:09,422
Jesus Christ, look at
this poor bastard, huh?

1352
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:11,322
Mellish: I guess they're
not bulletproof, huh?

1353
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:12,621
Reiben: Guess not.
All right?

1354
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:14,184
Mellish: I don't like what
he's got between his ears.

1355
01:19:14,263 --> 01:19:16,493
Jackson: Sort of
what you fellas got

1356
01:19:16,565 --> 01:19:17,793
between your legs.

1357
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:20,300
Mellish:
We got to give him that.

1358
01:19:20,369 --> 01:19:21,495
Not bad for you,
Jackson.

1359
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:23,060
I got 3 of a kind.

1360
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:24,230
Full house.

1361
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,638
The whole goddamn
airborne's watching.

1362
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:27,970
These aren't poker chips.

1363
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:29,305
Mellish:
All right, all right.

1364
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:31,312
Wade:
Put 'em back in there!

1365
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:57,266
He's not here.

1366
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,304
Wade: Put 'em back.

1367
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:02,673
Maybe we should bust up

1368
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:04,234
into a couple of
different groups, huh?

1369
01:20:04,313 --> 01:20:05,803
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

1370
01:20:05,881 --> 01:20:06,905
calling his name.

1371
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:08,609
He's bound to hear us
sooner or later.

1372
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:10,151
Ryan!

1373
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:13,416
That might be a little
hard to do, Captain.

1374
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,979
Maybe the locals
have seen him.

1375
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:16,649
Hey, you know--
uh, excusez-moi.

1376
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:18,693
Parlez-vous Ryan,
James ryan?

1377
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,421
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

1378
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:22,487
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

1379
01:20:22,564 --> 01:20:24,828
Ryan? You know
a guy named Ryan?

1380
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,663
Private James Ryan
from lowa?

1381
01:20:26,735 --> 01:20:29,465
Anybody know a Ryan?

1382
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,630
James Ryan?!

1383
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:33,266
Hey, Joe,

1384
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:34,934
doesn't, uh, Michaelson

1385
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,570
pal around with a Ryan
from ''C'' Company?

1386
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:38,840
Yeah, I think so.

1387
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:41,007
Well, bring him
up here, would you?

1388
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:51,287
You know
Private Ryan?

1389
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,759
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

1390
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:54,125
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir!

1391
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:55,857
My hearing
is not so good!

1392
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:57,023
lt comes and goes!

1393
01:20:57,099 --> 01:20:59,124
A German grenade went off
right by my head!

1394
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:00,293
[Louder]
Got it, got it.

1395
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:02,337
Do you know
Private Ryan?

1396
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:03,837
Who?

1397
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:06,272
Private Ryan?
James Ryan?

1398
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:07,603
Jimmy Ryan?

1399
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:10,668
James.
James Francis Ryan.

1400
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:13,579
No, no, no.
James Francis Ryan.

1401
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,641
Get me a pencil.
Something to write on.

1402
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:18,709
Quick! Quick!
Come on, a pencil!

1403
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:22,823
Here you are.
A small one, sir.

1404
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,859
Write this down.

1405
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:26,895
James Francis Ryan,
Question mark.

1406
01:21:26,962 --> 01:21:29,192
lowa, question mark.

1407
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,357
Do you know him?
Does he know him?

1408
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:32,695
Read the message. Look.

1409
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:37,430
Yeah. Of course
I know him, sir.

1410
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:39,098
Does he know
where he is?

1411
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:43,944
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:46,537
We missed our drop zone
by about 20 miles,

1413
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:49,914
ended up way over by
Bumville or some damn place.

1414
01:21:49,985 --> 01:21:51,316
Him, me, and a couple
of other guys

1415
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:53,081
were coming here
to the rally point,

1416
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:55,783
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1417
01:21:55,857 --> 01:21:58,985
to go to, uh... Ramelle...

1418
01:21:59,061 --> 01:21:59,993
Ramelle.

1419
01:22:00,062 --> 01:22:01,256
To baby-sit a bridge.

1420
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,592
That's the last
I've seen of him, sir.

1421
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:04,427
Great! Great!
Thank-- Thank you.

1422
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,524
Write thank you.
Read and thank you.

1423
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:07,830
Michaelson:
You're welcome!

1424
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:09,165
Assemble on me.

1425
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:13,000
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1426
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:18,306
Ramelle.

1427
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,713
We're here. There.

1428
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:22,977
Ramelle...

1429
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:24,985
is on the Merderet River
right here,

1430
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:26,987
just to the southwest
of us.

1431
01:22:27,055 --> 01:22:28,989
You know anything
about this bridge

1432
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:30,649
he was talking
about, Captain?

1433
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:34,184
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1434
01:22:34,263 --> 01:22:37,721
We can't push on Paris until
we take a deep water port,

1435
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:39,596
and Rommel knows that.

1436
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:40,930
So he's gonna try
to get his armor

1437
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:44,166
across the Merderet River
anywhere he can.

1438
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,867
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

1439
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:49,206
when we make the big
right turn to Cherbourg.

1440
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:51,337
That makes any village
on that river

1441
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:54,177
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

1443
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:16,461
Let's go.

1444
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:27,077
Wade: Captain.

1445
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:07,052
Horvath:
What the hell is that?

1446
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,282
Miller: A radar site.

1447
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:12,054
It's got to be
out of action.

1448
01:24:12,127 --> 01:24:14,186
Well, it looks like we
got something in that...

1449
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:16,822
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1450
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:18,923
See it?

1451
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,865
Yeah.
That's my guess, too.

1452
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,735
What is it?

1453
01:24:24,806 --> 01:24:27,206
Machine gun.
Probably MG-42.

1454
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,539
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1455
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:31,579
Maybe one of them's
our boy.

1456
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:33,307
Miller: No, their
patches are 82nd,

1457
01:24:33,382 --> 01:24:34,713
so your luck's
not that good.

1458
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:37,274
I don't know how fast
the rest of you Betties are,

1459
01:24:37,352 --> 01:24:39,752
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

1460
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:41,550
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

1461
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:44,387
So, Captain, what I'm
trying to say is,

1462
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:46,586
why don't we just
go around the thing?

1463
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,458
I hear what
you're saying,

1464
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,464
but we can't
go around it.

1465
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:53,592
I'm with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1466
01:24:53,668 --> 01:24:55,602
I mean,
we left them 88s.

1467
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:56,932
For the air force.

1468
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:59,405
The air force isn't
gonna spend ordinance

1469
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:01,499
on one machine gun.

1470
01:25:01,576 --> 01:25:03,771
Mellish: Uh, Captain.

1471
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:06,780
We can still skip it and
accomplish our mission.

1472
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:09,476
I mean, this isn't
our mission, right, sir?

1473
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:11,746
Oh, that's what you
want to do, Mellish?

1474
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,014
You just want
to leave it here

1475
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,181
so they can ambush the next
company that comes along?

1476
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:17,225
No, sir, that's not
what I'm saying.

1477
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,886
I'm simply saying, it seems
like an unnecessary risk

1478
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:21,223
given our objective, sir.

1479
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:23,423
Our objective
is to win the war.

1480
01:25:26,401 --> 01:25:28,369
Sir, I just, uh,

1481
01:25:28,437 --> 01:25:30,905
I don't have a good feeling
about this one.

1482
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:34,375
Well, when was
the last time

1483
01:25:34,443 --> 01:25:36,070
you felt good
about anything?

1484
01:25:56,665 --> 01:26:00,863
All right, 3 runners
with suppressing fire.

1485
01:26:00,936 --> 01:26:02,904
Mellish,
you hook to the right.

1486
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:04,632
I'll go up the middle.

1487
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:06,606
Who's going left?

1488
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,273
Who's going left?

1489
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:20,846
I'll do it.

1490
01:26:20,922 --> 01:26:22,150
I'll go left.

1491
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:23,919
All right.

Upham, switch off
with Jackson,

1493
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,528
and you linger
in the rear.

1494
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,120
Upham: Yes, sir.

1495
01:26:29,197 --> 01:26:30,391
We advance
and keep pressure on him

1496
01:26:30,465 --> 01:26:33,025
till he has to change out
his barrels.

1497
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:36,867
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1498
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:38,929
Maybe I should go up
the middle, sir.

1499
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:40,907
The way you run?
I don't think so.

1500
01:26:40,976 --> 01:26:42,671
Maybe I should
go left, sir.

1501
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:45,372
Maybe you
should shut up.

1502
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:48,439

1503
01:26:56,491 --> 01:26:59,289

you can reach 'em and...

1504
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:02,330

for the base runners.

and get up here!

and extra dressing now!

1509

the extra medical kit!

all right, Doc.

The last 11 years,

1737
01:40:56,831 --> 01:40:59,197
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1738
01:41:01,736 --> 01:41:03,670
I was the coach

Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1742
01:41:13,581 --> 01:41:17,381
they'd think,
''Well, that figures.''

it's a...

01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:31,960
So I guess
I've changed some.

1747
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:36,469

to recognize me

I get back to her.

1750
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:47,274

be able to...

1751
01:41:47,348 --> 01:41:49,873

days like today.

about Ryan.

1754
01:41:57,858 --> 01:41:59,758
I don't care.

1755
01:41:59,827 --> 01:42:02,421

He's just a name.

1756

But if...

1757
01:42:05,533 --> 01:42:07,501
you know,
if going to Ramelle and...

1758

finding him so he can go home,

1759
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:11,663
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife,

1760
01:42:11,739 --> 01:42:15,835
well then...
then that's my mission.

1761
01:42:17,445 --> 01:42:19,345
You want to leave?

1762
01:42:19,413 --> 01:42:22,974
You want to go off
and fight the war?

1763
01:42:24,952 --> 01:42:27,512
All right.

1764
01:42:27,588 --> 01:42:30,421
All right,
I won't stop you.

1765
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:32,686
I'll even put in
the paperwork.

1766
01:42:35,029 --> 01:42:36,656
I just know that
every man I kill,

1767
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,721
the farther away
from home I feel.

01:44:21,702 --> 01:44:24,296
I sit in my chair

1776
01:44:24,371 --> 01:44:26,737
Filled with despair

1777
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:28,468
There's no one

1778
01:44:28,542 --> 01:44:32,069
Could be so sad

1779
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:34,011
With gloom everywhere

1780
01:44:34,081 --> 01:44:36,242
I sit and I stare...

1781
01:44:45,492 --> 01:44:47,426
[Rumbling]

1782
01:44:50,097 --> 01:44:51,860
Half-track! Cover!

1783
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:56,035
[Rumbling]

1784
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,005
[Bazooka Fires]

1785
01:45:08,082 --> 01:45:10,107
Who's doing the shooting?

1786
01:45:10,184 --> 01:45:12,049
Who's doing the shooting?

1787
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:26,065
[Gunfire]

1788
01:45:28,736 --> 01:45:30,328
Aah!

1789
01:45:31,972 --> 01:45:33,906
Get ready to move on
their left flank!

1790
01:45:33,974 --> 01:45:35,100
Take their left flank!

1791
01:45:35,175 --> 01:45:37,040
Mellish: Hold on and
make sure they're down!

1792
01:45:58,999 --> 01:46:02,127
Corporal Henderson: 101st!
We're coming out!

1793
01:46:08,942 --> 01:46:13,572
Corporal Henderson: That was
a recon element, Second S.S.

1794
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:16,047
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1795
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:22,210
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1796
01:46:22,289 --> 01:46:24,280
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

1797
01:46:24,358 --> 01:46:26,087
Ryan, first of the 506th.

1798
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,424
P.F.C. Toynbe,
third of the 506th.

1799
01:46:28,495 --> 01:46:30,725
James Francis Ryan?

1800
01:46:30,798 --> 01:46:33,358
Yes, sir.
How'd you guess that?

1801
01:46:44,545 --> 01:46:47,639
Miller: Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1802
01:46:47,681 --> 01:46:51,947
Henderson: Yes, sir.
Small unit action.

1803
01:46:53,587 --> 01:46:57,284
They came in and beat
the hell out of us with 88s.

1804
01:47:03,464 --> 01:47:05,091
Tell you what, sir,
if you're our relief,

1805
01:47:05,132 --> 01:47:07,225
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1806
01:47:07,267 --> 01:47:09,792
I wouldn't
blame you.

1807
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:12,737
Who's your C.O.?

1808
01:47:12,806 --> 01:47:15,707
lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1809
01:47:15,776 --> 01:47:17,243
I'm afraid the best
we can muster up

1810
01:47:17,277 --> 01:47:19,142
right now is a corporal.

1811
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,871
So, what are you guys
all about?

1812
01:47:23,951 --> 01:47:27,819
We're here
for him. Ryan.

1813
01:47:27,888 --> 01:47:29,082
Me, sir?

1814
01:47:38,499 --> 01:47:42,162
James Francis Ryan
of lowa?

1815
01:47:42,236 --> 01:47:44,932
Yes, sir. Payton, lowa,
That's correct.

1816
01:47:45,005 --> 01:47:47,405
What is this about?

1817
01:47:49,009 --> 01:47:51,773
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1818
01:47:58,485 --> 01:48:00,715
Which-- Which ones?

1819
01:48:02,923 --> 01:48:04,322
All of them.

1820
01:48:10,964 --> 01:48:13,330
Uh...

1821
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,891
on-- on the level?

1822
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:19,464
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1823
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,100
Uh...

1824
01:48:22,176 --> 01:48:23,734
you might want to take
some time with this.

1825
01:48:23,811 --> 01:48:27,008
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...

1826
01:48:36,156 --> 01:48:37,623
What's this all about?

1827
01:48:37,691 --> 01:48:39,283
Ryan lost
his brothers.

1828
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:40,553
Which one?

1829
01:48:40,627 --> 01:48:42,026
All of them.

1830
01:48:46,099 --> 01:48:48,033
You--

1831
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:53,469
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1832
01:48:55,542 --> 01:48:57,703
Well, you're--
you're going home.

1833
01:48:59,179 --> 01:49:01,739
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1834
01:49:05,285 --> 01:49:06,980
Bring me back?

1835
01:49:09,089 --> 01:49:10,681
Corporal Henderson...

1836
01:49:10,757 --> 01:49:13,191
I don't mean to leave you
even more shorthanded,

1837
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,194
but orders are orders.
Any communication

1838
01:49:15,262 --> 01:49:16,957
about when you're going
to be relieved up here?

1839
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:18,463
Sir, there's
no way to tell.

1840
01:49:18,532 --> 01:49:20,022
We have no idea what's
happening south of us.

1841
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,034
I have my orders,
too, sir.

1842
01:49:22,102 --> 01:49:23,592
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1843
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:26,503
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1844
01:49:26,573 --> 01:49:28,632
I don't see
that it does, sir.

1845
01:49:30,477 --> 01:49:32,411
The chief of staff
for the United States Army

1846
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:33,639
says it does.

1847
01:49:33,714 --> 01:49:36,581
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1848
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:39,483
Our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1849
01:49:39,553 --> 01:49:41,111
across the Merderet
with the exception of 2.

1850
01:49:41,188 --> 01:49:43,053
One at Valognes
and this one here.

1851
01:49:43,123 --> 01:49:44,556
We let the Germans
take 'em,

1852
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,422
we'll lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1853
01:49:46,493 --> 01:49:48,461
Private, your outfit wants
to stay, that's one thing.

1854
01:49:48,528 --> 01:49:50,962
Your party's over here.

1855
01:49:51,031 --> 01:49:53,090
Sir, I can't leave until
at least reinforcements--

1856
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:55,532
You got 3 minutes
to gather your gear.

1857
01:49:55,602 --> 01:49:57,763
Sir, what about them?
There's barely enough--

1858
01:49:57,838 --> 01:49:59,465
Reiben: Hey, asshole!

1859
01:49:59,539 --> 01:50:02,997
2 of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1860
01:50:08,715 --> 01:50:10,683
Sir?

1861
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:11,945
That's right.

1862
01:50:21,295 --> 01:50:23,058
What were their names?

1863
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:25,894
lrwin Wade and
Adrian Caparzo.

1864
01:50:27,834 --> 01:50:29,734
Wade and...

1865
01:50:29,803 --> 01:50:32,738
Caparzo.

1866
01:50:44,351 --> 01:50:46,717
lt doesn't make any sense.

1867
01:50:49,089 --> 01:50:50,989
lt doesn't make
any sense, sir.

1868
01:50:51,058 --> 01:50:53,618
Why? Why do l
deserve to go?

1869
01:50:53,694 --> 01:50:55,127
Why not any of
these guys?

1870
01:50:55,195 --> 01:50:56,526
They all fought
just as hard as me!

1871
01:51:01,201 --> 01:51:04,659
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1872
01:51:04,738 --> 01:51:07,901
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1873
01:51:14,881 --> 01:51:17,406
Tell her
that when you found me,

1874
01:51:17,484 --> 01:51:21,215
I was here with the only
brothers I have left.

1875
01:51:21,288 --> 01:51:25,588
And that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1876
01:51:25,659 --> 01:51:28,219
I think
she'll understand that.

1877
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:30,559
There's no way
I'm leaving this bridge.

1878
01:52:11,838 --> 01:52:13,806
[Sighs]

1879
01:52:13,874 --> 01:52:15,535
What are your orders?

1880
01:52:17,644 --> 01:52:21,705
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1881
01:52:21,782 --> 01:52:24,842
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1882
01:52:24,918 --> 01:52:27,785
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1883
01:52:27,854 --> 01:52:30,288
I don't know.

1884
01:52:30,357 --> 01:52:31,881
What do you think?

1885
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:34,688
You don't want to know
what I think.

1886
01:52:37,064 --> 01:52:39,555
No, Mike, I do.

1887
01:52:39,633 --> 01:52:42,500
Well...

1888
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:44,503
part of me thinks
the kid's right.

1889
01:52:44,571 --> 01:52:46,505
What's he done
to deserve this?

1890
01:52:46,573 --> 01:52:48,507
lf he wants
to stay here, fine.

1891
01:52:48,575 --> 01:52:50,839
Let's leave him
and go home.

1892
01:52:50,911 --> 01:52:53,641
Yeah.

1893
01:52:53,713 --> 01:52:55,647
But another
part of me thinks...

1894
01:52:55,715 --> 01:52:59,116
what if by
some miracle we stay

1895
01:52:59,186 --> 01:53:01,950
and actually make it
out of here?

1896
01:53:02,022 --> 01:53:04,513
Some day we might look
back on this and decide

1897
01:53:04,591 --> 01:53:09,119
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1898
01:53:09,196 --> 01:53:10,663
we were able
to pull out of

1899
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:15,758
this whole god-awful,
shitty mess.

1900
01:53:15,836 --> 01:53:20,205
That's what
I was thinking, sir.

1901
01:53:20,273 --> 01:53:22,764
Like you said, Captain,

1902
01:53:22,843 --> 01:53:25,778
if we do that...

1903
01:53:25,846 --> 01:53:29,304
we all earn
the right to go home.

1904
01:53:32,085 --> 01:53:33,609
Oh, brother.

1905
01:53:36,423 --> 01:53:40,018
Trask:
This is everything.

1906
01:53:40,093 --> 01:53:42,493
You got the 2 30-caliber
machine guns,

1907
01:53:42,562 --> 01:53:44,086
17 grenades,

1908
01:53:44,164 --> 01:53:46,428
11 Hawkins mines.

1909
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:49,936
You got the 2 bazookas, but
they only got 8 rounds left,

1910
01:53:50,003 --> 01:53:52,062
and assorted small arms.

1911
01:53:52,139 --> 01:53:53,868
We had a 60 mortar,

1912
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,567
but an arty round
took it out.

1913
01:53:55,642 --> 01:53:58,543
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1914
01:53:58,612 --> 01:54:00,671
Which they're sure to do.

1915
01:54:00,747 --> 01:54:01,873
What you thinking, sir?

1916
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:03,279
Well...

1917
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:04,282
I'm thinking
they're going to try

1918
01:54:04,351 --> 01:54:06,285
to whip around
the flanks--

1919
01:54:11,024 --> 01:54:13,322
Miller: Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1920
01:54:13,393 --> 01:54:14,519
in-between these buildings

1921
01:54:14,594 --> 01:54:18,030
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1922
01:54:18,098 --> 01:54:19,622
Disable 'em?

1923
01:54:19,699 --> 01:54:20,757
lf we can.

1924
01:54:20,834 --> 01:54:22,233
Make that tank
a 60-ton roadblock.

1925
01:54:22,302 --> 01:54:23,826
We do that, we got a fighting
chance at their flanks.

1926
01:54:23,904 --> 01:54:25,394
Yes, sir, that's good.

1927
01:54:25,472 --> 01:54:26,905
Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1928
01:54:26,973 --> 01:54:28,304
Hit them hard as we can
one-on-one

1929
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:30,002
and fall back
to the bridge.

1930
01:54:30,076 --> 01:54:31,008
Machine gun
on the move down here,

1931
01:54:31,077 --> 01:54:32,066
number 2
up high somewhere

1932
01:54:32,145 --> 01:54:34,306
to piss a little bad
news on their heads.

1933
01:54:34,381 --> 01:54:36,975
Miller: That would be
the idea.

1934
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:39,177
Jackson?

1935
01:54:39,252 --> 01:54:41,015
lf we can, I'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1936
01:54:41,087 --> 01:54:42,554
Yes, sir.

1937
01:54:42,622 --> 01:54:44,783
Give you a little company
if you need it.

1938
01:54:44,858 --> 01:54:46,792
Yes, sir. Some company
couldn't hurt.

1939
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,691
I'd say a...

1940
01:54:48,762 --> 01:54:50,059
a 30 with about
a thousand rounds

1941
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:51,062
would be OK.

1942
01:54:51,131 --> 01:54:53,156
Parker,
job opportunity.

1943
01:54:53,233 --> 01:54:55,133
Reiben: It's not the worst
idea ever, Captain.

1944
01:54:55,202 --> 01:54:56,669
It's just that everything
depends on getting the tank

1945
01:54:56,736 --> 01:54:59,000
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1946
01:54:59,072 --> 01:55:01,700
So, how the hell do you

Horvath: Reiben's right.

1948
01:55:03,543 --> 01:55:05,534
As our esteemed colleague
from the airborne pointed out,

1949
01:55:05,612 --> 01:55:07,876
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1950
01:55:07,948 --> 01:55:09,882
so how do we stop the tank

1951
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:11,884
if we get it to commit?

1952
01:55:11,952 --> 01:55:13,476
Give it a rabbit
to chase.

1953
01:55:14,554 --> 01:55:17,148
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1954
01:55:17,224 --> 01:55:19,021
Yeah, but with what?

1955
01:55:21,628 --> 01:55:23,823
Well, we could try
a sticky bomb.

Sticky bomb, sir?

1957
01:55:26,466 --> 01:55:28,798
Sir, are you
making that up?

1958
01:55:28,868 --> 01:55:30,028
No. It's
in the field manual.

1959
01:55:30,103 --> 01:55:31,695
You check it out
if you want to.

1960
01:55:31,771 --> 01:55:34,535
Well, we seem to be
out of field manuals, sir.

1961
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:36,599
Perhaps you can
enlighten us.

1962
01:55:36,676 --> 01:55:37,938
All right, you have some
demolition, don't you?

1963
01:55:38,011 --> 01:55:40,002
Some TNT or
some composition ''B''?

1964
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,775
That, sir, is the one
thing we got plenty of.

1965
01:55:41,848 --> 01:55:43,577
I got that bridge wired
with enough composition ''B''

1966
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:44,674
to blow it twice.

1967
01:55:44,751 --> 01:55:46,048
All right, you can
spare some, then.

1968
01:55:46,119 --> 01:55:50,112
You take
a standard-issue G.l. sock,

1969
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:53,182
cram it with as much
comp ''B'' as it can hold,

1970
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:55,626
rig up a simple fuse,

1971
01:55:55,695 --> 01:55:58,459
then you coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1972
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:00,556
That way,
when you throw it,

1973
01:56:00,634 --> 01:56:02,101
it should stick.

1974
01:56:02,168 --> 01:56:04,728
It's a bomb that sticks.
It's a sticky bomb.

2140
02:04:33,646 --> 02:04:37,377
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

2141
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:40,851
and they said they had
a surprise for me.

2142
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,321
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft, and...

2143
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,824
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

2144
02:04:48,494 --> 02:04:51,827
with Alice--
Alice Jardine.

2149
02:04:58,805 --> 02:05:00,966

coming down.

And-- And Dan's
got her shirt off.

2152
02:05:05,344 --> 02:05:06,606
So he's working
on this bra,

2153
02:05:06,679 --> 02:05:08,169
and he's trying
to get it off,

2154
02:05:08,247 --> 02:05:11,182
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out...

2155
02:05:12,318 --> 02:05:14,183
''Danny, you're
a young man!

2156
02:05:14,253 --> 02:05:15,311

[Laughs]

2158
02:05:18,057 --> 02:05:19,854
And so Alice Jardine
hears this,

2159
02:05:19,926 --> 02:05:21,791
and she screams
and she jumps up

2160
02:05:21,861 --> 02:05:23,385
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

2161
02:05:23,462 --> 02:05:24,793
but she's still got
this shirt over her head.

2162
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,661
She goes running
right into the wall

2163
02:05:26,732 --> 02:05:29,326
and knocks herself out.

2164
02:05:29,402 --> 02:05:31,700
So now Dan
is just so mad at us.

2165
02:05:31,771 --> 02:05:33,500
He-- He starts
coming after us,

2166
02:05:33,573 --> 02:05:34,597
but at the same time,

2167
02:05:34,674 --> 02:05:35,936
Alice is over there
unconscious.

2168
02:05:36,008 --> 02:05:37,532
He's got to wake her up.

2169
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:39,703
So he grabs her
by a leg,

2170
02:05:39,779 --> 02:05:40,905
and he's dragging her.

2171
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:42,641
At the same time,
he picks up a shovel,

2172
02:05:42,715 --> 02:05:44,478
and he's going
after Sean.

2173
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:46,711
And Sean said, ''What are you
trying to hit me for?

2174
02:05:46,786 --> 02:05:49,516
I just did you a favor.''

2175
02:05:49,589 --> 02:05:52,319
And so this makes Dan
more angry.

2176
02:05:52,391 --> 02:05:54,291
He tries to swing
this thing.

2177
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,987
He loses the shovel.

2178
02:05:56,062 --> 02:05:58,223

and hits a kerosene lantern.

and respectfully,

2483
02:38:46,797 --> 02:38:49,664
George C. Marshall,
General, Chief Of Staff.

2484
02:39:40,985 --> 02:39:44,318
My family
is with me today.

2485
02:39:44,388 --> 02:39:46,253
They wanted
to come with me.

2486
02:39:48,826 --> 02:39:50,487
To be honest
with you,

2487
02:39:50,561 --> 02:39:52,825
l-- I wasn't sure
how I'd feel

2488
02:39:52,897 --> 02:39:54,125
coming back here.

2489
02:39:56,867 --> 02:40:00,428
Every day I think about
what you said to me

2490
02:40:00,504 --> 02:40:02,267
that day on the bridge.

2491
02:40:03,707 --> 02:40:05,971
And I've tried
to live my life

2492
02:40:06,043 --> 02:40:07,840
the best I could.

2493
02:40:08,913 --> 02:40:11,006
I hope
that was enough.

2494
02:40:12,149 --> 02:40:15,050
I hope that,
at least in your eyes...

2495
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:18,654
I've earned
what all of you

2496
02:40:18,722 --> 02:40:20,553
have done for me.

2497
02:40:33,938 --> 02:40:35,303
James.

2498
02:40:37,608 --> 02:40:39,735
''Captain
John H. Miller.''

2499
02:40:48,185 --> 02:40:51,018
Tell me I've led
a good life.

2500
02:40:51,088 --> 02:40:52,180
What?

2501
02:40:53,424 --> 02:40:56,086
Tell me I'm a good man.

2502
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:04,561
You are.

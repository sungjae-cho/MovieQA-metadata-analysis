1
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,849
SAN PEDRO

2
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
How you doin', Keaton?

3
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,930
I can't feel my legs,

4
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,599
Keyser.

5
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,780
Ready?

6
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,870
What time is it?

7
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,629
12.30.

8
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,220
[two gunshots]

9
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,310
[sirens]

10
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,230
It all started back
in New York six weeks ago.

11
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,910
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

12
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,529
The driver saw nobody, but
somebody fucked up. He heard a voice.

13
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,290
Sometimes that's all you need.

14
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,250
NEW YORK CITY

15
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,120
Mr McManus?

16
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,170
Christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep?

17
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,550
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

18
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,009
Todd Hockney?

19
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,269
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

20
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,519
Shit. Freeze!

21
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,899
Hold it!

22
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,949
Sure you brought enough guys?

23
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,279
It's quite simple.
A restaurant that changes with the taste

24
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,909
without losing the overall aesthetic.

25
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,449
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

26
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,420
- Where will it be?
- Let me give you an example.

27
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,209
This I had to see for myself.

28
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,379
David.

29
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,470
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

30
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,220
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

31
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,389
Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.

32
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,980
These gentlemen are from
the New York Police Department.

33
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,060
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I would have thought.

34
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,649
Il y a un problčme?

35
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,899
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

36
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,569
- Mr Keaton?
- Will you excuse us for a moment?

37
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,540
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

38
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,879
- Peut-ętre nous vous laisserions...
- No, no, no, please. Please sit down.

39
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,090
This is... This is a small problem.

40
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,259
- Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

41
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,220
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé lŕ?
- Non, c'est pas du tout un problčme.

42
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,180
- C'est la police, n'est-ce pas?
- Ça a l'air.

43
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,350
Ça va.

44
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,819
Unique.

45
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,740
Oui!

46
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,740
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

47
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,699
I mean, these guys
were hard-core hijackers.

48
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,870
But there I was.

49
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,209
At that point I wasn't scared.

50
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,959
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

51
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,339
Besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.

52
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,339
[man over PA] You know the drill.

53
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,389
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

54
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,559
Number one, step forward.

55
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,690
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

56
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,860
Number two, step forward.

57
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,200
Give me the fucking keys,
you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker...

58
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,620
Knock it off! Get back!
Number three, step forward.

59
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,639
- [thick accent] Hand me the keys.
- In English, please.

60
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,850
- Excuse me?
- In English!

61
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,350
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker. What the fuck?

62
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,600
Number four, step forward.

63
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,649
[number five] It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

64
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,980
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

65
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,860
It was all the cops' fault. You don't
put guys like that into a room together.

66
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,029
Who knows what can happen?

67
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,250
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

68
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,789
This has really gotta be
embarrassing for you guys, huh?

69
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,549
They drilled us all night. Somebody was
pissed about that truck getting hijacked.

70
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,840
They were hoping somebody
would give them something to go on.

71
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,799
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

72
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,850
Our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

73
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,769
They went after McManus first -
a top-notch entry man.

74
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,559
- What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.

75
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,570
Fucko?

76
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,279
He was a good guy. Crazy though.

77
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,240
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

78
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,029
- Say who?
- McManus! He told us another story.

79
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,830
Oh, is that the one about
the hooker with dysentery?

80
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,000
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a tight-ass,

81
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:25,590
but when it came to the job
he was right-on a smart man.

82
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,299
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

83
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,090
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

84
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,549
- Yeah, I'm shakin'[!] Come on.
- OK.

85
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,600
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me in the back?

86
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,179
Hello?

87
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:44,190
I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

88
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:47,190
Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.

89
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,899
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

90
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,360
You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

91
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,240
You think so? I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

92
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:58,870
Really?

93
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,960
I live in Queens. Did you put
that together yourself, Einstein?

94
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,500
Got a team of monkeys workin' on this?

95
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:09,259
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

96
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,889
Fuck your father in the shower, then
have a snack. You gonna charge me?

97
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,429
When I'm ready.

98
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,389
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

99
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,269
But Keaton was the real prize for them,
for obvious reasons.

100
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,730
It was your mistake, not mine.

101
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,110
Did you ever stop to ask me? Hm?

102
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,570
I mean, I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

103
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,500
- I'm a business man.
- What's that, the restaurant business?

104
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,330
From now on you're in
the getting-fucked-by-us business.

105
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,919
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,970
Like I said, it was your mistake. Not mine.

107
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,929
Now, you charge me
with this shit and I'll beat it.

108
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,269
OK?

109
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,639
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

110
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,019
Argh!

111
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,320
[Fenster] I really, really think somebody
should do something about this shit.

112
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,450
So I did a little time. Does that mean I get
railed every time a truck finds its way...

113
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,200
Fuck 'em!

114
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,500
Fenster, will you relax? These guys
don't have any probable cause.

115
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:27,129
You're fucking-A right.
No PC. No goddamn right.

116
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,169
You do some time, never let you go.
They treat me like a criminal.

117
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,049
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal!

118
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,429
Now, what you gotta go and do that?

119
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,889
- I'm tryin' to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

120
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,230
You're makin' me tired all over.

121
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,059
Well, fuck it then.

122
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,690
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you heard right.

123
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,240
Word I got is you hung up your
spurs, man. What's that all about?

124
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,240
[McManus] What's this?

125
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,909
Rumour has it Keaton's gone straight.

126
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,080
- I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
- Who's that?

127
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,830
A heavyweight criminal lawyer from
uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

128
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,879
How about it, Keaton?
You a lawyer's wife?

129
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:15,169
- What kind of retainer are you givin' her?
- Whoops!

130
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,379
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favour.

131
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,389
Tell him to keep quiet.

132
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,350
Dean Keaton.

133
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,309
Gone clean, huh?

134
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,059
Say it ain't so.
Or was it you that hit that truck?

135
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,320
Mac, Mac, forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

136
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,940
[chuckles]

137
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,450
- This whole thing was a shakedown.
- What makes you say that?

138
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,450
How many times you been in a line-up?

139
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:48,159
It's always you and four dummies. PD pay
homeless guys $10 a head half the time.

140
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,669
And there's no way
they'd line five felons in the same row.

141
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,590
And a voice line-up? A public
defender can get you outta that one.

142
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,299
- So why the hell was I strip-searched?
- That was the feds.

143
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:04,259
Truckload of guns get snagged. Customs
comes down on NYPD wanting answers.

144
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,059
They come up with us.
They're clutching at straws.

145
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,309
- I had a guy's finger up my asshole.
- Is it Friday already?

146
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,110
Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece?

147
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,860
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

148
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,830
- [Hockney] What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

149
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,200
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

150
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,830
Fuck who did it!
I wanna know who's the gimp.

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,250
- [Keaton] He's OK.
- How do I know that?

152
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,710
- What about it? What's your story?
- His name is Verbal.

153
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,470
- Verbal Kint.
- Verbal?

154
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,590
- Yeah.
- Roger really. People say I talk too much.

155
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,350
- I was just gonna tell you to shut up.
- We met before once or twice.

156
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,940
- In county. I was in for fraud.
- A line-up then, too. What happened?

157
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,980
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

158
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,779
- So you did it!
- All right, now, look.

159
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,110
We've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

160
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,370
So I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity, hm?

161
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,750
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

162
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,879
- Why don't you just calm down?
- What do you care what he has to say?

163
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm just talkin' here.

164
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,549
It seems like Mr Hockney wants to hear
what I got to say. I know Fenster's down.

165
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,509
What about you, guy?

166
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,639
I'm interested. Sure.

167
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,769
There, see? So now I'd like
to exercise my right to free assembly.

168
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,860
Why don't you just shut up?

169
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,200
You're missing the point.

170
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,159
No.

171
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,450
You're missing the point.

172
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,950
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

173
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,580
I don't care about your job.

174
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,419
And, um,

175
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,340
I want nothing to do with any of you.

176
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,970
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

177
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,179
Dean Keaton, gone the high road.

178
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,850
What is the world coming to?

179
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,730
Fuck him.

180
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,529
That was how it started. Five men
brought in on a trumped-up charge

181
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,120
to be leaned on by halfwits.

182
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,629
OK. Now I really can't
talk about it much here...

183
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,299
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now,

184
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:44,629
was that these men would
never break, never lie down,

185
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,549
never bend over for anybody.

186
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,720
Anybody.

187
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,059
[bell ringing, waves lapping]

188
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,149
[horn blows]

189
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,320
SAN PEDRO

190
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,119
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?

191
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,619
15 so far. They're still pulling
bodies out of the water though.

192
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,410
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, two.

193
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,079
One guy's in county hospital,
but he's in a coma.

194
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,299
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York, I think.

195
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,680
The chief wants this place sealed off.
If you have any questions, give him a call.

196
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,750
[ringing tone]

197
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,380
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

198
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:11,180
If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro PD on extension 112.

199
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,220
- Have a nice day.
- [answering machine beeps]

200
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,730
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you.

201
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:23,980
The DA came last night ready to arraign
even before they moved him to county.

202
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,400
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,

203
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:29,819
DA comes out the office looking like
he'd been smacked around.

204
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,160
They take his statement
and they cut him a deal.

205
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,539
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two.

206
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,579
What is that?

207
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,250
Listen, I give the DA credit
for getting that much. Understand?

208
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,420
Excuse me, sir.

209
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,299
This whole thing has turned political.

210
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,140
The mayor was here last night. The chief.
This morning the governor called, OK?

211
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,470
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

212
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,099
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

213
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,440
- Two hours, tops.
- I wanna see him.

214
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,440
- No, Dave.
- I gotta see him.

215
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,609
- Dave, no! I cannot do this for you.
- You gotta. I came a long way for this.

216
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,240
Dave, please.

217
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,369
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

218
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,170
He's paranoid. He knows the
interrogation rooms are all wired.

219
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,130
I quit. This won't be an interrogation.
Just a friendly chat.

220
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,299
- He will not go in the interrogation room.
- Someplace else.

221
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,259
Where?

222
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,009
No, no, no, no, no...

223
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,640
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope?
lf it was a hit, who called it in?

224
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:43,519
- I'm sure you have a host of wild theories.
- They know damn well what I think.

225
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,730
That's crazy! Besides, the guy's got
total immunity. His story checks out.

226
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,240
- He doesn't know what you wanna know.
- I don't think he does. Not exactly.

227
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,619
But there's more to his story.

228
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,240
Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier

229
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:04,789
for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

230
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,289
And, above all, I wanna
be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

231
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,630
- He's dead.
- Come on. Two hours.

232
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,880
Just till he makes bail.

233
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,549
They're all dead. I don't care how
tough a guy you say Keaton was,

234
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,519
nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

235
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,730
- Is he talking?
- He just regained consciousness.

236
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,269
- He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.
- Hungarian.

237
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
- Might have been.
- Most were Hungarians.

238
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,910
- You gotta put on one of these.
- Burn victims are susceptible to infection.

239
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,329
And, of course, there's no smoking.

240
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,920
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

241
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,839
- Is he gonna die?
- He has burns over 60% of his body.

242
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,549
- A number of ribs are broken.
- Call Security. Put a man on the door.

243
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,809
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

244
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,680
Do it.

245
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,519
- Do it now!
- [muttering in Hungarian]

246
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,730
Joel? Yeah, Baer down at LA County.

247
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,859
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbour is Arkosh Kovash.

248
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,819
Yes. Yes. I'm sure.
No, he's all fucked up.

249
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,829
- [shouts in Hungarian]
- What? What? I can't hear you.

250
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,250
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

251
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,460
Yes?

252
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:32,130
Well, not until I put a man on him. Send
me someone who can speak Hungarian.

253
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,339
- Yeah, he's talking like a Thai hooker.
- Keyser Söze!

254
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,930
- What?
- Keyser Söze! Keyser Söze!

255
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,890
- [coughs and splutters] Keyser Söze.
- No shit.

256
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,019
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser at Justice
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

257
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,779
Mm-hm.

258
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:30,140
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

259
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,940
Nice to meet you.

260
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,190
He wants to ask you a few questions.

261
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,400
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton mostly.

262
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,490
But I'd like to start at
the line-up in New York.

263
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,869
- Can I get coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the line-up.

264
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,460
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

265
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:52,920
One time I got so bad, my piss
come out like snot. It was thick...

266
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,210
- I'll get your fucking coffee.
- Get me one too while you're at it.

267
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,799
[opens door]

268
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,599
That guy is tense. Tension is a killer.

269
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,599
I was in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

270
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,650
The baritone was a guy named Kip Diskin.
Big, fat guy. I mean, like, orca fat.

271
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,519
- He was so stressed in the morning...
- Verbal, we're trying to help you.

272
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,490
Sure. And I appreciate that.
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.

273
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,279
I like cops. I would have liked
to have been a fed myself, but...

274
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,369
Verbal, you're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

275
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,119
[Verbal] I told the DA everything I know.

276
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,549
Verbal, I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.

277
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,470
- [Verbal] I know he was good.
- He was a corrupt cop.

278
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,430
Sure, 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

279
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,890
- Anyway, cops wouldn't let him go legit.
- Dean Keaton was a piece of shit!

280
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,230
Are you trying to get
a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?

281
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,769
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

282
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,940
May I have a cigarette?

283
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,779
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

284
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,000
According to your statement, you're
a short-con operator. Run-of-the-mill...

285
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,380
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

286
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,680
- Run-of-the-mill scams.
- It's been suppressed. It's inadmissible.

287
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,180
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

288
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:37,809
Well, I do have the weapons charge. I'm
looking at six whole months' hard time.

289
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,319
You know a dealer
named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

290
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,490
Know a religious guy named John Paul?

291
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,779
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

292
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,240
I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a
good friend of mine, likes me very much.

293
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:57,000
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby has
a lot of friends inside do favours for him.

294
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,049
What do you think he'd say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

295
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,799
- There's nothing in there about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

296
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,799
First thing on the job
I learnt how to spot a murderer.

297
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,720
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing and put 'em in jail.

298
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,099
Next day whoever's sleeping is your man.

299
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,059
If you're guilty, you know you're caught,
you get some rest. You follow me?

300
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,859
- No.
- Let me get right to the point.

301
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:27,950
I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

302
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,490
And I'm gonna get it from you
whether you like it or not.

303
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:33,660
I'm not a rat.

304
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,119
[door opens]

305
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,420
Thanks.

306
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,509
When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee right off the trees.

307
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,930
That was good. This is shit,
but, hey, I'm in a police station...

308
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,519
- Can we get started again?
- Now, what happened after the line-up?

309
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,359
The desk sergeant told me he couldn't
release you. Can you believe that?

310
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,569
You weren't even charged!
New York police.

311
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,710
I want pictures taken of your face.
I'll take 'em to the DA first thing.

312
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:22,670
- Forget about it.
- No! I'll have this in front of a grand jury!

313
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,880
Look, I don't wanna
talk about it, Edie. OK?

314
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,470
So what did Fortier and Renault say?

315
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,809
- They need more time to think about it.
- Dammit! More time for what, Edie?

316
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,230
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they'll still find out about me.

317
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,480
Give me some credit. I got you this far.

318
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:48,740
- Let's go to the grand jury. It won't stop!
- Look, it's never gonna stop, period!

319
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,950
By next week every investor in the city's
gonna be walkin' away from us.

320
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,579
It's finished.

321
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,750
- I'm finished.
- [footsteps]

322
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,049
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

323
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,089
It's never gonna stop.

324
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,559
I love you.

325
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,150
They ruined me in there tonight.

326
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,109
I love you.

327
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,029
Do you hear me?

328
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:37,200
What?

329
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,369
All right.

330
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,539
Let's just go to my place.

331
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,809
[Edie] We'll worry about this tomorrow.

332
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,480
Let's go.

333
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,609
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition.

334
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,660
A fast jump, high risk, long money.

335
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,619
We all knew it could be done.

336
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,410
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

337
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,910
To do it right took five men.

338
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,119
Five men meant Keaton.

339
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,420
Keaton took convincing.

340
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,670
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

341
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,589
Bullshit.

342
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,549
Bullshit.

343
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,470
They don't operate any more.

344
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,730
McManus has a friend in the 14th
Precinct. They're coming out for one job.

345
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:48,440
They're picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds. McManus already has a fence.

346
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,529
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California named Redfoot.

347
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,490
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

348
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:59,279
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

349
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,950
They won't take me unless you go.

350
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,500
Look at me. I need this.

351
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,539
Oh, you're telling me you don't
need this? Is this your place?

352
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,170
I'm not knocking you. You got a good
scam going with this lawyer... Oh!

353
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,849
Sorry.

354
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,009
It's OK. It's OK.

355
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,809
You say it's the real thing, that's cool.

356
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,150
- You OK?
- I was outta line.

357
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,319
But they're never gonna
stop with us. You know that.

358
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,109
As clean as you could get,
they'll never let you go.

359
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,619
This way we hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

360
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,829
- You sure you're OK?
- I'll be all right.

361
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,390
Look, I, uh...

362
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,559
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

363
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,779
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

364
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,740
[Keaton snorts]

365
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,700
So, uh...

366
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,579
how do they wanna do it?

367
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,799
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

368
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,420
Fenster? Hockney?

369
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:41,549
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

370
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,809
I got a way to do it without killing anyone,
but they won't let me in without you.

371
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,410
Three million?

372
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,710
Maybe more.

373
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,710
No killing?

374
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,670
Not if we do it my way.

375
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:56,670
New York's Finest Taxi Service
was not your normal service.

376
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,630
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket

377
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,430
driving smugglers and
drug dealers round the city.

378
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:07,309
For a few hundred dollars a mile
you got your own police escort.

379
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,269
They even had business cards.

380
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,440
After a while somebody started asking
questions and the service shut down.

381
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,230
Since then Internal Affairs have
been waiting to catch them in the act.

382
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,190
That's where we came in.

383
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,990
- So, how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

384
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,240
Will this get me to Staten Island?

385
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,160
You kidding me?
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

386
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,750
McManus brought us the job. Fenster got
the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware.

387
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,339
I came up with how to do it
so no one got killed.

388
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,210
But Keaton? Keaton
put on the finishing touch.

389
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:45,089
A little "fuck you"
from the five of us to the NYPD.

390
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,720
All right, watch this, watch this.
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful!

391
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:54,440
Come on, asshole! Fuck!

392
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:57,109
Holy shit!

393
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,400
- Don't move, you fuckers!
- Drop it now, motherfucker.

394
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,819
- Hurry up!
- Drop it! Don't fuckin' move!

395
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,069
- What do you want?
- [Fenster] Put the fuckin' thing away.

396
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,369
- [McManus] Stupid asshole.
- [Fenster] Don't fuckin' move, mama!

397
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:15,670
[Hockney] You want
a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

398
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,839
[McManus] Aw, fuck!

399
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,880
- Afternoon, pork chops. Give me the shit.
- Give him the fuckin' shit!

400
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,839
Give him the fuckin' thing!

401
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,470
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

402
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,599
Hurry up!

403
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,849
- Come on!
- Now the money.

404
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,940
- There's no money.
- Give me the money!

405
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,230
- There's no fuckin' money!
- Give me it!

406
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,319
- Give me the fuckin' money!
- Give him the money!

407
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,650
- Give me the money!
- Give him the money!

408
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:45,950
[McManus] Hurry up!

409
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,279
Motherfucker! You know who the fuck I
am? You people know who the fuck I am?

410
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,289
- Fuck!
- [Hockney] We do now, jerk-off.

411
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:57,079
[stamping]

412
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,299
Wait a minute. What's that?

413
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,509
What the fuck...? Holy shit!

414
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,510
[McManus] Go! Go! Go!

415
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,070
[sirens]

416
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,659
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
The press arrived before the police did.

417
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,489
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

418
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,539
Within a few weeks
50 more cops went down with them.

419
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,369
Everybody got it right in the ass
from the chief on down.

420
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,539
It was beautiful.

421
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,260
I owe you $2.50.

422
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,300
Dr Keaton.

423
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,309
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

424
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,360
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

425
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,940
In California?

426
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,900
Yes, Verbal. In California.

427
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,699
- Fenster and I...
- Wait. Hold the fuckin' phone.

428
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,739
You and Fenster? No, no, no, no, no.
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

429
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:17,619
OK, so everyone's gonna go.

430
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,119
We all go.

431
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,460
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

432
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,090
My fuckin' problem is that
you and Fenster are off in California

433
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,260
- while we're sittin' here holdin' our dicks!
- Hey! The job's over.

434
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,349
Cool it.

435
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,929
LA's a good place to lie low for a while.

436
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,190
You wanna dance?

437
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,610
Ladies...

438
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:00,409
I would like to propose a toast.

439
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,079
There you go.

440
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,300
To Mr Verbal.

441
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,469
The man with the plan.

442
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,190
[Verbal] We're gonna miss the flight.

443
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,980
Don't do this. Send her a note, something.

444
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,239
I said we'll make it.

445
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,940
We're gonna miss the plane.

446
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,230
She'll understand.

447
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,050
That's heart-warming. Really.

448
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,340
I'm weepy.

449
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:39,510
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

450
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:45,889
You guys wanted to know
what happened after the line-up.

451
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:50,059
Come on, Verbal.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

452
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,360
You expect me to believe that he retired?

453
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,530
For a woman?

454
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,699
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

455
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,119
- He loved her.
- Sure.

456
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,659
I'm supposed to believe
hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea?

457
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,500
- That was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

458
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,420
- [Kujan] Who'd know the service better?
- But Edie had him turned around.

459
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,219
Let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.

460
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,179
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

461
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,179
The guy I know was
a cold-blooded bastard.

462
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:28,480
IAD indicted him on three murder counts
before he was kicked off the force.

463
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,440
- So don't sell me the hooker with a heart.
- You got him all wrong.

464
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,570
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total
of seven times while he was on the force.

465
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,739
In every case the witnesses
either reversed their testimony,

466
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:46,829
or died before they could testify.

467
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,420
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

468
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,000
He killed three prisoners inside.

469
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,590
Of course, I can't prove this.

470
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,840
But I can't prove the best part either.

471
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,389
Dean Keaton was dead.

472
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,809
Did you know that? He died in a fire
two years ago during an investigation

473
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,610
into the murder of a witness
who was going to testify against him.

474
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,989
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into
a warehouse he owned before it blew up.

475
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,739
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

476
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,369
It blew up and took
all of Dean Keaton with it.

477
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,420
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

478
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,750
One killed himself in his car,

479
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,750
the other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

480
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,550
- [beeping]
- Agent Baer...

481
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,969
- Get this show on the road.
- There are too many people here.

482
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,429
Doctor, we'll be out of here
before he blows his porch light.

483
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,809
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

484
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,980
Everyone, calm down, all right?

485
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,480
I want you to ask this man
about the shoot-out in the harbour.

486
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,070
[speaks Hungarian]

487
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,369
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

488
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,260
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope. Uh, people.

489
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,840
- What?
- [Kovash continues speaking]

490
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:32,019
- He needs guarantees.
- What is he talking about?

491
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,400
He says his life's in danger.

492
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,320
He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.

493
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,989
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

494
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,239
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

495
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,409
about the devil.

496
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,789
Who's the devil?

497
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,289
Keyser Söze.

498
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,679
- Keyser Söze?
- He was in the harbour killing many men.

499
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,889
- He saw Keyser Söze?
- [Kovash carries on speaking]

500
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:19,690
- He saw his face.
- Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

501
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,860
- Describe him.
- OK.

502
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,789
[Kujan] Six weeks ago
an anonymous call tells me

503
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:34,619
I can find Keaton at Mondino's
with his attorney. And there he is.

504
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,420
Because he never profited
from his alleged death

505
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,050
and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him,

506
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,630
we had to let him go.

507
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,889
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

508
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,969
and then he had lunch.

509
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,309
- I don't know about that.
- Oh, I don't think you do.

510
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,440
But you say you saw Keaton die. You're
covering his ass and he's still out there.

511
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:05,610
I think he's behind that whole circus at the
harbour. He's using you cos you're stupid.

512
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:11,159
You tell me he's dead, so be it. I wanna be
sure he is before I go back to New York.

513
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,579
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

514
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,789
What lawyer?

515
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,840
- What lawyer, Verbal?
- When I was in that barbershop quartet...

516
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,130
I know you held out on the DA!
What did you leave out of that testimony?

517
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,929
- I can call up Ruby in ten minutes!
- The DA gave me immunity.

518
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,719
Not from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

519
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:36,230
Every criminal I've put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favour,

520
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,480
every creep that walks the street for
a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

521
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,230
Now you talk to me, or that immunity
they seem so fit to grant you

522
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,909
won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

523
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,780
There was a lawyer.

524
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,119
Kobayashi.

525
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,920
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

526
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,539
Convince me.

527
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,710
And tell me every last detail.

528
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,610
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus's fence, Redfoot.

529
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:33,409
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

530
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,659
Still, we should've known better.

531
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:37,659
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

532
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,159
Not bad. Can't complain.

533
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:42,579
How's it goin', Fenster?

534
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,380
Don't need to open it, right?

535
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,469
You must be Keaton.

536
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,679
Redfoot, Dean Keaton,
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

537
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:00,059
Verbal. The man with the plan, huh?

538
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,769
- Interested in any more work?
- We're always lookin' for extra work.

539
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,030
- We're on vacation.
- Well, that's too bad.

540
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:13,320
I got a ton of work and I don't have
any good people like you guys.

541
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:17,539
- What's the job?
- A jeweller out of Texas named Saul.

542
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:23,420
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
He does free appraisals for people.

543
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,920
Anyway, the word is
he carries around a lot of cash.

544
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,550
So I figure I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green. Simple.

545
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,679
- What about security?
- Bodyguards. Nothing you can't handle.

546
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,889
- Give me time to check it out?
- I'd expect nothing less from you, man.

547
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,309
Good to see you. We'll call you.

548
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
Enjoy LA, huh? Get yourself laid.

549
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,570
Hey, uh...

550
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,869
A friend of mine in New York tells me that
you know, that you knew Spook Hollis.

551
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:01,119
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

552
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,460
Good man, wasn't he?

553
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,960
I used to run dope for him.

554
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,170
- Too bad he got shieved.
- Yeah.

555
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,550
I shieved him.

556
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,889
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

557
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,059
I appreciate that.

558
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,190
Just out of curiosity,
was it business or personal?

559
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,360
A bit of both.

560
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,610
Well, like I said, you give me a call
if you're interested, all right?

561
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:43,409
Is there a problem?

562
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,710
One job. That was the deal.

563
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,969
One job? [McManus laughs]

564
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,599
One job!

565
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,599
That's a good one, Keaton.

566
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:08,440
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

567
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:11,610
He can convince anyone
he's someone else, but never himself.

568
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,400
It took one day with McManus
nagging him, and we went back to work.

569
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,500
So, I get out of my car.
I think it's wrecked.

570
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,969
In the back seat of the other car,
this woman's totally naked!

571
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,389
- I'm laughin' so hard, I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

572
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,550
Freeze! Freeze!

573
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,019
There's a second one here somewhere.

574
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:52,440
Give me the case.
Give me the fuckin' case!

575
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,570
Give me the case.

576
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,619
I'm telling you for the last time,
give me the fuckin' case!

577
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,289
- [Hockney] Come on!
- [Fenster] Hey! Don't move.

578
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,590
[car alarm]

579
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,659
Look, just hand over the case.

580
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:51,829
Hand over the fuckin' case!

581
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:18,320
[Hockney] Come on. Let's go!

582
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,449
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

583
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,909
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

584
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:32,920
[hammering]

585
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:49,269
Fuck!

586
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,980
[Fenster] Looks like
a lot of china to me. Shit.

587
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,360
- Guys, come on.
- [vehicle approaches]

588
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,869
- What're you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

589
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:08,789
- We did it your way, now my way.
- You gonna kill him?

590
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:10,949
- I'm gonna deal with it.
- You better.

591
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:13,119
I'm gonna deal with it. Shut up!

592
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,170
What am I supposed to do with that?

593
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,260
Feed it to the gimp, ease his pain.
I don't know what it is.

594
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:30,719
- What do you mean? Sh!
- I don't know. I got this job from a lawyer.

595
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,269
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know. Some limey.

596
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:37,860
He's a middle man for somebody, OK?
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

597
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,269
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you!

598
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,780
- Fuck you!
- Listen to me! We wanna meet him, OK?

599
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,949
That's funny.

600
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,159
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

601
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:53,829
- OK. We'll meet him.
- I'll call you.

602
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,630
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it, Dean. Wait.

603
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,170
One more thing, tough guy. Any more
surprises and I'm gonna kill you.

604
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,010
Such a tough guy, McManus.
Do me a favour, get the fuck off my dick.

605
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,889
- Fuck!
- No! No!

606
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,679
Better put a leash on that puppy.

607
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:19,559
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

608
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,940
The cops are gonna be
lookin' for the guys who did it.

609
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,449
Sooner or later they're gonna
come around askin' me.

610
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,119
You have a sweet night, ladies.

611
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,079
Fuck you.

612
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,420
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

613
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,840
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

614
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,719
Why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

615
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:53,179
Dave, someone to see you.

616
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,230
Jack!

617
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:03,360
Been lookin' for you. Still after that coke
from the harbour blood bath yesterday?

618
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,150
- Yeah.
- Stop lookin'. There was no coke.

619
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,699
I been in LA County talkin' to a guy they
pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro.

620
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,869
He came to this morning.

621
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:20,789
He's in a Hungarian mob doing a deal with
Argentinians. Says it was no dope deal.

622
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,250
- But the $91 million...
- We know. He says no way on the dope.

623
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,920
He tells me they were pulling
stumps for Turkey the next day.

624
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,679
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

625
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,929
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know. No one knew.

626
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:39,309
Except for a few key people.
They were all very hush about it, he says.

627
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,559
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don' t get it.

628
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:47,739
They tell me you got the cripple from
New York. Did he mention Keyser Söze?

629
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,780
Who?

630
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,949
Just bear with me here.

631
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,329
- Who's Keyser Söze?
- Aw, fuck!

632
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,579
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

633
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:04,539
What we need to do is find Redfoot,
Keaton, and get the hell outta here.

634
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,960
What we need to do is think. Think back.

635
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,510
Somebody with power.

636
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,599
Somebody capable of
trackin' us from New York to LA.

637
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,139
- Dean, what the hell are we doin' here?
- We're waitin'!

638
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,849
- I'm out.
- Sit down.

639
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,349
No. It's hot and I'm fuckin' bored.

640
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,980
[man] Mr Hockney, do stay.

641
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,730
Mr Keaton.

642
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,030
Mr Fenster I recognise from
his mug shots, as well as Mr McManus.

643
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,989
I can only assume that you are Mr Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

644
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,539
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

645
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:43,880
I am Mr Kobayashi.

646
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,760
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

647
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,800
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

648
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:57,639
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

649
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,179
He does not expect all of you to live,
but those of you who do

650
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:05,440
will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

651
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:07,610
Who's your boss?

652
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,070
I work for Keyser Söze.

653
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:26,079
- Who's Keyser Söze?
- Judging by the change in mood, Mr Kint,

654
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,250
I feel sure the rest of
your associates can tell you.

655
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,380
I come with an offer
directly from Mr Söze.

656
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,179
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean "an order"?

657
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:41,809
In 1981, Mr Keaton, you participated in a
hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

658
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:45,599
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr Söze

659
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:49,690
and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

660
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,150
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

661
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,820
You had no way of knowing this
because the fellow shipping the steel

662
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:00,329
was working for Mr Söze
without his knowledge.

663
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:06,869
Earlier this year Mr Fenster and Mr
McManus hijacked a flight out of Newark.

664
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,420
The plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.

665
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,010
Two months ago Mr Hockney stole a
truck carrying gun parts through Queens.

666
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:21,889
Gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

667
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:25,730
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

668
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,860
Again Mr Söze,
using pawns who had no knowledge.

669
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,690
Which brings us to Mr Kint.

670
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,699
Nine months ago one of
Mr Söze's less than intelligent couriers

671
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,369
was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple.

672
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,329
He was relieved of $62,000.

673
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,619
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

674
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,500
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

675
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,800
- You set up the line-up?
- Yes.

676
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,380
You were not to be released until I arrived.

677
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:04,269
It seems Ms Finneran was a little
too effective in expediting his release.

678
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:06,519
Holding the rest of you was a moot point.

679
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,480
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr Redfoot knew nothing.

680
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,269
Mr Söze rarely works
with the same people for long,

681
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,150
and they never know
who they're working for.

682
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,739
One cannot be betrayed,
if one has no people.

683
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,489
So, why are you telling us?

684
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:27,039
Because you have stolen from
Mr Söze, Mr Fenster. All of you.

685
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:31,500
That you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive.

686
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:35,170
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

687
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,340
All right, fuck the debt and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Söze?

688
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,639
I don't think that is relevant, Mr Hockney.

689
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,349
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

690
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,980
Mr Redfoot can testify to your
involvement and we can see to it he will.

691
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,190
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

692
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,449
Mr Söze's primary interest is narcotics.

693
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:04,949
He's been competing, shall we say, with
a group of Argentinians for years now.

694
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:08,159
Competing with Mr Söze has taken its toll.

695
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:15,250
The Argentinians are negotiating the sale
of $91m in cocaine in three days' time.

696
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:21,840
This purchase will revitalise the
diminishing strength of their organisation.

697
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:25,510
Mr Söze would like you to stop the deal.

698
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,269
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

699
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,650
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

700
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:38,150
Mr Söze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine on board.

701
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,610
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr Söze.

702
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:48,409
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

703
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:52,369
A gift from Mr Söze.

704
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,000
Good day, gentlemen.

705
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:10,119
My whole life's in here -
everything I've done since I was 18.

706
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,579
They fuckin' know everything.

707
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:15,460
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

708
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,429
No.

709
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,269
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

710
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:38,900
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Söze in New York?

711
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,860
- Bricks Marlin.
- Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.

712
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:49,369
He said he always made five times
more money than the job was worth.

713
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:53,409
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's
usin' him for window-dressing.

714
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,210
- I don't know. This is bad.
- No, it's bullshit.

715
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:00,539
This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' set-up.

716
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,710
The way I hear it,
Söze is some kind of butcher.

717
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,300
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Söze!

718
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,309
Who is Keyser Söze?

719
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:17,639
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

720
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:19,940
Nobody ever believed he was real.

721
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:23,320
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him,

722
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,699
but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody
could've worked for him. You never knew.

723
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,199
That was his power.

724
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,619
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled

725
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:36,750
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

726
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:42,710
One story the guys told me - the story
I believe - was from his days in Turkey.

727
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,510
A gang of Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

728
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:50,590
They realised that to be in power you
didn't need guns or money or numbers.

729
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,389
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

730
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,809
After a while they come into power,
and they come after Söze.

731
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:01,309
He was small-time then,
just running dope, they say.

732
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,940
They come to his home in the afternoon
looking for his business.

733
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:12,409
They find his wife and kids in the house
and decide to wait for Söze.

734
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,510
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

735
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,679
The Hungarians knew Söze was tough, so
they let him know they meant business.

736
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:46,769
They tell him they want
his territory, all his business.

737
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,239
Söze looks over the faces of his family,

738
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,119
then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

739
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:18,719
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead

740
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:21,309
than live another day after this.

741
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,980
He lets the last Hungarian go,

742
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:28,940
waits until his family are buried,
then goes after the rest of the mob.

743
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,360
He kills their kids, their wives,
their parents and their parents' friends.

744
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:39,739
He burns down the houses they live in
and the stores they work in.

745
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,539
He kills people that owe them money.

746
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:46,329
And like that... he's gone.

747
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,710
Underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.

748
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,010
He becomes a myth, a spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night.

749
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,300
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Söze will get you."

750
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:59,309
But no one ever really believes.

751
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:01,469
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

752
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:05,940
Keaton always said

753
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,360
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

754
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,489
Well, I believe in God.

755
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:17,280
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Söze.

756
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:26,750
Do you give any weight to this?

757
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:30,960
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice. He has a file on Söze in DC.

758
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:36,219
Been a hobby of his. Guys equate him
to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.

759
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,389
[knock at door]

760
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:43,769
- You've heard of him?
- On the street?

761
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,769
- Yeah.
- A few times.

762
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:49,019
Outside stuff.
Somebody working for a guy

763
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:54,190
who worked for a guy who got some
money from Keyser Söze, shit like that.

764
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:59,619
It could be an old badge, a hex sign,
to keep people from fucking with you.

765
01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:01,869
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

766
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:06,329
I got a guy trying to leave hospital on
a fried drumstick cos he's afraid of Söze.

767
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,579
Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.

768
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,420
I told it like it happened on the boat.
So what if I left out how I got there?

769
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:19,679
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

770
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,059
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me, Agent Kujan.

771
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:26,349
If I said the Loch Ness Monster
hired me, what would you say?

772
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:31,360
- Turn state's evidence, we'll hear it out.
- I got immunity. What can you offer me?

773
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,360
If there really is a Keyser Söze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

774
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:39,159
Where's your head? Where do you
think the pressure's coming from?

775
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,530
Keyser Söze, or whatever you
wanna call him, knows where I am.

776
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:46,829
He's got the front burner under your ass
to let me go, so he can scoop me up later.

777
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:50,539
Immunity was to deal with you.
I got a new problem when I post bail.

778
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:53,500
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

779
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,880
Oh, gee, thanks, Dave.
Bang-up job so far - extortion, coercion.

780
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,929
Kiss my pucker.

781
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:05,219
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us are now bailing me out? Fuck you.

782
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,690
You think you can catch Keyser Söze?

783
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:14,519
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

784
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,530
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

785
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:21,989
After that, my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

786
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:27,869
[beeping]

787
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,260
What happened next?

788
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:51,889
The next morning Fenster was gone.
He couldn't handle slumming for Söze.

789
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:56,820
He left us a note wishing us good luck
and took a chunk of the money.

790
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,610
- Then what?
- McManus was furious.

791
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:04,699
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out, all sorts of shit.

792
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,449
- That night we got the call.
- What call?

793
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:11,119
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

794
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,719
[Hockney] Let's get the fuck outta here.

795
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:26,639
- We gotta bury him.
- With what?

796
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,809
With our hands.

797
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:41,489
Oh, this is nuts.
It's dry fucking sand, McManus.

798
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:45,199
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

799
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,159
- Dig, you fuck!
- What we gonna do? He's gonna kill us.

800
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

801
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,210
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

802
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,260
If you run, we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you. You got that?

803
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:06,760
This ain't my boy we're buryin'.
I don't owe anybody!

804
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:11,349
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

805
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:16,900
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count, so fuck you!

806
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:19,900
- Cos now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

807
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,619
It's precaution. You want payback,
you wanna run, I don't care.

808
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:32,909
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

809
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,829
I'm not doin' it for you.

810
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,289
I'm doin' this for me.

811
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,920
I'm gonna finish this thing.

812
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,550
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

813
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,449
- After they killed Fenster nobody'd run?
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

814
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:16,710
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.

815
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:21,170
It was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.

816
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:25,840
To a cop, the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

817
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:28,639
There's no mystery,
no arch criminal behind it all.

818
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,309
If you got a dead body and
think his brother did it, you're right.

819
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:36,929
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just
set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

820
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,949
They're coming up.

821
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,159
Did you hear me? He's coming up.

822
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,329
He's on his way down.

823
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,630
[two gunshots]

824
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,510
Don't move.

825
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,680
Press 20. Do it now.

826
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:16,489
Move!

827
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:22,000
- The answer is no.
- Mr Söze will be most upset...

828
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:26,500
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser
Söze. You mention him again, I'll kill you.

829
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,840
A strange threat. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

830
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:39,560
We know that you can get to us.

831
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,939
But now you know that we can get to you.

832
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,939
I'm giving you one
last chance to call this off.

833
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,189
Mr Sö... My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

834
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:52,859
Neither do we.

835
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:57,829
You got Fenster, but you won't get all of
us before one of us gets through to you.

836
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:02,039
I believe you, Mr McManus.
I most sincerely do.

837
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,170
You would not have been chosen were
you not suitable, but it's not my decision.

838
01:10:07,289 --> 01:10:09,840
Whatever you threaten
me with is ludicrous

839
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,880
in comparison to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

840
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,520
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

841
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,310
I just wanted you to know that.

842
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:31,779
I'm so sorry, Mr McManus.

843
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:34,699
I implore you, Mr Keaton, believe me,

844
01:10:34,819 --> 01:10:38,199
Mr Söze is very real and very determined.

845
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:40,369
We'll see.

846
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:50,840
Before you do me in, Mr McManus,

847
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,220
you will let me finish my business
with Ms Finneran first, won't you?

848
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,310
What did you say?

849
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,100
Edie Finneran.

850
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:09,109
She's upstairs in my office
for an extradition deposition.

851
01:11:10,109 --> 01:11:14,489
I requested she be put on the case
personally. She flew in yesterday.

852
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,529
No matter.

853
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:20,699
Kill away, Mr McManus.

854
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:28,619
- You're lyin'.
- Am I?

855
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:51,270
Ms Finneran's escort while she's here in
LA. Never leaves her side for a moment.

856
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,729
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

857
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:01,739
Now rest. The boat will
be ready for you on Friday.

858
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,449
If I see you or any of
your friends before then,

859
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:09,369
Ms Finneran will find herself the victim
of a gruesome violation before she dies.

860
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,880
As, indeed, will your father, Mr Hockney,

861
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:16,210
and your Uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr Kint.

862
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,260
I might only castrate
Mr McManus's nephew David.

863
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,600
Do I make myself clear?

864
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,100
We'll take care of the bodies downstairs.
We'll add them to the cost of Mr Fenster.

865
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:33,229
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

866
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,600
[sighing]

867
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,979
It's a logistical nightmare.
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

868
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:20,949
- No tellin' how many more are below.
- Can we stealth these guys?

869
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:24,779
Nah. With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

870
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:29,039
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

871
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:33,000
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

872
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,750
- What if we wait for the money?
- Ten more men at least.

873
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,340
In my opinion it can't be done. Anybody
who goes in there is not comin' out alive.

874
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,300
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- [Hockney] Me, too.

875
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:50,060
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

876
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,229
Me, too.

877
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,560
There's nothing that can't be done.

878
01:13:57,819 --> 01:14:01,489
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk into certain death.

879
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:10,239
The news said it's raining in New York.

880
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,140
[indistinct voices]

881
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,270
- [whispers] What language is that?
- I don't know.

882
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:37,439
Russian, I think.

883
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:41,109
Hungarian?

884
01:14:41,229 --> 01:14:43,069
Sh.

885
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:46,609
[chatter continues]

886
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,090
Package has arrived.

887
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:08,739
You kids ready?

888
01:16:08,859 --> 01:16:11,739
I would be, if I didn't have
to stop and answer you.

889
01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:15,789
I'm ready. McManus,
you better be set up in ten seconds.

890
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,210
I'm ready.

891
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:23,130
I want you to stay here.

892
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,130
- I'm supposed to cover the...
- Listen, if we fail, take the money and go.

893
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,590
- Keaton, I can't...
- Find Edie, tell her what happened.

894
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,930
She knows people, she knows what to do.

895
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,979
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

896
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:41,229
- What if I...
- Just do what I say. Please.

897
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:46,689
Tell her that...

898
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,779
Tell her I tried.

899
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,340
[Verbal] McManus, he's on his way.

900
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,550
I'm there.

901
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:39,699
[indistinct voices]

902
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,630
[addresses men in Spanish]

903
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,649
One, two, three, four,

904
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:07,859
five, six, seven.

905
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:11,189
[chuckles] Oswald was a fag.

906
01:18:19,539 --> 01:18:21,329
Hi.

907
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:23,500
How ya doin'?

908
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,789
Is there... Is there a problem?

909
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,090
Fernando...

910
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,840
- żQué hace aquí?
- Nada.

911
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,930
- Aquí no puede pasar.
- żNo se puede pasar por aquí?

912
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:51,609
Mejor que se regrese.

913
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,449
Now.

914
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,060
[McManus] # Old Macdonald had a farm

915
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:30,479
# Ee-eye, ee-eye, oh

916
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:35,529
# And on that farm he shot some guys

917
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:38,699
# Bada-boom, bada-bing, bang, boom

918
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,470
[yelling]

919
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,810
Elvis has left the building.

920
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:13,420
[shouting]

921
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,050
[man screams]

922
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,890
No dispare. ĄVámonos!

923
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:35,689
Oh, man!

924
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,109
[chuckles]

925
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:39,689
Hello.

926
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:37,960
- Why didn't you run?
- I froze up.

927
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,590
I thought about Fenster and
how he looked when we buried him.

928
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,680
Then I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

929
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,640
Dave.

930
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:56,439
A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Shot twice in the head.

931
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,319
- Two men from the Bureau identified him.
- What else?

932
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,649
His name was Arturro Marquez,
a smuggler from Argentina.

933
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:05,699
He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

934
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:09,449
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

935
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:12,829
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

936
01:23:12,949 --> 01:23:18,079
Now, get this. Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

937
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:21,550
- Kobayashi.
- New York faxed a copy of his testimony.

938
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,050
- He was a rat.
- Yeah, a big fucking rat!

939
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:27,140
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison,

940
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,100
so much so that
he named close to 50 people.

941
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,680
Guess who he named in the finale?

942
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,810
- Keyser Söze.
- [Baer] There's more.

943
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:54,250
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

944
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,000
There was no dope on that boat.

945
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,170
Argh!

946
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,090
[footsteps]

947
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:44,300
- You, stay quiet.
- He's here. I know he's here.

948
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,720
That's him. I'm telling you,
that's him. I know he's here!

949
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,510
You can't understand. That's him.

950
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,810
- Shut up!
- That's him. You hear me?

951
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:58,229
I'm telling you it's Keyser Söze!

952
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:04,069
[two gunshots]

953
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,909
[mechanical whirring]

954
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:00,140
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know. There's no coke!

955
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:03,180
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck! No coke!

956
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:06,939
- What the fuck do you mean?!
- I've been in every fucking room!

957
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,069
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing! Nothing!

958
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:12,819
Don't fuck with me.

959
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:16,859
There is no... fucking... coke!

960
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,840
I'm outta here.

961
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,500
I told them nothing.

962
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,210
I swear.

963
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,800
I told them nothing. Please.

964
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,810
[gunshots]

965
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,890
McManus, what the fuck is goin' on?

966
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,810
The strangest thing.

967
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:09,369
Your statement says you saw a man
in a suit with a slim build.

968
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,920
- Wait a minute.
- Are you saying you saw Keyser Söze?

969
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:16,590
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- There was dope on that boat.

970
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:18,340
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not!

971
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:22,590
- You know what I'm gettin' at!
- Hey! I got immunity. I won't take this!

972
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,470
You know... You know
what I'm gettin' at, Verbal!

973
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,930
- I don't know!
- Yes, you do! The truth!

974
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:30,520
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

975
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,520
- I did.
- You're lying to me!

976
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,479
- I am not!
- You've known this whole fuckin' time!

977
01:30:35,609 --> 01:30:39,279
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear.

978
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:43,319
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun. He was your friend!

979
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:51,579
Because I was afraid. OK?

980
01:30:51,909 --> 01:30:54,170
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

981
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,090
- I knew it was Keyser Söze.
- But Keaton...

982
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,970
It was Keyser Söze, Agent Kujan.
I mean, the devil himself.

983
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:05,640
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

984
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,520
What if you miss?

985
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,189
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

986
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,189
[sirens]

987
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,819
- Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

988
01:32:45,939 --> 01:32:48,819
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

989
01:32:48,949 --> 01:32:52,239
He swore out a statement
saying that he had seen

990
01:32:52,369 --> 01:32:56,369
and could positively identify
one Keyser Söze.

991
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:00,119
It says in the report: "He had
intimate knowledge of his businesses,

992
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:04,250
including but not exclusive
to drug-trafficking and murder."

993
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,960
I never heard of him.

994
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,760
His people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

995
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,470
Most likely the same Hungarians
Söze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

996
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,640
The money wasn't there for dope.

997
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,100
The Hungarians were gonna buy the one
guy that could incriminate Keyser Söze.

998
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:21,649
- I said I never heard of him.
- Keaton did.

999
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:26,689
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition
adviser. She knew what he knew.

1000
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:31,029
- I don't under...
- There were no drugs. It was a hit.

1001
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:35,869
A suicide mission to whack out the
one guy that could finger Keyser Söze.

1002
01:33:35,989 --> 01:33:40,789
So Söze put some thieves to it, men he
knew he could march into certain death.

1003
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,670
You're saying Söze
sent us to kill someone?

1004
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:47,510
Keaton did. Verbal,
he left you behind for a reason.

1005
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,590
Just do what I tell you.

1006
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:54,720
If you all knew Söze'd find you anywhere,
why did he give you the money to run?

1007
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:58,140
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1008
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,270
A one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world

1009
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:05,859
finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple.

1010
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:08,319
No, sir. Why?

1011
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:11,859
- Edie.
- I don't buy the reform story for a minute.

1012
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:17,119
Even if I did, I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1013
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:19,289
So why?

1014
01:34:20,829 --> 01:34:22,869
Because he was my friend.

1015
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,380
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

1016
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,460
- Keaton didn't have friends.
- What are you doin' here?

1017
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:32,340
He saved you because
he wanted it that way. It was his will.

1018
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:35,550
- Keaton was Keyser Söze.
- No.

1019
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,140
The kind of man who could wrangle
men like Hockney and McManus.

1020
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:44,399
The kind of man who could engineer
a line-up through all his contacts at NYPD.

1021
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,819
The kind of man who
could've killed Edie Finneran!

1022
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:56,989
She was found yesterday at a hotel
in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.

1023
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:04,789
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

1024
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:07,000
Edie?

1025
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:11,090
He used all of you to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone.

1026
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,760
He had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1027
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,850
The one man that could identify him.

1028
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,810
This is all bullshit.

1029
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:21,979
You said you saw him die.

1030
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,770
Or did you? You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1031
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,609
You said you heard the shot
before the fire.

1032
01:35:30,729 --> 01:35:34,569
- But you didn't see him die.
- I knew him. He would never...

1033
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:38,449
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to.

1034
01:35:38,619 --> 01:35:40,949
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

1035
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:45,250
Where was the political pressure
coming from? It was Keaton.

1036
01:35:45,369 --> 01:35:47,210
Immunity was your reward.

1037
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:49,170
But why me?

1038
01:35:49,289 --> 01:35:54,050
Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?

1039
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:58,050
Because you're a cripple, Verbal.
Because you're stupid.

1040
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:00,220
Because you're weaker than them.

1041
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:08,310
If he's dead, if what you say is true,

1042
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:10,479
then it won't matter.

1043
01:36:11,569 --> 01:36:15,899
It was his idea to hit the taxi service
in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

1044
01:36:16,029 --> 01:36:19,029
It was all Keaton.

1045
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:22,039
We followed him from the beginning.

1046
01:36:23,369 --> 01:36:27,460
I didn't know. I saw him die.

1047
01:36:27,579 --> 01:36:31,250
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ!

1048
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,460
You're not safe on your own.

1049
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,720
- You think he's...
- Keyser Söze?

1050
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,640
I don't know, Verbal.

1051
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,479
Keyser Söze's a shield.
Or, like you said, a spook story.

1052
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:54,109
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1053
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:57,739
- Stay and let us protect you.
- No way. I'm not bait. I post today.

1054
01:36:57,859 --> 01:36:59,699
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1055
01:36:59,819 --> 01:37:03,409
Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP,
unless you turn state's.

1056
01:37:03,529 --> 01:37:05,239
I'll take my chances.

1057
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:09,119
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1058
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:12,670
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1059
01:37:12,789 --> 01:37:14,840
Maybe so.

1060
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:18,050
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1061
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,319
Fuckin' cops.

1062
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,840
Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine?

1063
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:09,350
You'll have to sign for these, Mr Kint.

1064
01:38:11,689 --> 01:38:15,819
One watch, gold.
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1065
01:38:16,729 --> 01:38:18,819
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1066
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:21,649
We've still got nothing, Dave.

1067
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:24,119
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1068
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,079
Which is nothing.

1069
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:29,750
No matter. He'll have
to know how close we came.

1070
01:38:30,409 --> 01:38:33,250
[Rabin] Keyser Söze or no Keyser Söze,

1071
01:38:33,369 --> 01:38:36,590
if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

1072
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,840
[Kujan] I'll find him.

1073
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,010
[Rabin] Waste of time.

1074
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:46,050
[Kujan] A rumour's not
a rumour that doesn't die.

1075
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:49,180
- [Rabin] What?
- Nothin'.

1076
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:56,310
- Man, you're a slob.
- Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1077
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:01,109
It all makes sense when you look at
it right. You gotta stand back from it.

1078
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:05,819
You wanna see a real horror show,
you should see my garage.

1079
01:39:42,439 --> 01:39:44,489
[Kujan] Convince me.

1080
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:48,779
When I was in that barbershop quartet in
Skokie. Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

1081
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:52,699
- [Keaton] We need to think back.
- [Kobayashi] You've heard many tales.

1082
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:55,829
- [McManus] Bricks Marlin.
- [Kujan] I wanna hear your story.

1083
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:00,420
[Verbal] It's all there. Some guy
in California, his name is Redfoot.

1084
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:04,170
- [Kobayashi] A gift from Mr Söze.
- [Keaton] What about Redfoot?

1085
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:09,180
- [Kobayashi] Mr Redfoot knew nothing.
- [Verbal] Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.

1086
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,930
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.

1087
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:16,520
When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee.

1088
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:20,899
- [Kujan] You thought he was a good man.
- [Verbal] I know he was good.

1089
01:40:22,109 --> 01:40:26,489
- [Kujan] Tell me every last detail.
- [Verbal] How do you shoot the devil?

1090
01:40:26,609 --> 01:40:32,119
- [Rabin] He's protected by the Prince of...
- [Hockney] What's your story?

1091
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,409
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?

1092
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:37,369
- I am Mr Kobayashi.
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.

1093
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,539
- Tell me every last detail.
- I work for Keyser Söze.

1094
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:43,050
Convince me. Convince me.

1095
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:02,649
Every creep that works the street for a
living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1096
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:04,819
The cripple, did you see him?!

1097
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:07,949
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- That way.

1098
01:41:08,069 --> 01:41:10,529
[Kujan] I know you know something.

1099
01:41:10,659 --> 01:41:14,329
I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

1100
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:18,789
- To a cop, the explanation's simple.
- You know what I'm gettin' at! The truth!

1101
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,090
- ..no arch criminal behind it all.
- [Keaton] Somebody with power.

1102
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:26,800
- [Kovash in Hungarian] Keyser Söze!
- Who's Keyser Söze?

1103
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:32,720
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

1104
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:35,930
Because you're stupid, Verbal.
Because you're a cripple.

1105
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,520
- Who's the gimp?
- You've known the whole fuckin' time!

1106
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,649
- Who's Keyser Söze?
- Who's Keyser Söze?

1107
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:47,439
- [Verbal] I'm sure Keaton is dead.
- [Keaton] I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1108
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:51,029
[Kujan] First thing I learnt on the job
was how to spot a murderer.

1109
01:41:51,159 --> 01:41:55,159
[Baer] They tell me you got the cripple
from New York. He mention Keyser Söze?

1110
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:56,369
[Kujan] Who?

1111
01:41:56,489 --> 01:42:01,460
[Verbal] After that... my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

1112
01:42:22,189 --> 01:42:27,529
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1113
01:42:29,569 --> 01:42:31,859
And like that...

1114
01:42:31,989 --> 01:42:34,029
he's gone.

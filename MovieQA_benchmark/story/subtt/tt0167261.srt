1
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,584
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:30,730
<i>I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,544
<i>Go back to the shadow.</i>

4
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,206
<i>The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:54,544
You - shall not - pass!

6
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,526
No! No!

7
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,679
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:35,001
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,501
No!

10
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,524
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,040
Gandalf!

12
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,258
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,949
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:08,340
Just a dream.

15
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:17,032
The Two Towers

16
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,724
Can you see the bottom?

17
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,048
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

18
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,068
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,122
Mr. Frodo!

20
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,463
I think I've found the bottom.

21
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,816
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

22
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:01,212
It's not natural. None of it.

23
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,495
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

24
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:08,970
Just a bit of seasoning.

25
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,276
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

26
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,066
Roast chicken?!

27
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:16,974
You never know.

28
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,313
Sam. My dear Sam.

29
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:25,912
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

30
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,252
It is special.

31
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,037
It's a little bit of home.

32
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,754
We can't leave this here for
someone to follow us down.

33
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,671
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

34
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:49,304
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

35
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,017
Real Elvish rope.

36
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:55,300
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

37
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,457
Won't come free in a hurry.

38
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,520
Real Elvish rope.

39
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:27,038
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't wanna see any closer.

40
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,505
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

41
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,026
It's just where we can't get.

42
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:36,386
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

43
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:41,493
I don't think Gandalf meant
for us to come this way.

44
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:46,412
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

45
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:48,791
...but they did.

46
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:02,913
Mr. Frodo?

47
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,245
It's the ring, isn't it?

48
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,772
It's getting heavier.

49
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:27,106
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

50
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,930
Oh, yes. Lovely.

51
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,842
Lembas bread. And look!

52
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,568
More lembas bread.

53
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,297
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

54
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,426
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

55
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:57,764
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

56
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:05,962
Those rain clouds might.

57
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,975
This looks strangely familiar.

58
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:46,083
It's because we've been here before.

59
00:08:46,364 --> 00:08:48,820
We're going in circles.

60
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,456
What is that horrid stink?

61
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,808
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

62
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,926
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

63
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,181
I can smell it.

64
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,882
We're not alone.

65
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:23,556
The thieves. The thieves.

66
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,697
The filthy little thieves.

67
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,610
Where is it?

68
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:33,459
Where is it?

69
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:37,342
They stole it from us.

70
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:41,672
My precious.

71
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:45,849
Curse them, we hates them!

72
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:50,083
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

73
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,001
This is Sting.

74
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,737
You've seen it before...

75
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,368
...haven't you, Gollum?

76
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,869
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

77
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,795
It burns!

78
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,245
It burns us!

79
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,218
It freezes!

80
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,251
Nasty Elves twisted it.

81
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,070
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

82
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,682
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.

83
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,513
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

84
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:43,244
That would kill us! Kill us!

85
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:46,150
It's no more than you deserve!

86
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,911
Maybe he does deserve to die.

87
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:55,690
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

88
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,982
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

89
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,069
Take it off us.

90
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:14,067
We swears to do what you wants.

91
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,249
We swears.

92
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,967
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

93
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:23,428
We swears...

94
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:28,275
...to serve the master of the precious.

95
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,346
We will swear on...

96
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:34,499
...on the precious.

97
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,852
Gollum. Gollum.

98
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:41,077
The ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

99
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:43,363
Yes...

100
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:46,378
...on the precious.

101
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,195
On the precious.

102
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,893
I don't believe you!

103
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:59,317
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

104
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,297
He's trying to trick us.

105
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,476
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

106
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:20,362
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

107
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:25,150
You've been there before?

108
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:27,755
Yes.

109
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,228
You will lead us to the black gate.

110
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,629
To the gate, to the gate!
To the gate, the master says. Yes!

111
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:58,561
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

112
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:03,052
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

113
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,715
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

114
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:12,750
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

115
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:15,922
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

116
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,131
And always the great eye watching, watching.

117
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:27,963
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

118
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,664
There! What did I tell you?

119
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,065
He's run off, the old villain.

120
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,750
So much for his promises.

121
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,559
This way, Hobbits.

122
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,842
Follow me!

123
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,090
Merry!

124
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,545
Merry!

125
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:08,802
You're late, our master grows impatient.

126
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:10,883
He wants the Shire-rats now.

127
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:16,204
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

128
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:20,370
Saruman will have his prize.

129
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:23,738
We will deliver them.

130
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,390
Merry!

131
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,874
Merry? Wake up.

132
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,210
My friend is sick.

133
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,276
He needs water. Please!

134
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,922
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

135
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,892
Stop it!

136
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,690
Can't take his draught!

137
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,929
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

138
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,912
You want some?

139
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,977
Then keep your mouth shut.

140
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,463
Merry.

141
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,885
Hello, Pip.

142
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,094
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

143
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,784
- It was just an act.
- An act?

144
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,282
See? I fooled you too.

145
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:31,763
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

146
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,052
What is it? What do you smell?

147
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,354
Man-flesh.

148
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,817
They've picked up our trail.

149
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,096
Aragorn.

150
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,609
Let's move!

151
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,700
Their pace has quickened.

152
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:17,701
They must have caught our scent.

153
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:19,642
Hurry!

154
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,046
Come on, Gimli!

155
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,129
Three days and nights pursuit.

156
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:34,242
No food. No rest.

157
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:38,361
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

158
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,033
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

159
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,771
They may yet be alive.

160
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,226
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

161
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:25,333
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

162
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:29,737
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.

163
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,548
Very dangerous over short distances.

164
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,090
Rohan.

165
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,018
Home of the Horse-lords.

166
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,794
There's something strange at work here.

167
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,922
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

168
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:00,059
Sets its will against us.

169
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,167
Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?

170
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:10,908
The Uruks turn northeast.

171
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:13,930
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

172
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:16,103
Saruman.

173
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:27,635
The world is changing.

174
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:33,307
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

175
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,863
...and Mordor?

176
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:44,051
To stand against the might
of Sauron and Saruman...

177
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:47,936
...and the union of the two towers?

178
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,444
Together, my Lord Sauron...

179
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:01,116
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

180
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,411
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.

181
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:25,289
The forests will fall.

182
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,078
A new order will rise.

183
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:35,968
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

184
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:40,134
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

185
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,885
I want them armed and ready
to march within two weeks!

186
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,750
But, my lord, there are too many!

187
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,893
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

188
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,195
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

189
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,234
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

190
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:12,793
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

191
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,644
- Burn it.
- Yes.

192
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,647
We will fight for you.

193
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,822
Swear it.

194
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:36,962
We will die for Saruman.

195
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,172
The Horse-Men took your lands.

196
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,773
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

197
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,509
Murderers!

198
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,512
Take back the lands they stole from you.

199
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:51,497
Burn every village!

200
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:59,698
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

201
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,872
It will begin in Rohan.

202
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,103
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

203
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,147
But no more.

204
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:11,564
Èothain! Èothain!

205
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,383
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

206
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,422
Papa says Èothain must not ride Garulf.

207
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,296
He is too big for him.

208
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,407
Listen to me. You must ride to
Edoras and raise the alarm.

209
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:27,128
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

210
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,292
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

211
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:34,157
Freda, I will find you there.

212
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,846
Quickly!

213
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:48,823
Go, child.

214
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:03,652
Rohan, my lord...

215
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,798
...is ready to fall.

216
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:19,618
Théodred.

217
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,451
Find the king's son!

218
00:23:37,943 --> 00:23:43,727
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

219
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:47,600
My Lord Èomer, over here!

220
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,252
He's alive.

221
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,166
Théodred.

222
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,509
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

223
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,432
He was ambushed by Orcs.

224
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:55,560
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

225
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,472
That is a lie.

226
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:05,458
Saruman the White has ever
been our friend and ally.

227
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,237
Gríma.

228
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:12,587
Gríma.

229
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:16,663
Gríma.

230
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:20,440
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

231
00:25:20,974 --> 00:25:24,422
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

232
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:28,027
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

233
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:41,520
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

234
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:44,293
Can you not see?

235
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:49,418
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

236
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,223
...your warmongering.

237
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,426
Warmongering?

238
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:58,747
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

239
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:01,946
What was the promised price, Gríma?

240
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,793
When all the men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

241
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:20,948
Too long have you watched my sister.

242
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,141
Too long have you haunted her steps.

243
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:35,431
You see much, Èomer, son of Èomund.

244
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:36,891
Too much.

245
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:43,886
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

246
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:48,857
...and all its domains under pain of death.

247
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,727
You have no authority here.

248
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:54,361
Your orders mean nothing.

249
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:58,673
This order does not come from me.

250
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,073
It comes from the king.

251
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,323
He signed it this morning.

252
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,554
Keep breathing. That's the key.

253
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,531
Breathe.

254
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,388
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

255
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,673
We're not going no further...

256
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:08,842
...until we've had a breather.

257
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,356
Get a fire going!

258
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:16,999
Merry!

259
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,717
Merry!

260
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:25,464
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

261
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,230
What's making that noise?

262
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:40,302
It's the trees.

263
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:42,112
What?

264
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:46,176
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

265
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:50,814
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

266
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:52,636
...and come alive.

267
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:54,568
Alive?

268
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:57,138
Trees that could whisper...

269
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,581
...talk to each other...

270
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,637
...even move.

271
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,458
I'm starving.

272
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:10,616
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

273
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,369
Yeah!

274
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,758
Why can't we have some meat?!

275
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:20,371
What about them?

276
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,458
They're fresh.

277
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:26,816
They are not for eating.

278
00:29:32,947 --> 00:29:34,835
What about their legs?

279
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,319
They don't need those.

280
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:41,919
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

281
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:48,560
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

282
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,984
Alive?

283
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:58,123
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

284
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:03,935
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

285
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:07,145
The master wants it for the war.

286
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,937
They think we have the ring.

287
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:14,518
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

288
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,375
Just a mouthful...

289
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:19,768
...a bit of the flank.

290
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:30,046
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

291
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:38,019
Pippin.

292
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:39,868
Let's go.

293
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:49,813
Go on.

294
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:51,482
Call for help.

295
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:53,970
Squeal.

296
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:57,257
No one's going to save you now.

297
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:07,977
Pippin!

298
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:34,681
A red sun rises.

299
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:38,111
Blood has been spilled this night.

300
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,218
Riders of Rohan...

301
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,067
...what news from the mark?

302
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:46,116
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

303
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:48,307
Speak quickly!

304
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:53,173
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

305
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,968
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

306
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,785
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

307
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,892
You would die before your stroke fell.

308
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,516
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

309
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,957
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

310
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:29,399
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden...your king.

311
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:34,850
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

312
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,349
Not even his own kin.

313
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,838
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

314
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,940
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

315
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:50,859
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

316
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,850
And for that, we are banished.

317
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:58,160
The White Wizard is cunning.

318
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,267
He walks here and there, they say...

319
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,476
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

320
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:09,083
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

321
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,547
We are no spies.

322
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,625
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

323
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,283
They have taken two of our friends captive.

324
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,550
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

325
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,854
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

326
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:27,004
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

327
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:32,372
We left none alive.

328
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,914
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

329
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:42,684
Dead?

330
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:47,370
I am sorry.

331
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,220
Hasufel! Arod!

332
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,594
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

333
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,586
Farewell.

334
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:12,003
Look for your friends.

335
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,674
But do not trust to hope.

336
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:18,928
It has forsaken these lands.

337
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,152
We ride north!

338
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,615
It's one of their wee belts.

339
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:19,094
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)

340
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:29,417
We failed them.

341
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,627
A Hobbit lay here.

342
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,186
And the other.

343
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:01,566
They crawled.

344
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,818
Their hands were bound.

345
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:21,812
Their bonds were cut.

346
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,378
They ran over here.

347
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:44,257
They were followed.

348
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,174
The belt!

349
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:54,235
Run!

350
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:59,270
Tracks lead away from the battle...

351
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,208
...into Fangorn Forest.

352
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,576
Fangorn?

353
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:11,322
What madness drove them in there?

354
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:32,057
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

355
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:42,161
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

356
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,490
Come here!

357
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,502
Trees. Climb a tree.

358
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,614
He's gone.

359
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,008
Merry!

360
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:38,775
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

361
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:47,557
Run, Merry!

362
00:39:57,405 --> 00:40:01,563
Little Orcs - Búrarum.

363
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,146
It's talking, Merry, the tree is talking.

364
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:06,234
Tree?

365
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,350
I am no tree!

366
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:11,789
I am an Ent.

367
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,493
A tree-herder.

368
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,009
A shepherd of the forest.

369
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:18,567
Don't talk to it, Merry.

370
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,533
Don't encourage it!

371
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:24,853
Treebeard, some call me.

372
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,086
And whose side are you on?

373
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,328
Side?

374
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:32,354
I am on nobody's side...

375
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,957
...because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

376
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:43,419
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

377
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,285
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

378
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:48,756
Hobbits?

379
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:54,759
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

380
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,471
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

381
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,937
They come with fire.

382
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:05,690
They come with axes.

383
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,610
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

384
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,654
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

385
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,731
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

386
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:19,773
Halflings!

387
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:21,097
Shire-folk!

388
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,556
Maybe you are...

389
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:27,436
...and maybe you aren't.

390
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:32,434
The White Wizard will know.

391
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:35,251
The White Wizard?

392
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:38,295
Saruman.

393
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,539
See? See?

394
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:55,117
We've led you out.

395
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,805
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

396
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,411
Very lucky we find you.

397
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,857
Nice Hobbit.

398
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:17,967
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

399
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:20,793
A swamp, yes, yes.

400
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:26,181
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

401
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:31,998
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

402
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,909
I found it. I did.

403
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,778
The way through the marshes.

404
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:44,443
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

405
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:48,692
They go 'round for miles and miles.

406
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,443
Come quickly.

407
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:54,599
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

408
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:59,106
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

409
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,584
There's been no sight nor
sound of a bird for two days.

410
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,144
No, no birdses to eat.

411
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,576
No crunchable birdses.

412
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:13,104
We are famished! Yes!

413
00:43:13,392 --> 00:43:17,515
Famished we are, precious!

414
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,105
Here.

415
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,288
What does it eats?

416
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,436
Is it tasty?

417
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:47,310
It tries to chokes us!

418
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,205
We can't eats Hobbit food!

419
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:56,925
We must starve!

420
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,535
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!

421
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:02,572
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

422
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:05,555
It does not care if we be hungry.

423
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:10,447
Does not care if we should die.

424
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:13,996
Not like master.

425
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:17,492
Master cares.

426
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:20,543
Master knows.

427
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,978
Yes.

428
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,746
Precious.

429
00:44:31,432 --> 00:44:34,913
Once it takes a hold of us...

430
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:40,930
...it never lets go.

431
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:42,889
Don't touch me!

432
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:17,229
There are dead things!

433
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,167
Dead faces in the water.

434
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:26,033
All dead.

435
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:28,431
All rotten.

436
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:32,165
Elves and Men and Orcses.

437
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:36,005
A great battle long ago.

438
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:38,617
Dead Marshes.

439
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:41,514
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

440
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,990
This way.

441
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:47,886
Don't follow the lights.

442
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,450
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...

443
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,146
...and light little candles of their own.

444
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,588
<i>...Tangado haid!</i>

445
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:25,570
Frodo!

446
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:14,591
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

447
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:16,741
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

448
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,778
Are you all right?

449
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:50,566
So bright.

450
00:47:50,889 --> 00:47:54,534
So beautiful.

451
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,537
Our precious.

452
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:01,627
What did you say?

453
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:04,005
Master should be resting.

454
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:08,162
Master needs to keep up his strength.

455
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:13,436
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

456
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:15,171
Gollum. Gollum.

457
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:17,134
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

458
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:21,308
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

459
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,144
He said your life was a sad story.

460
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:27,761
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

461
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:30,993
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

462
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:32,984
Were you?

463
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:37,403
Sméagol.

464
00:48:42,203 --> 00:48:44,626
What did you call me?

465
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:48,726
That was your name once, wasn't it?

466
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,680
A long time ago.

467
00:48:52,614 --> 00:48:54,686
My name.

468
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:57,278
My name.

469
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,645
Sméagol.

470
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:12,423
Black Riders!

471
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:13,943
Hide! Hide!

472
00:49:24,578 --> 00:49:26,782
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

473
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,527
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

474
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:34,003
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

475
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:37,102
No, you cannot kill them. No.

476
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:05,428
Wraiths!

477
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:07,787
Wraiths on wings!

478
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:17,833
They are calling for it.

479
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:21,511
They are calling for the precious.

480
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,840
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

481
00:50:26,102 --> 00:50:27,313
I'm here.

482
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,844
Hurry, Hobbits.

483
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:49,227
The Black Gate is very close.

484
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:58,051
Orc blood.

485
00:51:08,142 --> 00:51:09,833
These are strange tracks.

486
00:51:11,178 --> 00:51:13,120
The air is so close in here.

487
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:16,682
This forest is old.

488
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:19,494
Very old.

489
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,526
Full of memory...

490
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:28,462
...and anger.

491
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:37,516
The trees are speaking to each other.

492
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,233
Gimli!

493
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,326
Lower your ax.

494
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,860
They have feelings, my friend.

495
00:51:47,512 --> 00:51:49,421
The Elves began it.

496
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:54,220
Waking up the trees...teaching them to speak.

497
00:51:54,919 --> 00:51:57,189
Talking trees.

498
00:51:57,923 --> 00:52:00,824
What do trees have to talk about?

499
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,225
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

500
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:09,050
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!)

501
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:17,400
Man cenich?
(What do you see?)

502
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:20,642
The White Wizard approaches.

503
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:31,041
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

504
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:42,968
We must be quick.

505
00:52:58,614 --> 00:53:02,127
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

506
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:04,225
Where are they?

507
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:07,867
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

508
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:12,279
They met someone they did not expect.

509
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:14,666
Does that comfort you?

510
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:16,815
Who are you?

511
00:53:18,364 --> 00:53:20,253
Show yourself!

512
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,151
It cannot be.

513
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:35,130
Forgive me.

514
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:38,672
I mistook you for Saruman.

515
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,170
I am Saruman.

516
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:47,534
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

517
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:50,091
You fell.

518
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:54,050
Through fire...

519
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,575
...and water.

520
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:59,524
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

521
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:03,415
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

522
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,009
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

523
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:26,570
...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

524
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,225
Darkness took me...

525
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:40,002
...and I strayed out of thought and time.

526
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,877
Stars wheeled overhead...

527
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:48,556
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

528
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,925
But it was not the end.

529
00:54:53,254 --> 00:54:55,973
I felt life in me again.

530
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:00,447
I've been sent back...

531
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:02,224
...until my task is done.

532
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,554
Gandalf.

533
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,209
Gandalf?

534
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:09,426
Yes.

535
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:13,998
That was what they used to call me.

536
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:19,116
Gandalf the Grey.

537
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:22,240
That was my name.

538
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:23,858
Gandalf.

539
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:27,861
I am Gandalf the White.

540
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:33,924
And I come back to you now...

541
00:55:34,226 --> 00:55:36,616
...at the turn of the tide.

542
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,679
One stage of your journey is over, another begins.

543
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,602
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

544
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,613
That is no short distance!

545
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,039
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

546
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:53,351
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

547
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:56,908
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

548
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:59,126
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

549
00:55:59,385 --> 00:56:03,443
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested?

550
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:09,259
I mean, charming...

551
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:12,180
...quite charming forest.

552
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:16,344
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

553
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:20,859
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.

554
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:24,500
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...

555
00:56:24,808 --> 00:56:28,005
...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

556
00:56:28,312 --> 00:56:31,182
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

557
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:34,929
You still speak in riddles.

558
00:56:37,921 --> 00:56:44,064
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.

559
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:47,974
The Ents are going to wake up...

560
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:52,975
... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

561
00:56:53,936 --> 00:56:55,049
Oh, that's good.

562
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:57,858
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

563
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:01,213
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

564
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,991
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

565
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:08,893
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

566
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:32,679
That is one of the Mearas...

567
00:57:32,906 --> 00:57:35,590
...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

568
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:55,499
Shadowfax.

569
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:00,676
He is the lord of all horses...

570
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,174
...and has been my friend through many dangers.

571
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:24,033
<i>"O rowan mine</i>

572
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:28,001
<i>I saw you shine</i>

573
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:31,708
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

574
00:58:32,931 --> 00:58:37,241
<i>Upon your head how golden-red</i>

575
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:42,141
<i>The crown you bore aloft."</i>

576
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:44,808
Such a beautiful verse.

577
00:58:45,076 --> 00:58:49,778
- Is it much further?
- Búrarum. Don't be hasty.

578
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:53,277
You might call it far, perhaps.

579
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:57,962
My home lies deep in the forest...

580
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,062
...near the roots of the mountain.

581
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:07,071
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

582
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:11,260
And safe is where I'll keep you.

583
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:15,858
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

584
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:19,308
It's one of my own compositions.

585
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:20,754
Right.

586
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:26,858
<i>"Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

587
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:31,953
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

588
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:38,519
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

589
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,887
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

590
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,048
<i>Come back to me</i>

591
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:50,977
<i>Come back to me</i>

592
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:57,504
<i>And say my land is best."</i>

593
01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:08,731
Sleep, little Shirelings.

594
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:12,502
Heed no nightly noise.

595
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:16,568
Sleep till morning light.

596
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:22,359
I have business in the forest.

597
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:28,004
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

598
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:33,947
The shadow lies on Fangorn.

599
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:39,910
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

600
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:53,651
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.

601
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:57,119
Sauron will suffer no rival.

602
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:01,759
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his eye watches ceaselessly.

603
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:05,401
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

604
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:08,464
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

605
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:11,167
The rumor has reached him.

606
01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:14,295
The heir of Númenor still lives.

607
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:18,102
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

608
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,626
He fears what you may become.

609
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:26,253
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

610
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:30,041
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

611
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:31,795
War is coming.

612
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:35,448
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...

613
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:38,105
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

614
01:01:38,373 --> 01:01:41,918
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.

615
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:45,210
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.

616
01:01:45,513 --> 01:01:50,019
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

617
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:53,091
But for all their cunning...

618
01:01:53,353 --> 01:01:55,808
...we have one advantage.

619
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:00,515
The ring remains hidden.

620
01:02:01,663 --> 01:02:03,551
And that we should seek to destroy it...

621
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:06,645
...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

622
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:10,532
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...

623
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:12,266
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

624
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:16,433
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

625
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,296
We must trust now in Frodo.

626
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:21,335
Everything depends upon speed...

627
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,450
...and the secrecy of his quest.

628
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:29,715
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

629
01:02:30,722 --> 01:02:33,373
Frodo must finish this task alone.

630
01:02:34,225 --> 01:02:36,462
He's not alone.

631
01:02:36,728 --> 01:02:38,354
Sam went with him.

632
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:40,242
Did he?

633
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:44,906
Did he, indeed? Good.

634
01:02:45,705 --> 01:02:48,040
Yes, very good.

635
01:02:56,148 --> 01:03:00,816
The Black Gate of Mordor.

636
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,208
Oh, save us.

637
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:15,194
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.

638
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:21,844
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

639
01:03:22,205 --> 01:03:25,500
So good Sméagol does, master says so.

640
01:03:25,808 --> 01:03:26,986
I did.

641
01:03:35,785 --> 01:03:37,727
That's it, then.

642
01:03:39,355 --> 01:03:40,599
We can't get past that.

643
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:27,142
Look!

644
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,774
The gate.

645
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:30,148
It's opening!

646
01:04:37,611 --> 01:04:39,521
I can see a way down.

647
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,350
Sam, no!

648
01:04:44,616 --> 01:04:45,925
Master!

649
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:13,214
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

650
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:17,169
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

651
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:19,494
- Now!
- No!

652
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,049
No! No, master!

653
01:06:22,308 --> 01:06:25,178
They catch you! They catch you!

654
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,034
Don't take it to him.

655
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:34,703
He wants the precious.

656
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:37,890
Always he is looking for it.

657
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:41,933
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

658
01:06:42,328 --> 01:06:46,071
But we mustn't let him have it.

659
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,644
No! There's another way.

660
01:06:54,906 --> 01:06:57,460
More secret. A dark way.

661
01:06:57,876 --> 01:07:01,390
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

662
01:07:02,013 --> 01:07:03,060
He's up to something.

663
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:06,204
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

664
01:07:06,486 --> 01:07:09,101
Yes. There's a path...

665
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:11,775
...and some stairs.

666
01:07:12,088 --> 01:07:13,681
And then...

667
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:17,120
...a tunnel.

668
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:32,964
He's led us this far, Sam.

669
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:34,550
Mr. Frodo, no.

670
01:07:35,746 --> 01:07:37,153
He's been true to his word.

671
01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:43,231
No.

672
01:07:45,421 --> 01:07:46,982
Lead the way, Sméagol.

673
01:07:47,658 --> 01:07:51,433
Good Sméagol always helps.

674
01:08:25,592 --> 01:08:26,542
Hello?

675
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,971
Treebeard?

676
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:33,041
Where has he gone?

677
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:35,601
I had the loveliest dream last night.

678
01:08:36,337 --> 01:08:38,922
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

679
01:08:39,206 --> 01:08:41,596
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

680
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:44,064
...you were sick.

681
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,460
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

682
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:53,939
Did you hear that?

683
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:02,499
There it is again.

684
01:09:03,461 --> 01:09:07,903
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

685
01:09:11,872 --> 01:09:14,686
You just said something...Treeish.

686
01:09:14,973 --> 01:09:18,803
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

687
01:09:26,517 --> 01:09:28,305
You're taller.

688
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,349
- Who?
- You!

689
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:32,149
- Than what?
- Than me!

690
01:09:32,724 --> 01:09:34,764
I've always been taller than you.

691
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:39,464
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

692
01:09:40,496 --> 01:09:41,957
Please, Merry.

693
01:09:42,197 --> 01:09:45,874
You're what? 3 foot, 6"? At the most?

694
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:49,319
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

695
01:09:51,575 --> 01:09:53,746
3'8"!

696
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:57,535
3 foot 8"?

697
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:02,506
You did something.

698
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,918
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

699
01:10:10,893 --> 01:10:12,322
Merry!

700
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:14,797
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

701
01:10:15,063 --> 01:10:18,806
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

702
01:10:19,134 --> 01:10:21,206
Give me it back. Merry!

703
01:10:23,138 --> 01:10:24,447
What's happening?!

704
01:10:25,374 --> 01:10:26,780
It's got my leg!

705
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:28,602
Merry!

706
01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:49,588
Help!

707
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:58,190
Away with you.

708
01:10:58,437 --> 01:11:00,162
You should not be waking.

709
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:05,474
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

710
01:11:06,278 --> 01:11:08,734
Go to sleep.

711
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,971
Away with you.

712
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:14,382
Come, the forest is waking up.

713
01:11:15,089 --> 01:11:16,943
It isn't safe.

714
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:23,432
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

715
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:26,664
Anger festers in their hearts.

716
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:29,192
Black are their thoughts.

717
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:31,856
Strong is their hate.

718
01:11:32,136 --> 01:11:34,787
They will harm you if they can.

719
01:11:35,072 --> 01:11:38,487
There are too few of us now.

720
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:42,638
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

721
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:45,967
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?

722
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,315
- Are there Ent children?
- Búrarum.

723
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:55,021
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.

724
01:11:55,425 --> 01:12:00,445
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

725
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:02,272
Oh, I'm sorry.

726
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:06,275
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

727
01:12:06,604 --> 01:12:09,700
We lost them.

728
01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:14,860
And now we cannot find them.

729
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:21,223
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

730
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:24,104
Can't say that I have.

731
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,694
You, Pip?

732
01:12:28,222 --> 01:12:30,524
What do they look like?

733
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:37,534
I don't remember now.

734
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:57,889
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

735
01:12:58,783 --> 01:13:01,337
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

736
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:04,936
...whose mind is overthrown.

737
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:09,316
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.

738
01:13:10,128 --> 01:13:13,162
My lord, your son...

739
01:13:13,465 --> 01:13:15,571
...he is dead.

740
01:13:17,168 --> 01:13:18,891
My lord?

741
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:21,352
Uncle?

742
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:30,386
Will you not go to him?

743
01:13:33,586 --> 01:13:35,887
Will you do nothing?

744
01:13:36,154 --> 01:13:38,064
Be careful what you say.

745
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,397
Do not look for welcome here.

746
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:08,574
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

747
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:10,991
What a tragedy for the king...

748
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:14,135
...to lose his only son and heir.

749
01:14:15,358 --> 01:14:19,701
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

750
01:14:20,062 --> 01:14:24,765
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

751
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:26,541
Leave me alone, snake!

752
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,630
Oh, but you are alone.

753
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:35,912
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

754
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:39,572
...in the bitter watches of the night...

755
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,426
...when all your life seems to shrink.

756
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:47,778
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

757
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:52,498
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

758
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:56,752
So fair.

759
01:14:58,098 --> 01:14:59,407
So cold.

760
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,374
Like a morning of pale spring...

761
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,966
...still clinging to winter's chill.

762
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:23,243
Your words are poison.

763
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,268
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

764
01:17:12,759 --> 01:17:16,403
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

765
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:20,520
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

766
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:39,642
Your staff.

767
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:46,471
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

768
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:08,192
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

769
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,114
He's a herald of woe.

770
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:22,611
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...

771
01:18:23,894 --> 01:18:25,268
...Théoden King.

772
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:28,451
He's not welcome.

773
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:34,585
Why should I welcome you...

774
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:38,818
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

775
01:18:39,143 --> 01:18:42,307
A just question, my liege.

776
01:18:42,612 --> 01:18:45,359
Late is the hour...

777
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:49,443
...in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

778
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,392
Lathspell I name him.

779
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:55,436
Ill news is an ill guest.

780
01:18:55,723 --> 01:19:00,098
Be silent!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

781
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:02,316
I have not passed through fire and death...

782
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:05,663
...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

783
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:08,808
His staff.

784
01:19:09,069 --> 01:19:13,031
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

785
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:18,400
Théoden...

786
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:21,502
...son of Théngel...

787
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:25,653
...too long have you sat in the shadows.

788
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:31,853
I would stay still if I were you.

789
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,166
Harken to me!

790
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:41,803
I release you...

791
01:19:42,066 --> 01:19:43,954
...from the spell.

792
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:58,484
You have no power here...

793
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:02,264
...Gandalf the Grey.

794
01:20:07,825 --> 01:20:12,681
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.

795
01:20:22,306 --> 01:20:23,768
Wait.

796
01:20:25,274 --> 01:20:28,953
If I go, Théoden dies.

797
01:20:29,813 --> 01:20:31,918
You did not kill me...

798
01:20:32,182 --> 01:20:34,287
...you will not kill him.

799
01:20:38,288 --> 01:20:39,913
Rohan is mine.

800
01:20:41,457 --> 01:20:42,734
Be gone.

801
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,340
I know your face.

802
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:35,217
Èowyn.

803
01:21:37,578 --> 01:21:38,788
Èowyn.

804
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,265
Gandalf?

805
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:51,604
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

806
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:07,591
Dark have been my dreams of late.

807
01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:15,454
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...

808
01:22:15,779 --> 01:22:18,627
...if they grasped your sword.

809
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:05,768
I've only...

810
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:08,963
...ever served you, my lord.

811
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:14,053
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!

812
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,125
Send me not from your sight.

813
01:23:19,508 --> 01:23:22,127
No, my lord! No, my lord.

814
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:23,589
Let him go.

815
01:23:24,346 --> 01:23:27,445
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

816
01:23:36,691 --> 01:23:38,927
Get out of my way!

817
01:23:41,262 --> 01:23:44,294
Hail, Théoden King!

818
01:24:09,054 --> 01:24:11,475
Where is Théodred?

819
01:24:14,593 --> 01:24:17,048
Where is my son?

820
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:07,492
"Bealocwealm...
("An evil death...)

821
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:14,895
...hafað fréone frecan forth onsended...
(...has set forth the noble warrior...)

822
01:25:15,298 --> 01:25:21,698
...giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende."
(...A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels.")

823
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:29,481
"On Meduselde þæt he ma no wære...
("In Meduseld that he is no more...)

824
01:25:30,309 --> 01:25:33,809
...is þurh niedig rest."
(...for his necessary rest.")

825
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:37,963
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...)

826
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:41,142
...bealo..."
(...killing took him...")

827
01:25:44,344 --> 01:25:46,002
Simbelmynë.

828
01:25:51,218 --> 01:25:54,666
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.

829
01:25:58,658 --> 01:26:01,506
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

830
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:07,474
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

831
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:12,623
The young perish and the old linger.

832
01:26:13,404 --> 01:26:15,412
That I should live...

833
01:26:15,674 --> 01:26:18,903
...to see the last days of my house.

834
01:26:20,278 --> 01:26:23,987
Théodred's death was not of your making.

835
01:26:27,185 --> 01:26:30,447
No parent should have to bury their child.

836
01:26:47,304 --> 01:26:49,092
He was strong in life.

837
01:26:50,274 --> 01:26:53,691
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.

838
01:27:03,933 --> 01:27:07,033
"Westu hál."
("Be thou well.")

839
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:11,095
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu."
("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)

840
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:40,236
They had no warning.

841
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:42,825
They were unarmed.

842
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:47,229
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

843
01:27:48,349 --> 01:27:50,299
Rick, cot and tree.

844
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,790
Where is Mama?

845
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:57,692
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.

846
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:02,260
All the more potent, for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.

847
01:28:03,986 --> 01:28:06,886
Ride out and meet him head on.

848
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:11,029
Draw him away from your women and children.

849
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:13,193
You must fight.

850
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:17,120
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

851
01:28:17,384 --> 01:28:18,984
Èomer is loyal to you.

852
01:28:19,209 --> 01:28:21,809
His men will return and fight for their king.

853
01:28:22,076 --> 01:28:25,876
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

854
01:28:29,635 --> 01:28:31,835
Èomer cannot help us.

855
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:34,250
I know what it is you want of me...

856
01:28:34,431 --> 01:28:37,631
...but I will not bring further death to my people.

857
01:28:39,019 --> 01:28:41,019
I will not risk open war.

858
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:46,537
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

859
01:28:50,902 --> 01:28:52,502
When last I looked...

860
01:28:52,988 --> 01:28:56,488
...Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

861
01:29:03,518 --> 01:29:05,718
Then what is the king's decision?

862
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,651
By order of the king...

863
01:29:12,877 --> 01:29:14,284
...the city must empty.

864
01:29:15,513 --> 01:29:18,262
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

865
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:22,424
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

866
01:29:22,786 --> 01:29:24,215
Helm's Deep.

867
01:29:24,453 --> 01:29:27,837
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.

868
01:29:28,157 --> 01:29:30,044
Who will defend them if not their king?

869
01:29:30,293 --> 01:29:32,658
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

870
01:29:32,926 --> 01:29:34,650
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

871
01:29:34,895 --> 01:29:38,638
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

872
01:29:38,966 --> 01:29:41,071
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

873
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:43,408
What they will get is a massacre.

874
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:47,429
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

875
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:51,606
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

876
01:29:52,213 --> 01:29:54,962
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

877
01:29:55,549 --> 01:29:58,233
The people of Rohan will need you.

878
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,087
The defenses have to hold.

879
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,283
They will hold.

880
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:10,566
The Grey Pilgrim.

881
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:13,352
That's what they used to call me.

882
01:30:13,634 --> 01:30:18,523
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, 
and now I have no time.

883
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,443
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

884
01:30:23,076 --> 01:30:26,240
Look to my coming at first 
light on the fifth day.

885
01:30:27,245 --> 01:30:29,831
At dawn, look to the east.

886
01:30:30,116 --> 01:30:31,610
Go.

887
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,575
<i>Brego!</i>

888
01:30:58,724 --> 01:31:02,224
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

889
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:08,429
- Fæste ... stille nú.
(- Fast ... quiet now.)

890
01:31:11,025 --> 01:31:17,725
Fæste ... stille nú.
(Fast ... quiet now.)

891
01:31:20,617 --> 01:31:25,617
Stille ... stille ... stille.
(Quiet ... quiet ... quiet.)

892
01:31:27,499 --> 01:31:32,399
Lac is drefed, gefrægon.
(A battle is stirred up, they heard.)

893
01:31:36,882 --> 01:31:41,182
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?)

894
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:43,365
His name is Brego.

895
01:31:44,953 --> 01:31:46,776
He was my cousin's horse.

896
01:31:46,996 --> 01:31:48,796
Brego?

897
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:52,602
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)

898
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:55,947
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?)

899
01:32:01,278 --> 01:32:03,278
Man cenich?
(What did you see?)

900
01:32:03,637 --> 01:32:05,939
I have heard of the magic of Elves but...

901
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:09,370
...I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

902
01:32:10,536 --> 01:32:12,878
You speak as one of their own.

903
01:32:14,727 --> 01:32:17,112
I was raised in Rivendell...

904
01:32:17,483 --> 01:32:18,946
...for a time.

905
01:32:22,322 --> 01:32:24,264
Turn this fellow free.

906
01:32:24,991 --> 01:32:27,380
He's seen enough of war.

907
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,989
Gandalf the White.

908
01:32:42,275 --> 01:32:44,545
Gandalf the Fool!

909
01:32:45,912 --> 01:32:49,806
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

910
01:32:51,216 --> 01:32:54,990
There were three who followed the wizard.

911
01:32:55,553 --> 01:33:00,671
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

912
01:33:01,258 --> 01:33:03,942
You stink of horse.

913
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,122
The Man...

914
01:33:13,236 --> 01:33:17,264
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

915
01:33:17,609 --> 01:33:21,253
One of the Dúnedain Rangers, I thought he was.

916
01:33:21,579 --> 01:33:23,303
His cloth was poor.

917
01:33:24,282 --> 01:33:29,203
And yet he bore a strange ring.

918
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,903
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

919
01:33:34,224 --> 01:33:39,820
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

920
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:42,051
The Ring of Barahir.

921
01:33:43,098 --> 01:33:46,545
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

922
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:50,064
The lost king of Gondor - He is a fool.

923
01:33:50,372 --> 01:33:52,990
The line was broken years ago.

924
01:33:54,477 --> 01:33:55,938
It matters not.

925
01:33:56,177 --> 01:33:58,599
The world of Men shall fall.

926
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:00,670
It will begin at Edoras.

927
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,812
I am ready, Gamling.

928
01:34:12,059 --> 01:34:14,427
Bring my horse.

929
01:34:17,699 --> 01:34:19,008
This is not a defeat.

930
01:34:21,469 --> 01:34:22,646
We will return.

931
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:30,442
We will return.

932
01:34:53,932 --> 01:34:55,787
You have some skill with a blade.

933
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:06,384
Women of this country learned long ago:

934
01:35:06,645 --> 01:35:09,165
"Those without swords can still die upon them."

935
01:35:09,448 --> 01:35:11,205
I fear neither death nor pain.

936
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:14,557
What do you fear, my lady?

937
01:35:18,023 --> 01:35:19,777
A cage.

938
01:35:21,156 --> 01:35:24,835
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

939
01:35:25,162 --> 01:35:28,904
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

940
01:35:32,502 --> 01:35:34,444
You're a daughter of kings...

941
01:35:35,805 --> 01:35:38,969
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

942
01:35:44,381 --> 01:35:46,803
I do not think that would be your fate.

943
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,883
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

944
01:36:23,184 --> 01:36:25,191
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

945
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:28,235
He will expect an attack on the city.

946
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:32,788
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

947
01:36:33,093 --> 01:36:35,330
...the great fortress of Rohan.

948
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:40,853
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

949
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:44,127
They will be slow.

950
01:36:44,571 --> 01:36:48,828
They will have women and children with them.

951
01:36:52,879 --> 01:36:55,051
Send out your Warg Riders.

952
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:12,810
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

953
01:37:13,097 --> 01:37:15,650
- Why do you do that?
- What?

954
01:37:15,934 --> 01:37:18,356
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

955
01:37:18,903 --> 01:37:20,845
Because.

956
01:37:22,473 --> 01:37:24,513
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

957
01:37:24,775 --> 01:37:26,881
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

958
01:37:27,412 --> 01:37:30,062
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

959
01:37:30,348 --> 01:37:32,520
You have no idea what it did to him...

960
01:37:32,785 --> 01:37:35,174
...what it's still doing to him.

961
01:37:37,489 --> 01:37:39,497
I want to help him, Sam.

962
01:37:39,757 --> 01:37:40,968
Why?

963
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:49,329
Because I have to believe he can come back.

964
01:37:53,703 --> 01:37:55,557
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

965
01:37:55,804 --> 01:37:58,423
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

966
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,506
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

967
01:38:10,519 --> 01:38:11,599
I do.

968
01:38:13,689 --> 01:38:15,477
It's the Ring.

969
01:38:16,126 --> 01:38:17,620
You can't take your eyes off it.

970
01:38:18,427 --> 01:38:20,314
I've seen you.

971
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:24,540
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

972
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:28,606
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

973
01:38:28,871 --> 01:38:31,456
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

974
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:34,555
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

975
01:38:34,843 --> 01:38:36,502
Mine! My own!

976
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,450
Can't you hear yourself?

977
01:38:39,712 --> 01:38:41,305
Don't you know who you sound like?

978
01:38:51,657 --> 01:38:53,697
We wants it.

979
01:38:53,959 --> 01:38:56,546
We needs it.

980
01:38:56,830 --> 01:39:01,435
Must have the precious.

981
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:05,096
They stole it from us.

982
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:08,634
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

983
01:39:08,942 --> 01:39:12,684
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

984
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:16,143
No. Not master.

985
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:20,127
Yes, precious. False.

986
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:24,763
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

987
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:28,457
Master's my friend.

988
01:39:28,726 --> 01:39:33,582
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

989
01:39:35,065 --> 01:39:37,454
Not listening. I'm not listening.

990
01:39:37,734 --> 01:39:41,565
You're a liar and a thief.

991
01:39:42,373 --> 01:39:43,867
No.

992
01:39:44,842 --> 01:39:47,625
Murderer.

993
01:39:50,213 --> 01:39:51,195
Go away.

994
01:39:51,414 --> 01:39:53,684
Go away?

995
01:39:55,785 --> 01:39:58,469
I hate you.

996
01:39:58,756 --> 01:40:01,058
I hate you.

997
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:04,623
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

998
01:40:04,929 --> 01:40:06,685
I saved us.

999
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:11,274
It was me.
We survived because of me.

1000
01:40:12,669 --> 01:40:16,116
Not anymore.

1001
01:40:17,605 --> 01:40:19,099
What did you say?

1002
01:40:21,243 --> 01:40:24,920
Master looks after us now.

1003
01:40:25,247 --> 01:40:28,596
We don't need you.

1004
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:30,945
What?

1005
01:40:31,185 --> 01:40:32,876
Leave now...

1006
01:40:33,122 --> 01:40:36,767
...and never come back.

1007
01:40:37,092 --> 01:40:38,074
No.

1008
01:40:38,627 --> 01:40:42,652
Leave now and never come back.

1009
01:40:45,433 --> 01:40:51,097
Leave now and never come back!

1010
01:41:03,318 --> 01:41:05,903
We told him to go away.

1011
01:41:06,187 --> 01:41:09,033
And away he goes, precious.

1012
01:41:09,321 --> 01:41:11,230
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1013
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:13,246
Sméagol is free!

1014
01:41:18,196 --> 01:41:19,625
Look.

1015
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:24,175
Look, see what Sméagol finds?

1016
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,252
They are young.

1017
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,902
They are tender. They are nice.

1018
01:41:38,182 --> 01:41:41,566
Yes, they are.
Eat them. Eat them!

1019
01:41:44,421 --> 01:41:45,949
You'll make him sick, you will...

1020
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,331
...behaving like that.

1021
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:54,481
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

1022
01:41:58,801 --> 01:42:00,296
What's it doing?

1023
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:03,623
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1024
01:42:03,906 --> 01:42:06,012
It ruins it.

1025
01:42:06,276 --> 01:42:09,756
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1026
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,505
What we need is a few good taters.

1027
01:42:17,486 --> 01:42:20,421
What's taters, precious?

1028
01:42:20,723 --> 01:42:22,381
What's taters - Eh?

1029
01:42:22,624 --> 01:42:24,282
Po-ta-toes.

1030
01:42:24,693 --> 01:42:27,792
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1031
01:42:29,432 --> 01:42:34,703
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.

1032
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,062
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1033
01:42:38,474 --> 01:42:40,579
Oh, yes, we could.

1034
01:42:40,843 --> 01:42:44,191
Spoil a nice fish.

1035
01:42:45,615 --> 01:42:48,133
Give it to us raw...

1036
01:42:48,415 --> 01:42:51,317
...and wriggling.

1037
01:42:51,619 --> 01:42:54,619
You keep nasty chips.

1038
01:42:55,688 --> 01:42:57,663
You're hopeless.

1039
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,700
Mr. Frodo?

1040
01:43:29,657 --> 01:43:32,210
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1041
01:43:32,492 --> 01:43:34,859
Servants of Sauron.

1042
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:37,865
They are called to Mordor.

1043
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:41,031
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1044
01:43:41,331 --> 01:43:44,365
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1045
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:49,583
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1046
01:43:49,907 --> 01:43:54,862
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.

1047
01:43:55,347 --> 01:43:58,281
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1048
01:43:58,583 --> 01:43:59,760
Mr. Frodo.

1049
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:01,879
Look.

1050
01:44:05,556 --> 01:44:07,794
It's an Oliphant.

1051
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:18,968
No one at home will believe this.

1052
01:44:30,245 --> 01:44:32,034
Sméagol?

1053
01:45:12,487 --> 01:45:14,854
We've lingered here too long.

1054
01:45:17,957 --> 01:45:19,235
Come on, Sam.

1055
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:35,357
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1056
01:45:36,995 --> 01:45:42,095
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1057
01:45:42,448 --> 01:45:45,218
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1058
01:45:46,587 --> 01:45:49,943
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1059
01:45:50,236 --> 01:45:52,229
The enemy?

1060
01:45:54,355 --> 01:45:57,741
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1061
01:46:00,245 --> 01:46:02,369
You wonder what his name is...

1062
01:46:03,895 --> 01:46:06,137
...where he came from.

1063
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:10,538
And if he was really evil at heart.

1064
01:46:12,234 --> 01:46:15,623
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.

1065
01:46:17,342 --> 01:46:19,745
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1066
01:46:22,034 --> 01:46:23,512
...in peace.

1067
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:30,022
War will make corpses of us all.

1068
01:46:30,271 --> 01:46:32,299
Bind their hands.

1069
01:46:39,368 --> 01:46:41,868
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

1070
01:46:42,236 --> 01:46:45,386
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...

1071
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:48,542
...that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

1072
01:46:49,692 --> 01:46:51,192
It's the beards.

1073
01:46:51,777 --> 01:46:53,977
And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

1074
01:46:54,176 --> 01:46:56,376
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1075
01:46:56,991 --> 01:47:00,791
...and the Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground...

1076
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:05,239
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1077
01:47:10,965 --> 01:47:13,575
It's all right, it's all right. Nobody panic.

1078
01:47:13,728 --> 01:47:16,278
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

1079
01:47:17,545 --> 01:47:20,835
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

1080
01:47:21,288 --> 01:47:24,338
She was a girl, when they brought her father back dead.

1081
01:47:24,834 --> 01:47:26,634
Cut down by Orcs.

1082
01:47:27,232 --> 01:47:29,432
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

1083
01:47:30,465 --> 01:47:35,165
And she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.

1084
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,579
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.

1085
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:51,690
Gimli.

1086
01:47:52,259 --> 01:47:53,459
Oh No, I couldn't

1087
01:47:54,983 --> 01:47:56,735
<i>I really couldn't.</i>

1088
01:48:01,436 --> 01:48:02,936
I made some stew.

1089
01:48:03,313 --> 01:48:05,713
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1090
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:15,358
Thank you.

1091
01:48:36,995 --> 01:48:39,095
- It's good.
- Really?

1092
01:48:43,564 --> 01:48:46,364
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1093
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,340
He said that you rode to war
with Théngel, my grandfather

1094
01:48:52,689 --> 01:48:54,739
But he must be mistaken.

1095
01:48:55,296 --> 01:48:59,846
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1096
01:49:00,614 --> 01:49:03,064
Then you must be at least 60.

1097
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:07,388
70?

1098
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:10,365
But you cannot be 80!?

1099
01:49:13,075 --> 01:49:14,375
87.

1100
01:49:17,507 --> 01:49:19,957
You are one of the Dúnedain.

1101
01:49:20,687 --> 01:49:24,487
A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life.

1102
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:28,063
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

1103
01:49:28,196 --> 01:49:30,196
There are few of us left.

1104
01:49:30,281 --> 01:49:33,481
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

1105
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:37,639
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.

1106
01:49:52,075 --> 01:49:55,475
<i>The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.</i>

1107
01:49:56,872 --> 01:49:59,872
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1108
01:50:02,086 --> 01:50:04,886
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1109
01:50:06,049 --> 01:50:08,049
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1110
01:50:08,864 --> 01:50:10,864
I am asleep.

1111
01:50:17,728 --> 01:50:19,728
This is a dream.

1112
01:50:21,795 --> 01:50:24,395
Then it is a good dream.

1113
01:50:37,437 --> 01:50:39,537
Sleep.

1114
01:51:03,819 --> 01:51:06,119
Minlû pedich nin...
(You told me once...)

1115
01:51:07,886 --> 01:51:10,286
...i aur hen telitha.
(...this day would come.)

1116
01:51:11,015 --> 01:51:13,915
Ú i vethed...nâ i onnad.
(This is not the end...it is the beginning.)

1117
01:51:14,143 --> 01:51:16,543
Boe bedich go Frodo.
(You must go with Frodo.)

1118
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:18,658
Han bâd lîn.
(That is your path.)

1119
01:51:29,576 --> 01:51:32,176
Dolen i vâd o nin.
(My path is hidden from me.)

1120
01:51:32,705 --> 01:51:36,205
Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn.
(It is already laid before your feet.)

1121
01:51:36,563 --> 01:51:39,463
Si boe ú-dhannathach.
(You cannot falter now.)

1122
01:51:42,194 --> 01:51:43,694
Arwen...

1123
01:51:46,469 --> 01:51:48,756
Ae ú-esteliach nad...
(If you trust nothing else...)

1124
01:51:49,181 --> 01:51:51,189
...estelio han...
(...trust this...)

1125
01:51:52,309 --> 01:51:54,472
Estelio ammen.
(Trust us.)

1126
01:52:33,533 --> 01:52:35,285
Where is she?

1127
01:52:36,536 --> 01:52:38,845
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1128
01:52:42,292 --> 01:52:44,931
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

1129
01:52:45,712 --> 01:52:48,180
Arwen's time is ending.

1130
01:52:49,008 --> 01:52:50,236
Let her go.

1131
01:52:50,467 --> 01:52:52,378
Let her take the ship into the west.

1132
01:52:52,636 --> 01:52:55,594
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.

1133
01:52:55,890 --> 01:52:57,608
There it will be ever green.

1134
01:52:59,185 --> 01:53:01,460
But never more than memory.

1135
01:53:02,814 --> 01:53:05,726
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1136
01:53:06,068 --> 01:53:09,538
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1137
01:53:09,863 --> 01:53:12,093
She belongs with her people.

1138
01:53:24,492 --> 01:53:27,442
Nach gwannatha sin?
(Is this how you leave?)

1139
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,020
Ma nathach hi gwannathach...
(Did you think you could slip away at...)

1140
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:31,180
...or minuial archened?
(...at first light unnoticed?)

1141
01:53:33,722 --> 01:53:35,917
Ú-ethelithon.
(I will not be coming back.)

1142
01:53:36,744 --> 01:53:38,794
Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.
(You underestimate your skill in battle.)

1143
01:53:39,038 --> 01:53:40,388
Ethelithach.
(You will come back.)

1144
01:53:40,551 --> 01:53:42,501
Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
(It is not of death in battle that I speak.)

1145
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:45,090
O man pedich?
(What do you speak of?)

1146
01:53:49,936 --> 01:53:53,536
Edra le men, men na guil edwen
(You have a chance for another life...)

1147
01:53:55,358 --> 01:53:59,958
...haer o auth...a nîr a naeth.
(...away from war...grief, despair.)

1148
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:02,253
Why are you saying this?

1149
01:54:03,922 --> 01:54:06,959
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1150
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:11,111
It was a dream, Arwen.

1151
01:54:11,638 --> 01:54:12,957
Nothing more.

1152
01:54:14,391 --> 01:54:17,463
I don't believe you.

1153
01:54:26,613 --> 01:54:28,365
This belongs to you.

1154
01:54:31,201 --> 01:54:32,714
It was a gift.

1155
01:54:35,455 --> 01:54:36,888
Keep it.

1156
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:40,609
My lord?

1157
01:54:43,464 --> 01:54:47,855
She is sailing to the Undying Lands 
with all that is left of her kin.

1158
01:55:11,494 --> 01:55:12,927
What is it?

1159
01:55:14,497 --> 01:55:16,453
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1160
01:55:33,101 --> 01:55:35,092
Wargs!

1161
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,292
A scout!

1162
01:55:55,708 --> 01:55:58,097
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1163
01:55:59,546 --> 01:56:01,662
Get them out of here!

1164
01:56:06,512 --> 01:56:08,468
All riders to the head of the column.

1165
01:56:09,223 --> 01:56:11,134
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1166
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,064
Come on!

1167
01:56:24,948 --> 01:56:27,406
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1168
01:56:27,564 --> 01:56:29,009
- I can fight.
- No!

1169
01:56:31,747 --> 01:56:33,738
You must do this, for me.

1170
01:56:35,835 --> 01:56:37,348
Follow me!

1171
01:56:40,924 --> 01:56:45,076
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1172
01:56:45,429 --> 01:56:47,989
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1173
01:58:00,343 --> 01:58:02,538
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1174
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:06,944
That one counts as mine!

1175
01:58:23,701 --> 01:58:25,259
Stinking creature.

1176
01:59:52,588 --> 01:59:54,385
Aragorn!

1177
01:59:59,179 --> 02:00:00,578
Aragorn?

1178
02:00:14,654 --> 02:00:17,452
Tell me what happened and
I will ease your passing.

1179
02:00:17,741 --> 02:00:19,094
He's...

1180
02:00:19,743 --> 02:00:21,256
...dead.

1181
02:00:21,995 --> 02:00:24,823
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1182
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:29,790
You lie.

1183
02:01:03,707 --> 02:01:05,265
Get the wounded on horses.

1184
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:09,663
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1185
02:01:10,214 --> 02:01:12,250
Leave the dead.

1186
02:01:19,724 --> 02:01:21,157
Come.

1187
02:01:31,403 --> 02:01:32,961
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1188
02:01:33,197 --> 02:01:35,950
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1189
02:01:38,619 --> 02:01:40,371
We're safe!

1190
02:01:41,956 --> 02:01:44,709
We're safe, my lady.

1191
02:01:45,001 --> 02:01:46,150
Thank you.

1192
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:31,903
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1193
02:02:32,135 --> 02:02:33,614
Freda!

1194
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:42,154
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1195
02:02:46,109 --> 02:02:47,383
Take it to the caves.

1196
02:02:47,598 --> 02:02:50,298
Make way for the king!

1197
02:02:51,665 --> 02:02:55,130
Make way for Théoden!
Make way for the king!

1198
02:03:03,169 --> 02:03:06,764
So few...so few of you have returned.

1199
02:03:09,676 --> 02:03:11,871
Our people are safe.

1200
02:03:13,305 --> 02:03:15,739
We have paid for it with many lives.

1201
02:03:16,683 --> 02:03:18,162
My lady.

1202
02:03:21,939 --> 02:03:24,089
Lord Aragorn...

1203
02:03:24,358 --> 02:03:25,552
...where is he?

1204
02:03:27,612 --> 02:03:29,091
He fell.

1205
02:03:51,846 --> 02:03:54,679
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1206
02:03:54,974 --> 02:03:57,772
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.

1207
02:03:58,144 --> 02:04:01,102
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1208
02:04:01,398 --> 02:04:03,912
Get them into the caves.

1209
02:04:04,902 --> 02:04:09,532
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1210
02:04:11,784 --> 02:04:15,060
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1211
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:17,601
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1212
02:04:17,874 --> 02:04:20,832
<i>... but for a small culvert at its base...</i>

1213
02:04:21,128 --> 02:04:23,801
<i>... which is little more than a drain.</i>

1214
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:30,752
How? How can fire undo stone?

1215
02:04:31,097 --> 02:04:35,454
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

1216
02:04:39,272 --> 02:04:43,106
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

1217
02:04:43,443 --> 02:04:46,799
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

1218
02:04:47,114 --> 02:04:49,582
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1219
02:04:49,867 --> 02:04:51,220
Tens of thousands.

1220
02:04:51,452 --> 02:04:55,365
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1221
02:05:07,469 --> 02:05:10,427
A new power is rising.

1222
02:05:10,723 --> 02:05:13,601
Its victory is at hand.

1223
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:21,390
This night...

1224
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:26,053
...the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

1225
02:05:26,406 --> 02:05:29,603
March to Helm's Deep!

1226
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:33,266
Leave none alive!

1227
02:05:35,916 --> 02:05:38,305
To war!

1228
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:46,618
There will be no dawn for Men.

1229
02:06:03,988 --> 02:06:05,944
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1230
02:06:06,199 --> 02:06:09,236
There is always smoke rising...

1231
02:06:09,578 --> 02:06:13,253
...from Isengard these days.

1232
02:06:13,665 --> 02:06:15,178
Isengard?

1233
02:06:15,459 --> 02:06:17,256
There was a time...

1234
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:21,060
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1235
02:06:21,382 --> 02:06:24,579
But now he has a mind of metal...

1236
02:06:25,386 --> 02:06:27,741
...and wheels.

1237
02:06:28,598 --> 02:06:32,910
He no longer cares for growing things.

1238
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:34,988
What is it?

1239
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:42,185
It's Saruman's army.

1240
02:06:42,446 --> 02:06:43,959
The war has started.

1241
02:07:22,268 --> 02:07:26,518
<i>May the grace of the Valar protect you.</i>

1242
02:07:58,987 --> 02:08:00,784
Brego.

1243
02:08:26,975 --> 02:08:28,124
Arwen.

1244
02:08:29,424 --> 02:08:31,524
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)

1245
02:08:33,441 --> 02:08:35,439
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
(The ships are leaving for Valinor.)

1246
02:08:35,526 --> 02:08:37,235
Si bado, no círar.
(Go now...before it is too late.)

1247
02:08:38,029 --> 02:08:39,747
I have made my choice.

1248
02:08:46,246 --> 02:08:49,114
He is not coming back.

1249
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:53,790
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

1250
02:08:54,764 --> 02:08:57,714
There is still hope.

1251
02:09:01,959 --> 02:09:06,009
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

1252
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:12,050
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

1253
02:09:12,230 --> 02:09:14,621
...and all that you hope for comes true...

1254
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:19,490
...you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.

1255
02:09:19,907 --> 02:09:22,785
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

1256
02:09:23,078 --> 02:09:25,876
...Aragorn will die.

1257
02:09:28,834 --> 02:09:31,302
<i>And there will be no comfort for you...</i>

1258
02:09:31,587 --> 02:09:35,625
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.</i>

1259
02:09:38,594 --> 02:09:41,233
<i>He wlll come to death...</i>

1260
02:09:41,514 --> 02:09:43,982
<i>...an image of the splendor of the Kings of Men...</i>

1261
02:09:44,267 --> 02:09:48,738
<i>...in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.</i>

1262
02:09:58,032 --> 02:10:01,820
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1263
02:10:02,787 --> 02:10:07,622
<i>...you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...</i>

1264
02:10:08,001 --> 02:10:11,914
<i>...as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.</i>

1265
02:10:14,466 --> 02:10:16,775
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1266
02:10:17,052 --> 02:10:21,762
<i>...bound to your grief under the fading trees...</i>

1267
02:10:23,684 --> 02:10:25,595
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

1268
02:10:25,853 --> 02:10:30,165
<i>...and the long years of your life are utterly spent.</i>

1269
02:10:38,909 --> 02:10:40,024
Arwen.

1270
02:10:46,709 --> 02:10:48,904
There is nothing for you here...

1271
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:51,662
...only death.

1272
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:15,563
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(Do I not also have your love?)

1273
02:11:17,209 --> 02:11:19,109
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)

1274
02:12:09,974 --> 02:12:13,436
<i>I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)</i>

1275
02:12:13,936 --> 02:12:15,836
<i>Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)</i>

1276
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:18,741
<i>Han mathon ne chae,
(I feel it in the earth,)</i>

1277
02:12:19,776 --> 02:12:24,576
<i>a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)</i>

1278
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:28,660
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

1279
02:12:28,986 --> 02:12:31,500
<i>Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...</i>

1280
02:12:31,781 --> 02:12:35,091
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1281
02:12:37,287 --> 02:12:40,802
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1282
02:12:45,253 --> 02:12:48,484
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...</i>

1283
02:12:49,758 --> 02:12:52,636
<i>...the last free Kingdom of Men.</i>

1284
02:12:52,928 --> 02:12:57,126
<i>His war on this country will come swiftly.</i>

1285
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:04,012
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1286
02:13:04,316 --> 02:13:07,626
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.</i>

1287
02:13:07,945 --> 02:13:11,824
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...</i>

1288
02:13:13,534 --> 02:13:17,243
...the quest will claim his life.

1289
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:19,650
You know this.

1290
02:13:20,333 --> 02:13:23,052
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1291
02:13:25,297 --> 02:13:28,607
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1292
02:13:33,138 --> 02:13:37,177
<i>In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1293
02:13:38,519 --> 02:13:42,751
<i>It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.</i>

1294
02:13:43,107 --> 02:13:48,340
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.</i>

1295
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:52,216
<i>The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...</i>

1296
02:13:52,534 --> 02:13:56,447
<i>...take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.</i>

1297
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:00,793
<i>It is close now.</i>

1298
02:14:01,043 --> 02:14:05,116
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1299
02:14:08,385 --> 02:14:11,900
<i>For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...</i>

1300
02:14:12,222 --> 02:14:16,181
<i>...even unto to the ending of the world.</i>

1301
02:14:18,187 --> 02:14:19,939
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1302
02:14:20,231 --> 02:14:22,062
<i>...is over.</i>

1303
02:14:22,984 --> 02:14:26,420
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?</i>

1304
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,648
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1305
02:14:36,415 --> 02:14:37,689
What news?

1306
02:14:37,916 --> 02:14:40,635
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

1307
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:43,639
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

1308
02:14:43,923 --> 02:14:47,802
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1309
02:14:48,136 --> 02:14:50,445
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1310
02:14:50,889 --> 02:14:52,925
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

1311
02:14:53,183 --> 02:14:56,459
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1312
02:14:57,688 --> 02:15:01,124
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1313
02:15:01,442 --> 02:15:04,354
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

1314
02:15:06,614 --> 02:15:08,684
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1315
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:11,544
Sauron from Mordor.

1316
02:15:12,954 --> 02:15:16,071
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

1317
02:15:16,374 --> 02:15:18,012
Gondor is weak.

1318
02:15:18,252 --> 02:15:21,244
Sauron will strike us soon.

1319
02:15:22,131 --> 02:15:23,883
And he will strike hard.

1320
02:15:24,425 --> 02:15:28,338
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

1321
02:15:42,444 --> 02:15:44,560
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1322
02:15:44,822 --> 02:15:47,461
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1323
02:15:47,742 --> 02:15:49,892
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

1324
02:15:56,876 --> 02:15:58,548
Speak.

1325
02:15:59,713 --> 02:16:02,227
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1326
02:16:02,674 --> 02:16:05,552
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1327
02:16:06,095 --> 02:16:07,574
Your bodyguard?

1328
02:16:07,805 --> 02:16:09,523
His gardener.

1329
02:16:10,182 --> 02:16:12,093
And where is your skulking friend?

1330
02:16:13,686 --> 02:16:15,916
That gangrel creature.

1331
02:16:16,356 --> 02:16:18,233
He had an ill-favored look.

1332
02:16:20,026 --> 02:16:21,857
There was no other.

1333
02:16:26,033 --> 02:16:28,263
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

1334
02:16:31,706 --> 02:16:34,664
One we lost in Moria...

1335
02:16:35,877 --> 02:16:37,310
...two were my kin...

1336
02:16:37,545 --> 02:16:41,140
...a Dwarf there was also and an Elf and two Men.

1337
02:16:41,466 --> 02:16:45,220
Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.

1338
02:16:50,392 --> 02:16:52,064
You're a friend of Boromir?

1339
02:16:54,564 --> 02:16:55,997
Yes.

1340
02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:58,185
For my part.

1341
02:17:04,741 --> 02:17:07,574
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

1342
02:17:09,747 --> 02:17:11,146
Dead?

1343
02:17:11,373 --> 02:17:13,329
How? When?

1344
02:17:13,667 --> 02:17:16,227
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1345
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:20,304
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1346
02:17:23,219 --> 02:17:29,408
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.

1347
02:17:29,893 --> 02:17:32,851
It was cloven in two.

1348
02:17:34,648 --> 02:17:37,924
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1349
02:17:40,113 --> 02:17:41,831
He was my brother.

1350
02:18:30,792 --> 02:18:33,704
Boromir!

1351
02:18:34,338 --> 02:18:36,135
Boromir!

1352
02:18:40,469 --> 02:18:44,064
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

1353
02:18:44,390 --> 02:18:47,905
A place of light and beauty and music.

1354
02:18:48,228 --> 02:18:50,458
And so it shall be once more!

1355
02:18:53,108 --> 02:18:55,668
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1356
02:18:55,944 --> 02:19:00,142
Never again will the land of my
people fall into enemy hands.

1357
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:08,018
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed.

1358
02:19:08,341 --> 02:19:12,191
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1359
02:19:12,356 --> 02:19:16,906
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1360
02:19:23,849 --> 02:19:26,488
Good speech. Nice and short.

1361
02:19:26,769 --> 02:19:29,567
Leaves more time for drinking!

1362
02:19:29,981 --> 02:19:34,054
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1363
02:19:37,697 --> 02:19:39,767
Remember today, little brother.

1364
02:19:40,033 --> 02:19:42,911
Today, life is good.

1365
02:19:47,208 --> 02:19:48,721
What?

1366
02:19:49,168 --> 02:19:50,567
He's here.

1367
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:52,891
Well done men...

1368
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,752
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

1369
02:19:57,052 --> 02:20:00,362
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1370
02:20:01,056 --> 02:20:02,694
Father!

1371
02:20:07,605 --> 02:20:09,880
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.

1372
02:20:10,149 --> 02:20:13,425
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1373
02:20:15,029 --> 02:20:17,827
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

1374
02:20:18,742 --> 02:20:20,937
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1375
02:20:21,203 --> 02:20:23,159
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

1376
02:20:23,413 --> 02:20:25,051
Oh, too few.

1377
02:20:25,624 --> 02:20:27,899
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

1378
02:20:30,212 --> 02:20:33,170
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1379
02:20:33,466 --> 02:20:35,616
That is not my intent.

1380
02:20:35,885 --> 02:20:39,480
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.

1381
02:20:43,018 --> 02:20:45,816
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1382
02:20:46,104 --> 02:20:48,743
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1383
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:52,494
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1384
02:20:53,821 --> 02:20:56,130
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1385
02:20:56,407 --> 02:20:59,160
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

1386
02:20:59,452 --> 02:21:03,081
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.

1387
02:21:05,459 --> 02:21:07,654
The One Ring.

1388
02:21:10,506 --> 02:21:14,977
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1389
02:21:15,344 --> 02:21:18,814
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, Wizards.

1390
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:23,099
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1391
02:21:25,063 --> 02:21:27,623
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1392
02:21:27,899 --> 02:21:31,448
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt 
the hearts of lesser Men. But you!...

1393
02:21:31,779 --> 02:21:35,567
You are strong.
And our need is great.

1394
02:21:35,908 --> 02:21:40,982
It is our blood which is being spilled, 
our people who are dying.

1395
02:21:41,372 --> 02:21:46,241
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1396
02:21:46,628 --> 02:21:48,061
He will return.

1397
02:21:48,296 --> 02:21:51,891
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

1398
02:21:52,217 --> 02:21:54,651
You must go.

1399
02:21:55,930 --> 02:21:57,966
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1400
02:21:58,891 --> 02:22:04,170
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1401
02:22:04,564 --> 02:22:08,079
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1402
02:22:08,401 --> 02:22:11,279
...send me in his stead.
- You?

1403
02:22:12,572 --> 02:22:14,403
Oh, I see.

1404
02:22:14,658 --> 02:22:18,697
A chance for Faramir, captain of
Gondor, to show his quality.

1405
02:22:19,288 --> 02:22:21,199
I think not.

1406
02:22:21,457 --> 02:22:24,210
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1407
02:22:24,502 --> 02:22:27,300
The one who will not fail me.

1408
02:22:44,565 --> 02:22:47,602
Remember today, little brother.

1409
02:23:06,088 --> 02:23:07,999
Captain Faramir!

1410
02:23:09,342 --> 02:23:11,378
<i>We found the third one.</i>

1411
02:23:22,982 --> 02:23:24,893
You must come with me. Now.

1412
02:23:36,204 --> 02:23:37,273
Down there.

1413
02:23:52,221 --> 02:23:54,974
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1414
02:24:05,694 --> 02:24:07,127
They wait for my command.

1415
02:24:12,702 --> 02:24:13,737
Shall I shoot?

1416
02:24:15,038 --> 02:24:17,916
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1417
02:24:18,208 --> 02:24:19,960
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1418
02:24:20,710 --> 02:24:23,543
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1419
02:24:23,839 --> 02:24:26,433
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1420
02:24:33,558 --> 02:24:34,877
Wait.

1421
02:24:36,436 --> 02:24:39,155
This creature is bound to me.

1422
02:24:39,898 --> 02:24:41,729
And I to him.

1423
02:24:45,070 --> 02:24:46,344
He is our guide.

1424
02:24:51,118 --> 02:24:52,471
Please...

1425
02:24:52,703 --> 02:24:54,500
...let me go down to him.

1426
02:25:05,842 --> 02:25:07,434
Sméagol.

1427
02:25:08,512 --> 02:25:10,662
Master is here.

1428
02:25:11,932 --> 02:25:13,047
Come, Sméagol.

1429
02:25:15,937 --> 02:25:18,497
Trust master. Come.

1430
02:25:21,776 --> 02:25:25,451
We must go now?

1431
02:25:25,947 --> 02:25:29,257
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1432
02:25:29,576 --> 02:25:30,895
Follow me. Come on.

1433
02:25:32,162 --> 02:25:33,720
Come.

1434
02:25:36,292 --> 02:25:37,407
Come, Sméagol.

1435
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:39,951
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1436
02:25:40,546 --> 02:25:42,025
Come on.

1437
02:25:46,469 --> 02:25:48,061
Don't hurt him!

1438
02:25:48,305 --> 02:25:50,944
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1439
02:25:51,224 --> 02:25:52,452
Master!

1440
02:26:17,711 --> 02:26:19,986
That's enough.

1441
02:26:23,718 --> 02:26:25,788
Where are you leading them?

1442
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:29,272
Answer me.

1443
02:26:30,183 --> 02:26:33,255
Sméagol.

1444
02:26:36,857 --> 02:26:41,408
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1445
02:26:42,863 --> 02:26:45,377
Cruel Men hurts us.

1446
02:26:45,658 --> 02:26:48,536
Master tricksed us.

1447
02:26:48,828 --> 02:26:52,218
Of course he did.

1448
02:26:52,749 --> 02:26:56,298
I told you he was tricksy.

1449
02:26:56,628 --> 02:26:59,540
I told you he was false.

1450
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,434
Master is our friend.

1451
02:27:02,718 --> 02:27:04,948
Our friend.

1452
02:27:05,221 --> 02:27:07,291
Master betrayed us.

1453
02:27:07,557 --> 02:27:10,435
No. Not its business.

1454
02:27:11,644 --> 02:27:13,953
Leave us alone!

1455
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:16,539
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1456
02:27:16,817 --> 02:27:19,012
They stole it from us!

1457
02:27:19,278 --> 02:27:20,677
No. No.

1458
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,838
What did they steal?

1459
02:27:25,076 --> 02:27:30,196
My precious!

1460
02:27:34,085 --> 02:27:35,677
We have to get out of here.

1461
02:27:36,338 --> 02:27:38,215
You go. Go, now.

1462
02:27:40,926 --> 02:27:42,678
You can do it.

1463
02:27:44,221 --> 02:27:45,620
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1464
02:27:45,848 --> 02:27:47,566
Just this once.

1465
02:27:47,808 --> 02:27:49,526
Put it on.

1466
02:27:50,019 --> 02:27:51,975
Disappear.

1467
02:27:53,106 --> 02:27:54,141
I can't.

1468
02:27:57,277 --> 02:27:59,393
You were right, Sam.

1469
02:28:00,947 --> 02:28:03,336
You tried to tell me but...

1470
02:28:08,122 --> 02:28:10,192
I'm sorry.

1471
02:28:14,837 --> 02:28:17,590
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1472
02:28:19,134 --> 02:28:20,726
If I put it on...

1473
02:28:20,969 --> 02:28:23,199
...he'll find me.

1474
02:28:24,973 --> 02:28:26,850
He'll see.

1475
02:28:28,143 --> 02:28:30,054
Mr. Frodo...

1476
02:28:35,068 --> 02:28:39,141
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1477
02:28:41,533 --> 02:28:44,411
Here in the Wild I have you...

1478
02:28:44,703 --> 02:28:46,534
...two Halflings...

1479
02:28:46,788 --> 02:28:49,825
...and a host of men at my call.

1480
02:28:53,254 --> 02:28:56,610
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1481
02:29:06,435 --> 02:29:10,030
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1482
02:29:11,774 --> 02:29:14,686
...to show his quality.

1483
02:29:35,925 --> 02:29:37,483
No!

1484
02:29:40,722 --> 02:29:41,996
Stop it!

1485
02:29:42,223 --> 02:29:43,212
Leave him alone.

1486
02:29:44,601 --> 02:29:46,990
Don't you understand?

1487
02:29:48,396 --> 02:29:50,227
He's got to destroy it!

1488
02:29:50,482 --> 02:29:53,599
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1489
02:29:53,902 --> 02:29:55,494
To the Mountain of Fire!

1490
02:29:56,614 --> 02:29:59,606
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1491
02:29:59,909 --> 02:30:02,787
Please. It's such a burden.

1492
02:30:05,081 --> 02:30:07,072
Will you not help him?

1493
02:30:08,501 --> 02:30:10,332
Captain?

1494
02:30:11,088 --> 02:30:13,204
Prepare to leave.

1495
02:30:18,262 --> 02:30:20,571
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1496
02:31:21,213 --> 02:31:25,813
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)

1497
02:31:33,676 --> 02:31:36,236
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1498
02:31:36,513 --> 02:31:39,425
Get out of the way!
I'm gonna kill him!

1499
02:31:39,725 --> 02:31:43,354
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1500
02:31:43,687 --> 02:31:47,521
...and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1501
02:31:48,359 --> 02:31:49,792
Bless you, laddie.

1502
02:31:50,444 --> 02:31:52,116
Gimli, where is the king?

1503
02:32:01,206 --> 02:32:02,195
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)

1504
02:32:05,961 --> 02:32:07,235
You look terrible.

1505
02:32:34,469 --> 02:32:36,219
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1506
02:32:49,049 --> 02:32:51,005
A great host, you say

1507
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:53,820
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1508
02:32:54,597 --> 02:32:57,475
Ten thousand strong at least.

1509
02:32:59,143 --> 02:33:00,542
Ten thousand?

1510
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,409
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1511
02:33:06,193 --> 02:33:08,229
To destroy the world of Men.

1512
02:33:10,823 --> 02:33:12,734
They will be here by nightfall.

1513
02:33:18,664 --> 02:33:19,892
Let them come!

1514
02:33:21,459 --> 02:33:24,132
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

1515
02:33:24,421 --> 02:33:27,413
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1516
02:33:35,808 --> 02:33:38,606
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

1517
02:33:38,895 --> 02:33:41,204
No army has ever breached the deeping wall...

1518
02:33:41,481 --> 02:33:44,120
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1519
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,709
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1520
02:33:47,404 --> 02:33:49,520
These are Uruk-hai.

1521
02:33:49,781 --> 02:33:53,057
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.

1522
02:33:54,828 --> 02:33:58,343
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1523
02:33:58,666 --> 02:34:02,136
I know how to defend my own keep.

1524
02:34:08,885 --> 02:34:12,161
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

1525
02:34:12,472 --> 02:34:17,466
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1526
02:34:17,895 --> 02:34:20,455
Crops can be resown...

1527
02:34:20,731 --> 02:34:23,609
...homes rebuilt.

1528
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:26,794
Within these walls...

1529
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:28,713
...we will outlast them.

1530
02:34:28,948 --> 02:34:31,257
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

1531
02:34:31,535 --> 02:34:33,014
They come to destroy its people...

1532
02:34:33,245 --> 02:34:35,634
...down to the last child.

1533
02:34:36,623 --> 02:34:38,773
What would you have me do?

1534
02:34:39,043 --> 02:34:40,715
Look at my men.

1535
02:34:40,961 --> 02:34:42,633
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1536
02:34:44,882 --> 02:34:49,114
If this is to be our end, then 
I would have them make such an end...

1537
02:34:49,471 --> 02:34:52,383
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1538
02:34:56,144 --> 02:34:57,975
Send out riders, my lord.

1539
02:34:58,355 --> 02:35:01,108
You must call for aid.

1540
02:35:04,487 --> 02:35:06,637
And who will come?

1541
02:35:07,156 --> 02:35:08,669
Elves?

1542
02:35:08,908 --> 02:35:10,899
Dwarves?

1543
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:14,497
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1544
02:35:15,457 --> 02:35:17,652
The old alliances are dead.

1545
02:35:18,168 --> 02:35:20,841
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1546
02:35:21,130 --> 02:35:23,246
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1547
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:27,417
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

1548
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,551
Where was Gon...?

1549
02:35:32,308 --> 02:35:34,185
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1550
02:35:35,854 --> 02:35:38,209
...we are alone.

1551
02:35:45,197 --> 02:35:46,869
Get the women and children into the caves.

1552
02:35:47,116 --> 02:35:48,310
We need more time to lay provisions...

1553
02:35:48,534 --> 02:35:51,890
There is no time. War is upon us.

1554
02:35:52,288 --> 02:35:53,926
Secure the gate.

1555
02:35:59,212 --> 02:36:01,203
We Ents have not troubled...

1556
02:36:01,506 --> 02:36:04,737
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1557
02:36:05,636 --> 02:36:08,514
...for a very long time.

1558
02:36:09,890 --> 02:36:14,441
But now, something is about to happen...

1559
02:36:14,812 --> 02:36:17,042
...that has not happened...

1560
02:36:17,357 --> 02:36:19,712
...for an age.

1561
02:36:21,027 --> 02:36:23,177
Entmoot.

1562
02:36:23,697 --> 02:36:24,686
What's that?

1563
02:36:25,157 --> 02:36:27,876
'Tis a gathering.

1564
02:36:29,161 --> 02:36:31,629
A gathering of what?

1565
02:36:49,683 --> 02:36:51,913
Beech. Oak.

1566
02:36:52,186 --> 02:36:54,017
Chestnut. Ash.

1567
02:36:54,355 --> 02:36:56,266
Good. Good. Good.

1568
02:36:56,524 --> 02:36:58,754
Many have come.

1569
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:09,083
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1570
02:37:09,371 --> 02:37:11,805
...will go to war.

1571
02:37:20,883 --> 02:37:23,795
Move back! Move to the caves!

1572
02:37:26,389 --> 02:37:28,380
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1573
02:37:28,892 --> 02:37:31,087
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1574
02:37:31,353 --> 02:37:33,548
They can support the archers from above the gate.

1575
02:37:33,814 --> 02:37:36,806
Aragorn, you must rest.

1576
02:37:37,109 --> 02:37:39,418
You're no use to us half alive.

1577
02:37:39,987 --> 02:37:41,136
Aragorn!

1578
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:47,488
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

1579
02:37:47,787 --> 02:37:49,379
That is an honorable charge.

1580
02:37:49,623 --> 02:37:52,376
To mind the children, to find food 
and bedding when the men return.

1581
02:37:52,668 --> 02:37:54,306
What renown is there in that?

1582
02:37:54,545 --> 02:37:58,094
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

1583
02:37:58,507 --> 02:38:01,180
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

1584
02:38:01,469 --> 02:38:06,259
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1585
02:38:06,766 --> 02:38:09,485
You do not command the others to stay!

1586
02:38:09,769 --> 02:38:13,364
They fight beside you because 
they would not be parted from you.

1587
02:38:14,691 --> 02:38:16,807
Because they love you.

1588
02:38:23,993 --> 02:38:25,472
I'm sorry.

1589
02:39:31,369 --> 02:39:34,520
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1590
02:39:35,748 --> 02:39:37,466
These are no soldiers.

1591
02:39:39,794 --> 02:39:43,150
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1592
02:39:47,219 --> 02:39:50,017
Look at them. They're frightened.

1593
02:39:50,306 --> 02:39:51,705
I can see it in their eyes.

1594
02:39:56,851 --> 02:39:58,885
Boe a hyn
(And they should be)

1595
02:39:59,149 --> 02:40:02,141
Neled herain...dan caer menig
(300...against 10,000!)

1596
02:40:03,987 --> 02:40:04,814
Si beriathar hyn
(They have more hope of...)

1597
02:40:04,881 --> 02:40:06,201
ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(...defending themselves here than at Edoras...)

1598
02:40:06,362 --> 02:40:10,165
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)

1599
02:40:11,245 --> 02:40:12,473
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!)

1600
02:40:12,705 --> 02:40:14,821
Then I shall die as one of them!

1601
02:40:21,339 --> 02:40:23,091
Let him go, lad.

1602
02:40:23,758 --> 02:40:25,635
Let him be.

1603
02:40:27,179 --> 02:40:32,458
Every villager able to wield a sword 
has been sent to the armoury.

1604
02:40:36,939 --> 02:40:38,770
My lord?

1605
02:40:40,902 --> 02:40:43,370
Who am I, Gamling?

1606
02:40:46,867 --> 02:40:50,576
You are our king, sire.

1607
02:40:53,749 --> 02:40:56,900
And do you trust your king?

1608
02:40:58,546 --> 02:41:01,583
Your men, my lord...

1609
02:41:01,883 --> 02:41:04,602
...will follow you to whatever end.

1610
02:41:11,560 --> 02:41:13,391
To whatever end.

1611
02:41:23,323 --> 02:41:26,759
Where is the horse and the rider?

1612
02:41:27,077 --> 02:41:29,989
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1613
02:41:31,623 --> 02:41:35,901
<i>They have passed like rain on the mountains.</i>

1614
02:41:37,087 --> 02:41:40,159
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1615
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:47,599
The days have gone down in the West...

1616
02:41:48,433 --> 02:41:50,993
<i>... behind the hills...</i>

1617
02:41:52,979 --> 02:41:54,537
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

1618
02:42:03,074 --> 02:42:06,350
How did it come to this?

1619
02:42:27,809 --> 02:42:29,561
It's been going for hours.

1620
02:42:30,812 --> 02:42:33,121
They must have decided something by now.

1621
02:42:33,398 --> 02:42:37,311
Decided? No.

1622
02:42:37,653 --> 02:42:42,602
We only just finished saying...

1623
02:42:43,993 --> 02:42:45,790
...good morning.

1624
02:42:47,205 --> 02:42:50,277
But it's nighttime already.

1625
02:42:50,583 --> 02:42:52,301
You can't take forever.

1626
02:42:53,378 --> 02:42:55,369
Don't be hasty.

1627
02:42:55,881 --> 02:42:58,190
We're running out of time!

1628
02:43:01,303 --> 02:43:04,136
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1629
02:43:21,825 --> 02:43:23,099
Give me your sword.

1630
02:43:32,628 --> 02:43:33,777
What is your name?

1631
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:36,610
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1632
02:43:38,885 --> 02:43:41,399
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

1633
02:43:43,473 --> 02:43:45,350
They say that it is hopeless.

1634
02:44:03,245 --> 02:44:04,837
This is a good sword.

1635
02:44:06,915 --> 02:44:09,145
Haleth, son of Háma...

1636
02:44:13,589 --> 02:44:15,659
...there is always hope.

1637
02:44:38,741 --> 02:44:41,972
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1638
02:44:42,287 --> 02:44:43,766
Forgive me.

1639
02:44:43,997 --> 02:44:45,396
I was wrong to despair.

1640
02:44:48,627 --> 02:44:51,016
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)

1641
02:44:54,633 --> 02:44:57,352
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1642
02:45:00,890 --> 02:45:02,881
It's a little tight across the chest.

1643
02:45:09,149 --> 02:45:11,026
That is no Orc horn.

1644
02:45:16,782 --> 02:45:18,534
Send for the king.

1645
02:45:18,784 --> 02:45:22,220
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1646
02:45:54,031 --> 02:45:55,623
How is this possible?

1647
02:45:56,700 --> 02:46:00,215
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1648
02:46:00,538 --> 02:46:03,610
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

1649
02:46:04,459 --> 02:46:08,532
Long ago we fought and died together.

1650
02:46:10,966 --> 02:46:13,764
We come to honor that allegiance.

1651
02:46:14,258 --> 02:46:16,058
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!)

1652
02:46:22,353 --> 02:46:24,184
You are most welcome.

1653
02:46:29,652 --> 02:46:33,167
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

1654
02:47:07,234 --> 02:47:10,351
You could have picked a better spot.

1655
02:47:15,326 --> 02:47:19,365
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, 
let's hope it lasts the night.

1656
02:47:25,671 --> 02:47:27,389
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1657
02:47:28,090 --> 02:47:30,479
Let's hope they last the night.

1658
02:48:30,574 --> 02:48:34,169
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(Show them no mercy...)

1659
02:48:35,329 --> 02:48:37,524
...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!)

1660
02:49:12,035 --> 02:49:14,754
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1661
02:49:16,123 --> 02:49:17,841
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1662
02:49:57,334 --> 02:49:58,562
Dartho!
(Hold!)

1663
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:22,862
So it begins.

1664
02:50:28,826 --> 02:50:29,941
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)

1665
02:50:30,928 --> 02:50:33,028
<i>Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)</i>

1666
02:50:38,344 --> 02:50:40,693
Faeg i-varv...
(Their armour is weak at the neck...)

1667
02:50:40,899 --> 02:50:42,949
...dîn na lanc a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)

1668
02:50:43,036 --> 02:50:44,985
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!)

1669
02:50:49,807 --> 02:50:51,081
Did they hit anything?

1670
02:50:51,809 --> 02:50:53,720
Give them a volley.

1671
02:50:53,978 --> 02:50:57,014
- Fire!
- Fire!

1672
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:04,650
Tengado chadad!
(Keep firing!)

1673
02:51:11,831 --> 02:51:13,423
Send them to me! Come on!

1674
02:51:33,038 --> 02:51:34,038
Pendraith!
(Ladders!)

1675
02:51:34,272 --> 02:51:35,307
Good!

1676
02:51:42,155 --> 02:51:45,033
Swords! Swords!

1677
02:52:23,241 --> 02:52:25,277
Legolas! Two already!

1678
02:52:25,535 --> 02:52:27,571
I'm on 17!

1679
02:52:27,829 --> 02:52:30,297
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1680
02:52:37,215 --> 02:52:38,853
19!

1681
02:53:04,911 --> 02:53:06,264
Merry.

1682
02:53:10,751 --> 02:53:14,380
We have just agreed.

1683
02:53:24,557 --> 02:53:25,956
Yes?

1684
02:53:27,519 --> 02:53:31,512
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1685
02:53:32,816 --> 02:53:35,933
...and we have agreed...

1686
02:53:36,528 --> 02:53:40,407
...you are not Orcs.

1687
02:53:42,326 --> 02:53:44,362
Well, that's good news.

1688
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:48,579
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1689
02:53:49,376 --> 02:53:53,005
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1690
02:53:53,338 --> 02:53:54,817
Hasty?

1691
02:53:55,674 --> 02:53:57,471
Our friends are out there.

1692
02:53:57,718 --> 02:54:01,711
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.

1693
02:54:02,223 --> 02:54:04,418
War? Yes.

1694
02:54:04,684 --> 02:54:06,481
It affects us all.

1695
02:54:06,728 --> 02:54:09,606
Tree, root and twig.

1696
02:54:10,607 --> 02:54:14,486
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1697
02:54:14,861 --> 02:54:16,692
...it takes a long time...

1698
02:54:16,947 --> 02:54:21,657
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1699
02:54:22,036 --> 02:54:26,075
...and we never say anything...

1700
02:54:26,415 --> 02:54:30,169
...unless it is worth taking...

1701
02:54:30,503 --> 02:54:34,382
...a long time to say.

1702
02:54:35,318 --> 02:54:38,418
17! 18!

1703
02:54:38,655 --> 02:54:39,855
19!

1704
02:54:40,375 --> 02:54:42,125
20!

1705
02:54:42,409 --> 02:54:44,109
21!

1706
02:54:44,599 --> 02:54:48,199
<i>22 and 23!</i>

1707
02:54:54,237 --> 02:54:56,148
Causeway!

1708
02:55:03,998 --> 02:55:06,273
Is this it?

1709
02:55:06,542 --> 02:55:09,340
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1710
02:55:35,865 --> 02:55:37,184
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!)

1711
02:55:40,579 --> 02:55:41,375
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1712
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:43,037
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1713
02:56:35,471 --> 02:56:36,790
Brace the gate!

1714
02:56:55,159 --> 02:56:57,309
Hold them! Stand firm!

1715
02:57:05,295 --> 02:57:06,569
Aragorn!

1716
02:57:11,267 --> 02:57:12,409
Gimli!

1717
02:57:18,827 --> 02:57:20,727
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!)

1718
02:57:23,415 --> 02:57:25,067
Herio!
(Charge!)

1719
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:04,984
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1720
02:58:05,943 --> 02:58:09,777
We must weather such things as we have always done.

1721
02:58:10,782 --> 02:58:12,773
How can that be your decision?!

1722
02:58:13,535 --> 02:58:17,005
This is not our war.

1723
02:58:17,456 --> 02:58:19,572
But you're part of this world!

1724
02:58:23,796 --> 02:58:25,548
Aren't you?!

1725
02:58:29,719 --> 02:58:31,994
You must help. Please.

1726
02:58:33,390 --> 02:58:36,029
You must do something.

1727
02:58:36,435 --> 02:58:40,553
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1728
02:58:41,941 --> 02:58:45,490
But your part in this tale is over.

1729
02:58:45,820 --> 02:58:47,970
Go back to your home.

1730
02:58:58,083 --> 02:59:00,233
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1731
02:59:00,502 --> 02:59:02,299
We don't belong here, Merry.

1732
02:59:02,546 --> 02:59:04,741
It's too big for us.

1733
02:59:05,007 --> 02:59:07,567
What can we do in the end?

1734
02:59:09,971 --> 02:59:12,485
We've got the Shire.

1735
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:15,575
Maybe we should go home.

1736
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:20,592
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1737
02:59:20,899 --> 02:59:25,609
...and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

1738
02:59:25,988 --> 02:59:27,501
And...

1739
02:59:29,367 --> 02:59:32,325
And all that was once green and good 
in this world will be gone.

1740
02:59:35,999 --> 02:59:38,797
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1741
02:59:58,440 --> 02:59:59,634
Aragorn!

1742
02:59:59,858 --> 03:00:02,133
Fall back to the Keep!

1743
03:00:02,402 --> 03:00:05,360
Get your men out of there!

1744
03:00:06,615 --> 03:00:08,048
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!)

1745
03:00:12,955 --> 03:00:14,513
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1746
03:00:15,124 --> 03:00:16,716
Haldir!

1747
03:00:17,585 --> 03:00:18,984
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1748
03:00:20,922 --> 03:00:24,039
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1749
03:00:25,174 --> 03:00:26,474
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1750
03:00:43,405 --> 03:00:45,554
Haldir!

1751
03:01:27,327 --> 03:01:28,760
Brace the gate!

1752
03:01:31,039 --> 03:01:32,267
Hold them!

1753
03:01:34,168 --> 03:01:37,399
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1754
03:02:05,702 --> 03:02:07,533
Make way!

1755
03:02:10,540 --> 03:02:12,178
We cannot hold much longer!

1756
03:02:18,215 --> 03:02:21,651
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1757
03:02:21,969 --> 03:02:24,437
As long as you can give me.

1758
03:02:24,722 --> 03:02:26,314
Gimli!

1759
03:02:27,850 --> 03:02:29,169
Timbers!

1760
03:02:29,394 --> 03:02:31,271
Brace the gate!

1761
03:02:46,120 --> 03:02:47,758
Come on. We can take them.

1762
03:02:48,664 --> 03:02:50,222
It's a long way.

1763
03:02:55,547 --> 03:02:57,219
Toss me.

1764
03:02:58,467 --> 03:03:00,219
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1765
03:03:00,469 --> 03:03:01,982
You'll have to toss me!

1766
03:03:07,643 --> 03:03:08,871
Don't tell the Elf.

1767
03:03:09,437 --> 03:03:11,155
Not a word.

1768
03:03:26,455 --> 03:03:27,854
Shore up the door!

1769
03:03:28,082 --> 03:03:30,073
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1770
03:03:30,334 --> 03:03:31,369
Watch our backs!

1771
03:03:35,548 --> 03:03:37,698
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1772
03:04:27,729 --> 03:04:29,082
Hold fast the gate!

1773
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:36,193
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1774
03:04:41,035 --> 03:04:42,593
Aragorn!

1775
03:05:16,073 --> 03:05:18,428
Pull everybody back.

1776
03:05:18,909 --> 03:05:20,627
Pull them back.

1777
03:05:21,245 --> 03:05:22,644
Fall back!

1778
03:05:22,872 --> 03:05:25,261
Fall back!

1779
03:05:26,543 --> 03:05:28,181
They have broken through!

1780
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:30,570
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1781
03:05:30,839 --> 03:05:32,989
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1782
03:05:33,258 --> 03:05:35,726
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1783
03:05:36,011 --> 03:05:38,161
Into the Keep!

1784
03:05:49,734 --> 03:05:54,489
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

1785
03:05:54,865 --> 03:05:59,381
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.

1786
03:06:05,293 --> 03:06:06,521
Wait! Stop!

1787
03:06:07,462 --> 03:06:08,895
Stop!

1788
03:06:12,092 --> 03:06:13,730
Turn around.

1789
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:17,314
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1790
03:06:17,598 --> 03:06:22,388
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1791
03:06:22,937 --> 03:06:25,531
Yes. Exactly.

1792
03:06:25,815 --> 03:06:28,887
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

1793
03:06:29,193 --> 03:06:31,753
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.

1794
03:06:32,030 --> 03:06:33,941
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1795
03:06:36,660 --> 03:06:39,538
That doesn't make sense to me.

1796
03:06:39,830 --> 03:06:40,945
But then...

1797
03:06:41,165 --> 03:06:43,759
...you are very small.

1798
03:06:44,335 --> 03:06:46,053
Perhaps you're right.

1799
03:06:48,756 --> 03:06:50,235
South it is, then.

1800
03:06:51,801 --> 03:06:54,998
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1801
03:06:57,182 --> 03:06:59,821
I always like going south.

1802
03:07:00,102 --> 03:07:04,220
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1803
03:07:05,024 --> 03:07:07,379
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1804
03:07:07,652 --> 03:07:09,483
No, we won't.

1805
03:07:10,321 --> 03:07:12,471
Not this time.

1806
03:07:19,206 --> 03:07:20,195
Look!

1807
03:07:21,875 --> 03:07:24,230
Osgiliath burns!

1808
03:07:24,503 --> 03:07:25,856
<i>Mordor has come.</i>

1809
03:07:27,047 --> 03:07:29,356
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1810
03:07:30,801 --> 03:07:32,917
It has only the power to destroy.

1811
03:07:33,888 --> 03:07:35,287
Please...

1812
03:07:35,515 --> 03:07:37,073
...let me go.

1813
03:07:38,184 --> 03:07:39,697
Hurry.

1814
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:44,584
Faramir!

1815
03:07:44,817 --> 03:07:47,206
You must let me go!

1816
03:07:47,736 --> 03:07:51,046
And those little family of field mice...

1817
03:07:51,365 --> 03:07:54,084
...that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

1818
03:07:54,911 --> 03:07:58,108
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

1819
03:08:09,426 --> 03:08:12,224
Many of these trees were my friends.

1820
03:08:13,055 --> 03:08:17,872
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1821
03:08:18,853 --> 03:08:20,002
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1822
03:08:20,230 --> 03:08:22,869
They had voices of their own.

1823
03:08:25,235 --> 03:08:27,669
Saruman.

1824
03:08:28,113 --> 03:08:31,071
A wizard should know better!

1825
03:08:45,465 --> 03:08:49,152
There is no curse in Elvish...

1826
03:08:49,414 --> 03:08:51,867
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1827
03:08:52,139 --> 03:08:54,369
...for this treachery.

1828
03:08:55,893 --> 03:08:58,612
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1829
03:09:03,443 --> 03:09:04,592
Where are they going?

1830
03:09:05,153 --> 03:09:08,270
They have business with the Orcs.

1831
03:09:08,865 --> 03:09:12,983
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1832
03:09:13,328 --> 03:09:15,842
...with rock and stone.

1833
03:09:39,857 --> 03:09:43,734
- Yes.
- Rárum-rum! Come, my friends.

1834
03:09:44,862 --> 03:09:48,901
The Ents are going to war.

1835
03:09:49,242 --> 03:09:50,960
It is likely...

1836
03:09:51,203 --> 03:09:54,559
...that we go to our doom.

1837
03:09:56,125 --> 03:09:58,480
Last march...

1838
03:09:59,128 --> 03:10:01,084
...of the Ents.

1839
03:10:49,265 --> 03:10:52,860
Faramir! The Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.

1840
03:10:53,186 --> 03:10:55,177
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1841
03:10:58,024 --> 03:10:59,423
Mr. Frodo?

1842
03:10:59,776 --> 03:11:03,735
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1843
03:11:04,073 --> 03:11:06,462
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1844
03:11:20,882 --> 03:11:22,235
Take them to my father.

1845
03:11:23,844 --> 03:11:26,722
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1846
03:11:29,266 --> 03:11:32,178
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

1847
03:11:33,479 --> 03:11:36,039
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

1848
03:11:36,816 --> 03:11:39,455
You want to know why your brother died?

1849
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:43,665
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1850
03:11:43,991 --> 03:11:45,788
He tried to kill him!

1851
03:11:46,034 --> 03:11:48,264
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1852
03:11:49,163 --> 03:11:50,915
Watch out!

1853
03:12:01,927 --> 03:12:02,996
Mr. Frodo?

1854
03:12:05,681 --> 03:12:07,433
They're here.

1855
03:12:10,644 --> 03:12:12,999
They've come.

1856
03:12:15,691 --> 03:12:17,488
Nazgûl!

1857
03:12:39,717 --> 03:12:41,787
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1858
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:45,796
Take cover!

1859
03:13:03,243 --> 03:13:04,722
The fortress is taken.

1860
03:13:05,578 --> 03:13:06,693
It is over.

1861
03:13:06,913 --> 03:13:10,701
You said this fortress would never fall 
while your men defend it.

1862
03:13:11,043 --> 03:13:13,841
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1863
03:13:16,715 --> 03:13:18,034
They're breaking in!

1864
03:13:20,761 --> 03:13:23,150
<i>They're past the door!</i>

1865
03:13:26,601 --> 03:13:30,560
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1866
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:35,231
Is there no other way?

1867
03:13:36,904 --> 03:13:39,816
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1868
03:13:40,616 --> 03:13:42,732
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1869
03:13:47,707 --> 03:13:50,016
Send word for the women and children 
to make for the mountain pass.

1870
03:13:50,293 --> 03:13:53,012
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1871
03:13:55,299 --> 03:13:58,575
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1872
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:04,744
Ride out with me.

1873
03:14:08,938 --> 03:14:10,496
Ride out and meet them.

1874
03:14:11,316 --> 03:14:13,386
For death and glory.

1875
03:14:13,652 --> 03:14:15,005
For Rohan.

1876
03:14:16,572 --> 03:14:17,971
For your people.

1877
03:14:18,782 --> 03:14:20,613
The sun is rising.

1878
03:14:25,206 --> 03:14:28,084
<i>Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.</i>

1879
03:14:28,376 --> 03:14:29,729
<i>At dawn...</i>

1880
03:14:29,961 --> 03:14:31,599
<i>...look to the east.</i>

1881
03:14:35,842 --> 03:14:37,434
Yes.

1882
03:14:39,972 --> 03:14:41,564
Yes.

1883
03:14:42,975 --> 03:14:45,250
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1884
03:14:45,519 --> 03:14:48,238
...shall sound in the deep...

1885
03:14:48,773 --> 03:14:50,684
...one last time.

1886
03:14:50,942 --> 03:14:52,375
Yes!

1887
03:14:55,488 --> 03:14:59,117
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

1888
03:15:07,043 --> 03:15:08,317
Fell deeds, awake.

1889
03:15:09,587 --> 03:15:10,656
Now for wrath...

1890
03:15:10,880 --> 03:15:14,111
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1891
03:15:21,308 --> 03:15:23,458
Forth Eorlingas!

1892
03:16:11,362 --> 03:16:12,556
Gandalf.

1893
03:16:19,871 --> 03:16:23,386
Théoden King stands alone.

1894
03:16:24,125 --> 03:16:26,195
Not alone.

1895
03:16:26,712 --> 03:16:27,781
Rohirrim!

1896
03:16:33,761 --> 03:16:34,876
Èomer.

1897
03:16:35,096 --> 03:16:37,530
To the king!

1898
03:17:55,224 --> 03:17:56,942
Yes!

1899
03:18:06,152 --> 03:18:09,428
A hit. A fine hit.

1900
03:18:34,140 --> 03:18:36,495
Break the dam!

1901
03:18:36,768 --> 03:18:40,078
Release the river!

1902
03:19:07,551 --> 03:19:10,190
Pippin! Hold on!

1903
03:19:15,560 --> 03:19:18,358
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1904
03:19:59,858 --> 03:20:01,769
What are you doing?

1905
03:20:10,452 --> 03:20:11,965
Where are you going?

1906
03:21:10,183 --> 03:21:11,457
It's me.

1907
03:21:14,021 --> 03:21:16,137
It's your Sam.

1908
03:21:20,570 --> 03:21:23,084
Don't you know your Sam?

1909
03:21:40,925 --> 03:21:44,156
I can't do this, Sam.

1910
03:21:45,179 --> 03:21:47,090
I know.

1911
03:21:48,183 --> 03:21:50,458
It's all wrong.

1912
03:21:51,311 --> 03:21:53,222
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1913
03:22:00,738 --> 03:22:02,729
But we are.

1914
03:22:09,247 --> 03:22:12,159
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1915
03:22:12,459 --> 03:22:14,734
The ones that really mattered.

1916
03:22:15,879 --> 03:22:18,757
<i>Full of darkness and danger they were.</i>

1917
03:22:19,049 --> 03:22:21,882
<i>And sometimes you didn't want to know the end</i>

1918
03:22:22,178 --> 03:22:25,011
<i>...because how could the end be happy?</i>

1919
03:22:27,683 --> 03:22:29,799
<i>How could the world go back to the way it was...</i>

1920
03:22:30,061 --> 03:22:33,417
<i>... when so much bad had happened?</i>

1921
03:22:34,399 --> 03:22:36,230
Victory!

1922
03:22:36,485 --> 03:22:37,964
We have victory!

1923
03:22:38,195 --> 03:22:41,983
<i>But in the end, it's only a passing thing...</i>

1924
03:22:42,324 --> 03:22:43,598
<i>...this shadow.</i>

1925
03:22:43,826 --> 03:22:46,101
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1926
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:48,964
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1927
03:22:49,248 --> 03:22:53,036
<i>And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer</i>

1928
03:22:55,130 --> 03:22:57,405
<i>Those were the stories that stayed with you...</i>

1929
03:22:57,674 --> 03:22:59,346
<i>...that meant something.</i>

1930
03:22:59,593 --> 03:23:02,061
<i>Even if you were too small to understand why.</i>

1931
03:23:03,555 --> 03:23:07,230
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1932
03:23:07,560 --> 03:23:09,073
<i>I know now.</i>

1933
03:23:09,979 --> 03:23:12,095
Folk in those stories...

1934
03:23:12,357 --> 03:23:16,316
...had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

1935
03:23:16,653 --> 03:23:18,803
They kept going...

1936
03:23:19,573 --> 03:23:22,690
...because they were holding on to something.

1937
03:23:24,411 --> 03:23:26,641
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1938
03:23:38,677 --> 03:23:42,431
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1939
03:23:42,889 --> 03:23:45,403
And it's worth fighting for.

1940
03:24:12,421 --> 03:24:16,539
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.

1941
03:24:17,468 --> 03:24:21,256
You know the laws of our country, 
the laws of your father.

1942
03:24:21,598 --> 03:24:23,714
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

1943
03:24:28,146 --> 03:24:29,499
Then it is forfeit.

1944
03:24:32,318 --> 03:24:34,036
Release them.

1945
03:24:46,166 --> 03:24:48,122
Stay out of the forest!

1946
03:24:48,377 --> 03:24:50,095
Keep away from the trees!

1947
03:25:41,017 --> 03:25:42,735
Final count...

1948
03:25:42,977 --> 03:25:45,775
...42.
- 42?

1949
03:25:47,357 --> 03:25:51,908
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

1950
03:25:52,904 --> 03:25:56,419
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1951
03:26:00,704 --> 03:26:03,855
- 43.
- He was already dead.

1952
03:26:04,750 --> 03:26:07,139
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1953
03:26:07,420 --> 03:26:11,936
...because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

1954
03:26:14,344 --> 03:26:18,860
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1955
03:26:19,308 --> 03:26:22,698
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.

1956
03:26:23,020 --> 03:26:25,853
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1957
03:26:26,148 --> 03:26:28,867
I hear the staff are very good.

1958
03:26:34,658 --> 03:26:36,933
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1959
03:26:37,202 --> 03:26:41,275
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1960
03:26:41,623 --> 03:26:42,817
I'm starving.

1961
03:26:43,042 --> 03:26:46,000
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

1962
03:26:46,295 --> 03:26:49,253
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1963
03:27:13,324 --> 03:27:15,633
Saruman's storeroom!

1964
03:27:18,079 --> 03:27:20,718
I don't believe it.

1965
03:27:20,999 --> 03:27:22,955
It can't be.

1966
03:27:23,669 --> 03:27:26,422
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1967
03:27:27,840 --> 03:27:30,070
The finest pipe-weed in the South Farthing.

1968
03:27:30,509 --> 03:27:33,501
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1969
03:27:33,805 --> 03:27:34,874
Wait.

1970
03:27:35,682 --> 03:27:36,831
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

1971
03:27:37,058 --> 03:27:38,537
Share it?

1972
03:27:40,437 --> 03:27:42,746
No. No.

1973
03:27:44,358 --> 03:27:45,632
Dead plant and all that.

1974
03:27:46,110 --> 03:27:48,180
Don't think he'd understand.

1975
03:27:49,530 --> 03:27:51,646
Could be a distant relative.

1976
03:27:52,533 --> 03:27:54,922
I get it.

1977
03:27:55,203 --> 03:27:57,922
Don't be hasty.

1978
03:27:59,124 --> 03:28:00,796
Exactly.

1979
03:28:01,960 --> 03:28:04,110
Bar-hrum.

1980
03:28:29,865 --> 03:28:31,093
This is the old sewer.

1981
03:28:31,325 --> 03:28:34,317
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.

1982
03:28:34,620 --> 03:28:36,292
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1983
03:28:37,415 --> 03:28:39,804
Captain Faramir...

1984
03:28:40,543 --> 03:28:42,295
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1985
03:28:44,881 --> 03:28:46,109
The very highest.

1986
03:28:46,675 --> 03:28:49,189
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

1987
03:28:49,469 --> 03:28:52,302
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1988
03:28:53,599 --> 03:28:55,510
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

1989
03:28:56,185 --> 03:28:57,698
Gollum says there's a path...

1990
03:28:57,937 --> 03:29:01,691
...near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

1991
03:29:02,317 --> 03:29:03,989
Cirith Ungol?

1992
03:29:07,614 --> 03:29:10,048
- Is that its name?
- No.

1993
03:29:10,325 --> 03:29:11,917
No!

1994
03:29:12,828 --> 03:29:15,706
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1995
03:29:16,207 --> 03:29:19,597
...they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1996
03:29:20,628 --> 03:29:23,062
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1997
03:29:23,506 --> 03:29:29,536
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

1998
03:29:31,306 --> 03:29:33,024
I must.

1999
03:29:36,645 --> 03:29:40,081
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

2000
03:29:40,399 --> 03:29:42,355
Thank you.

2001
03:29:54,247 --> 03:29:58,206
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

2002
03:30:10,849 --> 03:30:12,328
Come on, keep up.

2003
03:30:15,854 --> 03:30:18,527
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

2004
03:30:19,274 --> 03:30:21,026
You know that, don't you?

2005
03:30:21,902 --> 03:30:23,415
He was trying to save you, see?

2006
03:30:23,988 --> 03:30:25,467
Save me?

2007
03:30:25,865 --> 03:30:27,935
So there's no hard feelings.

2008
03:30:28,201 --> 03:30:33,116
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2009
03:30:33,498 --> 03:30:36,012
Gollum, Gollum.

2010
03:30:37,169 --> 03:30:38,841
Yes, master.

2011
03:30:40,005 --> 03:30:42,724
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2012
03:30:43,008 --> 03:30:45,203
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2013
03:30:50,808 --> 03:30:55,802
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

2014
03:31:03,155 --> 03:31:06,033
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2015
03:31:06,826 --> 03:31:10,216
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

2016
03:31:15,502 --> 03:31:18,778
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

2017
03:31:19,923 --> 03:31:22,995
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

2018
03:31:26,430 --> 03:31:29,706
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

2019
03:31:30,017 --> 03:31:31,336
What?

2020
03:31:31,561 --> 03:31:35,349
I wonder if people will ever say;
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2021
03:31:35,690 --> 03:31:38,807
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

2022
03:31:39,110 --> 03:31:41,943
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

2023
03:31:42,239 --> 03:31:43,831
"Yes, my boy.

2024
03:31:44,074 --> 03:31:47,703
The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot."

2025
03:31:48,037 --> 03:31:50,471
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

2026
03:31:50,748 --> 03:31:52,545
"Samwise the Brave."

2027
03:31:52,792 --> 03:31:55,431
I want to hear more about Sam.

2028
03:31:59,841 --> 03:32:02,719
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

2029
03:32:04,179 --> 03:32:08,058
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2030
03:32:09,310 --> 03:32:10,629
So was I.

2031
03:32:19,571 --> 03:32:22,165
"Samwise the Brave."

2032
03:32:26,536 --> 03:32:27,810
Sméagol?

2033
03:32:28,038 --> 03:32:30,836
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

2034
03:32:31,125 --> 03:32:32,956
Master.

2035
03:32:33,210 --> 03:32:36,043
Master looks after us.

2036
03:32:36,964 --> 03:32:39,637
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2037
03:32:39,926 --> 03:32:42,281
Master broke his promise.

2038
03:32:42,554 --> 03:32:44,624
Don't ask Sméagol.

2039
03:32:44,889 --> 03:32:47,961
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2040
03:32:48,268 --> 03:32:50,987
Master betrayed us.

2041
03:32:51,271 --> 03:32:54,229
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2042
03:32:54,525 --> 03:32:58,279
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

2043
03:32:58,613 --> 03:33:01,252
Kill him! Kill him!

2044
03:33:01,532 --> 03:33:02,965
Kill them both!

2045
03:33:03,201 --> 03:33:06,671
And then we take the precious...

2046
03:33:06,997 --> 03:33:10,387
...and we be the master!

2047
03:33:11,209 --> 03:33:13,769
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2048
03:33:14,046 --> 03:33:16,606
Eyes always watching.

2049
03:33:16,882 --> 03:33:20,272
Then we stabs them out.

2050
03:33:20,595 --> 03:33:24,907
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

2051
03:33:25,266 --> 03:33:28,576
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2052
03:33:28,895 --> 03:33:31,489
Kill them both.

2053
03:33:31,773 --> 03:33:34,162
Yes. No! No!

2054
03:33:34,443 --> 03:33:37,992
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2055
03:33:38,864 --> 03:33:41,332
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2056
03:33:41,617 --> 03:33:44,131
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2057
03:33:44,412 --> 03:33:49,566
We could let her do it.

2058
03:33:50,752 --> 03:33:54,745
Yes. She could do it.

2059
03:33:55,090 --> 03:33:59,447
Yes, precious, she could.

2060
03:33:59,803 --> 03:34:05,594
And then we takes it once they're dead.

2061
03:34:06,769 --> 03:34:09,488
Once they're dead.

2062
03:34:14,027 --> 03:34:17,576
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2063
03:34:17,906 --> 03:34:19,862
Sméagol will show you the way.

2064
03:34:20,117 --> 03:34:22,267
Follow me.

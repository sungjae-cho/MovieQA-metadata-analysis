1
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,511
4, 5, 6

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,836
7, 8. Now, girls...

3
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,274
Come on, girls. Anybody?

4
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,437
Anybody else?

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,479
Jenny, again.

6
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,190
Isn't it because Mr. Rochester is blind?

7
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,069
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,710
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

9
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,190
Right. So the only sound I want to
hear coming through the ceiling

10
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,192
is the sound of sweat
dripping onto textbooks.

11
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,316
-Cello?
-No cello.

12
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,275
I thought we agreed that
cello was my interest or hobby.

13
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,828
Well, it already is
your interest or hobby.

14
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,956
So when they ask you
at the Oxford interview,

15
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,473
"What is your interest or hobby?"

16
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,676
you can say the cello
and you won't be lying.

17
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,035
But you don't have to practise a hobby.

18
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,959
A hobby is a hobby.

19
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,156
Can I stop going
to the youth orchestra, then?

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,710
No! No, no, the youth orchestra's
a good thing.

21
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,430
-That shows you're a joiner-inner.
-Yes, but I've already joined in.

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,552
So now I can stop.

23
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,478
No! No, that just shows the opposite.
Don't you see?

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,640
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

25
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,950
No. They don't want people
who can think for themselves.

26
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,553
No, of course they don't.

27
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,911
-See you Wednesday.
-All right, okay. Bye.

28
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,151
Jenny? Should I wear, like, Sunday best?

29
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,834
Better, I'm afraid.

30
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,550
Just to show my father you're
un jeune homme sérieux, not a Teddy Boy.

31
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,673
God. Right.

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,036
I'm going to go.
It's going to bucket down in a minute.

33
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,113
-Okay, right.
-I'll see you at the weekend.

34
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,758
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,239
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

36
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,512
Goodbye, my love!

37
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,993
Come on, come on.

38
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,231
-No!
-Stop it now, stop it. That's enough.

39
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,678
Now look what you've done.

40
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,352
Come here.
The nice man's waiting for us.

41
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,271
-It fell off!
-No, it didn't fall off.

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,955
-You kicked it off. Now, come on.
-But my sock's all wet!

43
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,277
Hello. Look, if you had any sense,

44
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,713
you wouldn't take a lift
from a strange man,

45
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,314
but I'm a music lover
and I'm worried about your cello,

46
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,910
so what I propose is you put it
in my car and walk alongside me.

47
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,869
How do I know
you won't just drive off with the cello?

48
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,546
Good point.

49
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,279
How much does a new cello cost?
£10, £15? I don't know.

50
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,669
Let's say 15.

51
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,279
No? All right.

52
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,313
Up to you.

53
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,597
-And that.
-Right.

54
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,473
-I'm David, by the way.
-Jenny.

55
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,993
Very good.

56
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,317
-How did the concert go?
-It was a rehearsal.

57
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,834
-The concert's next Thursday.
-What are you playing?

58
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,678
Elgar.

59
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,552
I think it's a shame he spent
so much time in Worcester, don't you?

60
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,552
Because Worcester's too near Birmingham,
and you can hear that in the music.

61
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,599
There's a terrible Brummy accent
in there, if you listen hard enough.

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,711
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,638
-I'm not a Jew.
-No, I am.

64
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,668
I wasn't accusing you.

65
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,354
Can I sit in the car with my cello?

66
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,199
Jump in.

67
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,597
I've never seen a car like this before.
C'est très chic.

68
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,477
It's a Bristol. Not many of them made.

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,871
-Where to, madam?
-I only live round the corner.

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,875
-Worse luck.
-I'll see what I can do.

71
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,590
I suppose cellists must go
to a lot of concerts.

72
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,595
We don't go to any concerts.
We don't believe in them.

73
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,797
-They're real.
-So people say.

74
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,830
-Smoke?
-I'd better not.

75
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,479
I live just up there.

76
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,350
-Why don't we believe in them?
-He'd say there's no point to them.

77
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,511
-Your father, this is?
-Yes.

78
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,912
They're just for fun.

79
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,396
Apart from school concerts, which are
no fun at all, so we go to those.

80
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,590
-They don't help you get on.
-Which, of course,

81
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,398
is what's so wonderful about them.

82
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,038
-Anyway, you'll go one day.
-I know. I will.

83
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,551
If I go to university,
I'm going to read what I want

84
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,790
and listen to what I want,

85
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,270
and I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films

86
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,794
and I'm going to talk to people
who know lots about lots.

87
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,276
-Good for you.
-Yes.

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,155
-Which university?
-Oxford. If I'm lucky.

89
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,951
Did you go anywhere?

90
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,951
I studied what I believe they call
"the university of life".

91
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,670
I didn't get a very good degree, though.

92
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,834
Well, thank you for driving me home.

93
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,920
-Are you all right? Have you got it?
-Yes, it's fine.

94
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,071
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

95
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,869
* Sous le ciel de Paris
marchent des amoureux

96
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,275
* Sous le pont de Bercy

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,876
* Un philosophe assis

98
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,270
* Deux musiciens, quelques badauds

99
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,238
* Puis les gens par milliers

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,231
I don't want to hear
any French singing!

101
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,591
French singing wasn't on the syllabus
last time I looked!

102
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,757
-Battenberg?
-Thank you.

103
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,552
I actually like the crust.

104
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,711
So where are you applying, Graham?

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,951
-I'm not sure yet.
-Well! When will you be sure?

106
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,279
You can't let the grass grow
under your feet, young man.

107
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,158
-I might take a year off.
-What for?

108
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,996
I don't know,
maybe do some travelling.

109
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,119
That sort of thing.

110
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,233
Travelling?

111
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,358
What are you, a Teddy Boy?

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,639
You know she's going to Oxford,
don't you?

113
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,518
If we get her Latin up to scratch.

114
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,991
So while she's studying English
at Oxford,

115
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,752
you'll be the wandering Jew.

116
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
Mr. Mellor, I'm not a Teddy Boy.

117
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,115
I'm an homme sérieux jeune.

118
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,512
No. Yeah!

119
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,115
I'm a homme jeune sérieux. A homme...

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,514
-They're for me.
-Who are they from?

121
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,350
-Gosh. Him.
-What's this?

122
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,552
Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been sent
some flowers from a chap.

123
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,756
-A chap? What kind of chap?
-He's wishing me luck for tonight.

124
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,400
Is that all he's wishing you?
Where'd he get the money from?

125
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,552
-He earns it, I expect.
-Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

126
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,073
Can we just go?

127
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,912
Otherwise the good luck flowers
will actually be responsible

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,390
for me actually missing the concert,
which would be ironic, n'est-ce pas?

129
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,792
-I don't... I don't like it.
-Objection noted. Jenny?

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,711
-Noted.
-Yeah, well...

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,234
There's got to be 10 bob's worth
of luck here. I mean...

132
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,151
That's a bit much for a schoolgirl,
isn't it?

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,793
Well, we can't leave it here!

134
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,156
I mean, even I'd burgle a house
with flowers left outside.

135
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,912
They'll think we're made of money.

136
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,752
Thank you, Marjorie.

137
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,989
Camus doesn't want you to like him.
Feeling is bourgeois.

138
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,435
Being engagée is bourgeois.

139
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,075
He kills someone,
and he doesn't feel anything.

140
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,952
His mother dies,
and he doesn't feel anything.

141
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,636
I wouldn't feel anything
if my mother died.

142
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,597
Does that make me an existentialist?

143
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,193
No. That makes you a cow.

144
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,199
Une vache.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,232
Well, after I've been to university,
I'm going to be French,

146
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,230
and I'm going to Paris,
and I'm going to smoke and wear black

147
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,753
and listen to Jacques Brel,

148
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,469
and I won't speak, ever.
C'est plus chic comme ça.

149
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,471
-Crikey!
-What?

150
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,399
Wait here.

151
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,313
Hello!

152
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,159
Hello.

153
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,713
Hello.
Thank you.

154
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,556
-How did it go?
-Fine, I think.

155
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,431
I didn't mess my bit up.

156
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,837
Nobody got thrown out
of the orchestra afterwards.

157
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,475
Always the mark of a cultural triumph.
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.

158
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,835
-What are you doing on Friday?
-Going to school.

159
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,832
I meant in the evening.

160
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,754
Of course. Nothing.

161
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,719
Because I'm going to listen to some
Ravel in St. John's Smith Square.

162
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,712
My friends Danny and Helen would be
coming, too, so it wouldn't be...

163
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,354
I'll tell you what,
I'll come and pick you up,

164
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,748
and if your mother and father
disapprove,

165
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,432
then you can have the tickets
and go with one of them.

166
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,317
-How does that sound?
-Thank you.

167
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,156
-And I'd like to go with you.
-7:00?

168
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,192
What are they saying?

169
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,352
And, probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards.

170
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,749
-Supper?
-If you want to.

171
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,316
Well the thing is,
we'll probably have eaten.

172
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,073
Well, if you'd like supper,

173
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,994
then perhaps on Friday
you could not eat?

174
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,796
Yes. Of course.

175
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,870
-A spot of supper?
-You've heard of supper.

176
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,518
We've heard of it,
but we've never eaten it.

177
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,392
So you're going to have
to tell us everything.

178
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,198
Otherwise it's not fair.

179
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,510
-I won't allow it!
-Fine! He's more than happy

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,477
-for you to take me.
-Fine, I will.

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,359
-Good!
-Well, where is it?

182
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,193
-St. John's Smith Square.
-Where's that?

183
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,679
I don't know.
I'm sure we could find out.

184
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,194
It's in Westminster.
Right next door to the Abbey.

185
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,316
-How do you know that?
-I had a life

186
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,789
before we were married, you know.
You soon put a stop to that.

187
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,831
-Well, there you are.
-Where are we?

188
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,673
We're near Westminster Abbey.
I'm not going all the way over there.

189
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,955
The trouble is that's where
St. John's Smith Square is.

190
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,395
Well, there must be something on
locally. Where's the paper?

191
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,272
She wants to see someone who can play.

192
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,750
She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland
scratching away. I'll take her.

193
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,274
And how do you propose to get there?
RAF helicopter?

194
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,588
-That's him.
-Bloody hell!

195
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,359
-Jack!
-By the way, David's a Jew.

196
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,114
A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.

197
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,478
What does she mean by that?
I've never said anything like that!

198
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,552
It's just an expression.
I've got nothing against the Jews...

199
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,591
Glad to hear it. Hello.

200
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,233
I didn't mean I've got nothing against
you. No, of course I do mean that.

201
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,278
-Dad.
-No. It's... Sorry, it's just that...

202
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,070
You're not the sort of person
that I would be against.

203
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,470
Well, I wouldn't, because I'm not
the kind of person who would be against

204
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,313
people.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,514
I'm Jack. This is my wife, Marjorie.

206
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,992
You didn't tell me
you had a sister, Jenny.

207
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,912
Please.

208
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,558
You're a lucky man, Jack.

209
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,352
Yes, I suppose I am.

210
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,674
-This is lovely.
-Thank you.

211
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,431
I'm sorry, David.
Would you like a drink?

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

213
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,508
If Jenny's ready,
perhaps we'll shoot off?

214
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,750
Actually, David,
Dad has something he has to tell you.

215
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,871
No, no. Really. Well, it was just
a question, a point of reference.

216
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,431
What's the best way to get to
St. John's Smith Square from here?

217
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,716
It's a straight run, really.
Up to Hammersmith,

218
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,677
take the A4 through Kensington,
you're there.

219
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,637
-As simple as that?
-As simple as that.

220
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,080
-Shall I book us some tickets?
-No.

221
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,714
Well, have her back by 10:00, David.

222
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,358
Well, I was hoping
she might come with me afterwards

223
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,998
for a spot of supper with my Aunt Helen.

224
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,199
Well...

225
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,350
No, no, well...

226
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,919
She's usually in bed by then.

227
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,471
What if I promise
to have her back by 11:30?

228
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,951
Well, it's Friday night,

229
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,312
and you are going all the way
to the West End.

230
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,950
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

231
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,839
All right.

232
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,193
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

233
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,912
Have a nice time.

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,991
Come on.

235
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,610
Hello, hello!

236
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,715
Are we late?

237
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,472
No, I thought
we were going to miss the beginning,

238
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,675
and then it wouldn't be worth going in

239
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,398
and we could all go off dancing
or something.

240
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,879
Helen is one of the more
reluctant members

241
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,712
-of tonight's audience.
-Hello.

242
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,031
Jenny, these are my friends,
Helen and Danny. Shall we?

243
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,510
-Hello.
-All right?

244
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,630
-4, please.
-Thank you, sir.

245
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,833
-Sorry.
-That's all right.

246
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
-It's lovely, isn't it?
-It's beautiful.

247
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,194
-Where did you get it from?
-I don't know. Chelsea somewhere.

248
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,238
Yours is... Well, good for
this sort of concert, isn't it?

249
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,353
Thank you.

250
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,549
We should go shopping together one day,
you and I, if you want.

251
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,153
That would be nice.

252
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,196
But Chelsea,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

253
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,839
Sorry?

254
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,873
I just said,
"It's too expensive for me."

255
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,990
No, you didn't.
You said something completely different.

256
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,559
No, well...

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,434
-I said it in French.
-In French? Why?

258
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,519
I don't know.

259
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,155
Well, Chelsea's too expensive
for me, too, really,

260
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,310
but we don't have to worry about that.

261
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,312
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

262
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,110
Why would David want
to take me shopping?

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,151
(INTRODUCTION ET ALLEGRO)

264
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,349
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you think?

265
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,672
I hope so! God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral

266
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,115
when I listen to classical music.

267
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,552
-That was classical, wasn't it?
-Yes. Very classical.

268
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,636
-As classical as you can get.
-Juliette's it is, then.

269
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,190
Heaven forbid we should end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

270
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,159
(A SUNDAY KIND OF LOVE)

271
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,950
* I want a Sunday kind of love

272
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,313
* A love to last past Saturday night

273
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,229
Miles Davis, Sartre...

274
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,471
Extraordinary woman, Gréco.
Just like you, Helen.

275
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,558
What about Chante Françoise Sagan?
Have you heard that one?

276
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,312
-It's wonderful.
-I've only got...

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,994
I think it's just called Juliette Gréco.

278
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,355
The one with the eyes on the sleeve?
I saved up

279
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,034
and got my French Conversation teacher
to bring it back after Christmas.

280
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,680
-You have a French Conversation teacher?
-Yes.

281
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,228
Is that why you suddenly speak French
for no reason?

282
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,109
Have you never heard her sing?
She's marvellous.

283
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,958
You should see her in Paris,
though, not here.

284
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,112
David will take you.

285
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,069
-I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
-Better than here, really.

286
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,196
Isn't it wonderful
to find a young person

287
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,192
who wants to know things?
There's so much I want you to see.

288
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,029
Are you all right
to come and have a look

289
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,190
at that Pembroke Villas place with me
on Friday, Danny?

290
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,189
No, I can't. There's a Burne-Jones
coming up at Christie's on Friday.

291
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,679
Desperate to get my hands on it.

292
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,398
You're thinking of buying a Burne-Jones?

293
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,277
A real one?

294
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,150
I just have a feeling the
Pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

295
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,958
I love the Pre-Raphaelites!

296
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,071
-Do you?
-Yes, of course!

297
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,470
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.
Not Holman Hunt so much,

298
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,551
-he's so garish.
-Absolutely.

299
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,872
Well, why don't we all go
to the auction together?

300
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,430
-Auction! Gosh, how exciting.
-It's Friday morning.

301
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,881
Friday.

302
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,995
-You're busy?
-Well, yes.

303
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,639
Tant pis.

304
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,030
Quel dommage.
C'est pas de problème. C'est...

305
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,917
-Are you sure you're busy?
-No. I'm sure I could rearrange.

306
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,599
That would be lovely.

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,198

319
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,113
It's 25 to 12:00.

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,797
-We finished tea at 7:00.
-I know what time it is.

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,513
How was your evening?

322
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,637
Best night of my life.

323
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,993
Night, Mum.

324
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,357
I think there were 1 violins,
1 cello, 2 violas, a harp...

325
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,953
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

326
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,792
I want to know
what else was on the programme.

327
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,315
It was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

328
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,595
He just said he wanted to take me places
and show me things.

329
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,035
-"Things"?
-Plural? My God!

330
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,513
I knew that Jane Eyre would
eventually work its magic on you.

331
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,790
I'm assuming that's what you're all
so animated about.

332
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,552
-Of course.
-Jane Eyre

333
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,234
-and Jenny's new boyfriend.
-He's not my new boyfriend.

334
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,238
That's true.
He's more of a man friend, actually.

335
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,232
-He's got a sports car, Miss Stubbs!
-It's maroon.

336
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,834
So could we call him
a Mr. Rochester figure?

337
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,474
I think he must be as blind
as Mr. Rochester.

338
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,236
You may or may not have noticed
I'm trying to steer the subject away

339
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,595
from Jenny's lurid love life
into the matter in hand.

340
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,519
And it is clear from this evidence

341
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,272
that most of you know
far too much about the former

342
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,998
and next to nothing about the latter.

343
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,830
Reluctantly, I have to admit
that Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

344
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,190
Excellent as always, Jenny.

345
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,112
Hello.

346
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,113
Hello.

347
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,797
Any further bids?

348
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,795
-Sold, then, for 60 guineas.
-Hello.

349
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,312
You're late.

350
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,436
We now turn to Lot 41.

351
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,796
The Tree of Forgiveness
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

352
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,755
This is a rare opportunity to purchase a
key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

353
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,798
-Who will start me off at 100 guineas?
-Is it that one?

354
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,438
Yes, that's the one.

355
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,837
15 guineas?

356
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,439
20 guineas?

357
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,874
Thank you. 40? Thank you, sir.

358
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,912
Do I hear 60?

359
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,632
80 guineas? Thank you, sir.

360
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,676
Another one, madam? 100 guineas?

361
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,759
120?

362
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,352
No further bids?

363
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,393
-Your turn.
-What?

364
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,072
-Any further bids?
-Your turn.

365
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,114
-Any more?
-Quick!

366
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,112
120 guineas from the
very eager new bidder.

367
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,793
140, madam?

368
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,959
Thank you. 160 guineas?

369
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,909
180? Thank you.

370
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,113
200 guineas?

371
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,758
220?

372
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,319
Another one, madam?

373
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,396
Sold for 200 guineas. Thank you.

374
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,040
-Your name, please?
-Mellor.

375
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,155
Now we move on to Lot 42...

376
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,629
Thank you very much. I couldn't possibly
have bought it without you.

377
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,715
Just a couple of years ago,

378
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,394
you could pick one of them up for 50 quid.
No one was interested.

379
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,670
I would have been so interested.

380
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,480
As you can see, I just love things.

381
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,311
That's not a Lockey-Hill!

382
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,158
There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

383
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,309
No, certainly not me.

384
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,198
-It's beautiful! Do you play?
-Thank you.

385
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,953
I used to. I vowed to myself
that one day I'd own one of these

386
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,792
and now I do own one,
I don't touch the bugger.

387
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,388
It's vulgar, really,
putting it on display.

388
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,913
Give it to Jenny.

389
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,319
-I think that would be even more vulgar.
-Play for us, Jenny.

390
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,109
-No, one day, when I'm good enough.
-She's good enough now.

391
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,395
David, you've never seen me play.

392
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,554
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

393
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,392
We should all go
and spend a weekend in Oxford.

394
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,553
Straw boaters, punting, cream teas...

395
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,756
-Boats.
-...antiquarian book shops.

396
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,833
Bit of business, if we can find it.

397
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,431
What about next weekend?

398
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,319
Yes.

399
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,119
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

400
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,233
-I'll talk to them.
-You're going to ask my father

401
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,356
if you can take me away for the weekend?

402
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,670
-He'd have you arrested.
-We'll see.

403
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,918
-I bet you can't.
-How much?

404
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,356
I'd be careful if I were you, Jenny.
You don't know who you're dealing with.

405
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,119
Half a crown.

406
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,279
You're on.

407
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,233
How do you know Danny?

408
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,313
You know.
We kept bumping into each other,

409
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,072
then we became pals,

410
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,554
and we've ended up doing a bit
of business together when it suits us.

411
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,155
-What kind of business?
-Property, a bit of art dealing.

412
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
Some buying and selling. This and that.

413
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,232
-Right. I'll just be 2 ticks.
-Okay.

414
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,751
-Mr. Goldman, good to see you.
-Jolly good. Madam.

415
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,073
All right.

416
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,751
-All right, I've got this one. And...
-Put me down!

417
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,559
Go on, then.

418
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,552
Sorry about that.

419
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,750
How do you know those negro people?

420
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,070
-They're clients.
-Clients?

421
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,391
Schvartzers have to live somewhere.

422
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,119
It's not as if they can rent
off their own kind, is it?

423
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,989
Test results for the Virgil translation.
We'll start from the bottom.

424
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,232
Patricia.

425
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,879
Absent.

426
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,795
Margaret, 48%.

427
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,479
Jenny!

428
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,272
52%.

429
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,879
That would just about scrape a pass
in the exam proper.

430
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,838
Not good enough for Oxford candidates.

431
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,154
-It's her Latin, isn't it?
-Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

432
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,076
But what if everyone's best isn't good
enough? What do we do then?

433
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,631
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money, anyway.

434
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,711
-You don't mean that.
-Well, what's she going to do

435
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,279
with an English degree?

436
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,079
If she's going to spend 3 years
playing that bloody cello,

437
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,435
talking in French
to a bunch of beatniks,

438
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,432
well, I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

439
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,999
Well, she might meet
a nice lawyer there,

440
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,355
but she could do that
at a dinner dance tomorrow!

441
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,432
Because that's the point of
an Oxford education, isn't it, Dad?

442
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,875
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

443
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,078
What about private tuition?

444
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,437
Can anybody hear me?
How much is this going to cost me?

445
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,954
5 shillings an hour,
maybe a little more for A-level.

446
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,873
5 bob? We spend 5 bob here,
we spend five bob there.

447
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,552
Next thing you know,
that's our savings down the drain.

448
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,278
And what else
are we spending 5 bob on?

449
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,998
What else are we spending sixpence on?

450
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,159
Nothing! No! Nothing.
All of this is free. This vase is free.

451
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,151
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

452
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,028
That chair, this sofa, it's all free.
We didn't have to pay for any of it.

453
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,554
You see,
that's the beauty of life, Jenny.

454
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,312
You don't have to pay for anything.

455
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,278
You know, there's a lovely Oxford tree
growing in the garden.

456
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,749
Lucky for you,
because that's Oxford taken care of.

457
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,395
And there's a whole orchard
of school trees, so that school is free,

458
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,949
and I think there's even
a private tuition tree in there.

459
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,792
-I'll just go and check, shall I?
-Jack!

460
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,950
It's all right, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll only be a second,

461
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,669
because I think there's a whole clump of
them surrounding the pocket money tree!

462
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,035
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

463
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,439
And by the way, you might be lucky.

464
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,239
There might be a man with deep pockets
growing out there,

465
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,151
because God knows
you're going to need one!

466
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,269
Well, you can always go
to secretarial college with Hattie.

467
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,430
-Thanks.
-Charming!

468
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,355
-God. No.
-Hello!

469
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,151
Hello, Graham.

470
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,879
I haven't seen you in ages.

471
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,631
It went a bit wrong, didn't it?
The tea party, I mean.

472
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,069
Was it because of the year off thing?
Because I...

473
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,593
No!

474
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,838
I just have so much work to do
if I'm going to get the grades I need.

475
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,880
Yeah, she doesn't have time for boys.

476
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,193
-Bye, Graham!
-Bye.

477
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,116
And I'll tell you what the first thing

478
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,475
my grandfather did when he retired...

479
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,271
was to say to my grandmother
when she expired.

480
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,151
-You do all the Goons?
-No, my Eccles is no good.

481
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,549
-No, you've got him.
-No, no.

482
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,989
-I can't do it...
-Hello.

483
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,231
Jenny. David does the most
fantastic Bluebottle.

484
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,517
-You came to see my parents?
-Why is that so hard to imagine?

485
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,872
Why are you drinking?
It's not Christmas.

486
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,476
Well, there's a lot you don't know
about us, young lady.

487
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,959
We had a life before you came along.

488
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,271
That's true. I'm only going on what
I've seen for the last 16 years.

489
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,638
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

490
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,439
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

491
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,476
But you didn't tell us
David went to Oxford.

492
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,712
-No! I didn't.
-For all the good it did me.

493
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,155
-Isn't that funny?
-Extraordinary.

494
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,989
I was just telling Jack
that I'm going back next weekend.

495
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,035
I go and visit my old English professor
every now and again.

496
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,789
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

497
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,711
It's not always what you know,
is it, David?

498
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,553
Too true.
Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?

499
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,637
Dad's never come across anyone.

500
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,352
He wrote a children's book called
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

501
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,591
-that did very well, I believe.
-CS Lewis.

502
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,148
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval Literature,

503
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,437
but I came to know him very well.
We just

504
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,113
got along.

505
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,555
Jenny used to devour those books.

506
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,071
I'd love to meet him.

507
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,150
I'm sorry,
am I being slow on the uptake?

508
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,238
Would Jenny like to come at the weekend?

509
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,074
Not this weekend,
but sometime, perhaps. Yes.

510
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,558
How often do you see him?

511
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,199
Not very often. Every couple of years.

512
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,672
Maybe next time.

513
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,912
Well, I suppose...

514
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,399
Would she have to stay the night?

515
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,635
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

516
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,951
Clive could get her a room
at the college. It's easy enough.

517
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,192
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

518
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,952
It wouldn't be a bother,
would it, David?

519
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,793
(SWEET NOTHIN'S)

520
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,149
Come on!

521
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,356
Just putting a few things in a bag!
Don't worry!

522
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,879
* Yeah, we both understand

523
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,074
* Ooh, sweet nothin's

524
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,313
Come on!

525
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,835
We're nearly ready!
Be there in 2 ticks.

526
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,751
How can they only be nearly ready?

527
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,870
I wouldn't be surprised
if 3 of them came out of there.

528
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,751
It's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

529
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,351
Ladies, come on, let's go!

530
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,196
There, have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

531
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,030
You should keep that one,
if you want it.

532
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,318
-One can only wear so many in one day.
-Thank you.

533
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,391
What about tonight?
Have you got a pretty enough nightie?

534
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,599
Won't I be sharing a room with you?

535
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,279
You haven't slept with him.

536
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,149
-No.
-Good for you.

537
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,557
-Really? Do you think so?
-Yes! Well, you're only 16.

538
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,153
-You don't want to get preggers, do you?
-No.

539
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,555
No, I wouldn't let that happen.

540
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,359
I want to wait until I'm 17.

541
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,234
-On my 17th birthday, hopefully.
-With David?

542
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,471
Golly, it will be with David, won't it?

543
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,751
If that's what you want.
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

544
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,713
Ta-da!

545
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,474
Shall we make a move?

546
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,908
* Got me wrapped around
your little finger

547
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,672
* If this is love

548
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,151
* It's everything I hoped it would be

549
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,879
Can't we get out and have a look around?

550
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,669
Later, if we have time.

551
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,150
-Imagine spending 3 years here.
-I know.

552
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,994
Why are university girls
so strange-looking?

553
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,549
They can't all have started off
that way, can they?

554
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,916
I mean, most girls aren't born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be,

555
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,558
so there must be something
about these places

556
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,837
that make you fat or spotty
or short-sighted.

557
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,718
Well, when you look at it like that,

558
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,156
I mean, that's proper scientific
analysis. You can't argue with science.

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,230
I still don't quite understand
what you want to do when you get here.

560
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,719
I want to read English.

561
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,798
-Books.
-Sorry?

562
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,991
You want to read English books.

563
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,353
"Reading English"
is just another way of saying...

564
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,908
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

565
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,434
Anyway, tomorrow
we'll get more of a feel for the place.

566
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,150
Absolutely. This place will be good
for a little business.

567
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,118
All those little old ladies
wandering around.

568
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,191
-Old ladies?
-This place is rife with stats.

569
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,920
Please explain what stats are.
You're always going on about them.

570
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,028
-It isn't very interesting.
-But you two are interested.

571
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,951
That's because
we're not very interesting, either.

572
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,712
-No, they're not, really.
-It's true.

573
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,314
That's why we need you here.
To save us from ourselves.

574
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,551
Yeah, to put some intelligence
and culture into our brutal lives.

575
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,438
-Sing to us! Sing to us!
-Please don't make me sing for you.

576
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,317
Please don't make us talk about work.

577
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,235
So, now, is he Clive, do you think,
or CS?

578
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,958
I'm confused now.
I thought you made him up.

579
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,439
No, we...

580
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,153
Never mind.

581
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,112
"To dear Jenny,
with the pleasure of meeting you.

582
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,994
"Come and see me again soon, Clive."

583
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,799
Dirty old man.

584
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,322
No?

585
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,556
We've got these exact same curtains
at home.

586
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,830
Let's not talk about curtains.

587
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,348
You look beautiful.

588
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,361
David.

589
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,118
There's something you should know.

590
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,759
I'm a virgin,

591
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,158
and I want to stay that way
until I'm 17.

592
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,358
I think that's good.
I think that's right.

593
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,073
We can still be romantic, though,
can't we?

594
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,072
Yes, of course.
As long as it's not actually...

595
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,193
Minnie.

596
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,759
Is that me?

597
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,472
Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse

598
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,358
and I'm your bubbalub.

599
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,232
Okay. If that's what you want to do.

600
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,713
-Minnie.
-Yes, David?

601
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,593
Bubbalub.

602
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,673
Bubbalub.

603
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,633
May I have a look?

604
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,999
Just a peek.

605
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,558
You just want to see them?

606
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,439
Thank you.

607
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,477
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

608
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,073
Really?

609
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,830
Might be worth a look.

610
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,033
Right.

611
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,433
-Do you want...
-No.

612
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,159
-Jenny!
-Aren't you coming?

613
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,118
-We don't go in.
-What are you talking about?

614
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,078
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

615
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,075
Helen will look after you.

616
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,594
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much. David...

617
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,636
I'm not going to tell you a second time.

618
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,599
Run along.

619
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,749
-Well, they won't be long, either way.
-Either way?

620
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,991
Well, sometimes they find something
and sometimes they don't.

621
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,436
And when they do find something,
we often have to leave quite quickly.

622
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,668
They can be quite naughty sometimes.

623
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,675
-Thank you!
-Bye!

624
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,513
-Cheerio!
-Catch! Careful. Careful.

625
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,719
Come on.

626
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,193
-Helen!
-Pass it back. Good!

627
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,674
-Jenny!
-What?

628
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,718
You can stand there if you like,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

629
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,473
Coo-ee!

630
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,433
Jenny!

631
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,156
Sorry about being
a little brisk back there, Jenny.

632
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,512
It's just the way we do things.
Silly, really.

633
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,477
Here, don't forget your case.

634
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,469
-Who's coming up for a drink?
-Me!

635
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,279
No. You go.
I'll make my own way home.

636
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,675
Jenny.

637
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,793
Jenny!

638
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,273
It's an old map. A Speed.

639
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,510
The poor dear didn't even know
what it was.

640
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,434
What a waste!
It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in

641
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,519
wherever the hell we were.

642
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,993
It should be with us.
We know how to look after it properly.

643
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,917
-We liberated it.
-"Liberated"?

644
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,519
-Yeah!
-That's one word for it.

645
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,438
Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that.

646
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,629
You drink everything
I put in front of you down in one,

647
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,758
then you slam your glass down on the bar
and ask for more.

648
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,799
It's wonderful.

649
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,909
We're not clever like you,
so we have to be clever in other ways,

650
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,879
because if we weren't,
there would be no fun.

651
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,631
We have to be clever with maps and...

652
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,398
You want to know what stats are?

653
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,836
Stats are old ladies
who are scared of coloured people.

654
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,230
So we move the coloureds in
and the old ladies move out,

655
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,512
and I buy their flats cheap.
That's what I do.

656
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,479
So now you know.

657
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,600
And if you don't like it,
I'll understand,

658
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,992
and you can go back to Twickenham
and listen to the Home Service

659
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,198
and do your Latin homework,

660
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,030
but these weekends,
and the restaurants and the concerts,

661
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,111
they don't grow on trees.

662
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,830
This is who we are, Jenny.

663
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,519
That's better.

664
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,230
-Come on, you two!
-Come on up!

665
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,632
You can have my olive!

666
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,669
Come on.

667
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,919
I suppose you have homework to do?

668
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,398
You have no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.

669
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,357
"Action is character,"
our English teacher says.

670
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,800
I think it means
that if we never did anything,

671
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,757
we wouldn't be anybody.

672
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,035
And I never did anything
before I met you.

673
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,190
And sometimes I think no one's ever done
anything in this whole stupid country,

674
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,478
apart from you.

675
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,313
-Okay.
-Right.

676
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,913
There you are.

677
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,193
Night.

678
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,797
Marjorie, look at this.

679
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,754
"Clive."
Lucky girl!

680
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,788
Never a dull moment with David?

681
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,077
Better than that young man
you brought home for tea.

682
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,031
David's a lot older than Graham.

683
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,839
Graham could live to be 200 years old,
you'll never see him swanning around

684
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,751
with famous authors.
Hasn't got it in him.

685
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,876
Graham might become a famous author,
for all you know.

686
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,110
Becoming one
isn't the same as knowing one.

687
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,239
That shows you're well connected.
Very impressive young man, your David.

688
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,718
I must admit, life's a little brighter
with him around.

689
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,230
Come on, girls, get a move on!

690
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,431
-What the hell are those?
-Russian Sobranies.

691
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,189
Where did they come from?

692
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,511
Well, she probably bought them
from the Savoy, or Claridge's,

693
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,718
or the opera or some fancy nightclub.
Who knows with Jenny?

694
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,390
Paris. You can't buy them here.

695
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,796
-You never bought them yourself?
-No, I never.

696
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,916
Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

697
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,108
But I'll bring you some back,
if you like.

698
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,478
-You are joking?
-Non.

699
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,115
-He's taking you to Paris?
-Oui.

700
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,038
-This term?
-Peut-être.

701
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,035
Wait. Isn't it your birthday
next Thursday?

702
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,392
Might be.

703
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,119
My God. Your birthday?

704
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,652
I would not like to be you.

705
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,508
All those suppers you've had off him?
Ouch.

706
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,760
You've such a Victorian attitude
to sex, you two.

707
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,513
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

708
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,272
Well, we haven't told them yet.

709
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,675
But David will come up with some story.
He usually does.

710
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,113
Yeah, I've noticed that.

711
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,189
Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.
Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.

712
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,556
Those funny cigarettes you were smoking?
Sobranies. 10 packets each.

713
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,076
How much is the Chanel perfume?

714
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,238
Are you the girl going to Paris,
or are you not, because...

715
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,272
Tina, top button.

716
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,232
Jenny, the headmistress
wants a word with you.

717
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,919
The legend of Mr. Rochester may have
travelled further than you intended.

718
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,679
Come.

719
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,433
Miss Mellor.

720
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,629
We're all very excited
about your forthcoming trip to Paris.

721
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,675
Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds.
Some of us can talk of little else.

722
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,110
An older man, I understand?

723
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,069
A word of warning, Miss Mellor.

724
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,436
There may well have been
the odd 6th-form girl who has lost

725
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,114
an important part of herself,
perhaps the best part,

726
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,435
while under our supervision.
These things happen, regrettably.

727
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,272
If, however,
we are made aware of that loss,

728
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,351
then of course
the young lady in question

729
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,032
would have to continue
her studies elsewhere.

730
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,350
If, that is,
she still has any use for A-levels.

731
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,677
Do I make myself clear?

732
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,236
-Can I go now?
-If you would.

733
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,238
What are you doing in there?

734
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,989
Well, I imagine
she's lighting the candles on my cake.

735
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,191
You're 17, not 250.

736
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,872
-Thanks for inviting me.
-It was Marjorie's idea, not mine.

737
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,277
-Not even Jenny's, for that matter.
-Dad!

738
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,588
Ta-da!

739
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,516
Well, blow them out before
the house burns down.

740
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,157
-Make a... Okay, just... Don't wait.
-Bravo.

741
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,949
Who'd like a piece?

742
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,792
-Me, please.
-Well, come on, come on. Presents.

743
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,319
It doesn't matter, I'll...

744
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,759
It's a new Latin dictionary.

745
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,229
Thank you. I needed a new one.

746
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,678
Dear! Got a... Snap!

747
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,677
Good grief!
Jenny, you should see this!

748
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,876
-It's a special day.
-She's a special girl!

749
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,393
I know it.

750
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,154
Bit of help!

751
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,231
Makes your dictionary look
a bit feeble, Graham?

752
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,436
-Gosh!
-And these are for you.

753
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,080
-Hello, young man.
-David!

754
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,469
-David, would you like a drink?
-I'd love one.

755
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,517
I'd best be going, 'cause I've got
a stack of homework to do, so...

756
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,553
Well...

757
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,870
-Thank you. Bye.
-Cheers.

758
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,511
-Bye, Mr. Mellor.
-Cheerio, Graham.

759
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,079
Thank you.

760
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,591
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

761
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,791
-Goodbye, Jenny.
-Bye, Graham.

762
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,388
-A little something warming?
-You know me so well.

763
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,311
-Can I open anything yet?
-Wait for me.

764
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,312
Before you open that lot,
I've got a surprise. Next weekend,

765
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,472
we're all going to Café de Flore
to celebrate Jenny's birthday.

766
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,393
-Lovely!
-Café de Flore

767
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,239
is in the Boulevard St. Germain,
in Paris.

768
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,874
-What do you mean, Paris?
-You know the one, Dad.

769
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,638
No, no. No, no, no.

770
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,476
No, we don't have any French money.

771
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,357
And besides, it's too...

772
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,871
Well, I don't think
it would agree with me.

773
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,190
-Dad!
-The French don't like us, Jenny,

774
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,192
you know that. John Sutton, from work,
he went there last year.

775
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,431
They were very rude to him.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun,

776
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,030
but it's just not for me, Europe.

777
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,992
-You'll have to go another time.
-You've just said you don't like Europe.

778
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,071
So what's going to change?
It'll have to be Europe, won't it,

779
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,628
-because it certainly won't be you.
-I'll take her.

780
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,312
-To the continent?
-Why not?

781
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,028
-And leave me here on my own?
-For God's sake!

782
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,039
What do you think?

783
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,515
You know what Jenny's like
about France, Jack.

784
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,350
-French films and books and music.
-Of course I do.

785
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,352
Sorry, yes. It goes without saying.
She's your daughter.

786
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,277
Jenny likes to joke
about how you're a stick-in-the-mud

787
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,397
and all the rest of it,
but I know that's not who you are.

788
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,669
Otherwise, she wouldn't be who she is.

789
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,195
No.

790
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,999
But I can also see
that I have acted out of turn,

791
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,469
and I'm sorry.

792
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,837
What about your Aunt Helen?

793
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,310
-An hour late.
-We'll make it. I promise.

794
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,070
Okay, there's a flight
at 8:00 in the morning.

795
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,839
Good.

796
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,598
There's no bed.

797
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,875
I pushed the boat out
and got us a suite.

798
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,918
-A suite?
-Yeah.

799
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,830
Well, if work stops us
from getting to Paris until tomorrow,

800
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,639
then work can buy us a nice hotel room.

801
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,354
Anyway, it's a special occasion,
isn't it?

802
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,838
I'd have thought tonight, of all nights,
we'd only need a bed.

803
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,712
Hold on, one second. I've got something.

804
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,673
I thought...

805
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,637
I thought we might practise with this.

806
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,233
With a banana?

807
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,880
I thought we might get the messy bit
over with first.

808
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,279
What?

809
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,559
David!

810
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,593
I don't want to lose my virginity
to a piece of fruit!

811
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,439
I'm sorry.

812
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,479
Hey.

813
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,470
-I think the moment might have gone.
-Hey, hey...

814
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,609
-I think we should wait until Paris.
-I'm sorry

815
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,079
Minnie, I...

816
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,716
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

817
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,479
David,

818
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,230
if tomorrow night does happen,
it's only ever going to happen once.

819
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,440
Why will it only ever happen once?

820
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,631
Because the first time
can only ever happen once.

821
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,717
So...no baby talk.

822
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,559
No Minnie.

823
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,390
Just treat me like a grown-up.

824
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,313
Okay?

825
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,517
I know.
Let's go and sit in our sitting room.

826
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,079
All right.

827
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,753
We'll order up some champagne.

828
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,319
Room service?

829
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,753
(SUR LES QUAIS DU VIEUX PARIS)

830
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:51,791
* Quand doucement tu te penches
En murmurant, "C'est dimanche"

831
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,315
* Si nous allions en banlieue
faire un tour

832
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,358
* Sous le ciel bleu des beaux jours?

833
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,351
* Mille projets nous attirent

834
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,838
* Mais dans un même sourire

835
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,434
* Nous refaisons le trajet
simple et doux

836
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,638
* De nos premiers rendez-vous

837
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,553
* Sur les quais du vieux Paris

838
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,315
* Le long de la Seine, le bonheur sourit

839
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,273
* Sur les quais du vieux Paris

840
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,876
* L'amour se promène en cherchant un nid

841
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,150
* Vieux bouquiniste
Belle fleuriste

842
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,233
* Comme on vous aime
Vivant poème

843
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,795
* Sur les quais du vieux Paris...

844
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,429
* De I'amour bohème

845
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,035
* C'est le paradis

846
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,116
Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?

847
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,710
It wasn't too uncomfortable?

848
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,628
Not after the first bit.

849
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,150
It's funny, though, isn't it?

850
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,472
All that poetry and all those songs

851
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,278
about something
that lasts no time at all.

852
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,033
Yeah.

853
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,591
All your exercise books on my desk
in a pile, please.

854
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,311
I bought this for you.

855
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,031
That's very kind of you.

856
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,753
But I can't accept it.

857
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,639
Why not?

858
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,314
It's because of people like you

859
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,109
that I plough through illiterate essays
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

860
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,275
But I know where this came from, Jenny,

861
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,357
and if I took it, I feel
I would be betraying both of us.

862
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,199
Jenny?

863
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,274
You can do anything you want.
You know that.

864
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,675
You're clever, and you're pretty.

865
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,872
Is your boyfriend interested
in clever, Jenny?

866
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,471
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

867
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,677
I'm telling you to go to Oxford,
no matter what.

868
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,749
Because if you don't,
you'll break my heart.

869
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,473
-Where did you go?
-Cambridge.

870
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,232
Well, you're clever and you're pretty,
so presumably clever Miss Stubbs won

871
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,958
and here you are with your pony essays.

872
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,072
I don't know, these last few months,
I've eaten in wonderful restaurants

873
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,075
and been to jazz clubs and watched
wonderful films, heard beautiful music.

874
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,113
-Jenny, are you taking precautions?
-It's nothing to do with that.

875
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,871
-Isn't it?
-Maybe all our lives are going to end up

876
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,235
with pony essays, or housework.

877
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,798
And, yes, maybe we'll go to Oxford,

878
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,313
but if we're all going to die
the moment we graduate,

879
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,630
isn't it what we do before that counts?

880
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,718
I'm sorry you think I'm dead.

881
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,952
I don't think you're dead,
I just don't...

882
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,917
I think you'd better go
to your next class.

883
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,119
Go, go, go!

884
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,592
Well done, Jenny!

885
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,148
I've never won anything before, not even
at the Women's Institute raffle.

886
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,435
And I always bet on the sweetest looking
one and he always comes last.

887
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,272
-Let's go. Come on.
-Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky.

888
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,993
Come on, let's go,
I don't want to miss him.

889
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,311
-Pick up your 10 bob on the way out.
-I won 10 shillings!

890
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,355
-Who is this man, anyway?
-Peter Rachman. Complete bastard.

891
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,310
Well, why do we have to see him here?

892
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,516
Because he's not the sort of chap
with an office.

893
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,958
All right.

894
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,393
Ladies.

895
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,031
A bottle of your finest champagne, please.

896
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,919
There he is.

897
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,909
Come on, Jenny, tell them
your good news. Don't be bashful.

898
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,672
No, be Sneezy!

899
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,669
Jenny got 2 As and a B
in her mock A-levels.

900
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,876
Like everyone else
in this sophisticated establishment.

901
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,758
-The B was in Latin.
-Seriously, congratulations.

902
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,239
Excuse us.

903
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,118
Don't worry too much.

904
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,879
About what?

905
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,556
Someone told me that in about 50 years,
no one will speak Latin, probably.

906
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,552
Not even Latin people.
So don't worry about your B.

907
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,631
He's even more of a bastard
than I thought.

908
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,631
You wouldn't want him
to marry your sister.

909
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,393
You wouldn't want to talk to him
in a club, come to that.

910
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,915
You do know what you're doing,
old chap? With Jenny?

911
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,351
-This is the one, Danny.
-Right.

912
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,792
That's it!

913
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,753
-You can see she's different.
-I just don't want to see her hurt.

914
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,352
(I'M COMIN' HOME)

915
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,235
Have you bought
any more paintings recently?

916
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,633
Have I? Yes! Picked up a little Piper.
Good one, I think.

917
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,872
I'm still trying to work out what makes
good things good. It's hard, isn't it?

918
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,679
Well, the thing is, Jenny, you know.

919
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,750
Without necessarily being able
to explain why.

920
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,078
See, you have taste.
That's not half the battle.

921
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,679
That's the whole war.

922
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,915
Jenny, we should go. It's late.

923
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,274
-Really?
-Yes.

924
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,920
Alas. One day school
will be over forever

925
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,911
and we can talk about art all night.

926
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,118
-You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

927
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,872
Let's go. Come on.

928
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,953
Good night.

929
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,753
Wait here.

930
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,437
-David, what are you looking for?
-Just...

931
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,759
What are you doing?

932
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,552
Will you marry me?

933
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,319
What were you looking for?

934
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,077
I thought I had a ring.

935
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,908
It wouldn't have been the right one,
but it would have done for tonight.

936
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,439
David.

937
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,679
I'm serious.

938
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,872
You're very sweet.

939
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,752
What do you think?

940
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,356
-Take me home.
-All right.

941
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,518
<i>They do need some looking after,</i>

942
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,750
<i>but nothing that will require
too much work.</i>

943
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,195
<i>Just leave them in your potting shed
for a couple of weeks</i>

944
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,674
<i>and they'll look after themselves.</i>

945
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,910
<i>Fine, the potting shed.
Who does he think I am,</i>

946
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,672
<i>Prince Rainier of Monaco?</i>

947
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,433
<i>What if I got married
instead of going to college?</i>

948
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,638
-Married?
-Married.

949
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,756
Well, it would depend
on who it was, of course.

950
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,276
-Would it? That's interesting.
-Well, of course it would.

951
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,510
I wouldn't want you married off
just for the sake of it.

952
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,956
-Thanks.
-Has somebody asked you?

953
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,951
-Yes.
-Who?

954
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,758
-David?
-No. A man I just met walking his dog.

955
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,200
-What did you tell him?
-Nothing yet.

956
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,635
Do you have a choice, or is it too late?

957
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,670
Of course she's got a choice!

958
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,914
An interesting one, too?

959
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,117
This is where you're supposed to say,
"But what about Oxford?"

960
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,395
Well, look at it another way.

961
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,755
You wouldn't really need to go now,
would you?

962
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,235
I wouldn't need to go?
Would you like to expand on that?

963
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,355
-You'd be looked after.
-All that Latin. All those essays!

964
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,150
What was the point? Why didn't you just
send me prowling round nightclubs?

965
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,310
It would have been less trouble
and I might have had more fun!

966
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,392
I don't know about nightclubs,
I know about education.

967
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,596
Anyway, looks like
it might have turned out

968
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,079
-for the best.
-How?

969
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,119
He wouldn't want you if you were thick,
now, would he?

970
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,038
"May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

971
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,475
"Sings: 'Whoop, Jug! I love thee..."'

972
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,438
When it says "sings",

973
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,238
it means you sing the line.

974
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,352
Never mind. Right. Lear.

975
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,193
"Does any here know me?
This is not Lear.

976
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,876
"Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?
Where are his eyes?"

977
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,757
"Waking? Who is it that 
can tell me who I am?"

978
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,956
Miss! Me. I can.

979
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,877
-Jenny.
-What?

980
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,393
Take it off.

981
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,917
My God! Is that what I think it is?
I'm going to be a bridesmaid!

982
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,593
You know the school rule on jewellery.

983
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,472
Half the girls in this room
are wearing jewellery.

984
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,152
Yes, but none of it's going
to ruin their lives.

985
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,838
We have a difference of opinion
about that.

986
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,996
How far advanced
are these ridiculous plans?

987
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,828
Have you set a date?
Have you decided on a church?

988
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,432
We won't be getting married in a church.
David's Jewish.

989
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,839
Jewish?

990
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,953
He's a Jew?

991
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,189
You are aware, I take it,
that the Jews killed our Lord?

992
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,034
And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

993
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,831
I suppose he told you that.

994
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,313
We're all very sorry about what
happened during the war,

995
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,231
but that's absolutely no excuse

996
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,153
for that sort of malicious
and untruthful propaganda.

997
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,839
Anyway, I can see you're far more
in need of responsible advice

998
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,399
than I realised.

999
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,917
Nobody does anything worth doing
without a degree.

1000
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,036
Nobody does anything worth doing
with a degree. No woman, anyway.

1001
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,517
So what I do isn't worth doing?

1002
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,398
Or what Miss Stubbs does,
or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?

1003
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,278
Because none of us would be here
without a degree.

1004
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,998
You do realise that, don't you?
And yes, of course,

1005
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,111
-studying is hard and boring...
-Boring!

1006
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,354
-I'm sorry?
-Studying is hard and boring.

1007
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,637
Teaching is hard and boring. So
what you're telling me is to be bored,

1008
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,756
and then bored and finally, bored again

1009
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,319
but this time for the rest of my life?

1010
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,830
This whole stupid country is bored.

1011
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,393
There's no life in it, or colour
or fun. It's probably just as well

1012
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,471
the Russians are going to drop
a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

1013
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,553
So my choice is
to do something hard and boring,

1014
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,359
or to marry my Jew

1015
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,956
and go to Paris and Rome
and listen to jazz

1016
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,749
and read and eat good food
in nice restaurants and have fun.

1017
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,596
It's not enough to educate us
any more, Mrs. Walters.

1018
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,477
You've got to tell us
why you're doing it.

1019
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,274
It doesn't have to be teaching,
you know. There's the Civil Service.

1020
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,349
I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mrs. Walters,

1021
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,555
but it is an argument worth rehearsing.

1022
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,028
You never know, someone else might want
to know the point of it all one day.

1023
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,029
-Where did you find him?
-I can't tell you that.

1024
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,997
-Why?
-I think he likes you. Do you like her?

1025
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,117
"Yes, I do like her."
You do? You don't...

1026
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,760
You don't remember? It's Jenny.
You remember her from last time.

1027
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,355
"No, I don't." Yes, you do!
Naughty thing. You... Pardon?

1028
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,876
That's revolting!
You stick to your own species.

1029
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,713
He wants to kiss you,
I think.

1030
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,233
Is that naughty?

1031
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,917
-We're engaged.
-Who is?

1032
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,954
-No! Really?
-Yeah.

1033
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,268
-Engaged?
-Show her.

1034
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,430
-Yes! Look.
-Gosh!

1035
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,674
-That's fantastic news!
-Thank you.

1036
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,669
Congratulations.

1037
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,718
I knew you'd see sense about university.
You'll stay pretty now.

1038
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,598
Can I still read?

1039
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,716
Of course. But it doesn't have to be
books now, does it?

1040
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,872
Magazines will do just as well,
and you learn more from them, anyway.

1041
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,355
-Helen.
-Well you won't be laughing, David,

1042
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,635
when she goes all speccy and spotty.

1043
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,834
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.

1044
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,673
I noticed that, too.
I thought he might be a bit jealous.

1045
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,198
Jealous?

1046
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,510
We're going to keep him away from you.

1047
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,033
I mean, what is one supposed to order
as a starter, anyway?

1048
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,236
And how will I know
what is a starter and what isn't?

1049
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,869
We've been through this, Dad. It'll be
quite clearly marked on the menu.

1050
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,117
Can't the 3 of you just go
on your own and leave me here?

1051
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,679
I'd be perfectly happy
with a tin of salmon.

1052
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,272
-Hello.
-Hello.

1053
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,150
Ready?
I think you'll like this place, Jack.

1054
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,310
Their wine list is as good
as anything I've seen in London.

1055
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,992
Yes. Someone told me that.

1056
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,390
David, probably.
Who else would it have been?

1057
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,359
Madame.

1058
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,232
I was hoping you'd take us in this.

1059
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,276
You won't want to drive in anything else
after tonight.

1060
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,795
-Mind you, it drinks petrol.
-Yes.

1061
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,548
I'm afraid we'll have to stop
on the way into town.

1062
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,231
I feel like Eamonn Andrews.

1063
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,673
-Is that a good thing?
-Eamonn Andrews

1064
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,433
is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.

1065
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,073
-How are you tonight, sir?
-Very well. Might as well fill her up.

1066
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,989
I'm going to make a quick call.
I'll be 2 ticks.

1067
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,114
Do you think I should offer
to help pay for the petrol?

1068
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,679
Would he be insulted, do you think?

1069
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,990
I know he said tonight was his treat,

1070
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,310
but does that apply to the petrol,
do you think?

1071
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,277
I'm sure it does, Jack.

1072
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,833
-No.
-Jack!

1073
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,872
It just came off.

1074
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,710
-Put it on my bill.
-Thank you, sir.

1075
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,439
Cheers.

1076
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,152
Jenny? Jenny.

1077
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,553
Take us home.

1078
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,279
-What's wrong?
-I'm afraid there's been...

1079
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,237
-Jenny's had a bit of a shock.
-What's happened?

1080
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,711
It's just another one of David's
little muddles and misunderstandings.

1081
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,877
I don't want to hear another word
from anybody. Take us home.

1082
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,473
-Now.
-All right.

1083
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,838
You can take care of this,
can't you, David?

1084
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,319
Go inside, Dad.

1085
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,874
"Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman."

1086
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,554
"Mr. and Mrs. David..." You're married!

1087
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,558
Legally, yes, but I...

1088
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,348
-When were you going to tell me?
-Soon. It...

1089
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,315
It's just never seemed
like the right time.

1090
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,837
You seemed so happy
and I was happy and...

1091
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,912
You were living with your wife
all this time.

1092
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,670
Round the corner! Byron Avenue!

1093
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,796
It's no wonder
we kept bumping into each other, is it?

1094
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,553
-What number?
-34.

1095
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,236
Don't be like this. Come on.

1096
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,512
I have nothing.

1097
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,671
I didn't take my exams. I...

1098
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,193
I left school!

1099
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,031
Where's it all gone now?

1100
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,117
I can get a divorce.

1101
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,912
Everything will turn out for the best.

1102
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,192
Go and tell them.

1103
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,309
Go and tell them,
and then go and tell your wife.

1104
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,999
They won't listen now.

1105
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:33,637
All right? I'll come round tomorrow,
when everyone's feeling a bit calmer.

1106
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,478
Please don't make me...

1107
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,516
Please don't make me tell them
on my own.

1108
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,669
You owe me that much.
You owe them that much.

1109
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,155
I owe them much more than that.

1110
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,873
Hey.

1111
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,159
2 minutes, and then I'll
come out and drag you in.

1112
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,239
What's going on?

1113
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,872
He's helping himself
to some Dutch courage before facing you.

1114
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,875
Stolen Dutch courage,
from the look of it.

1115
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,154
He has something he has to tell you.

1116
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,993
He just drove off!

1117
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,712
Can you tell us?

1118
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,513
Jenny, please!

1119
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,395
I wouldn't worry about it
too much.

1120
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,478
-When I found out...
-Not now, Helen.

1121
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,797
I tried to tell him.

1122
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,995
I'm not speaking to him now,
if that's any consolation.

1123
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,393
It's a funny world you people live in.

1124
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,755
You both watched me
carrying on with a married man

1125
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,592
and you didn't think it was worth
saying anything about it.

1126
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,272
Yes, well,
if you want that conversation...

1127
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,749
You watched David and I
help ourselves to a map

1128
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,832
and you didn't say much, either.

1129
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,070
Come on, you, let's go. Good boy.

1130
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,915
Hello.

1131
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,470
Hello. Sorry, I think I've got the wrong
number. I was looking for my...

1132
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,915
I wanted... For my cello lesson.

1133
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,997
No. Don't tell me.

1134
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,479
Good God.

1135
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,919
You're a child.

1136
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,309
You didn't know
about any of this, presumably?

1137
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,798
No. They never do.

1138
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,635
You're not in the family way, are you?
Because that's happened before.

1139
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,872
Thank God for that.

1140
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,471
No. No. You stay here.

1141
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,629
-Did you see her?
-Yes, I saw her.

1142
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,636
I didn't talk to her.
There wasn't any need.

1143
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,756
We have to have this out.

1144
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,236
Well, if you won't do it, I will.
I'm still your father.

1145
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,993
You're my father again now, are you?
And what were you

1146
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,389
when you encouraged me
to throw my life away?

1147
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,152
Silly schoolgirls are always
getting seduced

1148
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,071
by glamorous older men.
But what about you two?

1149
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,033
Jenny?

1150
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,913
Jenny.

1151
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,918
Jenny, I'm sorry.

1152
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,559
I know I've made a mess of everything.

1153
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,990
All my life I've been scared

1154
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,274
and I didn't want you to be scared.

1155
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,392
That's why I wanted you to go to Oxford.

1156
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,632
And then along came David
and he knew famous writers,

1157
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,154
he knew how to get
to classical music concerts...

1158
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,754
But he wasn't who he said he was.

1159
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,959
He wasn't who you said he was, either.

1160
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,950
The other day, your mother and I
were listening

1161
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,112
to a programme on the radio
about CS Lewis,

1162
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,193
and they said
that he'd moved to Cambridge in 1954.

1163
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,793
I said, "Well they've got that wrong."

1164
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,035
Our Jenny wouldn't have his name
in her book

1165
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,190
if he'd moved to Cambridge.

1166
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,635
There's a cup of tea
and some biscuits out here.

1167
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,315
How do you think we can help?

1168
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,315
I want to repeat my last year at school
and take my exams.

1169
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,918
I got the impression last time we spoke
that you didn't see the point of school,

1170
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,070
or of me, or of any of us here.

1171
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,198
I know. I was stupid.

1172
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,237
The life I want, there's no shortcut.

1173
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,479
I know now
that I need to go to university.

1174
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,558
It gives me absolutely
no pleasure whatsoever

1175
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,632
to see our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1176
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,233
Although, of course, you are not
one of our schoolgirls any more.

1177
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,719
Through your own volition.

1178
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,636
I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.

1179
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,231
You're not a woman.

1180
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,234
No, I'm afraid I think
that the offer of a place at this school

1181
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,231
would be wasted on you.

1182
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,438
Come in.

1183
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,755
I didn't expect to see you again.

1184
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,793
This is lovely.

1185
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,734
All your books and pictures and...

1186
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,189
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1187
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,799
That's all you need, isn't it?

1188
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,837
Just somewhere to...

1189
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,389
I'm sorry I said those silly things.
I didn't understand.

1190
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,511
Let's forget about it.

1191
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:43,679
-A Burne-Jones.
-Do you like him?

1192
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,955
I do. Still.

1193
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,510
"Still"? You sound very old and wise.

1194
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,837
I feel old, but not very wise.

1195
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,993
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

1196
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,759
I was so hoping
that's what you were going to say.

1197
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,118
Thank you, Marjorie.

1198
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,800


1199
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,432
It's from Oxford.

1200
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,191
"It is my pleasure to inform you

1201
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:01,991
"that your application to read English
at Oxford has been accepted.

1202
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,150
"On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,

1203
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,153
"the staff of the university
look forward to welcoming you..."

1204
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,920
So I went to read English books,

1205
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,116
and did my best
to avoid the speccy, spotty fate

1206
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,634
that Helen had predicted for me.

1207
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,430
I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless as any other student.

1208
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,713
But I wasn't.

1209
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,998
One of the boys I went out with,

1210
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,559
and they really were boys,

1211
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,832
once asked me to go to Paris with him.

1212
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,471
And I told him I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris,

1213
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,517
as if I'd never been.

1214
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:09,837
(SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE)

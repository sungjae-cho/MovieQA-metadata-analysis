Here's what I
don't like about it.

108

You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,208
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

110
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,760
and it's almost
like you're doing it

111
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,345
because you feel
bad about yourself.

112
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,137
He called me late,
and we hung out.

113
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,843
It wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
It was fun.

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,311
Ew! You had
sex with him.

115

it near my face.

don't they?

120
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,163

Let us offer.

121
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,490
If we don't offer...

122
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,583
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.

123
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,659
I couldn't.

124
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,542
You don't want to
look right at it.

125
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,835
No.

126
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,964
It's too aggressive.
It's like...

"Hello."

128
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,549

Those are the balls?

130
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,264
Yeah.
I'm trying to make it round,

131
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,974
but I can't
because I have elbows.

132
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,683
He is so hot, though.

133
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,021
Look, I know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,

134
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,067
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

135
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,146
You're a total catch,
and any guy

136
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,273
would be psyched
to be your man.

137
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,700
You should just
make room

138
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,240
for somebody who
is nice to you.

139
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,322

He's honest!

140
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,156
He told me that
we are what we are

141
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,033
and we're just having fun.
And I like that.

142
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,336

you need dental work.

wrong with my teeth.

I don't want

154
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,236
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!

155

have gone down Mason.

Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

163
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,552
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

164

Oh, I don't know.
What do you think, honey?

Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.

167

That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

168
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,018
Yeah.
Yeah.

169
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,858
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't

174
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,083
know who you're
sleeping next to.
It is scary.

175
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,788
I mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

176
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,960
It is scary.

177
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,836
So did you guys
want to look at
these engagement rings?

178
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,172
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

179
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,598
I'll be here.

180
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,812
Thank you.

181
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,680
What was that about?

182
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,564
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

183
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,815
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.

184
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,943
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

185
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,524
and how your
boyfriend left you,

186
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,196
and maybe marriage
will work out.

187
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,824
Show me your
"love is eternal" face.

188
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,500
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.

189
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,329
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?

190
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,163
What's up, Don-Don?

191
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,836
You make up
the best nicknames.

192
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,711
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

193
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,007
Don't sue me
for touching you.

194
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,640
Show Annie your
"love is eternal" face.

195
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,853
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

196
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,397
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

197
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,065
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

198
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,195
Look, I'm trying
really hard.

199
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,405
You've just
got to try harder.

200
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,282
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,

201
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,331
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and I'm doing her a favor.

202
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,406
I understand.

203
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,036
Oscar, get back to work.

204
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,922
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.

Oh, hey, roomie.

211
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,072
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

212
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,279
I got a free tattoo.
You did what?

213
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,199
I could not believe it.
The guy said,
"Do you want a tattoo?"

214
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,245
Just a random...

the side of his van.
No.

216

He said, "It's for free!"
And I said, "Sure."

217
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,042
You said yes?
Yeah!

218
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,496
Yeah. Look.
See here?

219
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,956
What is it?

220
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,083
See that?

221
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,672
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

222
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,095
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

223
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,432
It's a Native American
symbol meaning "wasted."

224
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,510
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's...

Hello. How are you?

226
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,977
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
It's really infected.

227
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,224
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

228
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,475
Yeah, a little bit.

229
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,901
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

230
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,024
Yeah. It can't hurt.
All right.

231
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,447
So, I just wanted
a quick word.

232

You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.

233
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,614
I was getting my check,
and I wondered

234
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,953
if I could get
your check, too?

235
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,281
Yes.
I'm getting
the money.

Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

242
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,310
Because it's a kind of,
like, "needing it
today"-type situation.

I'm very happy
that you are here.

What?
Because I want
to eat an apple.

255

Would you like
some apple?

256
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,546
What is that?
I got engaged.

What?
I know!

been acting so weird

and he thought he
was gonna blow it.

he was going to
break up with me.

Well, he became
a gay prostitute.

he had hit his bottom.

honey,

that maybe this
is your bottom.

hitting bottom
is a good thing.

They've been
married 12 years.

342
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,789
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

343
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,372
I'm sure she greets
him in the evening,
beaver first.

344
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,131
I don't want to
think about that.

345
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,795
I bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.

346
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,801
'Cause there was
one thing I would
never do,

347
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,303
and I'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.

348
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,600
I don't want to know.

349
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,515
It's called
a "chicken coop."
Of course it is.

350
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,471
You start at the back
and you peck your way

351
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,976
to the front like
you have a beak.

352
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,309
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.

353
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,152
That's gross.

354
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,855
Well, I'm sure
your dad likes it.

355
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,236
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.

356
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,317
Okay.

357
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,661
You sure you don't
want to move in with me?

358
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,202
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

359
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,749
No way in hell.
Yeah?

360
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,825
No, thanks.

361
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,331
Think about it.
Okay.

362
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,537
You don't need
your own place.

363
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,588
Yeah, I kind of do.
Okay.

364
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,998
All right,
I'm going to go.
All right.

365

I know.

This is your

Isn't that crazy?

It's so beautiful.

Dougie's boss
is a member here.

I know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, I guess.

They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,

they are disgusting.

It's going great.
I'm on the mend.

428
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,225
I just got some
pins in my legs.

429
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,438
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
I can still do this. Right?

but I'm back.

I met a dolphin down there.

And I swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,

438
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,960
but into my soul.

439
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,708
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

440
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,464
And he said,
"I'm saving you, Megan."

441
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,128
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
I'm assuming, telepathically.

442
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,846
We had a connection
that I don't even
know if I can... Jesus.

It's a pleasure.

He's not...
I'm not... He's not...
I'm not with him.

448
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,732
Sorry.
All right.

because I'm going to
climb that like a tree.

to meet Helen.

I better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.

that you two should
get married right now

489
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,674
I'm not going to go
on with a big speech,
so I'll just say this.

a part of this celebration.

That was so sweet.

497
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,404
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?

498
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,197
And they were
working the entire weekend,

499
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,875
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.

500
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,875
And I shared things with you
that I've never
shared with anyone.

501
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,176
And you made me realize
how I can trust people again.

502
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,216
So let me just say,

503
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,556
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

504
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,600

so proud of you.

Sorry. And, Dougly...

00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,312
I'm sorry, inside joke.

507
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,192
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

508
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,148
because I still
need my drunken

Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

516
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,924
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

517
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,088
Umm...

518
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,513
I just wanted to
say really quick that
(SIGHING)

519
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,096
you are so special
to me, because...

520
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,149
Well, one of the reasons is
because I've known you
my whole entire life.

521
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,233
And you've really
helped shape who I am.

522
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,649
I just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

523
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,484
as your maid of honor.

524
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,446
I know you had
some other choices,

525
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,953
but you are like my sister,
and I love you.

526
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,785
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

527
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,870
Thank you.
One last thing.

528
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,254
It's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

529
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,459
and that's you, Lil.

530
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,170
I went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

531
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,631
and there is
a beautiful saying
that I learned there.

533
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,558
It means,
"You are a part of me,

00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,144
"a part that I could
never live without,

535

"and I hope and I pray
that I never have to."

And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.

539
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,665
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.

540
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,367
I just wanted to
say really quick...

541

Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?

542
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,579
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

543
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,963
Lillian and I took
Spanish together in school.

544
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,883
And so, I would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here...

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

546

Thank you.

547
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,740
Thank you.
I feel so close to you
and can trust you.

548
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,120
You are my
angel and soul mate.

549
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,376
And I feel I can
communicate with you
with simply a look.

550
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,300
Thank you for coming.

551
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,800
Here, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

552
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,928
Yep, I got it.

LILLIAN: Man,
engagement parties rule.

564
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,652
It made me feel awesome,

565
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,446
like I can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.

566
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,278
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

567
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,614
What?
I'm just like...

568
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,449
I don't know.
She's in your wedding

569
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,705
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?

570
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,703
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.

571
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,543
I'm just...
Like, the whole gown,
and the...thing.

572
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,468
It's just weird, right?
You know what?

573
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,888
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

574
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,307
She's really...
She's a good one.
I'm telling you.

575
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,761
Well, I'm sure if you
like her, I will like her.

576
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,309
You have to just
get to know her.

577
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,186
Yeah.
Which I think
you really should.

578
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,108
And... Will you
just do me a favor?

579
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,685
Would you just hang
out with her once,

580
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,312
just the two of you.
All right?

581
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,988
As a favor to me.

582
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,235
Okay, I will.

I love you, too.

I'm sorry.

Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.

588

We've only known each other
for five minutes.

See? Okay?
I'm not drunk. I told you.

594
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,438
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?

595
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,819
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can I stop walking now?

596
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,818
You can stop walking
when I tell you
to stop walking.

Hey, look.
If I was drunk,

598
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,071
would I be able to do this?

Please, stop.

Please, stop.
I believe you.
You are not drunk.

601

But I'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.

What? Why?

about brake lights.
You have to have them.

God, those have
been out for a year.

Please, I promise
I will get them fixed.

This week, I promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?

and registration,
please.

Wynnewood Drive.

Yep.
We are neighbors.

over on Ashley.
Ahh.

614
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,555
I used to work on Ashley.

615
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,807
You did? Where?

616
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,733
I had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.

Oh. Cake Baby.

You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!

It was your face.

You made good cakes.

623
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,951
Thanks.

624
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,163
You used to make these
little pastry things,

625
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,001
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard...

626
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,418
Cream puffs.

627
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,799
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.

628
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,517
I used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

629
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,139
with, like, a wormy face.

630
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,933
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

631
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,475
Sorry.
No, no. It was...

632
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,858
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

633
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,566
when the business
went under. So, anyway...

634
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,196
You're kidding?

635
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,948
What a dick.

636
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,122
I'm glad
I never tipped him.

637
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,621
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

638
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,415
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?

639
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,125

What? What?

640
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,335
Get your
taillights fixed...

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,295
I promise.
I promise I will.
I promise. Thank you.

...before you kill someone.

643
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,763
I'm not going to
kill anybody.

Here, there's your ID.

to give you this.

shop in Milwaukee.

Different guy.
Yeah.

651
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,106
And don't mention
the whole "Bill
Cosby" thing to him.

652
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,613
It drives him nuts.
I mean it.

653
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,035
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

654
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,955
You know what?
If you mention my name,
that I referred you,

655
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,828
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.

656
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,080
My gosh. Thank you.

657
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,378
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.

658
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,081
Okay. Well,
I appreciated your cakes.

659
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,962
So, we are even.

nice of you.

We are not all bad.

664
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,220
What?

665
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,725
I was just saying,
we are not all bad!

666
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,352
Oh. Yeah.

667
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,150
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

668
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,728
I'm the best of them.

669

I didn't know
you played tennis.

673
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,641
Yeah, I played
a little in
high school.

674
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,518
I'm so glad we
were able to do this.

675

I'm really glad we
could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.

I know, right?
Yeah.

It's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.

Ohh. I know.

680
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,650
But she's not really
that into sports.

681
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,280
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

682
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,737
that was too competitive.

683
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,827
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

684
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,658
It's funny how
people change, isn't it?

685
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,037
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
Do people really change?

686
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,709
I think they do.

687
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,050
Yeah, but, I mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

688
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,719
I think we change
all the time.

689
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,265
I think we stay the same,
but grow,
I guess, a little bit.

690
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,802
I think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

691
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,229
But, I mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.

692
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,852
Not really,
I don't think so.

693
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,566
I think so.
I don't.

you guys up to?

00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,245
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

Fuck off, Helen.

00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,585
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

I've seen better
tennis playing in

Umm...

721
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,523
I've been thinking, and...

722
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,401
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

723
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,781
She's been here
long enough.

724
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,830
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.

We split it three ways.
What do you say?

00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,035
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

Yeah. So, technically,
I'm only allowed to tour.

I have no way
of earning money,

go and prostitute
down on the street.

00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,903
What diary?

742
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,864
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

743
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,984
You read my...
You read my journal?

744
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,287
At first, I did not know
that it was your diary.

I thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.

make any...

the deep personal details

748

mentioned Gil and Brynn...
ANNIE: No, no, no, no.

Don't read my journal!
GIL: And the crumbs.

750

Then...
Don't go in my room!

00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,089
Well, hello! I think,
before you make
those sort of demands,

752
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,514
you need to,
maybe, think about

753
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,974
putting a note on
your door saying,

754
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,349

read my diary and
wear my clothes."

a little scary

is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

this is where
Brazilians come to eat.

I got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

She always drags me
to the weirdest places

762

and the food is
always incredible.

And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.

00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,840
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

likes Brazilian food.

I'm bringing anybody,
I guess.

00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,790
Please, can I
set you up? Please?

778
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,342
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?

779
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,590
If you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.

780
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,841
Maybe.

781
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,261
I'm sorry.

784
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,644
Yeah, I'll have
some of that, please.

785
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,815
I'll start with this.

786
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,394
I'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.

787
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,275
This is crazy
good, ya'll.

788
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,231
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?

789
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,740
It's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.

790
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,162
I feel a bit
bloated, so...

791
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,284
Not me.

792
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,582
HELEN: No?
No. Physically,
I don't bloat.

793
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,834
Lucky.
That is lucky.

794
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,915
It's a gift.

795
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,753
I can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.

797
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,838
And be a mom.

798
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,015
Yeah?

799
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,263
The other night,
I'm slaving away,

800
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,470
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

801
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,935
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.

802
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,854
I said, "No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight."

803
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,436
He goes,
"Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?"

804
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,279
He's nine.

805
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,449
Okay, now that
Lillian's in the bathroom,

806
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,902
I just wanted to
talk to you guys about
the shower really quick.

807
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,410
I was thinking it
could be French-themed,

808
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,037
since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.

809
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,037
So I figured we
could bring Paris here

810
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,207
and have champagne
and little cookies.

811
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,792
They'd say "Lillian
and Dougie" on them.

812
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,464
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

813
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,217
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

814
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,090
I love that.
Good idea, Annie.

815
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,175
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.

816
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,385
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

817
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,470
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

818
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,226
Good. Great.

819
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,978
I don't know.
It's really cute.

820
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,059
But I feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

821
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,228
a bit,
"Been there, done that."

822
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,691
I just feel
like we can top it.

823
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,147
We should throw
some ideas around.

824
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,449
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

825
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,072
or something
they'd been thinking of.

826
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,403
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

827
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,410
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.

828
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,874
That, and I'll just
snowball on top of that,
also <i>Fight Club</i>.

829
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,584
Female fight club.

830
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,671
We grease up,
we pull in.

831
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,425
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, "Surprise!
We're going to fight!"

832
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,180
We beat the shit out of her.

833
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,557
She's not going
to forget that.

834
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,676
We just fucking attack.

835
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,933
Can I be honest?
No.

836
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,187
I'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.

837
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
What about
the bachelorette party?

838
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,106
That's what's more important.

839
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,691
I've got a new tube top,
I want to cut the tags off.

840
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,739
I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

841
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,029
Where are we going?
MEGAN: I'm going
to second her.

842
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,735
We'd better
blow this shit out.
Yeah.

843
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,492
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

844
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,949
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

845
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,117
Because she's realizing,
"Holy shit!

846

1018
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,366
It happened.

1019

No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

doing it, aren't you?

00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,096
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

1025
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,852
Right.
Thank you.

1026

You okay?

1027
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,320
I crapped
my wedding dress.
I crapped...

1028
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,121
I... I crapped
my wedding dress.

Lunch was fun,
though, right?

1030

It was a good time,
all the girls together.

Is this a sign, Annie?

1032
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,421
No. I'm just
going to pull over

1033
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,295
really quick,
though, because...

Hi.

These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.

I'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.

1057

But Becca spoke
so highly of you.

1058

She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.

Okay.

Do you watch movies?

I guess everybody is.
I don't know. Why?

1072

Because my mom is
going to kill you.

uncomfortable.

01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,568
That can't be true.

1355
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,942
People don't keep
guns up their asses

1356
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,494
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1357
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,074
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1358
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,080
What?
In his back pocket.

1359
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,787
You have got to get
something out of your ass

1360
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,914
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

1361
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,870
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

1362
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,586
I don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.

1363
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,793
I can put my Nano.
I will show you.

1364
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,298
I will...
If you get me scissors,

1365
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,841
I will cut
a hole in my pocket.

1366
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,218
And you will
never find this again
until I want you to find it.

1367
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,940
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,

1368
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,357
only after
we have showered

1369
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,355
separately.

1370
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,529
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished

1371
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,740
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

1372
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:19,371
And then I pretend I'm tired,
but I'm not tired.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1373
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,533
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

1374
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,328
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.

1375
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,381
Excuse me, could I
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?

Seven and Sevens.

1378
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,885
You will like it.
It's sweet.

1379
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,550
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1380
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,686
But I heard about
a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.

1381
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,893
She got sucked
into the toilet.

1382
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,516
Sucked right in.

1383
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,771
Are you okay?

1384
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,067
Yes.

1385
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,734
Yeah, I just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.

1386
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,404
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1387
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,829
Why don't you take
my scotch?

1388
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,915
It will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

1389
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,750
Honestly,
I do it all the time.
Yeah?

1390
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,381
Yeah, and I'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

Well, thanks.

1392
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,218

Okay.

Yeah, it's good.

1396
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,396
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1397
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,609
Okay.

1398
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,615
Ohh. Look at that.

Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

1400
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,251
So you don't even
have sex anymore?

1401
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,754
No, I have sex constantly.

1402
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,381
The sex is constant.

1403

kissed me in five years.

when you are
having sex, then?

and wishing it would stop.

1406

a little bit mad at me,

Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.

1696

I just slept with
a cop that pulled me over

1697
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:46,707
and I woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.

I ran out

01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,026
Please pull over!
Why?

2024
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,479
Because I would rather
get murdered out here

2025
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,735
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.

2026
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:55,441
Can you please
just pull over?

2027
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,910
Come on, Annie.
It's called humor.

2028
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,912
Learn about it.

2029
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,703
Besides, I would
never last a half-hour.

2030
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,371
Goodbye, Ted.

2031
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:15,716
If you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.

2032
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,465
You used me!

2033
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,932
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!

2034
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,070
<i>Wilson!</i>

2035
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,082
<i>Wilson! I'm sorry!</i>

2036
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,831
<i>I'm sorry, Wilson.</i>

2037
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,005
<i>Wilson, I'm sorry!</i>

2038
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:52,748
<i>I'm sorry!</i>
(SNIFFLING)

2039
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,129
Oh, no, Wilson.

2040
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:55,463
<i>Wilson!</i>

2041
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:56,544
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

2042
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:59,343
I'm coming in.

2043
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,508
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.

2044
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,801
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!

2045
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,562
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!

2046
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,848
Okay, we're coming...
We're coming in.

2047
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:11,309
Everybody is in
and having fun.

2048
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,728
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.

2049
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:15,438
Heel!

2050
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,318
How many of
those did you take?

2051
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,114
I took nine.

2052
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:25,032
Yeah, I did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

2053
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,038
It turns out, I'm probably
more comfortable with six.

2054
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,295
It's a lot... That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

2055
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,047
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

2056
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,757
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

2057
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,465
And say what, Megan?

2058
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,514
Say, "Hi, I can't
get off the couch.

2059
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:45,184
"I got fired from my job.
I got kicked out
of my apartment.

2060
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:48,513
"I can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.

2061
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,145
"I don't have any friends.
The last time I..."

2062
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,567
You know what I
find interesting
about that, Annie?

2063
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,612
It's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

2064
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,155
You know why
it's interesting?

2065
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,657
Here's a friend
standing directly

2066
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:01,150
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

2067
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,697
And you choose to
talk about the fact

2068
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,240
that you don't
have any friends.

2069
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,697
You know what I mean.

2070
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,198
No, I don't think
you want any help.

2071
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,329
I think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

2072
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,502
I think Annie wants
a little pity party.

2073
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,667
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

2074
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,340
You're an asshole. I'm life.
Is life bothering you?

2075
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:17,462
Yes! What are you doing?

2076
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:18,672
I'm life, Annie.
I'm life, Annie.

2077
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,300
You have got to
fight back on life.

2078
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,630
Megan!

2079
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,007
You better learn to fight.

2080
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:25,257
Megan!

2081
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,139
I'm life and I'm going
to bite you in the ass!

2082
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:29,178
(SCREAMING)

2083
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,226
Megan...
It's not me.
I'm your life. Turn over!

2084
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:32,477
My God!

2085
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:36,436
I'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

2086
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:37,566
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

2087
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,984
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

2088
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,650
I'm your life, Annie.
I'm your shitty...
(GRUNTS)

2089
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,027
I'm sorry.

2090
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,154
Nice hit.

2091
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:50,950
All right.

2092
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,286
I'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

2093
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,996
I knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

2094
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:57,840
I think...

2095
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,343
I think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

2096
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,550
A girl named Megan.

2097
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,214
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

2098
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,887
a very good time
in high school.

2099
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,144
I'm referring to
myself when I say "Megan."

2100
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,225
It's me, Megan.
Yeah, I got that.

2101
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,890
I know you look at
me now and think,

2102
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,941
"Boy, she must have
breezed through high school."

2103
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,564
Not the case, Annie.

2104
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:21,489
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

2105
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,157
They used to
try to blow me up.

2106
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:24,867
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

2107
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,485
Firecrackers.

2108
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,284
I mean literally.
I'm not saying
that figuratively.

2109
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,082
I got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

2110
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:33,868
Do you think I
let that break me?

2111
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,583
Do you think I went home
to my mommy, crying,

2112
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,416
"I don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends"

2113
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,876
No, I did not.
You know what I did?

2114
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:44,462
I pulled myself up,
I studied really hard.

2115
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,718
I read every book in
the library. And now?

2116
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,219
I work for the government.
I have

2117
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,762
the highest possible
security clearance.

2118
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,390
Don't repeat that!
I won't.

2119
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,515
I can't protect you.

2120
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,056
I know where
all the nukes are
and I know the codes.

2121
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,104
I won't say anything.

2122
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,478
You would be amazed.

2123
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,071
A lot of shopping malls.

2124
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,489
Don't repeat that!

2125
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,858
I won't.

2126
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,116
I have six houses.

2127
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:09,532
I bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because I could.

2128
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:10,830
Okay, you lost Lillian.

2129
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,247
You got another best friend

2130
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,996
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.

2131
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,955
Huh?

2132
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,753
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

2133
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,039
Okay, 'cause I do not
associate with people

2134
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:21,791
that blame the world
for their problems.

2135
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,626
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.

2136
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:26,170
And you're also
your solution.

2137
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,261
Right? I mean, that's...

2138
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,468
You get that?

2139
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:34,103
I just miss her, I guess.

2140
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,140
Yeah, I know you do.

2141
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,566
I know you do.

2142
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,943
All right, come on.
Bring it in.

2143
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:43,441
There's the Annie...

2144
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:45,238
There's the Annie I
knew was there, okay?

2145
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,609
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.

2146
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:48,734
I'm sorry.

2147
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,239
You've got to
wash that hair.

2148
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,183
What's wrong?

2149
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,689
Nothing.

2150
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,018
(SIGHING)

2151
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:24,691
I love you.

2152
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,669
Looks great. Thank you.

2153
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:44,711
Rhodes and I worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.

2154
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:46,508
Are you serious?

2155
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,007
Yeah. I owe him big time.

2156
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,005
That's really nice.

2157
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,681
Hey, Mom?

2158
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,146
This is my mom, Judy.

2159
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:05,228
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

2160
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,233
Good to meet you, too.

2161
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,233
Wait a minute,
don't I know you from AA?

2162
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,911
BILL COZBI: Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?

2163
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,571
It's good, huh?

2164
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,701
It's just delicious.

2165
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:21,470
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

2166
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:22,596
Come in.

2167
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,278
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?

2168
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,022
It's Lillian's big day.

2169
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,902
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.

2170
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,536
I'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

2171
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,118
Mom, it's 8:00
in the morning.

2172
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,661
You can put syrup on it.

2173
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:46,286
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

2174
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:51,542
(EXCLAIMS)

2175
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,047
I know.

2176
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,212
Hi.

2177
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,638
What do you want?

2178
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,845
I was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.

2179
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,139
No, why would I...
What do you mean?

2180
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:04,138
I can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.

2181
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,396
What?

2182
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:07,645
She is missing.
Can you help?

2183
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,814
Okay, just wait here.
I think I know

2184
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,650
someone that
might be able to help.

2185
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:13,985
I'll get my keys.
Can I just use...

2186
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:21,075
I mean, I just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.

2187
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,747
Everything was going smoothly.

2188
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,791
The dress looked fantastic.
It had come in from Paris.

2189
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,411
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.

2190
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:32,125
I had organized everything
to the last final detail.

2191
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:33,675
I just...

2192
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:35,507
I don't know
what's happened to her.

2193
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,839
I don't know.
You should know, right?

2194
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:41,221
You're her best friend.
It's weird that
you don't know.

2195
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:42,635
You guys are so close.

2196
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:50,226
Annie, I want to
apologize to you personally

2197
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:53,104
for all of the things
that have gone down.

2198
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,109
I know that I hurt you,

2199
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,691
and that I created a distance
between you and Lillian.

2200
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,617
I want to
apologize for that...
I don't want to hear...

2201
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:01,241
...and everything
that happened

2202
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,909
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas...

2203
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,786
Okay, I don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.

2204
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,959
I don't even
want to talk to you.

2205
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,829
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.

2206
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:12,631
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.

2207
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,334
I'm basically just by myself.

2208
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,466
I don't want to...
I don't feel sorry for you.

2209
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,382
I really liked
that original dress

2210
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,224
you picked at
the bridal store.

2211
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,224
I thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.

2212
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:29,773
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.

2213
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,104
And I know...

2214
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,153
I don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

2215
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,228
No, it did.

2216
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,362
No, I don't think it did.

2217
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,441
It was the food.
I shit my pants
on the way home.

2218
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,945
I don't think it
was your fault.

2219
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,236
That was my fault.

2220
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,785
I think people just
ask me to their weddings

2221
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,580
because I'm good at
organizing parties.

2222
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:53,415
I don't have any
female friends.

2223
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,958
I'm so sorry.

2224
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,461
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2225
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,300
It's just...
It's just...

2226
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,931
It's the first time I've
ever seen you look ugly.

2227
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,842
And that makes
me kind of happy.

2228
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,971
I look ugly? No, I don't.
I don't really look ugly.

2229
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:11,352
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.

2230
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,149
No, I'm not really
an ugly crier.

2231
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,818
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.

2232
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:16,320
Just a little bit.

2233
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,155
It's just my makeup.

2234
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,362
But I still look pretty good.

2235
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:26,163

2236
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:28,448

2237

Rhodes.

2238
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,086
Come on! Rhodes!

2239
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:34,872
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.

Excuse me! Please!

Rhodes,
I know you can hear me,
and I know you're mad at me,

2243
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,550
but I need your help. Please!

2244
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:51,059
You know this guy?

2245
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,322
What are you doing?

2246
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,025
I just want to
get his attention.

2247
01:49:04,329 --> 01:49:06,411
Annie! Oh, my God.

2248
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,954
ANNIE: (SHOUTING)
Reckless driving!

2249
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:16,998
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?

2250
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:19,341
I'm speeding!
You better pull me over!

2251
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:23,549
Really?

2252
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:25,555
Here comes
the litter-bug!

2253

Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.

2254
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,773
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while I'm driving.

2255
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,351
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!

2256
01:49:39,448 --> 01:49:40,437
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

2257
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,147
Beer!

2258
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,273
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2259
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,071
Idiot.

01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,626

I feel really sick, Annie!

01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,763
Hey, who's driving that car?

2267
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:17,562
Can we go up now?

2268
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,394
That's not clever.

2269

Hey!

01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:23,397
I'm topless!

2271
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,191
I'm totally topless.

Really?

2273
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,914
Wow. Unbelievable.

01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,172
I don't know.

Hey! Are you crazy?

2277
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,258
Are you crazy?

2278
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:50,344
All of that stuff,
that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

I'm sorry. I just...
I really need your help.

We can't find Lillian.

2281

How long has she been gone?

2282
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,891
She's been
missing for 12 hours.

2283
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,309
12 hours?

2284
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:03,024

until it's at least 24 hours.

It's Helen.

Hello, Helen.
I've heard wonderful things.

2295
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,890
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.

2296
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,641
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone

2297
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:35,393
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.

2298
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,562
Do you know where that is?

2299
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,685
Yes. That is her apartment.

2300
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,645
I thought you said
you looked there.

2301
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,855
We did. We did.
Last night.

2302
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:44,023
Okay.

2303
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:47,065
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

2304
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:48,820
She must have gone
back after you left.

2305
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,196
God, that was crazy of her.

2306
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:51,660
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.

2307
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:52,994
Okay.

2308
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,825
We found her!

2309
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:04,248
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to
waste your time.

2310
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,174
That's embarrassing.

2311
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,257
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.

2312
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,339
It's this kind of
high-octane stuff

2313
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,507
that really made me
want to become a cop.

2314
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,934
"Missing girl found
at her apartment."

2315
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:17,514
It's...

2316
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:19,680
It's adrenalin-pinching.

2317
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:23,650
It's nice to see you.

2318
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:30,486
I'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.

2319
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:32,572
Means I won't have
to stop you again.

2320
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,536
Okay.

2321
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:41,869
Annie, let's go.

2322
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:45,998
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.

01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:49,384
Bye.

2325
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:20,078
Do you mind actually
if I go by myself?

2326
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,577
Sure.
Okay.

2327
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,413

2328
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,048

Lil?

2330

LILLIAN: Go away.

2331
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:42,933
What happened?

2332
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,107
This whole
wedding is fucked up.

2333
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:51,734
Helen just took
over everything, and

2334
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,700
everything's got
out of control.

2335
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:58,654
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

2336
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:03,082
This has been really
hard to do without you.

2337
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:07,083
It's been shitty.

2338
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:10,916
I'm sorry.

2339
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,793
Nope. I'm sorry.

2340
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:16,092
I'm sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding.

2341
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:18,973
It's my fault.

2342
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:20,096
No, it's my fault.

2343
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:23,099
I think I'm the one
with the mental problems.

2344
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,521
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

2345
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:25,889
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

2346
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:26,973
Yes, technically.

2347
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,977
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
I out-crazied you.

2348
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,650
Everything's
going to be okay.

2349
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:36,116
Yeah? How do you know that?

2350
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,659
I left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

2351
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,949
I told Dougie I
had to go get Q-tips.

2352
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:45,492
And

2353
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:49,705
all of a sudden,
I realized I was
driving here.

2354
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,880
I came here.

2355
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:57,759
I realized this
is the last time
I'm going to be here

2356
01:54:57,933 --> 01:54:59,639
in this apartment

2357
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,050
with that couch,

2358
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:02,676
and this bed,

2359
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,765
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2360
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,771
Because you know
how much I love my bathtub.

2361
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:07,980
It's a good tub.

2362
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,726
I slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

2363
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:13,483
Everything's gonna change.

2364
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:16,989
I mean, I'm not
going to get to

2365
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,030
live five
minutes away from you.

2366
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:23,822
And it makes me so sad.

2367
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,327
Well, don't be.

2368
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:32,923
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

2369
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,467
but they'll be better.

2370
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,387
You know?

2371
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:43,350
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

2372
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,640
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

2373
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:48,976
And so do I.

2374
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:55,775
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?

2375
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:03,787
I'm gonna be fine.

2376
01:56:06,251 --> 01:56:08,958
So don't worry, okay?
I'm gonna be...

2377
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:10,744
I'm gonna be fine.

2378
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:12,625
I am fine.

2379
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:19,674
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.

2380
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,760
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

2381
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:25,804
Whatever you say, boss.

2382
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:30,184
All right, let's get
your dress on,

2383
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,273
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.

2384
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:35,526
Oh, yeah.

2385
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,771
That's the other problem.

2386
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:52,294
Don't you dare laugh.

2387
01:56:53,215 --> 01:56:54,796

Okay.

2390
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:03,555
I cannot wear this dress!

2391
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,298
Okay, don't panic.

2392
01:57:06,478 --> 01:57:07,968
(CRYING)
This is a nightmare.

2393
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:10,349
We'll fix it.

2394
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:12,185
We'll tweak it.

2395
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,395
I will not let you
walk down that aisle

2396
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,351
unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
I promise.

2397
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:19,818
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?

2398
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,905
I think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.

2399
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:26,076
No, don't say that.

2400

If Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,

2401
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,084
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.

2402
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,159
That's true.

2403
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:36,998
MINISTER: Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?

2404
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:40,175
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her

2405
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,257
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her

2406
01:57:43,348 --> 01:57:45,339

both shall live?

2407
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:46,468
I do.

2408
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,347
MINISTER: And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?

2409
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,769

vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

2413

I pronounce you
husband and wife.

2414
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:03,197
You may now kiss the bride.

00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:32,682
1 ... 2 ... 3!

5
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,485
My name is Jordan Belfort.

6
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:36,819
He did not.

7
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,121

I am a former member of the class

00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:44,994
in a small apartment
in Bayside, Queens.

00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:48,631
When I turned 26 years old I was the Chief

12
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,067
I made $ 49 million.

13
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,837
What annoyed me because i missed three
million to 1 million per week.

14
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,176
No.

15
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,912
My Ferrari was white as
Don Johnson in Miami Vice.

16
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,414
It was red.

17
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:10,553
See that amazing house?

18
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:12,255
It is mine.

19
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:16,159
In Addition to Naomi and my
two perfect children.

20
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:19,328
I own a mansion,
private jets, 6 cars, 3 horses.

00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:31,874
I also bet

Drink like a fish,
have sex with prostitutes

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,345
Perhaps 5 or 6 times
week.

25
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:38,748
I have 3 federal agencies
trying to catch me.

26
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,016
By the way ...

27
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,151
I love drugs.

28
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:48,458
Ok.

29
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,259

00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:06,275
Up, up!

32
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,913
Relax.

33
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,259
Are these good?
Yes, I am.

34
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:25,161
Good job.

35
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,296
Take care of yourself, okay?

36
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,932
Until next time,
brother.

37
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,334

For a month.

41
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:47,583
Mr. Jordan looks good.

42
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,153
I take painkillers 10
to 15 times per day.

43
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,654
For my back pain.

44
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,222
Adderall to stay focused.

45
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,426
Xanax not get nervous
and dozed a little.

46
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:59,195
Cocaine to get up
morphine again and good ...

47
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,931
Because it's amazing.
Good morning.

48
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:11,507
But all drugs
God put on this earth.

49
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,177
There is one that is my favorite.

50
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:16,879
You see ...

51
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,948
enough of this
will make you invincible.

52
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,051
Able to conquer the world

53
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,454
and eviscerate your enemies.

54
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,325
I'm not talking about this.

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,994
But This.

56
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,667
The money will not only
buy a better life.

57
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,169
Best food, best cars,
best vaginas.

58
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,238
Also it makes you a
better person.

59
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,376
You can support the church
or a political party.

60
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,745
You do what you eat
to earn money.

61
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:55,485
I always wanted to be rich.

62
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:56,919
So let me go back.

63
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,457
22 years old, newly married
and crazy about money.

64
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:02,959
So what do I do?

65
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,496
I go to the only place I Could
quench my great ambitions.

66
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:24,180
You're lower than
rubbish in a puddle.

67
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,249
Got a Problem With That?

68
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,584
Jordan?

69
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,953
I have no problem.
Right.

70
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,321
Because that's what
you are.

71
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:33,489
Rubbish puddle.

72
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,125
Your job is to be a connector
meaning

73
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,028
That marcaras to phone
more than 500 times a day.

74
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,964
Trying to connect to my
with wealthy businessmen.

75
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,233
And until you pass
your trial period

76
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,668
this is all you do.

77
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,136
Sit.
Sit!

78
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,408
Just so you know last year
I made over $ 300,000.

00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,011
The guy who worked for

80
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,246
$ 1 million.

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,249
I can not Imagine
lout Should be that guy.

82
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,885
Jordan Belfort?

83
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,253
Mark Hanna.

84
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,655
It's a pleasure to meet you.

85
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:08,157
Also, I see you've met

head to 1.

88
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:13,997
Hey, fuck him.

Want to know how it sounds

Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.

00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,072
It was an injection
adrenaline.

105
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:58,708

is getting rich.

Thank you.

134
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,342
Mr. Hanna.

135
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:44,747
Are you able to get high during the day
and you can even do your job?

136
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,683
How the fuck else
I could do?

137
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:48,918
Cocaine and prostitutes
my friend.

138
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,653
Right.

139
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,425
I must say I'm excited
to be part of your signature.

140
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,996
Customers who have are ...
Customers rot.

141
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,633
Your Responsibility is only
put meat on the table.

142
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,236
You have a girlfriend?
I am married.

143
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,306
I have a wife, her name
Teresa is. It is a hairdresser.

144
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,008
Congratulations.
Thank you.

145
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:13,343
Think Teresa.

146
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:14,577
The name of the game.

147
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,412
Move the money
pocket of your customer

148
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,214
to yours. "

149
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:21,284
But if you can make him win
customer money at the same time

150
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,486
is beneficial for all,
Right?

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,455
No.

152
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,957
Rule number one
Wall Street.

153
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,460
Nobody ...

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,829
I do not care if you're
Jimmy Buffet.

155
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:35,631
Nobody knows Whether the actions
They will rise,

156
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:37,867
down, turn sideways
in fucking circles.

157
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,402
Less us
runners.

158
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:42,171
It's quite a fugazi.
You know what is That?

159
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,640
Fugazi, wants
say false.

160
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,879
Fairy Dust
does not exist.

161
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:51,848
It does not matter,
does not matter.

162
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,516
Not in the
periodic table.

163
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,284
It's not real.

164
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,421
Follow Me.

165
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,490
We do not
create shit.

166
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:01,758
We do not build anything.

167
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,760
No. ..
If you have a customer

168
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,428
I buy shares' $ 8.

169
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:08,097
And now worth 16 Which
this fucking happy.

170
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,334
Wants to charge, take the money
and run home.

171
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:12,735
Do not leave it.

172
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:14,637
Ok ...
Because That would make real.

173
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:16,339
If ...
What do you do?

174
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,341
Have another brilliant idea.

175
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,109
A special idea.

176
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,445
Another situation,
other action.

177
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,081
To recover its investment
gains and then some.

178
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,883
It will do every time.

179
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,818
Because They are addicted.

180
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:32,322
You do it again and again.

181
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:33,556
Meanwhile ...

182
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,026
I thinks he is doing
millionaire, what is true, in part.

183
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:38,761
But you and I runners.

184
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:40,997
We took home
cash.

185
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,333
By the commission,
bastard.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,168
Right.

187
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:47,904
It's amazing sir.

188
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:50,139
Do not know how excited I am.

189
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,908
Should be.
There are two key.

190
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,677
To be successful in
this business.

191
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:56,512
First of all.

192
00:10:58,881 --> 00:10:59,949
You must keep peopl.

193
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,417
If ...

194
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:02,752
Do you masturbate?

195
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,088
If I masturbate?

196
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:06,489
If ...

197
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:07,957
If I do.

198
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,292
How many times a week?

199
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,663
Maybe 3 or 4 times.

200
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,665
Those numbers are for rookies.

201
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,002
Personally I
At least masturbate

202
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:20,837
twice daily.

203
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,172
Once in the morning
after exercise.

204
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:24,841
Then again after
lunch.

205
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,442
Really?

206
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,012
I want to do but do not
do so.

207
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,347
I do it because i need it.

208
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,984
Imagine trying to
numbers all day.

209
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,153
Decimal points.
Adjusted frequencies.

210
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,923
Damn digits.

211
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,260
All that shit you accumulate
above the shoulders.

212
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,629
Do you understand?
Decays to some people.

213
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,832
You have to hang the turkey
blood flow.

214
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,035
That pace to continue
below the belt.

215
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,236
Done.

216
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,505
This is not advice,
is a recipe. Believe me.

217
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,306
If you do not.

218
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:58,941
You're going to unbalance.

219
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,044
We will divide into two
and you will fall to the side.

220
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,379
Worse, I've seen this happen.

221
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,681
Lmplosionaras.

222
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,582
I will not implode, Lord.
No. ..

223
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,651
Of course not.
I'm here to stay, you know?

224
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,219
If Implosions are ugly.
If ...

225
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,822
Run to the bathroom and do it
Whenever you can.

226
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,924
When you return good
so, to think

227
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,592
money while doing it.

228
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,995
Second

229
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,663
key to success.

230
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:24,834
In this package I have a
small drink called cocaine.

231
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,904
Right.
It will keep you alert Between the ears.

232
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:30,373
It will help your fingers
That mark faster.

233
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,574
Guess.

234
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,343
That's good for me.

235
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:35,545
Yes sir.

236
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:37,747
Revolutions, do you understand?

237
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:41,317
Revolutions.
Keep the client in the wheel.

238
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,754
Never for the park is open
24 hours, 365 days a year.

239
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,590
Every decade, every damn century.

240
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:49,492
That's it.

241
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,160
It is the name of the game.

242
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,330
Help yourself.

243
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:56,032
Thank you.

244
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,544
We will.

245
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,884
We are a common
denominator.

246
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,662
Follow the rhythm.

247
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,946
The next six months I met
the inputs and outputs of Wall Street.

248
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:47,817
Money earned while fucking
I prepared for big.

249
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:05,702
Then, I was a runner
licensed to end.

250
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,071
Ready to make my fortune.

251
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:12,342
My first day as a future
master of the universe.

252
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,095
They called Black Monday '

253
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:33,997
Do not tell me.

254
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:37,700
By 4pm the bag had
dropped 500 points.

255
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,004
The worst decline since 1929.

256
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:46,909
I do not mind a European country,
They want to do what.

257
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,544
Our market is here.

258
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,179
Want to say something?
You know what happened?

259
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,715
A damn tsunami.
You're making a big mistake.

260
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,817
Yes, speak to your boss.

261
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:58,988
When many people hang

262
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,657

263
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,091

264
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:13,569

Within a month, LF Rotstraut.

269
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,750
An institution since 1899.

270
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,485
It closed its doors.

271
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,288
Wall Street had swallowed me

272
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,657
and Expelled
again.

273
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:39,662

Not what you think.

456
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,926
They say you marry
your cousin or something.

457
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:01,297
My wife ... if my wife
He's my cousin.

458

00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:17,547
It developed very well,
you know.

464
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,949
All my friends wanted
mount, you understand.

465
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:22,318
I thought, I'll let
None of these

466
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:26,089
idiots take my cousin.
Then That I use to be cousins

467
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,658

468
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:30,126
someone else's lame.

00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,662
If someone was going to do,
Should be.

470
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:33,997
Out of respect, you know?

471
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:37,500

00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:45,675
Are they right?
They are not retarded or anything.

476
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:47,910
But there is a great
true risk?

477
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,880
If you know
no 60,

478
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:54,250
65% That the child risk
is fucking retarded.

479
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,652
That scares me friend.

480
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:59,789
There is always the Possibility though
They are cousins ??or not.

481
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,291
What if something
well happen?

482
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:04,427
Basically if the child
out delayed

483
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:06,829
would take to the field

484
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:11,334
and say, you're free now.
"Run and be free".

485

486
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,676

00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,097
My partner and I are interested
in renting your shop.

520
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:23,333
Donnie and I were
to go on our own.

521
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,002
The first thing needed
was runners.

522
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:28,171
Boys experience
sales.

523
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:30,473
So some were recruited
my city friends.

524
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,242
Sea Otter, who sold meat
and marijuana.

525
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:36,713
Chester, who sold tires
and marijuana.

526
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,582
And Robbie, who sold
grabbed everything.

527
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:41,284
More than anything marijuana.

528
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:43,920
Can you bring me ketchup?

529
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,488
He is Brad.

530
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,090
Brad was the one
really wanted.

531
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,758
But not wearing
fine with us.

532
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:50,994
Enough in itself to
money selling Quaalude.

533
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,763
That became the King
the Quaalude of Baysack.

534
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:55,264
Have Vagina there or what?

535
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,167

Do you understand me?

538
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,172
Hey Zip!

539
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,541
Tell your sister that
ask for it.

540
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,177
Bring a pair of her panties
the next time you come.

541
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:11,247
She no longer wants to talk.

542
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:13,182
Get out of here.

543
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,818
Mama we?
chicken or what?

544
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,321
Mama.

545
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,990
Do you hear me?
It's easier than you think.

546
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:25,161
All people on the phone they want
and get rich quick.

547
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:26,763
We get something for nothing.

548
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:28,998
I once wanted to sell
marijuana about Amish.

549
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:32,535
You know those who have beards
and no mustache, that shit.

550
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:36,039
He says he just wants
make furniture.

551
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,708
I do not understand.
What does that matter?

552
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,077
What are you talking about?

553
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:43,579
Not to put words
in your mouth but you just said

554
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:46,015
everyone wants
be rich.

555
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,318
You just said that.

556
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,487
What do they talk?

557
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:53,489
As Buddha, do not care
money.

558
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:55,591
They just want to wrap sheets.
Do not buy anything.

559
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,293
I'm not talking about Buddha or Amish.

560
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:58,828
I'm talking about normal people.

561
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,530
Working people
daily.

562
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:02,298
Everyone wants to be rich.
Am I crazy?

563
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:04,834
Good but some believe
in that nonsense.

564
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:07,670
Ketchup please.

565
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:09,572
Do not want to make money?

566
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,842
Do not want to make money?
I want to make money, right?

567
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,077
I can sell anything.

568
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:16,112
I can sell lubricant
a convent full of nuns.

569
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:17,880
So hot that neither
need.

570
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:20,249
That's the attitude.
Can you sell anything?

571
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:21,884
Sell ??me this damn pen.

572
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:23,152
Can you sell anything?
Sell ??this.

573
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:24,787
Sell ??me the pen.

574
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,323
Can I finish
eat first?

575
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,359
Brad show him how.

576
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,427
Sell ??me this pen,
come on.

577
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:32,862
What do you sell
this pen?

578
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,364
That's my boy.
This pencil.

579
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:35,932
You can sell
anything.

580
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:38,067
Do me a favor, write
your name on that napkin.

581
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:39,802
I do not have a pen.

582
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:41,504
Exactly, supply and demand
my friend.

583
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,973
See what I mean?
You need to create.

584
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,742
Make them want
buy the stock.

585
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,610
As if they needed it.
Do you understand?

586
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,845
That's the thing.

587
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,380
All nuns
are lesbians.

588
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,181
What the fuck you talking about?

589
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,083
Think it can not do
with men.

590
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:55,618
So you must ...

591
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,720
How often?
I ordered 4 times.

592
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,323
Here it comes.
So if it comes.

593
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:03,092
I know these guys you were not
Harvard graduates.

594
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,263
Robbie Feinberg, the Pinhead.
Took 5 years to finish high school.

595
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,566
Alden Kupferberg, he Sea Otter
Not even graduated.

596
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,669
Chester Ming, a wicked
China man.

597
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:14,637
I thought Jiujitsu
I was in Israel.

598
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,006
The most intelligent of the group
Nicky was Koskoff.

599
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:19,008
He attended school
laws.

600
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:22,345
He said "Rugrat" for his
awful toupee.

601
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:26,416
Still Dateli youth
hungry and stupid.

602
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:27,884
Soon.

603
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,419
The rich do.

604
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,089
OMG.

605
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:34,724
Jordan is ...

606
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,627
Like baby?
God is beautiful.

607
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:42,031
They are the largest in the world,
but of very good quality.

608
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:43,499
They are beautiful.

609
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:45,468
They are.

610
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:47,236
God ...

611
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:50,006
What?
Something tell me.

612
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,675
What is it?
I do not know, I just ...

613
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,912
these actions.
These companies.

614
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:58,014
Companies are garbage.

615
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,215
Well yeah.
Ok.

616
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:00,917
They are terrible.

617
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,620
Do not worry, I told you
it was completely legal.

618
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,990
I know but will not make more money.

619
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,124
Right?

620
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,827
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes not.

621
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,295
You know how it is.

622
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:14,931
Do not you feel better if you
you sold it to rich people

623
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,866
having a fortune in money?

624
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:20,536
Course.

625
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,473
But rich people do not buy
penny stocks.

626
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:25,375
Just do not.

627
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:26,843
Why not?

628
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,014
Because they are very cunning.

629
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,382
That's the reason.

630
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,817
What person with a
college

631
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,086
trust this group
Idiots?

632
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,489
Tell him to call back.
I have $ 5,000 in your phone.

633
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:42,825
But what it sounded
like a bunch of idiots?

634
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,496
What if you could teach
sell to people with money?

635
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,097
Real money.

636
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,700
So I decided to reinvent
the company.

637
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:53,469
Knights.
Welcome.

638
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:56,072
A Stratton Oakmont.

639
00:31:56,172 --> 00:32:00,009
You fools will put in the spotlight
to the richest 1

640
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:01,411
Americans.

641
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,379
I speak whale.

642
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,847
Moby Dicks.

643
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:06,849
With this script.

644
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,118
Which is their new
harpoon.

645
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:11,587
We teach all
and every one of you.

646
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,657
To be the fucking
Captain Ahab.

647
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:16,259
Do you understand me?

648
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,660
Captain who??

649
00:32:17,827 --> 00:32:19,595
Captain Ahab.
The fucking ...

650
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,665
From the book, bastards.
Book.

651
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:24,834
Get your brain.

652
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,670
We listen, we are a
new company.

653
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:29,305
With a new name.

654
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:32,208
A company in which our
customers to believe.

655
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,378
A company in which our
customers can trust.

656
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:37,680
A firm whose roots

657
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,049
They are so ingrained in
Wall Street.

658
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,118
Our own
founders

659
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,920
sailed in the
Mayflower.

660
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,722
And they recorded the name
Stratton Oakmont.

661
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:47,890
In the fucking Plymouth Rock.

662
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,425
Get it?

663
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,594
We will do the following.

664
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:55,198
First launched actions
Disney, AT & T, IBM.

665
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:56,833
Stable companies exclusively.

666
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,002
Who is
people know.

667
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,037
Once call
their attention.

668
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:03,406
We let them fuck
dog.

669
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,675
The Pink Sheets,
actions cents.

670
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,210
Where we do
money.

671
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,178
50% commission, baby.

672
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:12,615
The key to making money in a
situation like this.

673
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,585
It is to position before
close the deal.

674
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,488
Because when we read in
The Wall Street Journal.

675
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,657
It's too late.

676
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,425
And wait ...

677
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,662
expect and who speak first

678
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,297
lost.

679
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,734
Sorry appreciate the call.

680
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,970
I must think about it.

681
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,805
I'll talk to my wife
thereon.

682
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,407
Can I call you back?
They do not know, right?

683
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,076
They have to think,
talk to the wife

684
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,879
With her fairy godmother, the point is that
no matter what they say.

685
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:46,049
The real objection is that
do not trust you guys.

686
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:47,717
Why would trust
in you?

687
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,253
Look at you are a ball
greasy seller, right?

688
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,122
So what you say?

689
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:55,625
I'm saying that if I put
$ 7 in Union Carbine

690
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:57,694
I'll get to $ 32.

691
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:00,263
Lnstruments Texas to $ 11,
will increase to $ 47.

692
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,865
It will come at $ 16
and take out $ 41.

693
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,434
You must tell me now,
Chester

694
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,570
buy me 2,000 shares
Dizzy now. Come on!

695
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:09,672
Honestly, Kevin.
Really?

696
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:13,042
I do not know,
you called me.

697
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:15,244
You're a total stranger.
I agree with you.

698
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:16,779
You do not know me or
I love you.

699
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,182
Let me introduce my
Kupferberg name is Alden.

700
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,984
Robbie Feinberg.
Chester Ming.

701
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,819
I am vice president
Stratton Oakmont.

702
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:26,723
I plan on being one of the ...
Best Brokers of my signature.

703
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:28,391
Not have been there if
I'm not ambitious.

704
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:30,927
Just wanted to say
you seem to be ...

705
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,528
a type quite sincere.

706
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:33,997
Thank you.

707
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:35,198
It will not millionaire
nor poor.

708
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:37,266
What will this deal
is to serve ...

709
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,736
a springboard for
future business, Kevin.

710
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:41,471
Do you already feel comfortable
me, Scott?

711
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:45,508
You must be sure that eventually
find a broker on Wall Street.

712
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:46,843
In one you can trust.

713
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:50,380
And that can consistently
make you money.

714
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,249
Does that sound right?

715
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,053
If ... your ...

716
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,988
I must say I am
quite impressed.

717
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:02,392
What do you think?
Kevin.

718
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,664
Give me a chance with a
Kodak action.

719
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:09,932
And believe me Kevin.

720
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,669
The only problem
you're going to have.

721
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:15,571
You did not buy more.

722
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,373
Does that sound right?

723
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,448
My wife and divorce
cost me more.

724
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,849
Yeah, let's do it.

725
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,287
Excellent choice Kevin,
How much do you want this time?

726
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:35,158
They are $ 5.0 '00.
Kevin's try $ 8,000.

727
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,693
It's OK to be 10,000.
10.

728
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:38,795
Is that okay?
Excellent choice.

729
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,330
Let me close the deal
right now

730
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,598
and I return the call
few minutes with confirmation.

731
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,902
Kevin, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

732
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:47,737
Thanks friend,
I'll have a beer.

733
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:50,573
It was fun.
Take care, Kev.

734
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:52,742
Thank you, thank you very much.

735
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,111
Shit, I'm a good runner!

736
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,818
That fucking idiot.

737
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,487
The only thing I'm
certain in this world

738
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:05,755
are the airlines.

739
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,158
Kusho Airlines, are the future
airlines.

740
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,494
Invest now ...
My name is Nicky Koskoff.

741
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:15,264
- I'm the vice president of Stratton Oakmont.
- I'm the vice president of Stratton Oakmont.

742
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:18,968
Judy sorry for your loss.

743
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,737
When did he die?

744
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:23,072
When the stock falls
few points ...

745
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,974
My grandfather died,
rest in peace.

746
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,043
I leave a lot of money ...

747
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:30,013
Sunlight was before
such a thing existed.

748
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:31,681
8,000 shares.
Yes!

749
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:33,416
25,000.
Yes!

750
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:38,421
A very smart decision
I transfer it to my sales associate.

751
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,822
Well!
Veronica!

752
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:42,458
Veronica??
You passeth with Andrea.

753
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,993
Anyone seen
Veronica?

754
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,834
Did you have a good week?

755
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,571
Closing month.

756
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:58,508
$ 28.7 million in
gross commissions.

757
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:01,711
All of the boys
actions!

758
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:06,516
To celebrate our act
Weekly stupidity.

759
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,718
I offered to our
Adorable Assistant.

760
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,086
Danielle Harrison.

761
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,322
$ 10,000.

762
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:14,324
To shave your fucking head!

763
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:18,761
Yes!, You want this?

764
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:22,098
You want this?
Let's do it!

765
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,833
Let's do it!
? That shaved!

766
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,401
Start!

767
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:35,912
For your guys information
Danielle agree to use this money

768
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:39,349
for breast implants.
Already a C cup but now

769
00:37:39,582 --> 00:37:41,084
have some fucking
Double D.

770
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,820
Is not this a good business?

771
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:48,758
It's the best company in the world!

772
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:57,000
Donnie burning roof
of this crap!

773
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,789
Word spread about us
by Wall Street.

774
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,592
Even in places
I did not want.

775
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:41,838
It was not long until
Forbes,

776
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,373
the flagship of Wall Street

777
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,074
be called for an interview.

778
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,910
How do you see the future for
Stratton Oakmont?

779
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,746
In a word.

780
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,249
Diversification.

781
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,917
Sounds good, thanks.

782
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:56,286
I have more than enough, I appreciate it.
Fantastic.

783
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:57,820
Can we take
a quick photo?

784
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:01,824
A total knife in the back.

785
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,526
This damn useless,
Look ...

786
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,096
"He Wolf of Wall Street"
so call me, look.

787
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:08,598
Your hair looks good.

788
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,999
My hair looks good?
Yes.

789
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:14,003
Jordan Belfort that sounds like a
twisted Robin Hood.

790
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,675
Stealing from the rich to give himself
and his small band of runners.

791
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:20,009
See it, read it.
Listen.

792
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,180
There is no such thing as
bad publicity, honey.

793
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:25,682
Read the article bebe.

794
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:28,151
You look good in a
important magazine.

795
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:29,585
It seems you do not understand ...

796
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,323
Check out my resume.
Sorry!

797
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,825
Lord please look
my resume.

798
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:38,928
Move!

799
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,832
That's why everyone wants to Article
work for you now.

800
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,567
What did I say?

801
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,503
Wait a minute.
You want a job?

802
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,972
Talk to me.

803
00:40:49,138 --> 00:40:50,206
Mr. Belfort.

804
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,175
Forbes asked a
superstar.

805
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:56,846
Each day dozen
Kids are crazy about money.

806
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:58,348
They came to my door.

807
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:02,619
If we hired left the
University of overnight

808
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,554
and spent any
money that had

809
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,923
in a new suit made
our tailor in Stratton.

810
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:08,992
Are you playing right now?

811
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:12,428
Literally we put them
clothing these kids.

812
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,864
But this idiot came
snooping.

813
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,901
You know every time someone
rises to the top in this world

814
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:22,071
there will always be an idiot
try to drag it down.

815
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:26,009
In a few months, we doubled
our quantity.

816
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:27,944
We moved to offices
even larger.

817
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,586
It was a madhouse.

818
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:38,254
A festival of greed.

819
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,924
Of equally between
cocaine, testosterone and body fluids.

820
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:44,661
Yes!

821
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:45,962
It got so bad.

822
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,431
I should declare the office
an area to get free.

823
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:50,333
Between 9 and 7 day.

824
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,402
But do not start there.

825
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,905
Indeed madness began
on our first day.

826
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:57,874
When one of our
Ben Jenner runners.

827
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,244
He walked into the elevator while one
sales assistant sucked it.

828
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,013
Her name was Pam and
in his defense

829
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,418
had an amazing technique with a
wild tongue movement.

830
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,420
A month later.

831
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,288
Donnie and I decided
do a threesome with her.

832
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:13,623
One Saturday afternoon while
our wives

833
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,992
bought dresses
Christmas.

834
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,795
Eventually Ben
married with it, which was

835
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:22,298
amazing considering that it
I Suck at the office.

836
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,868
Became depressed and
killed three years later.

837
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:30,873
Anyway, my father hired Max
to bring order, as the Enforcer.

838
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,176
The doer of the law in
Stratton.

839
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,612
They called Mad Max.

840
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,246
For his bad temper.

841
00:42:37,714 --> 00:42:41,050
He exploding something
as simple as a phone.

842
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:47,624
Who has the balls to fuck
call on a Tuesday night?

843
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:51,260
Damn!
You are going to lose.

844
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:53,329
Please tell me something I do not know.

845
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:56,132
Hope all week
for this damn program.

846
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:58,735
And I can not ...
Hello?

847
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,838
But as soon picked up the phone ...
Gene??, How are you Gene?

848
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:04,040
He left an accent
English.

849
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:05,708
That would be great Gene.

850
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:08,678
Goodbye.
It was bizarre.

851
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:10,013
Fucking asshole!

852
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:11,414
Well ...
You missed it.

853
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:12,849
There goes Mad Max again.

854
00:43:13,816 --> 00:43:14,817
Shit!

855
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:16,719
Okay, tell me what happened.
What happened?

856
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:19,589
He discovered that it was his mother's sister.
Who is he?

857
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:22,759
The protagonist.
You know who he is.

858
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:24,794
She was the sister of his mother.

859
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:26,429
Was found dead.

860
00:43:27,263 --> 00:43:30,800
Of course not Mad Max had to know
everything we did in Stratton.

861
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:34,804
There is a large white
throw them and they stick.

862
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,474
He is a white dollar sign,
who give closer

863
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:39,842
takes more points.

864
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:41,277
Think this shit right.

865
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:43,713
If you get hurt,
What happens?

866
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,181
Let's go crazy.

867
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:48,217
I do not think gets hurt,
has superhuman strength.

868
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:49,452
I think it will be fine.

869
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,120
You can not see straight
eyes.

870
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,655
Can not see it in the eyes?

871
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,324
It is a fact, I saw it on PBS.

872
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:56,759
Confused and cables
intersect.

873
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,495
You must do as you see elsewhere.
Like when I see you but actually

874
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,698
I see your chin.
I feel undressed me, but no.

875
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,500
They are like the Mona Lisa,
find eye contact.

876
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,235
No matter where you are
standing in the room.

877
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:07,904
And that hook, you know.

878
00:44:08,137 --> 00:44:10,006
There is a limit to what
we can do with it.

879
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:12,742
This allowed throwing things, food ...
Anything.

880
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:15,345
But for example I would not do.

881
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,916
And the girls play
with him those things.

882
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,318
I think that would ...
Serious thing to ask.

883
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:24,988
But this guy is interested
at launch.

884
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,056
If I find this to be
his gift, okay?

885
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:28,725
They were built to be thrown.

886
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:30,660
As a long dart,
his head looks like a dart.

887
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:31,794
They are made to be precise.

888
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:33,997
My God, can we play
bowling with this guy?

889
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:35,932
That's his brother,
He is dedicated to bowling.

890
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:39,202
We can put a suit and upload
on a skateboard.

891
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:40,970
We threw down an alley
to pine trees.

892
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:42,372
Shit, that's interesting.

893
00:44:42,672 --> 00:44:44,841
Can we bring this guy?
If we can.

894
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:46,576
It says here that this type
showing his penis.

895
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:48,177
Instead of growing.

896
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:49,746
They are very hot indeed.

897
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,547
So be careful
with these little guys.

898
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:53,182
Safety first.

899
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:55,285
I want someone with a
tranquilizer

900
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:56,986
ready to knock
this bastard.

901
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:59,055
We could bring ...
Pepper spray, tazer.

902
00:44:59,222 --> 00:45:00,290
Gun shot??

903
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,824
No, that will hurt.

904
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,192
I just want this unconscious
I fainted.

905
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:05,662
I say we keep
with legal trick, right?

906
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:07,697
But we consider it a
human.

907
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,165
Just consider it an act.

908
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:11,034
We'll be fine.
Remember the circus of last year

909
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,169
Many types died
but not sued anyone.

910
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,204
How important it must
keep in mind is ...

911
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,040
These things are
gossips.

912
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:18,574
They meet and backbiting.

913
00:45:18,908 --> 00:45:20,743
It's a good point.
The last thing we need ...

914
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,579
's Get together and say,
mock us.

915
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,515
That will look bad Stratton.

916
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,617
That's why I love you, thinking
shit like that.

917
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:30,586
When I try to come
as one of us.

918
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:32,255
That's it.
One of us ...

919
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,199
Jordan, your father is coming.
Something about American Express account.

920
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:45,868
Get him out of here.
Yeah, good luck.

921
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:47,136
I'm serious.

922
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,805
Get him shit.
Ok, guys ...

923
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:52,709
It's coming.

924
00:45:52,942 --> 00:45:54,010
Invent something.

925
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:56,045
As your advisor ...

926
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:58,548
'$ 130,000.

927
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:00,383
Jordan In a month?

928
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:04,821
'$ 430,000.

929
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:06,422
In a fucking month.

930
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:08,491
Relax are expenses
business.

931
00:46:08,658 --> 00:46:10,159
Business Expenses??

932
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:11,628
Look what you have here.
What?

933
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:15,264
Look at $ 26,000 for a fucking dinner.

934
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:17,433
Ok, this has explanation.

935
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,902
It was by a customer.
The Faizer.

936
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:21,537
If millionaires
of Argentina.

937
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,840
Ordered expensive champagne.
We had to buy champagne.

938
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,175
We took a walk,
tell about it.

939
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,111
If you clear the walk ...
Is the ride?

940
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,414
$ 26,000 in walk??

941
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:33,416
Does this walk will cure cancer?

942
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:37,253
In fact if you cured cancer.
That's the problem, so it was expensive.

943
00:46:37,453 --> 00:46:38,554
Shut the fuck up.

944
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:39,922
Really.
Basta.

945
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:41,157
Entertainment EJ.

946
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,092
What the fuck is that?

947
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,762
Well, that's ...

948
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,431
What is it Jordan?
I do not know how to describe this.

949
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,034
Jordan is??
It is a prostitution ring, Jordy.

950
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,335
I know.
That's what it is.

951
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:54,003
That's what it is.

952
00:46:54,237 --> 00:46:55,805
Not the perfect description?

953
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:57,874
That is what it is
but ... any of this.

954
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:59,542
Was charged to me,
but all of them.

955
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:01,044
To us?

956
00:47:01,344 --> 00:47:03,046
I was not, explain
this shit.

957
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,348
Are all your shit
charges.

958
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:08,451
Guys, the company tax
allow the TNA.

959
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:09,786
Nothing happens.
TNE.

960
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:12,388
TNE.
Yes I did.

961
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:13,957
Not so, said TNA.
I did not.

962
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:15,692
If you did.
I never said that.

963
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,293
Said TNA is TNE.
Right.

964
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,696
I know you're upset about dinner
and makes sense.

965
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:21,597
Because we spend a lot of money.

966
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:23,666
But tne said.
Do not tell me what you said.

967
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,735
Listen to what you said.
Pope, TNA said.

968
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:27,670
That's what I said.
There is no doubt.

969
00:47:27,904 --> 00:47:29,038
I try to ...

970
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:30,239
I'm getting closer.
Papa ...

971
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:31,541
I'm close to the edge.

972
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,543
So I say, I want
open yourself more.

973
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:34,911
Will kill you.

974
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:38,548
Max, why you repress?
That's it.

975
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:40,183
That's it, get out.

976
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,451
No.

977
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,119
Get out of here.

978
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:44,654
What prostitute accepts
credit cards?

979
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:45,989
A rich.

980
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,157
Stratton had 3 types
prostitutes.

981
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:50,827
The first class, the best of the best.
Wooden model.

982
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,462
Cost between
$ 300 to $ 500.

983
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,131
You had to use a condom unless
you gave them a good tip.

984
00:47:57,433 --> 00:47:59,002
Then came the Nasdaq.

985
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,004
They were well
but not great.

986
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:03,039
Cost between '$ 200 to $ 300.

987
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:05,174
Finally the
Pink Sheets.

988
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:07,410
Whores, costing of
$ 100 down.

989
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,012
But you used a condom.

990
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:10,913
They had to inject with
penicillin next day.

991
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,682
If you are not like the penis.

992
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:14,317
I'm not saying the
cogiéramos.

993
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:15,985
Believe me, we did.

994
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:19,322
Is this album out
again.

995
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:21,424
It is what it is,
you know too much ...

996
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:23,660
Entertainment with EJ.

997
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,762
Papa ...
How are things at home?

998
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:27,697
Well, they're not right.

999
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:30,433
She just does not ...
Do you understand?

1000
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,503
It's like the smell,
attracting

1001
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:35,738
after a time
simply vanishes.

1002
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:38,074
Slightly.
It's supposed to be.

1003
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:39,742
Supposed to be?
So is marriage.

1004
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:42,278
Your mother and I have been
married long time.

1005
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,882
Do you think we jumped into bed
every two minutes?

1006
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,617
I understand you ...

1007
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:49,319
I want to stay married but papa ...

1008
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,823
It's crazy out there,
some girls are ... OMG.

1009
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:57,260
The things that make
Pope now ...

1010
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:00,430
It's another level.
Really?

1011
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:01,931
All are shaved too.

1012
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:03,499
Do not think so.
All shaved.

1013
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,734
Are you kidding?
Really.

1014
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,836
Bald as a Chinese dog.
No bush?

1015
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,038
No bush.
OMG.

1016
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:11,140
DE soon in a week.

1017
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,209
Nobody had anything down there.

1018
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,012
They are bald brow
down.

1019
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,914
Nothing.

1020
00:49:18,114 --> 00:49:19,182
Looks done by laser.

1021
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:20,583
That's the world, you see?

1022
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:23,319
I would have liked
after birth.

1023
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:25,622
I was never a fan
bush to be honest.

1024
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:26,923
Really?
Yes.

1025
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:28,424
I do not care.

1026
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,692
Papa ...

1027
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,295
Pope did not want you to stresses
these things.

1028
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:35,098
Why did not I going to do?
Watch those fools work.

1029
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,499
I know you are stupid
but I need

1030
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,401
who want to live
like me, you know?

1031
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,003
Long live like me.

1032
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,738
Jordy ...

1033
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:45,008
One of these days
will have consequences.

1034
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:49,112
You look at me like I was crazy.

1035
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:51,781
This is not crazy,
is obscene.

1036
00:49:53,016 --> 00:49:54,017
It was.

1037
00:49:54,651 --> 00:49:55,652
In the normal world.

1038
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,221
But who wanted to live there?

1039
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,672
Let's take this company.

1040
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:19,008
A fucking stratosphere!

1041
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:29,419
Fuck that Maryland.
Fuck them.

1042
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:32,055
Why should they be
our money?

1043
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:33,423
We will not be second to anyone.

1044
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:34,958
It was our second
and big play.

1045
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:37,093
Find companies
to make public.

1046
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:38,661
IPO.

1047
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:40,496
It was the only way these
idiots on Wall Street.

1048
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,967
Stop thinking of us
valiéramos anything or not.

1049
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:45,501
We OnClip internationally.

1050
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:47,203
You see, we were different.

1051
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:49,005
We liked to get high
as much as possible.

1052
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,673
During our blowout
business.

1053
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,176
To stimulate the
flow of our ideas.

1054
00:50:53,776 --> 00:50:56,112
So we took these Ludes
as if they were M & M.

1055
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:04,554
Not sure what a Lude?

1056
00:51:04,621 --> 00:51:05,655
I will tell you.

1057
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:06,990
Wait ...

1058
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:08,992
Looks like those Ludes ...

1059
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,928
This Donnie doing magic
right now.

1060
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:46,829
The Quaalude

1061
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:49,766
Lude or as it is known
commonly.

1062
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:52,568
It was first synthesized
in 1951.

1063
00:51:52,669 --> 00:51:55,204
For an Indian doctor.
Points no feathers.

1064
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:56,706
As a sedative.

1065
00:51:56,873 --> 00:52:00,610
Prescribed for housewives
problems sleeping.

1066
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,712
But soon ...

1067
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:06,849
someone realized that if you resistías
the urge to sleep for 15 minutes.

1068
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,652
You drugged fine.

1069
00:52:10,386 --> 00:52:13,756
It was not long until
people started abusing Ludes.

1070
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,026
In 1982 the American Government
the banned.

1071
00:52:17,293 --> 00:52:18,695
Like the rest of the world.

1072
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:22,365
Which meant that
this was short.

1073
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,668
No joke, and not even
can buy.

1074
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:28,471
You ran out of luck.

1075
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:32,909
Steve Madden.

1076
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:35,745
Steve.
Steve.

1077
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,380
Remember those ads?

1078
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:39,349
Those girls giant head

1079
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:41,651
with bulging eyes using
those clunky shoes.

1080
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:44,587
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

1081
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:46,255
His school friend,
Steve Madden.

1082
00:52:46,322 --> 00:52:48,658
Steve Madden was named as
to women's shoes at the time.

1083
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:51,995
All prayed for Wall Street
take your company public.

1084
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:55,198
Except ... Guess
who grew up with him?

1085
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:57,000
Shoes.
Shoes.

1086
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,335
My own vice president.

1087
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:01,537
Shoes.

1088
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:03,506
'Diamond' Donnie Azoff.

1089
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:06,075
Steve.
Steve.

1090
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,044
Steve.
Hey friend.

1091
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,879
You have to see this girl.

1092
00:53:10,013 --> 00:53:11,381
Watch this.

1093
00:53:11,414 --> 00:53:12,582
Mira.

1094
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:19,589
I'd take that girl
so was my sister.

1095
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,325
He would give me AIDS.

1096
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:24,661
Want to see the wolf
handle this?

1097
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:28,798
Shit.

1098
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:30,166
Cristy.

1099
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:37,407
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1100
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,942
Hello.
Naomi.

1101
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,410
It's my pleasure.

1102
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:41,678
Naomi, also.

1103
00:53:41,878 --> 00:53:43,513
Have an amazing place.

1104
00:53:43,947 --> 00:53:46,382
I think I had never been
before in such a large house.

1105
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,418
Really?, There is a beach
beautiful outside.

1106
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:49,819
Blair Hollingsworth.

1107
00:53:50,653 --> 00:53:52,155
Hello Blair, is a pleasure.

1108
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,756
Your name is Blair?
Yes.

1109
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,224
Like the Jet Ski?

1110
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:56,926
Never had it
done before.

1111
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,128
Never in your life?
No, never.

1112
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,430
Never?
No.

1113
00:54:00,663 --> 00:54:02,932
How often do you
ask me that?

1114
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,668
Maybe a couple more times.

1115
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:07,470
Ok.

1116
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:09,238
Do you understand?
Yes.

1117
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:11,741
Hello I am Hildy, delighted.
Hello.

1118
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:13,576
Jordan, Teresa needs
your help.

1119
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,546
If you tell him to go in minutes.
Tell him that.

1120
00:54:16,746 --> 00:54:18,247
Why did not you tell
that to your wife?

1121
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:19,949
I would but I'm having
a conversation here.

1122
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:22,418
You know, I think we should go.

1123
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:23,786
Wait, where did they go?

1124
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:25,321
We have to go,
there are other parties ...

1125
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:27,657
We can stay for a drink.
If, stay by one.

1126
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:29,626
It is assumed that we would go to the other,
so ...

1127
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:32,262
Let's stay for a drink.
Let it stay for a drink.

1128
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:33,963
Stay, do not make much mess.
May.

1129
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,299
Like the champagne?
Clear.

1130
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,568
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1131
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:50,213
Sorry my friend,
he gets ...

1132
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,249
Get out.
I had to.

1133
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,951
Well done Donnie.

1134
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:58,254
I can not believe what I saw.

1135
00:54:58,454 --> 00:54:59,989
Is this guy crazy.

1136
00:55:05,662 --> 00:55:07,497
Ray Ridge is in Staten Island, right?

1137
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,966
Brooklyn across the river.

1138
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,534
Territory of Saturday Night Fever.

1139
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:13,169
Here's Guinea Gulch.

1140
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:15,905
They call to bridge the
point of the side Guinea.

1141
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,808
Do I imagine that
you're Italian?

1142
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,009
On my father ...

1143
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:23,913
I'm also Dutch,
German, English.

1144
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,181
I am a mix.

1145
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:26,516
Yes you are.
Yes.

1146
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:28,651
I have family still
London ..

1147
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:30,219
My Aunt Emma.

1148
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:31,487
It's the best.

1149
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:32,989
Fully English, you know.

1150
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,657
It has a lot of class.

1151
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:35,992
That explains it then.

1152
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:37,927
What?
You.

1153
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:39,662
I mean, you're a Duchess.

1154
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:41,864
The Duchess of Ray Ridge.

1155
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:46,469
Excuse me.

1156
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:48,237
Can you give us a straw
please?

1157
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,341
Thank you.

1158
00:55:54,277 --> 00:55:55,612
I was a little ...

1159
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:59,082
Surprised you
Cristy pidieras my number.

1160
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:01,985
Why?

1161
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,221
Not yet married?

1162
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:09,459
Yes but what?

1163
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:11,294
Is the married people can not
have friends?

1164
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:14,797
Will we be friends?

1165
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:17,533
Yes.

1166
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:18,835
Will you be my friend?

1167
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,841
We will not be friends.

1168
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:36,753
Night work
in my designs.

1169
00:56:36,919 --> 00:56:38,888
I have a whole line
lingerie.

1170
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:41,624
Nightgowns, bras,
panties.

1171
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:45,528
Do you design tights
for women?

1172
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:47,130
OMG.

1173
00:56:57,674 --> 00:57:00,276
Come on Jordan, think of a way
that up to your apartment.

1174
00:57:05,748 --> 00:57:07,417
Want to climb
tea or something?

1175
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,486
Tea, yes.

1176
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:12,655
Are you hot?
Yes.

1177
00:57:12,922 --> 00:57:14,757
That sounds good.
You ...

1178
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:16,459
Of course, if I want
top bearing.

1179
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:22,665
Look, who is this?

1180
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:24,634
Look who it is.
Say hello Rocky.

1181
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:25,835
Hello sweetness.

1182
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:28,071
Ok.
Well ...

1183
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:30,239
Kindle Fire or something
I'll be out in a moment.

1184
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:32,342
Yeah, fire?
Security.

1185
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:38,047
I like your painting, it's ...

1186
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:47,323
God help me,
How do I pick?

1187
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:52,762
Are these good?
If ...

1188
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:54,998
I just try to start the fire.

1189
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:02,672
That's it, you're gone.
Do not get involved.

1190
00:58:02,705 --> 00:58:03,906
Go home to your wife.

1191
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,084
As you can guess.

1192
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:18,154
I fucked her until she was crazy.

1193
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:20,490
Jesus Christ.

1194
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:24,527
For 11 seconds.

1195
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,073
Now do you come?

1196
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,741
Yes, I did.

1197
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:41,511
Did you do?
Did you come?

1198
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:43,079
No.
No?

1199
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:46,282
Ok, I'm still so hard
Just give me a moment.

1200
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:49,252
Security.

1201
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:50,954
Let baby.

1202
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:02,832
OMG.

1203
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:04,667
Get out Rocky.

1204
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,336
Bad dog.
Give a cookie or something.

1205
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:07,870
This well.
We will.

1206
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:09,005
Keep doing it.

1207
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:10,840
Go play Rocky.
Go.

1208
00:59:14,277 --> 00:59:16,179
These crazy.
I could not get enough.

1209
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:18,748
Her vagina was like
heroin to me.

1210
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,317
Nor was it just for the sex.

1211
00:59:21,618 --> 00:59:23,152
Naomi and eachother.
I say ...

1212
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,421
had similar interests
and stuff.

1213
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:33,463
You like that, right?
Yes.

1214
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:20,833
You, get the damn car!

1215
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,505
Shit.

1216
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:28,140
Relax honey.

1217
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,542
Relax.

1218
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:31,076
Son of a fucking bitch.

1219
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:33,345
Basta.

1220
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:35,347
Please.
That bitch.

1221
01:00:36,348 --> 01:00:37,783
Does the bitch party?

1222
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:40,820
Jesus Christ.
What is it?

1223
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,289
Shut up, I never knew
you'd be here.

1224
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:44,890
With that fucking bitch?

1225
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:46,959
Does the bitch party?

1226
01:00:46,992 --> 01:00:48,994
Just met her there.

1227
01:00:50,162 --> 01:00:52,364
Honey.
Who the fuck are you Jordan?

1228
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:55,401
You are a person completely
different.

1229
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:57,803
I made a mistake not
to tell you baby.

1230
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,573
Sorry.

1231
01:01:00,706 --> 01:01:02,508
Sorry.
Is that what you wanted?

1232
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,653
Do you love her?

1233
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:21,994
Answer me.

1234
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:45,151
I felt horrible.

1235
01:01:46,919 --> 01:01:50,256
3 days after I ordered divorce
and Naomi moved to the department.

1236
01:01:55,261 --> 01:01:56,295
Say what you want.

1237
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,164
But the Duchess had style.

1238
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,500
I did decorate to Feng Shui
whole place

1239
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,302
even hired a butler.

1240
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:07,006
This guy was smart,
sophisticated. Professional.

1241
01:02:07,173 --> 01:02:08,574
Really great.

1242
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:09,909
Jasmine??

1243
01:02:10,176 --> 01:02:12,745
Yes sir amaze wanted tonight.
Very well.

1244
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,914
Very well.
Good nose.

1245
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:16,515
Except that one time.

1246
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:23,055
OMG.

1247
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,092
Hello!

1248
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,027
Already Wednesday?

1249
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,497
What the fuck?

1250
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:33,199
That's fucked up!

1251
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:36,135
He must have thought we were still
in The Hamptons.

1252
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,170
I thought so.
What did they darling?

1253
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,173
They were everywhere,
2 types over there on the table.

1254
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,408
Another over here.

1255
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,742
Four right here.

1256
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:45,511
Are you serious?
Right there?

1257
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:47,379
Why not me
said honey?

1258
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:48,614
Bebe gets worse.

1259
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,151
After they left,
review the department.

1260
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:55,054
What?
What baby?

1261
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:58,657
Where is my money?
I do not know where he is.

1262
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:02,828
Where's my fucking money?
Do not know where Mr. Belfort.

1263
01:03:02,995 --> 01:03:03,963
I did nothing.

1264
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,599
He's a liar,
lies is all it says.

1265
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:08,667
Let's start from the beginning.
Let's start from the beginning.

1266
01:03:08,734 --> 01:03:10,736
Invite friends, right?
Yes.

1267
01:03:11,003 --> 01:03:12,838
One thing led to another,
spun out of control.

1268
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,073
We understand that.

1269
01:03:14,306 --> 01:03:16,175
We do it all the time,
We are fucking degenerate.

1270
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,409
Just look at us, right?

1271
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:19,845
But money was stolen
my department.

1272
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,113
Just my sock drawer.

1273
01:03:21,113 --> 01:03:23,349
Like I said, not
where is your money.

1274
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:25,050
Let's start from the beginning.
Who came?

1275
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:27,486
It was a normal day,
knew again the next day.

1276
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,588
Everything would be fine and clean.

1277
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,490
I got a little
at breakfast.

1278
01:03:31,657 --> 01:03:35,027
I was happy I did
some eggs, some ice cream.

1279
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:36,529
I know Rudy likes
ice cream.

1280
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:38,664
My friend Rudy, so I call ...
Who is Rudy?

1281
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,433
Who is Rudy?
Yeah, who is Rudy?

1282
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:43,669
You know who you are, come on.

1283
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:44,904
Does he know who he is?
Yes.

1284
01:03:46,005 --> 01:03:47,673
Who is Rudy?
I do not know ...

1285
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,609
You were at the club Lollipop
to know who danced.

1286
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,344
Do you know who Rudy?

1287
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:56,182
I know no one.
What do you mean?

1288
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:57,716
Was the club Lollipop?

1289
01:03:57,817 --> 01:03:59,118
It was the club Lollipop
indeed.

1290
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,153
He was on stage
rubbing with everyone.

1291
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:02,822
That's fucked up, I like to dance.

1292
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:05,324
There is perhaps
know many people.

1293
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:09,495
Listen $ 50,000 were
stolen from my sock drawer.

1294
01:04:09,695 --> 01:04:11,197
Like all jewelry
my girlfriend.

1295
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,932
Where is?
Who the fuck is Rudy?

1296
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:15,000
That fagot Rudy
took my stuff?

1297
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:16,702
Did you?
Answer me.

1298
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:18,337
Ok, now I understand.

1299
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:20,673
This is because I'm gay.

1300
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:22,675
I can see that.

1301
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:24,176
Because you're gay?

1302
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,112
My cousin is a fag.

1303
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:28,013
But I'm going on vacation
with him and his boyfriend.

1304
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:29,849
I love them.
Your are in charge right?

1305
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:31,317
Never steal.

1306
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:33,786
Not that I do not fall well gay.
I do not like you you.

1307
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:36,455
Never hire a damn
Mexican in my fucking house.

1308
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:39,792
Shit!

1309
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:45,364
Speaks cursed.
Speak!

1310
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,333
I'll drop.
Where is?

1311
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,070
Chester and Toby became
about Yakuza against Nicholas.

1312
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,505
Totally crazy.

1313
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:56,542
I had to call the police
to avoid being killed.

1314
01:04:57,176 --> 01:04:58,711
I gave each $ 1,000.

1315
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:00,346
I told them what Nicholas
had done.

1316
01:05:01,347 --> 01:05:02,782
They kicked him
ass.

1317
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:04,183
Thanks again
officers.

1318
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,986
It's not like I mattered
the 50,000.

1319
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:10,723
He earned that almost every day
through a hole or other rat.

1320
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:14,260
A rat hole is a friend,
as Brad here.

1321
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,996
Who had shares in his name,
for me.

1322
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:19,031
Who are you?
Jack Nicholson??

1323
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,699
I was up prices.

1324
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:23,636
The selling and give most
share of the profits.

1325
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:25,704
You guessed it, me.

1326
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:30,709
All cash, no record
in books.

1327
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,546
A big scam to
eyes of the law.

1328
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,349
This is our new lawyer
Manny Riskin security.

1329
01:05:38,317 --> 01:05:41,620
$ 700 an hour to be
the voice of doom.

1330
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,322
Listen, if you screw
SEC.

1331
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:44,790
You pierce nipples.

1332
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,159
Do not worry, I have
SEC under control.

1333
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:49,962
What do these idiots?

1334
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:51,931
Hey!
Hey!

1335
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:53,165
What do they do?

1336
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,000
We have here a damn SEC.

1337
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:58,003
Exchange Commission
Security and sent

1338
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,738
two guys that kicked
out our archives.

1339
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,074
The install in our
conference room.

1340
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:05,511
Les put microphones and lower temperature
air conditioning much so

1341
01:06:05,678 --> 01:06:07,179
seemed Antarctica
there.

1342
01:06:07,346 --> 01:06:08,614
Is it always so cold here?

1343
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:10,416
I do not know.

1344
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:13,385
While they were looking for a weapon
smoking in that room.

1345
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:18,224
I was about to shoot a bazooka
in this.

1346
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:20,593
Featuring our
IPO last.

1347
01:06:20,926 --> 01:06:23,362
An IPO is an Offer
Initial public.

1348
01:06:23,596 --> 01:06:27,199
It is the first time an action is
the solvent for the general population.

1349
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,368
By making this company
something public.

1350
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:30,903
We fijábamos the
initial asking price.

1351
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,072
Then sold them to
Return to our friends.

1352
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:34,673
Do you understand?
Look.

1353
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:37,576
Know you do not follow it
I say anyway.

1354
01:06:37,843 --> 01:06:39,245
Okay, never mind.

1355
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:41,080
The real question is this.

1356
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:42,848
Was this legal?

1357
01:06:43,182 --> 01:06:45,117
Of course not.

1358
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:48,154
But we made so much money
neither knew where to spend it.

1359
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,860
What do you do when you do not know
you spend your money?

1360
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,401
OMG.

1361
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:04,336
Will you marry me?

1362
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,539
OMG.

1363
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:08,207
Is that a yes?

1364
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,410
Are you sure?
Yes, I am.

1365
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:13,379
I am.
Your you are?

1366
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:14,613
Yes.

1367
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:28,327
I did my bachelor party in
the Mirage in Las Vegas.

1368
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:30,763
He flight to there
It was a bacchanal.

1369
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,667
One last blast for
guys before you settle down.

1370
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:36,735
Hundreds of people.

1371
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:39,905
50 hookers and 50 more
waiting to land.

1372
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,974
Drugs ..

1373
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:45,010
Our plane was
a pharmacy with wings.

1374
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,808
After all,

1375
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:18,110
weekend
It cost me $ 2 million.

1376
01:08:19,745 --> 01:08:22,581
Including the cost of returning
to furnish the entire 28th floor.

1377
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:25,918
Kiss the bride.

1378
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,956
But the wedding was something
out of a fairy tale.

1379
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:34,160
Naomi, my Duchess.

1380
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:38,664
He found his Duke in the Bahamas.
The club ocean barge.

1381
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:52,678
Of course after
the bachelor goodbye, El Duque

1382
01:08:53,012 --> 01:08:54,880
need some injections
penicillin for

1383
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,550
we can consummate the marriage
safely.

1384
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:05,057
Hi, Barry Kleinman
filming the wedding.

1385
01:09:05,324 --> 01:09:07,026
A word for your child.
Jordan ...

1386
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:08,961
Remember what I told you.

1387
01:09:09,495 --> 01:09:12,364
Involve your penis and vagina.

1388
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:15,000
You know what you can do.

1389
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:16,535
Jordy!

1390
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:35,287
OMG.

1391
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:41,160
Good, you came!

1392
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:44,096
Jordan.
Jordan.

1393
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,831
Look who came.

1394
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,433
Aunt Emma's.

1395
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:50,636
Aunt Emma.
God I bet.

1396
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,071
How are you?

1397
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:54,540
Nice to finally
know.

1398
01:09:55,141 --> 01:09:57,209
In person.
Dust in the nose.

1399
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:03,749
I lived in the 60s fondly.

1400
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:05,651
Enjoy the day.

1401
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,721
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

1402
01:10:22,835 --> 01:10:24,837
Only one more step.
Where are we going?

1403
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:26,138
Keep your eyes closed.

1404
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:27,640
One, two, three.

1405
01:10:30,176 --> 01:10:32,545
What's this?
Your wedding gift.

1406
01:10:32,845 --> 01:10:34,346
What?
Your wedding gift.

1407
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:35,548
Honey.

1408
01:10:36,248 --> 01:10:37,550
What ...?

1409
01:10:38,117 --> 01:10:39,385
Are you serious?

1410
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:41,287
A damn yacht?

1411
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:55,067
My God, baby!

1412
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,904
Like it?
These crazy.

1413
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,206
Like it?
Yes.

1414
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:09,014
Sailed for three weeks
Caribbean.

1415
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:11,951
Eventually we got to Long Island
where we buy a house.

1416
01:11:12,218 --> 01:11:14,820
7 acres in Gold Coast
Long Island.

1417
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:17,323
The world's most expensive home.

1418
01:11:17,456 --> 01:11:20,092
With maids, cooks,
landscape, everything.

1419
01:11:20,326 --> 01:11:22,495
Even had two
guards working in shifts.

1420
01:11:22,795 --> 01:11:24,029
Both were named Rocko.

1421
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:30,035
It was heaven on earth.

1422
01:11:33,139 --> 01:11:34,673
Get up piece of shit.

1423
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:36,308
Who is Venice?

1424
01:11:39,412 --> 01:11:40,579
Are you a fucking owl?

1425
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:42,014
Who is?
I have no idea ...

1426
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:43,682
Did you fuck her last night?

1427
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:46,485
What are you talking about?
Of course not, baby.

1428
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:48,954
No!
You said your name in your sleep.

1429
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:51,157
Are you crazy?

1430
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,427
Do not even know what that is Venice.

1431
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:55,661
What the hell does that mean?

1432
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,864
Venice is the dumbest thing
I have heard in my fucking life.

1433
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:08,040
Venice baby, where are you?

1434
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:12,344
Venice.

1435
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,846
Where are you going?

1436
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:19,485
Bebe ...

1437
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:20,719
you're going to play hardball, right?

1438
01:12:21,887 --> 01:12:22,955
Jesus Christ.

1439
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:26,859
I like, I like.

1440
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,661
Lobito Lobito.

1441
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:30,096
Lobito.
Lobito??

1442
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,498
If my baby is
word to stop.

1443
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:33,966
I do not mind your word.
We will.

1444
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,868
Shut the fuck up.

1445
01:12:36,836 --> 01:12:38,170
Shut up bitch.

1446
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:40,806
Damn bow.

1447
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:43,843
Truth.

1448
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,211
Right, I forgot.

1449
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,913
Forget it, baby.
Donnie and ...

1450
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:51,217
in a condominium in Venice.

1451
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:52,618
Thus all these
confusion.

1452
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:54,120
Would invest in Italy.

1453
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,821
Not in Italy,
California.

1454
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:57,256
Does California?

1455
01:12:57,389 --> 01:12:58,657
You're a fucking liar.

1456
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:01,327
Duchess honey.
Do not tell Duquesa.

1457
01:13:01,494 --> 01:13:02,928
Do not.

1458
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,865
Think not
what you do?

1459
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,000
You are now a father Jordan.

1460
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,468
Yes.
You're a father now.

1461
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,971
But you still act like a child.

1462
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:14,173
Shit!
Damn!

1463
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,243
Bebe have anger issues.

1464
01:13:17,676 --> 01:13:19,745
Who was the Volo here

1465
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:20,880
at 3 in the morning
a stupid helicopter

1466
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,216
and get up to Skylar?

1467
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,818
That was you.
Skylar.

1468
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:27,420
Those are nonsense.

1469
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:39,832
Not even you care.

1470
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:45,805
That would have just made that field
Golf, Bermuda grass.

1471
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,640
Now you ruined it.

1472
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,011
I have to redo everything and deal
damn people with golf.

1473
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:54,914
OMG you have to try
people with golf.

1474
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,317
That tragedy, honey.
OMG.

1475
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,553
Probably they had
to pay cash.

1476
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,822
With your hands,
horrible burden.

1477
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:06,559
At least you did some work
besides using my card all day.

1478
01:14:06,826 --> 01:14:09,595
I can not keep up with you
with your professions, honey.

1479
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,797
He eras past month
a connoisseur of wines.

1480
01:14:12,098 --> 01:14:13,933
You are now an architect
landscapes.

1481
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,035
Is that you?, No!
Fuck you!

1482
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,671
You dare not throw me
that damn water.

1483
01:14:18,838 --> 01:14:20,239
Do not you dare.

1484
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,508
Are you okay honey?

1485
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,511
Just talk,
Okay?

1486
01:14:25,911 --> 01:14:28,013
Let's use our words,
you know.

1487
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:30,416
's Communicate, ok?

1488
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,752
Let sweetheart.

1489
01:14:33,152 --> 01:14:34,587
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

1490
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:38,824
Stop flexing your muscles Jordan,
you look like a fucking asshole.

1491
01:14:39,992 --> 01:14:42,795
You should be happy
have a husband

1492
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:45,598
that is in good shape
like me. Right?

1493
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:48,000
Come here.

1494
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,468
Give me a kiss.

1495
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,971
You look so beautiful, come on.
Besarte??

1496
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:53,205
You look beautiful.
Besarte??

1497
01:14:53,472 --> 01:14:54,540
Give me a ...

1498
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,576
Fuck you!

1499
01:14:57,843 --> 01:14:59,678
Yes, my morning ritual.

1500
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:03,682
First I fought with Naomi
for what I did last night.

1501
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:07,920
Then I got to sweat vapor
drugs out of my system.

1502
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:09,822
After assessing the damage.

1503
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:11,457
Whitened my eyes.

1504
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,593
He took my pills
for the back, to start the day.

1505
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,595
Then sought to reconcile
with Naomi.

1506
01:15:17,196 --> 01:15:19,298
Good morning daddy.

1507
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:21,333
Where's my kiss?

1508
01:15:22,835 --> 01:15:24,336
Hello sweetness.

1509
01:15:25,838 --> 01:15:28,841
Daddy will get a kiss
both girls?

1510
01:15:29,408 --> 01:15:30,409
No. ..

1511
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:33,579
Papi may even
Mommy play.

1512
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:37,349
For a long, long, long time.

1513
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:41,987
Papi is very sorry for what I said,
did not mean anything.

1514
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:44,256
Daddy should not waste their time.

1515
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:46,425
And from now on.

1516
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,431
I'm just going to wear skirts
very small in the house.

1517
01:15:55,334 --> 01:15:57,336
And something else daddy.

1518
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:01,741
Mommy is very tired

1519
01:16:01,874 --> 01:16:04,777
and boring to use
panties.

1520
01:16:06,612 --> 01:16:08,180
Yeah?
Yes.

1521
01:16:11,016 --> 01:16:12,485
In fact ...

1522
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:19,658
In fact, she has decided
throw them all away.

1523
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,833
So look good daddy.

1524
01:16:28,634 --> 01:16:31,504
You'll see a lot of this
the house.

1525
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:34,673
If mommy.

1526
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,009
But untouched.

1527
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,317
What about daddy?

1528
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:47,653
Bebe.

1529
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:53,359
Look at this shit.

1530
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:56,829
A Mommy likes to play
with Daddy.

1531
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,668
Any time you have
noticed

1532
01:17:02,835 --> 01:17:05,337
something weird about the
bear there?

1533
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:10,076
His eyes seem to be
a little weird, right?

1534
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,113
There's something different about your eyes.

1535
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:17,817
If you think that's true.
Say hello mami!

1536
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,553
Rocko Rocko and Greet.
Say hello!

1537
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,221
Hi friends,
All right?

1538
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:26,592
Everyday, choose the
today to give me problems.

1539
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:29,462
Today was the greatest day in
Stratton history.

1540
01:17:29,662 --> 01:17:31,697
He needed to think clearly.

1541
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:33,165
Jordan.

1542
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:35,234
Welcome.
Already Steven arrived?

1543
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:38,537
This was the day we threw
Steven Madden's IPO.

1544
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,006
All are gathered here
and determined.

1545
01:17:41,173 --> 01:17:43,609
Everything had to work well
and perfect.

1546
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,344
What's that guy?

1547
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:47,446
What do you do?

1548
01:17:48,514 --> 01:17:51,984
Most history IPO
this firm, what the fuck does?

1549
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:55,821
Are you using a bow tie?

1550
01:17:56,055 --> 01:17:56,989
Hello.

1551
01:17:58,057 --> 01:17:59,291
How you doing?

1552
01:17:59,558 --> 01:18:00,526
Right.

1553
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,661
Are you cleaning
the tank?

1554
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,931
If I had a minute and ...

1555
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:07,833
You had a minute.

1556
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:10,302
Just today you had to clean it.
Is today the day?

1557
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:13,906
I finished my paperwork and
had a few minutes.

1558
01:18:14,573 --> 01:18:16,075
Ok, nice to meet you.

1559
01:18:22,348 --> 01:18:23,582
In this day?

1560
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:27,553
Damn bastard,
On this day??

1561
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,321
Is this what you do?

1562
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,823
Hey all.

1563
01:18:31,157 --> 01:18:32,258
Hear.

1564
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,361
This is what happens when
what to do today.

1565
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:50,176
Grab your small
michi tie.

1566
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:53,179
Get your things and get out
my office, you know?

1567
01:18:53,345 --> 01:18:54,547
Get out!

1568
01:18:58,584 --> 01:18:59,652
All their posts.

1569
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:01,387
We are here to
make money.

1570
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,788
All their posts.

1571
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:08,027
A gap of wolves.
Just how I like it.

1572
01:19:08,294 --> 01:19:10,663
Jordan look what capture
in the lobby, a genius.

1573
01:19:10,763 --> 01:19:12,598
Sign Steven Madden.

1574
01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:15,701
Businessman shoes
Women.

1575
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,505
Thanks to Donnie were going to put
your business to the public.

1576
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:23,576
Stratton Oakmont was
evolve.

1577
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,344
It was not trash puddle.

1578
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,279
Therefore they should
see you face.

1579
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:29,515
You have to burn them
selling those shares.

1580
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,217
OK?
Not only that

1581
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:34,754
Donnie and I were owners
secret 85% from Steve Madden.

1582
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:37,323
Which speaking in terms
legal was not right.

1583
01:19:37,423 --> 01:19:40,760
But we did filthy rich
if our troops supported him.

1584
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,028
Our work was
mentalizarlos.

1585
01:19:43,763 --> 01:19:44,930
But not much.

1586
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,567
Hello, if I could ...

1587
01:19:49,135 --> 01:19:50,669
For those
I do not know.

1588
01:19:51,504 --> 01:19:52,805
My name is
Steve Madden.

1589
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,240
We know who you are.

1590
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,142
Your name is
in the box.

1591
01:19:56,342 --> 01:19:57,510
The shoes,
Show them.

1592
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,578
Show them.
Ok, yes.

1593
01:19:59,845 --> 01:20:01,380
Anyway, this shoe.

1594
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,716
It's pretty cool.
It is the Mery Lou.

1595
01:20:03,849 --> 01:20:07,386
It's what put us on the map,
I would not be here without him.

1596
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,321
It is a shoe for fat.
Believe it or not ...

1597
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:11,991
Believe it or not,
Mary Lou is equal

1598
01:20:12,258 --> 01:20:13,959
by Mary Jane but is
black leather.

1599
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:24,670
All right.

1600
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:29,742
Applause for Steven Madden and
amazing shoes, we will lift them.

1601
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,044
Well there, I apláudanlo.

1602
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,948
Has she pulled out of the system?

1603
01:20:37,349 --> 01:20:38,884
Have a good evening or what?

1604
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,621
I want to take a moment to tell
because Steve is so ...

1605
01:20:42,988 --> 01:20:45,124
absolutely brilliant.

1606
01:20:46,358 --> 01:20:47,927
It is because this man

1607
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:49,862
is a creative genius.

1608
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:53,666
This ability, this gift
Steve has.

1609
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,735
It goes beyond ...

1610
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,803
see fashion in footwear.

1611
01:20:57,837 --> 01:20:59,171
His real power.

1612
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:01,240
Is to create fashion.

1613
01:21:01,841 --> 01:21:02,942
Do you understand me?

1614
01:21:03,209 --> 01:21:05,344
Geniuses like Steve come
only once every decade.

1615
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:08,948
I speak of Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel.

1616
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:10,249
Among others.

1617
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:12,418
Steve come here a second.

1618
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,587
I do not realize it.

1619
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:18,924
Steve Madden is the person
more important

1620
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:21,193
in the footwear industry
Women with orders

1621
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,131
exhausted all the stores
North America now.

1622
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,700
What we have here in
our office.

1623
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:31,837
We should thank the stars
this man is here.

1624
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:34,306
We should be on our knees
right now.

1625
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:36,675
Getting ready to
I suck his thumb.

1626
01:21:37,777 --> 01:21:39,011
Just like that, okay?

1627
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:40,946
I chupártelo Steve.
Ok.

1628
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:43,215
All you're going to suck.

1629
01:21:44,517 --> 01:21:45,718
This is our
golden ticket

1630
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,820
to the Chocolate Factory.

1631
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:52,124
I want to meet Willy Wonka, okay?

1632
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,694
I want to be with
Oompa Loompas damn well.

1633
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,901
Come out of the fucking stage.
Get out of here.

1634
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:05,337
It's okay to want to be
focus for a second.

1635
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:07,306
See those black boxes?

1636
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,176
Called telephone.
I'll tell you a secret

1637
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,577
on these telephones.

1638
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:13,546
They are not going to make themselves.

1639
01:22:13,946 --> 01:22:15,781
OK?
Without you ...

1640
01:22:16,615 --> 01:22:18,317
They are just pieces
useless plastic.

1641
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:22,488
As a weapon without a Marine
trained to shoot.

1642
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:25,424
The keys of the phone.

1643
01:22:26,425 --> 01:22:28,928
It depends on each of you.

1644
01:22:30,429 --> 01:22:32,364
My knights highly
trained.

1645
01:22:33,933 --> 01:22:35,167
My murderers.

1646
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:38,671
My murderers not
take no for an answer.

1647
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:41,240
My cursed warriors.

1648
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:43,676
Do not hang up the phone

1649
01:22:44,076 --> 01:22:47,012
to his client
either buy or ...

1650
01:22:47,113 --> 01:22:49,615
Die!

1651
01:23:04,497 --> 01:23:05,664
Let me tell you something.

1652
01:23:06,098 --> 01:23:08,667
No nobility
in poverty.

1653
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:12,004
I have been a rich man
and a poor man.

1654
01:23:12,037 --> 01:23:14,540
But I choose life rich
every moment.

1655
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:19,011
At least as a
Rich Man

1656
01:23:19,278 --> 01:23:20,713
I face my problems and
I put them back in a limo

1657
01:23:20,946 --> 01:23:22,748
using a tailored '$ 2,000.

1658
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:25,651
And a gold watch $ 4,000.

1659
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,290
He has it.
Give, give.

1660
01:23:31,557 --> 01:23:32,758
Let me go!

1661
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,995
If anyone here thinks that
I'm shallow

1662
01:23:36,662 --> 01:23:37,830
or materialistic.

1663
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:40,499
Go find work
fucking Mc Donalds.

1664
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:42,234
Because you belong there.

1665
01:23:44,403 --> 01:23:47,339
But before you leave this
room full of winners.

1666
01:23:48,674 --> 01:23:51,510
I want you to look good to the person
your side, come on.

1667
01:23:53,179 --> 01:23:55,347
Because at some point in
not so near future.

1668
01:23:55,581 --> 01:23:58,818
When you stop at a red light
in your car battered.

1669
01:23:59,485 --> 01:24:02,088
That person is going to reconcile
on your side

1670
01:24:02,588 --> 01:24:04,256
in his new Porsche.

1671
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:07,326
With his beautiful wife
aside.

1672
01:24:07,827 --> 01:24:09,528
They have voluptuous boobs.

1673
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:12,798
But really who you be?

1674
01:24:13,766 --> 01:24:15,568
A nasty beast

1675
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:17,336
with a supply of razors

1676
01:24:17,503 --> 01:24:20,706
Pellos filled sitting next to you.
In a car full of shopping

1677
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:22,575
a cheap market.

1678
01:24:22,942 --> 01:24:24,777
Will you be sitting next to that.

1679
01:24:25,077 --> 01:24:27,113
So listen to me
and listen well.

1680
01:24:27,513 --> 01:24:29,515
Are you behind on the
your card accounts?

1681
01:24:30,049 --> 01:24:32,118
Well, pick up the phone and
starts dialing.

1682
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,587
Your landlord will bounce?

1683
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,890
Well, pick up the phone and
starts dialing.

1684
01:24:37,957 --> 01:24:40,860
Your girlfriend thinks you're
a useless loser?

1685
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:43,996
Well, pick up the phone and
starts dialing.

1686
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,332
I want that deal
with their problems.

1687
01:24:46,632 --> 01:24:48,134
Becoming rich.

1688
01:24:49,902 --> 01:24:51,737
All you have to
do today.

1689
01:24:52,071 --> 01:24:53,339
You get that phone.

1690
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:57,009
And say the words
I have taught.

1691
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,245
I will make you richer

1692
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:03,282

1693
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:08,888
They should go out there.

1694
01:25:09,989 --> 01:25:14,760
I want Steve mess actions
Madden on the throats of his customers.

1695
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,631
Until drowning.

Until drowning and

1697
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:23,202
That's what I want today.

01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:16,889
Even large firms
Wall Street bought.

1706
01:26:26,999 --> 01:26:28,701
Of the 2 million shares
for sale, 1 million belonged to me

1707
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,637
in possession of fake accounts
for my rat holes.

1708
01:26:31,904 --> 01:26:33,973
Now the highest price ...

1709
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:36,442
You know what?
Who cares?

1710
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:38,210
As always the point is this.

Barry Kleinman is on the phone
flame Future Video.

1716
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:54,460
Who?

01:26:54,493 --> 01:26:55,661
He says it's urgent.

1718
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:57,496
Urgent??,
Who the fuck is it Barry Kleinman?

1719
01:26:57,763 --> 01:26:59,198
My God, will you marry me?

1720
01:26:59,498 --> 01:27:01,667
Going to bed with me?
Go fuck your cousin.

1721
01:27:01,901 --> 01:27:03,636
Barry, what happens?
Listen ...

1722
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:05,404
There is a citation.
Citation??

1723
01:27:06,005 --> 01:27:08,974
What are you talking about?
The FBI wants a copy of your marriage.

1724
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:10,576
Is the fucking FBI?

1725
01:27:10,743 --> 01:27:12,378
Are you kidding?
Listen ...

1726
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:13,946
Your name is Denham.

1727
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,915
It is an agent of the Office
New York.

1728
01:27:16,182 --> 01:27:17,683
What is your problem?
It's a Boy Scout.

1729
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:19,652
It's your fucking Gordon Gekko.

1730
01:27:21,087 --> 01:27:22,088
Why do you want the video
my marriage?

1731
01:27:22,288 --> 01:27:24,423
It's like an invasion
my privacy. Do you understand?

1732
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:26,192
It is intrusive ...

1733
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:29,128
Has pictures of all
your inner circle.

1734
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:31,263
Images, names
people.

1735
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:33,666
You know you want?
Look at yourself.

1736
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,235
Want disconcerting to you
and your wife.

1737
01:27:36,402 --> 01:27:38,871
For you and Bug
you become a witness.

1738
01:27:39,405 --> 01:27:40,906
You want me to betray myself?

1739
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,575
Want information
myself.

1740
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,112
Good thing I know
everyone in the city center.

1741
01:27:46,378 --> 01:27:48,180
Call the Department
of Justice, the DEA.

1742
01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,850
No one knows you exist.

1743
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,118
So calm down.

1744
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:53,419
Do not know I exist?

1745
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:55,287
No.
That is good.

1746
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:02,862
You know who is right?

1747
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:06,332
Yes.
If you would like more information.

1748
01:28:06,499 --> 01:28:07,867
Knowing what he knows.

1749
01:28:07,967 --> 01:28:09,835
You could go home.

1750
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,304
Going home?
Putting mics on your phone.

1751
01:28:12,405 --> 01:28:14,140
At home, to get information.

1752
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:17,042
Do not mess with these
types as well.

1753
01:28:17,276 --> 01:28:19,178
Do not play well.
Are you crazy?

1754
01:28:19,412 --> 01:28:21,247
It's what you do.
For that you pay.

1755
01:28:21,514 --> 01:28:23,416
You have a license Detective, you know?

1756
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:25,551
So I make my living
I am no longer a cop.

1757
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:27,586
Do not take away my license,
Okay?

1758
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,821
Ok.

1759
01:28:29,488 --> 01:28:33,159
If I can not do that,
I can at least? Calling?

1760
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:36,529
Jordan, Jordan.

1761
01:28:36,796 --> 01:28:40,433
Do me a favor, will only
call your damn lawyer.

1762
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:43,335
Whatever you do.
Follow the rules.

1763
01:28:43,536 --> 01:28:45,337
What you say.

1764
01:28:45,638 --> 01:28:47,840
I use it against you.
Do not you understand?

1765
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:49,542
He is ready.
You are silly.

1766
01:28:49,675 --> 01:28:51,010
Shit.

1767
01:28:51,343 --> 01:28:52,411
I can not get stoned?

1768
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:54,246
Are we talking
or you will be sedated?

1769
01:28:54,513 --> 01:28:57,817
At least terminate the Damned
macaroni.

1770
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:00,419
All right.

1771
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:01,754
Do not call.

1772
01:29:05,324 --> 01:29:06,992
Hello friends, upload.

1773
01:29:07,326 --> 01:29:08,694
Admission is there.

1774
01:29:09,795 --> 01:29:10,930
Welcome.

1775
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:13,432
What a nice day.

1776
01:29:17,036 --> 01:29:17,970
Welcome aboard.

1777
01:29:18,971 --> 01:29:21,340
I'm Jordan, I welcome to Naomi.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1778
01:29:21,507 --> 01:29:23,275
Agent Denham,
He is the Agent Hughes.

1779
01:29:23,342 --> 01:29:24,410
Like this?

1780
01:29:24,543 --> 01:29:26,679
Let me introduce you.
They are Nicole and Heidi.

1781
01:29:26,912 --> 01:29:29,281
We will not be shy,
no need.

1782
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,717
Do not be afraid.
They are friends of Stratton.

1783
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,052
It's my pleasure.
Hello.

1784
01:29:35,988 --> 01:29:38,824
His message said he wanted
talk privately.

1785
01:29:39,492 --> 01:29:40,926
Yes, I want to talk
private.

1786
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,595
One minute please ladies.

1787
01:29:42,828 --> 01:29:44,330
Just call if you want something.

1788
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:45,664
We are happy to help.

1789
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:47,566
Are you hungry?

1790
01:29:47,767 --> 01:29:50,069
We have pasta, shrimp, lobster.

1791
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,071
Whisky or have any
drink they want.

1792
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:55,474
Know that the Office us
eating or drinking.

1793
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:59,845
Course.
Had he been on one of these before?

1794
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:01,447
A boat?

1795
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:03,682
I learned to surf
when he was 6.

1796
01:30:04,016 --> 01:30:04,984
Do not tell me, seriously?

1797
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:07,620
I like this
I mean ...

1798
01:30:07,987 --> 01:30:10,423
I had extend the average
to enter the helicopter.

1799
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:11,757
See?

1800
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:14,527
Anyway, this is for you.

1801
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,930
It is a complete list of
everyone at my wedding.

1802
01:30:18,197 --> 01:30:20,332
I know you wanted the video
bed.

1803
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:22,902
Imagine that this would help
to speed things up, right?

1804
01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:24,703
Right.
Look ...

1805
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,407
My point is that I am aware
that investigates Stratton

1806
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:31,544
but even if I think too much,
I find no reason.

1807
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:35,848
I know we're not conventional,
We are bustling to work.

1808
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:39,452
You must understand that the competition
must ask for a name.

1809
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:42,988
I want you to understand
no ...

1810
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:44,924
do anything illegal.

1811
01:30:45,758 --> 01:30:46,992
Not at all.

1812
01:30:47,259 --> 01:30:51,464
You can talk to the SEC have gone to my
office 15 times in the last 6 months.

1813
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:54,033
I have nothing to hide.

1814
01:30:54,166 --> 01:30:57,069
Well the SEC is an agency
civil regulatory.

1815
01:30:57,303 --> 01:30:59,038
We seek criminal.
Right.

1816
01:30:59,171 --> 01:31:01,207
You seek criminal
really.

1817
01:31:02,675 --> 01:31:05,578
It makes me think that
I investigate me.

1818
01:31:05,778 --> 01:31:09,348
Seriously, what do you think we did?

1819
01:31:09,515 --> 01:31:10,716
Or do we?
I do not understand.

1820
01:31:12,084 --> 01:31:14,720
Jordan can not argue
an ongoing investigation.

1821
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,988
I get it.

1822
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:17,790
With that said.

1823
01:31:18,758 --> 01:31:20,493
This case was left
on my desk.

1824
01:31:21,293 --> 01:31:23,763
For a new administration,
need load

1825
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:25,831
investigating the new company
on the block.

1826
01:31:25,998 --> 01:31:27,199
A noisy boys.

1827
01:31:27,366 --> 01:31:30,636
I ended up being the idiot
doing research, exactly.

1828
01:31:31,036 --> 01:31:32,505
It's just, you know ...
Bug Me

1829
01:31:32,705 --> 01:31:35,741
we are the new kids,
that hit Wall Street.

1830
01:31:36,008 --> 01:31:39,011
You should see what happens in
larger signatures.

1831
01:31:39,178 --> 01:31:40,513
I know all
information.

1832
01:31:40,946 --> 01:31:45,418
True Goldman, The Leahman Brothers
its collateral obligations

1833
01:31:45,651 --> 01:31:47,319
in actions that nonsense.

1834
01:31:47,486 --> 01:31:48,988
It's crazy.

1835
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:53,159
I can tell you step by step
exactly what happens.

1836
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,528
Just ask.

1837
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:56,929
I'm available.

1838
01:31:57,329 --> 01:31:58,597
Exactly what I wanted to hear.

1839
01:31:58,864 --> 01:32:00,966
Do not see why not
and sit a moment

1840
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:04,036
is not profitable for both.

1841
01:32:04,303 --> 01:32:06,372
It should be, right?
Profitable for both.

1842
01:32:06,539 --> 01:32:07,807
Should.
Look ...

1843
01:32:08,641 --> 01:32:10,109
I will give my personal line.

1844
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:13,345
5 days a week just call me,
feel free to do so.

1845
01:32:14,113 --> 01:32:15,448
I will.
Genial.

1846
01:32:20,152 --> 01:32:21,487
Insurance you do not want?
drink?

1847
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,955
Are not you hungry?

1848
01:32:23,556 --> 01:32:24,490
Nothing?
No.

1849
01:32:24,657 --> 01:32:25,891
No?

1850
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,431
Let me ask you a question, if
very personal just tell me to shut up.

1851
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,402
Do I try to get your license
running at some point?

1852
01:32:36,569 --> 01:32:39,505
Did you mean to try Wall Street?

1853
01:32:40,506 --> 01:32:41,907
No?
Who did you talk?

1854
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:43,843
Who the fuck you talk to?

1855
01:32:44,009 --> 01:32:46,746
I did a little research,
Do you see what I mean?

1856
01:32:49,014 --> 01:32:52,151
Have you thought about what would have happened
to stay the course?

1857
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:57,490
When I travel home on the subway
and I sweat balls

1858
01:32:57,623 --> 01:32:59,425
with the same outfit three days in a row.

1859
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:00,960
Yeah, bet I do.

1860
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:02,795
I've thought,
Who would not?

1861
01:33:03,028 --> 01:33:04,630
Sure, who would not?

1862
01:33:04,764 --> 01:33:06,465
Another personal question
do not need to answer it.

1863
01:33:06,599 --> 01:33:07,833
No problem Jordan.

1864
01:33:07,967 --> 01:33:10,336
How do you get $ 15 billion dollars,
something?

1865
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,538
A year??

1866
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:15,674
Well, shall we say ...

1867
01:33:16,409 --> 01:33:18,944
You get a free gun
when you enlist in the FBI.

1868
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:22,281
But it bothers me,
Do you understand?

1869
01:33:22,415 --> 01:33:24,517
When you think of people who
built this country.

1870
01:33:24,817 --> 01:33:25,918
Working people like you.

1871
01:33:26,052 --> 01:33:27,987
Firefighters, teachers,
FBI agents.

1872
01:33:28,654 --> 01:33:32,324
At the end of the day
flayed alive financially.

1873
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:33,993
That bothers me.

1874
01:33:34,493 --> 01:33:37,430
That's all Wall Street
and this market

1875
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,998
for me I think

1876
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:42,034
reward is good, you know?

1877
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,804
There are situations in which ...

1878
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:47,840
I can make those situations
better for people.

1879
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:50,076
You know what I mean.

1880
01:33:50,342 --> 01:33:52,611
Timing is everything.

1881
01:33:52,912 --> 01:33:54,013
Right.

1882
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:56,015
For example I have a boy.

1883
01:33:57,983 --> 01:34:00,720
It was a school
environmental science or something.

1884
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,788
He was drowning in
student loans.

1885
01:34:02,922 --> 01:34:05,257
Above his mother needed
heart surgery.

1886
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:07,259
It was a horrible situation.
Clear.

1887
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,829
But what got the market
at the right time.

1888
01:34:09,995 --> 01:34:11,997
With the right actions
and the indicated directory.

1889
01:34:13,132 --> 01:34:15,334
From overnight
change his whole life.

1890
01:34:16,469 --> 01:34:19,004
He put his mother in the best
hospital in New York.

1891
01:34:19,638 --> 01:34:22,675
It did not work for her,
but unfortunately he died ...

1892
01:34:22,842 --> 01:34:25,378
We gave him the opportunity.
Do you understand?

1893
01:34:26,379 --> 01:34:28,681
One form is
the right team and then ...

1894
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:30,783
the overnight.
Your life can change.

1895
01:34:37,123 --> 01:34:38,991
How much internal ...?

1896
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:42,361
How much does an internal
in such a deal?

1897
01:34:42,628 --> 01:34:43,662
In that situation.

1898
01:34:44,463 --> 01:34:46,432
In that transaction
in particular.

1899
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:47,833
One.

1900
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:50,336
Almost half a million dollars.

1901
01:34:54,907 --> 01:34:56,909
Would do that for anyone,
you know.

1902
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:59,378
Anyone need
proper guidance.

1903
01:35:19,665 --> 01:35:21,500
Can you say that again?

1904
01:35:22,068 --> 01:35:23,669
The way you said it.

1905
01:35:24,403 --> 01:35:25,504
Likewise.

1906
01:35:30,276 --> 01:35:31,410
I do not know what you mean.

1907
01:35:31,577 --> 01:35:33,012
You know what I mean.
No.

1908
01:35:33,212 --> 01:35:34,880
That thing just Jordan
to make is that,

1909
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,582
if I'm not mistaken,

1910
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:39,051
is that you tried to bribe
a federal officer.

1911
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:41,554
Technically
bribed anyone.

1912
01:35:41,587 --> 01:35:43,155
Technically it was not ...
No. ..

1913
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:44,890
According to the criminal code
U.S..

1914
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:48,627
There must be an exact figure
for an exchange of services.

1915
01:35:48,661 --> 01:35:50,296
That does not serve them well in
court.

1916
01:35:50,596 --> 01:35:52,198
I do not listen well.

1917
01:35:52,364 --> 01:35:53,766
No, that's the truth.

1918
01:35:53,966 --> 01:35:55,301
But I will say this.
Yeah?

1919
01:35:55,868 --> 01:35:59,839
The same gentleman who told me that
Did you get you license also

1920
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,807
told me you were a straight arrow.

1921
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:03,175
I check my background.

1922
01:36:03,409 --> 01:36:04,510
Well ...

1923
01:36:05,778 --> 01:36:07,780
when you ride in a boat that seems
James Bond villain.

1924
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,682
Sometimes you have to act the part, right?

1925
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:13,285
I think it is time for
the hell out of my boat.

1926
01:36:13,419 --> 01:36:14,487
What say you?

1927
01:36:15,654 --> 01:36:17,056
Jordan'll tell you something.

1928
01:36:17,223 --> 01:36:19,592
Many Idiots
Wall Street I've caught.

1929
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:22,361
They have no manners.

1930
01:36:22,795 --> 01:36:23,863
Do not tell me.
Yes.

1931
01:36:24,163 --> 01:36:25,698
Her parents are idiots.

1932
01:36:25,965 --> 01:36:27,666
Like their
parents before them.

1933
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:29,969
But you ...

1934
01:36:31,504 --> 01:36:34,140
Jordan you get
for yourself.

1935
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:35,574
Did I?

1936
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:36,909
Good for you man.

1937
01:36:37,076 --> 01:36:38,210
Little Man??

1938
01:36:38,511 --> 01:36:39,879
Good for you.
Am I a little man?

1939
01:36:40,246 --> 01:36:41,347
Let me tell you something.

1940
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:43,849
Let me tell you something else.

1941
01:36:44,016 --> 01:36:45,618
Honestly, it's no joke.

1942
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:47,420
This is one of the boats more
nice where I've been.

1943
01:36:47,753 --> 01:36:48,988
I must tell you.
I bet you do.

1944
01:36:49,255 --> 01:36:50,656
You know also thought én?

1945
01:36:50,923 --> 01:36:53,526
He fucking hero I will be
in office.

1946
01:36:54,093 --> 01:36:56,028
When you seize this
damn boat.

1947
01:36:56,162 --> 01:36:58,664
Jordan will be very funny.

1948
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:01,434
It's beautiful.

1949
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:03,402
It also brings the girls
beautiful.

1950
01:37:03,669 --> 01:37:06,205
It is wonderful.
Okay fuck off my boat.

1951
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:08,908
Sure we will soon.

1952
01:37:09,141 --> 01:37:11,210
Sure, good luck road
home on the subway

1953
01:37:11,377 --> 01:37:13,079
to see their miserable
and horrible wives.

1954
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:16,248
Heidi Hare lick my caviar
balls in between.

1955
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:19,151
Guys want lobsters
for the trip home?

1956
01:37:19,418 --> 01:37:23,255
Poor devils nor can afford them,
bastards.

1957
01:37:26,759 --> 01:37:29,028
Hey guys, look what
I found in my pocket.

1958
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:30,863
Look, a year's salary.

1959
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:32,598
Right here, you know how to call them?

1960
01:37:32,832 --> 01:37:34,266
Coupons fun.

1961
01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:37,403
Coupons are fun.

1962
01:37:46,178 --> 01:37:48,547
Switzerland??
What the fuck is there?

1963
01:37:49,014 --> 01:37:50,616
Swiss Banks, that's what you get.

1964
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,318
It was time to cover
ass.

1965
01:37:52,885 --> 01:37:53,819
He had to hide my money.

1966
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:56,455
Sign Rugrat.

1967
01:37:56,722 --> 01:37:58,791
I knew a banker
Swiss law school.

1968
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:00,493
But he was in Geneva.

1969
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:03,262
There was no way to make
the sober journey.

1970
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:08,667
I knew that if I took my drugs right.
You could sleep during the flight.

1971
01:38:09,335 --> 01:38:11,370
But he must take the amount
adequate w.

1972
01:38:12,204 --> 01:38:14,206
4pm to take a few more Ludes.

1973
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:17,009
That began to take effect
when I finished my speech.

1974
01:38:17,777 --> 01:38:19,078
My numbness phase.

1975
01:38:19,612 --> 01:38:23,416
At dinner I took a couple more,
along with a few cocktails and a few Valium.

1976
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,651
My wandering phase.

1977
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:29,922
8:30 to take a couple of more Ludes.

1978
01:38:30,423 --> 01:38:32,558
I lost almost all
my motor skills.

1979
01:38:33,526 --> 01:38:34,927
This phase was drooling.

1980
01:38:37,863 --> 01:38:40,366
By 10 I did not know that
or who was shit.

1981
01:38:41,434 --> 01:38:43,002
This phase has no name.

1982
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,638
Board the plane one
shortly before 12.

1983
01:38:46,906 --> 01:38:49,375
Look at that nice.
Excuse me sir ...

1984
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:51,210
Soon began the contest
sleeping.

1985
01:38:52,244 --> 01:38:53,512
Can I see your ticket books?

1986
01:38:53,713 --> 01:38:55,581
We do not have tickets.

1987
01:38:55,781 --> 01:38:57,616
I love Jesus Christ
get me something.

1988
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:59,752
Hey, relax.

1989
01:38:59,885 --> 01:39:02,388
Why's your hand
damn my penis?

1990
01:39:03,823 --> 01:39:05,991
He has his hand on ...
I'll wear the belt.

1991
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:07,426
What's on your mind?

1992
01:39:07,626 --> 01:39:09,261
Do not do that on a
public place.

1993
01:39:09,495 --> 01:39:10,863
I pluck.

1994
01:39:11,297 --> 01:39:12,498
Get it out!

1995
01:39:12,665 --> 01:39:14,667
I heard that there is a
treasure down there.

1996
01:39:15,735 --> 01:39:17,370
Basta.
Excuse me sir.

1997
01:39:18,137 --> 01:39:19,405
Please sit down.

1998
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:22,141
Return to your seat.
Why are you upset?

1999
01:39:22,308 --> 01:39:23,676
Please return to your seat.

2000
01:39:23,909 --> 01:39:26,011
I'll have to call the Captain.
Please sir.

2001
01:39:26,512 --> 01:39:27,747
Please sit down sir.

2002
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,348
Please sit down.
Ok.

2003
01:39:29,448 --> 01:39:31,417
I'm going, stop.
Sorry.

2004
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:32,885
Ok.
. Ire to sleep.

2005
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:34,453
Have you asked or
we ask?

2006
01:39:34,754 --> 01:39:36,455
Fasten your seatbelts.
Ok.

2007
01:39:36,589 --> 01:39:38,657
We can not take off
if they do not.

2008
01:39:38,791 --> 01:39:40,659
Sit and abróchatelo.
Ok.

2009
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,261
Can I do for you?
What?

2010
01:39:42,461 --> 01:39:43,496
I'll do it for you.
Ok.

2011
01:39:43,662 --> 01:39:46,499
Speaks English, do not understand what you say.
Come here.

2012
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:48,300
I will help with his belt.

2013
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:51,003
Sit up, sit down.

2014
01:39:51,504 --> 01:39:53,205
Here we go, well here we go.

2015
01:39:55,841 --> 01:39:57,376
Hilfe going to come.

2016
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:00,012
Hilfe.
Hilfe.

2017
01:40:00,279 --> 01:40:01,247
Hilfe.
P. ..

2018
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:13,959
Jesus Christ.

2019
01:40:14,193 --> 01:40:16,128
Shit.

2020
01:40:17,596 --> 01:40:18,831
Donnie.

2021
01:40:18,998 --> 01:40:21,667
This is not funny.
Untie friend.

2022
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:23,703
I can not untie.

2023
01:40:24,503 --> 01:40:26,872
The Captain will Moor.
You electrocuted.

2024
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:30,943
Why?

2025
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:45,925
Would you people scream.

2026
01:40:47,193 --> 01:40:48,260
Shit.
You were on the floor.

2027
01:40:48,494 --> 01:40:49,962
Rolling and stuff.

2028
01:40:50,696 --> 01:40:52,331
Jesus.
Called Captain Edward.

2029
01:40:53,366 --> 01:40:54,867
Would you call Edward?

2030
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:56,235
Yes, I was very upset.

2031
01:40:56,969 --> 01:40:58,871
Really?
Luckily it is first class.

2032
01:41:00,473 --> 01:41:03,075
I think you're Jesus Christ
a drug problem.

2033
01:41:04,543 --> 01:41:07,847
Where are Ludes?

2034
01:41:08,247 --> 01:41:09,915
In my ass, do not worry.

2035
01:41:10,549 --> 01:41:12,418
I got this.
Thank God.

2036
01:41:13,953 --> 01:41:16,088
Jesus Christ, what we do when
come to Switzerland?

2037
01:41:16,222 --> 01:41:17,456
This is bad.

2038
01:41:17,757 --> 01:41:20,926
I can not breathe, do something
to calm down please.

2039
01:41:21,427 --> 01:41:22,862
Shut the fuck up.
Shut.

2040
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:25,131
Ok.

2041
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:27,867
That is good.

2042
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:29,668
Keep doing it.

2043
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:33,639
Shut.

2044
01:41:39,011 --> 01:41:40,679
Mr. Belfort.

2045
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,214
It is free to go.

2046
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:45,584
Really?

2047
01:41:49,655 --> 01:41:52,558
Donnie is when we get
not acting like yourself.

2048
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:54,660
Donnie Librémoslo idiot, okay?

2049
01:41:54,827 --> 01:41:56,262
Why do you claim to me?

2050
01:41:56,495 --> 01:41:59,331
Listen the only reason you're here
and not in jail is by my friend, okay?

2051
01:41:59,632 --> 01:42:01,333
Hilfe!

2052
01:42:01,834 --> 01:42:03,903
We're here.
We will.

2053
01:42:04,804 --> 01:42:06,072
Jordan Belfort.

2054
01:42:06,405 --> 01:42:07,473
Finally.

2055
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,508
Nicholas told me so
about you.

2056
01:42:10,376 --> 01:42:12,011
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2057
01:42:12,278 --> 01:42:14,380
It's my pleasure.
Same to you.

2058
01:42:16,449 --> 01:42:18,651
You understand that ended up there?
Ok.

2059
01:42:19,652 --> 01:42:22,421
Need a larger sofa.
I do not understand. Sorry.

2060
01:42:22,621 --> 01:42:25,257
Curious about its laws
banking security.

2061
01:42:28,194 --> 01:42:30,329
Wait, yes.
Sorry Jordan.

2062
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:34,333
The Swiss tradition demands
10 minutes ...

2063
01:42:35,334 --> 01:42:36,569
Conversation.
If conversation.

2064
01:42:37,002 --> 01:42:38,204
Before discussing business.

2065
01:42:40,005 --> 01:42:41,073
If ...

2066
01:42:44,009 --> 01:42:46,846
Of course ...
get to the point.

2067
01:42:47,012 --> 01:42:48,381
What do you know?

2068
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:53,786
Under what circumstances
you would be required to cooperate with the FBI

2069
01:42:54,487 --> 01:42:57,423
or the Department of Research
American for example.

2070
01:42:58,290 --> 01:43:01,427
Never?

2071
01:43:01,827 --> 01:43:02,862
Yes.

2072
01:43:03,362 --> 01:43:05,664
How ever?

2073
01:43:06,766 --> 01:43:10,136
Unless you want to invade
Switzerland in the coming months.

2074
01:43:11,203 --> 01:43:13,572
So we will check your gas
down the street to success.

2075
01:43:13,706 --> 01:43:14,874
If the street.

2076
01:43:15,141 --> 01:43:17,777
If the street.
Say it right.

2077
01:43:18,844 --> 01:43:20,713
See, this is what I did
in law school.

2078
01:43:21,113 --> 01:43:22,681
Champagne.
Champagne.

2079
01:43:22,782 --> 01:43:24,750
If, fries ...

2080
01:43:25,918 --> 01:43:28,220
That kind of thing.

2081
01:43:30,056 --> 01:43:32,591
What wonder stupid Swiss ...

2082
01:43:32,758 --> 01:43:34,827
Are you going to fuck?

2083
01:43:37,663 --> 01:43:39,598
I understand perfectly.

2084
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:41,333
American shit.

2085
01:43:43,569 --> 01:43:47,840
The only way to mess with
a bank here.

2086
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:52,011
If the crime is also being investigated
here in Switzerland.

2087
01:43:52,278 --> 01:43:56,048
But there are several Swiss law
that apply to your ...

2088
01:43:56,348 --> 01:43:57,349
practices.

2089
01:43:58,117 --> 01:43:59,485
From my point of view.

2090
01:43:59,952 --> 01:44:02,888
Now you're in paradise.

2091
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:04,590
Told you it was fantastic,
Right?

2092
01:44:05,825 --> 01:44:07,460
If the Department of Justice
American

2093
01:44:07,626 --> 01:44:09,295
sends us a subpoena.

2094
01:44:09,428 --> 01:44:11,764
Become toilet paper.

2095
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:14,834
We would clean your ass with it.

2096
01:44:16,369 --> 01:44:19,839
Unless there is an investigation
in fraud actions.

2097
01:44:20,139 --> 01:44:22,942
Which is a crime here too,
if I'm not mistaken.

2098
01:44:23,209 --> 01:44:27,113
Then, there should be cooperation
on your part.

2099
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:28,681
I think.
Yes.

2100
01:44:29,448 --> 01:44:30,416
Yes, it is.

2101
01:44:32,118 --> 01:44:33,953
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2102
01:44:35,888 --> 01:44:36,956
If you were ...

2103
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:38,791
under another name.

2104
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:42,161
A friend, a comrade.
A cousin.

2105
01:44:42,628 --> 01:44:43,963
A cousin, yes.

2106
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:48,701
Pariente.
Yes.

2107
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:55,941
Hark well what I said?,
or am I hallucinating.

2108
01:44:56,609 --> 01:44:58,277
If ... other.

2109
01:44:59,345 --> 01:45:01,580
Are you saying that you use
a hollow rat.

2110
01:45:02,014 --> 01:45:05,284
But one rat hole never enter
Switzerland with all that money.

2111
01:45:06,085 --> 01:45:09,655
What I needed was a rat
with a European passport.

2112
01:45:17,263 --> 01:45:18,364
Jordan ...

2113
01:45:18,764 --> 01:45:21,067
Hello, how's my favorite aunt?

2114
01:45:21,534 --> 01:45:23,069
Welcome, traffic?

2115
01:45:23,569 --> 01:45:24,904
Not at all.

2116
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:31,610
Thank goodness Aunt Emma
I do not need much convincing.

2117
01:45:32,278 --> 01:45:34,580
It turned out that the English were not
very different from the Swiss.

2118
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:37,349
Money talks and bullshit
they go by bus.

2119
01:45:37,616 --> 01:45:39,585
How do you say recess rat
in English?

2120
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:42,321
If you get into any trouble.

2121
01:45:42,922 --> 01:45:44,990
I will come immediately,
do not worry.

2122
01:45:45,491 --> 01:45:46,792
I promise.

2123
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,662
He keeps us young risk,
Dear? Truth?

2124
01:45:54,533 --> 01:45:56,001
Sometimes I wonder ...

2125
01:45:56,902 --> 01:45:58,704
If you have money left
it take over you.

2126
01:45:59,805 --> 01:46:02,641
Among other substances.

2127
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,414
Is it that obvious?

2128
01:46:08,848 --> 01:46:11,317
This is darling,
sweat drugs.

2129
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:17,089
That I can tell, I am ...

2130
01:46:17,556 --> 01:46:18,657
a drug addict.

2131
01:46:19,492 --> 01:46:20,860
I really am,
but I say ...

2132
01:46:21,694 --> 01:46:25,431
cocaine, pills whatever
I'll take me.

2133
01:46:27,033 --> 01:46:28,134
That's the truth.

2134
01:46:29,969 --> 01:46:31,170
I am also addicted
sex.

2135
01:46:32,171 --> 01:46:34,373
There are worse things that
be addicted to sex.

2136
01:46:36,175 --> 01:46:37,843
Why I tell you
all this?

2137
01:46:38,411 --> 01:46:39,745
Sorry.

2138
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,581
Because I am trustworthy.

2139
01:46:43,449 --> 01:46:45,317
You are, it is easy
trust you.

2140
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:50,756
It's just my job,
you know ...

2141
01:46:51,557 --> 01:46:53,359
all these people depend on me.

2142
01:46:53,492 --> 01:46:55,461
There are thousands of dollars
into play.

2143
01:46:56,295 --> 01:47:00,099
Sometimes I feel like I bite more
than I can chew.

2144
01:47:01,534 --> 01:47:03,202
You're a man with
a big appetite.

2145
01:47:03,903 --> 01:47:05,004
Yes.

2146
01:47:07,006 --> 01:47:08,240
Are you hitting on me?

2147
01:47:09,075 --> 01:47:10,676
Yes, it is.

2148
01:47:13,846 --> 01:47:14,780
Suppose that ...

2149
01:47:15,214 --> 01:47:16,615
I demand to me.

2150
01:47:17,283 --> 01:47:18,584
It was my decision.

2151
01:47:19,485 --> 01:47:24,390
It is difficult to know how to control the
anxiety, do you understand?

2152
01:47:27,593 --> 01:47:29,829
Relax and let go.

2153
01:47:31,197 --> 01:47:32,798
Freeing the tension?

2154
01:47:34,166 --> 01:47:35,668
If you are seducing me.

2155
01:47:36,202 --> 01:47:37,670
Yes.
Fuck.

2156
01:47:38,337 --> 01:47:39,672
Yes, release tension.

2157
01:47:44,677 --> 01:47:45,678
Suppose we ...

2158
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:48,247
you only need to learn ...

2159
01:47:49,849 --> 01:47:51,951
to do what is
natural part of life, you know?

2160
01:47:54,987 --> 01:47:56,322
Are you hitting on me?

2161
01:48:03,662 --> 01:48:05,765
Stability dear.
Family.

2162
01:48:13,572 --> 01:48:14,807
Take care of my niece, baby.

2163
01:48:15,808 --> 01:48:17,076
I'll take care of everything here.

2164
01:48:19,245 --> 01:48:20,379
Deal.

2165
01:48:27,253 --> 01:48:29,889
We literally
lot of money.

2166
01:48:30,723 --> 01:48:32,825
Emma could never load
all by herself.

2167
01:48:33,492 --> 01:48:36,996
So I thought,
Who else has a European passport?

2168
01:48:37,596 --> 01:48:39,598
You're doing very tight.

2169
01:48:39,832 --> 01:48:42,168
Brad, as a successful trader.

2170
01:48:42,334 --> 01:48:44,503
He spent his winters at
southern France.

2171
01:48:44,837 --> 01:48:46,505
Where he met his wife
Chantelle.

2172
01:48:46,672 --> 01:48:49,508
A stripper source
Slovak.

2173
01:48:49,842 --> 01:48:52,712
He was born in Switzerland.

2174
01:48:57,683 --> 01:48:58,984
This is fucked.

2175
01:49:00,386 --> 01:49:01,320
Do not tell me.

2176
01:49:05,324 --> 01:49:07,860
It will take us as
15 trips.

2177
01:49:12,865 --> 01:49:15,000
It could work.
What about your family?

2178
01:49:15,701 --> 01:49:18,404
I say ... all have passports
Swiss, right?

2179
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:20,840
She has parents, brother.

2180
01:49:21,073 --> 01:49:23,209
Her brother has a wife,
5 people are right there.

2181
01:49:23,442 --> 01:49:24,877
5 to 6 trips and ready,
Right?

2182
01:49:25,277 --> 01:49:28,347
All are accursed
Swiss, they can.

2183
01:49:28,614 --> 01:49:30,683
At least I have a family
dealer shit.

2184
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:33,586
Do not forget me money.

2185
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:37,790
Excuse me what?
Forgot to tell you he has ...

2186
01:49:38,324 --> 01:49:39,458
some money.
My money.

2187
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,328
I have a couple of million
underway.

2188
01:49:42,995 --> 01:49:45,264
When I give you a call arriving
and you can pick them up.

2189
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:49,535
Will you call me?

2190
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:52,838
When you arrive, I give you a call.

2191
01:49:53,172 --> 01:49:54,540
For you to collect.

2192
01:49:54,573 --> 01:49:56,342
We do not work for you man.

2193
01:49:57,276 --> 01:49:59,545
Honey, you got my money
attached to your tits.

2194
01:49:59,912 --> 01:50:01,514
Technically if you work
for me.

2195
01:50:05,117 --> 01:50:06,619
Jordan need to talk.

2196
01:50:06,752 --> 01:50:08,988
I will not, I tell you,
not for him.

2197
01:50:09,288 --> 01:50:11,490
I'm not the errand boy, okay?

2198
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:12,858
I understand.
Listen.

2199
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:16,962
He will take you to where I say.
Tell that to that piece of shit.

2200
01:50:17,196 --> 01:50:21,133
If you do not like I want,
lose reason and you'll break your teeth.

2201
01:50:21,901 --> 01:50:25,304
The teeth of who?

2202
01:50:25,471 --> 01:50:27,373
I put the money in
the damn table.

2203
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,742
Not you, I'm the reason
this whole deal.

2204
01:50:29,909 --> 01:50:31,844
Calm down you fucking idiot.
Fuck his gun.

2205
01:50:33,379 --> 01:50:36,582
You're a fucking mule
I have 5 more like your brother.

2206
01:50:36,749 --> 01:50:38,918
Shut the fuck up you piece of shit.

2207
01:50:39,085 --> 01:50:40,753
You know what else?
You dress like shit.

2208
01:50:40,986 --> 01:50:42,321
So fuck you.
Shut up bastard.

2209
01:50:42,955 --> 01:50:44,223
Jesus, are you okay?
How do you like pussy?

2210
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:45,758
Who's the fag now?

2211
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:47,460
Are these good?

2212
01:50:50,329 --> 01:50:52,598

2214
01:50:55,468 --> 01:50:58,170
What in the big picture was
just a drop.

2215
01:50:59,739 --> 01:51:02,742
For the next more over
6 round trips.

2216
01:51:02,842 --> 01:51:04,610
Chantelle's family and friends.

2217
01:51:04,844 --> 01:51:08,280
They spent more than $ 20 million in
cash without even hesitation.

2218
01:51:14,086 --> 01:51:15,955
I have a little more.
Really?

2219
01:51:16,555 --> 01:51:17,490
Thank you.

01:51:18,391 --> 01:51:20,026
Welcome.

Park the car, you fucking idiot.

2226
01:51:57,263 --> 01:51:59,098
I can not close the case.

2227
01:51:59,665 --> 01:52:01,667
A fucking day, just a fucking day.

2228
01:52:01,967 --> 01:52:04,036
You could not be sober?
It's fucked up, right?

2229
01:52:05,137 --> 01:52:06,505
You must be kidding.

2230
01:52:12,678 --> 01:52:13,679
It is a joke.
A joke?

2231
01:52:13,913 --> 01:52:15,581
I'm sober.
Jesus Christ.

2232
01:52:16,182 --> 01:52:17,817
It is a joke.
Are you stupid?

2233
01:52:18,484 --> 01:52:20,252
You came like a fucking maniac.

2234
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:21,821
You know how much attention

2235
01:52:21,954 --> 01:52:23,389
I'm not stupid.

2236
01:52:23,756 --> 01:52:25,057
I'm smart.
Intelligent??

2237
01:52:25,324 --> 01:52:26,826
Do millionaires treatment.

2238
01:52:27,326 --> 01:52:29,428
I am intelligent and important.
Unlike you.

2239
01:52:29,595 --> 01:52:31,630
A person who does not
low blows.

2240
01:52:31,997 --> 01:52:33,199
When scared, okay?

2241
01:52:33,699 --> 01:52:36,302
By the way I have not yet received
an apology for that.

2242
01:52:36,535 --> 01:52:39,572
I check my messages daily
when I get to work.

2243
01:52:39,839 --> 01:52:43,275
But I have only a light off because
not you leave me a message.

2244
01:52:43,409 --> 01:52:46,078
You should shut up.
My wife check messages.

2245
01:52:46,245 --> 01:52:48,180
I'm calling from the office each
45 minutes.

2246
01:52:48,347 --> 01:52:51,417
Already Brad apologized?
Is there a message on the answering machine?

2247
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:54,453
But I have nothing,
well you treat people.

2248
01:52:54,653 --> 01:52:57,590
Got a big mouth,

2249
01:52:58,157 --> 01:52:59,692
Can I get a pass?

2250
01:53:00,126 --> 01:53:01,794
It is figurative language.
OMG.

01:53:01,994 --> 01:53:03,329
The Emperor of village idiot.

2252
01:53:03,629 --> 01:53:05,598
Wine from village idiot
to give me a pass.

2253
01:53:06,132 --> 01:53:09,001
What do they do in town idiot
when the emperor is not?

2254
01:53:09,502 --> 01:53:10,870
Is there chaos?

2255
01:53:11,404 --> 01:53:12,805
Do people plundered and violated?

2256
01:53:13,172 --> 01:53:15,708
What people do
while you're here?

2257
01:53:16,942 --> 01:53:19,545
Scroll up and sing.

2258
01:53:19,678 --> 01:53:21,347
I have not lost a trial
in my life.

2259
01:53:21,514 --> 01:53:23,115
If you come to me again.

2260
01:53:23,716 --> 01:53:24,817
Just calm down.
You know what?

2261
01:53:26,752 --> 01:53:30,256
I do not think wrong,
I think you'll like.

2262
01:53:31,257 --> 01:53:34,593
So you come to me.

What is it?

2267
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:46,072
I alert my side

2268
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:48,040
Are you hot for my friend.

2269
01:53:48,174 --> 01:53:50,242
Do you understand?
But I will not go into that.

2270
01:53:50,409 --> 01:53:53,612
Please give me enough

2271
01:53:53,779 --> 01:53:55,014
Give me the briefcase.
Right.

2272
01:53:55,181 --> 01:53:56,549
You have to do me a favor.
What?

2273
01:53:56,549 --> 01:53:57,783
You should take this case.

2274
01:53:58,384 --> 01:53:59,618
Driving straight home.

2275
01:54:00,152 --> 01:54:01,420
You open the briefcase.

2276
01:54:01,554 --> 01:54:03,656
You take every
dollars.

2277
01:54:03,823 --> 01:54:05,658
Do not leave anything inside.

2278
01:54:05,758 --> 01:54:08,361
I want you to have
organized outside of the case.

2279
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:12,465
The footage and the mess by
Slovenian vagina your wife.

2280
01:54:12,698 --> 01:54:13,999
Do you understand?
Damn garbage.

2281
01:54:15,401 --> 01:54:16,902

Do not move.
Back off!

2286
01:54:24,744 --> 01:54:26,912
Do not repeat it again.

2287
01:54:27,747 --> 01:54:29,582
Drop the briefcase.
Hands up.

2288
01:54:30,116 --> 01:54:31,317
Knees.

2289
01:54:31,751 --> 01:54:32,918
Knees, sir.

2290
01:54:33,152 --> 01:54:34,453
Knees.

What's that?
20 real lemons.

2296
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,908
A pharmacy was closing

2297
01:54:56,075 --> 01:54:57,410
Keep this for 15 years.
Are you kidding?

2298
01:54:57,676 --> 01:54:58,911
Lemons??

2299
01:54:59,512 --> 01:55:01,013
We are going to get really crazy.

2300
01:55:01,514 --> 01:55:02,848
When dealing with
Quaaludes.

2301
01:55:03,115 --> 01:55:04,817
Lemons 714.

2302
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:06,485
They were the holy grail.

2303
01:55:06,652 --> 01:55:07,820
Can you believe it?
OMG.

2304
01:55:07,987 --> 01:55:11,757
I thought they were a myth. -
More powerful than anything.

2305
01:55:11,991 --> 01:55:14,927
Look at this baby.
Donnie knew how to celebrate.

2306
01:55:15,327 --> 01:55:17,496
He said he kept these
for a special occasion.

2307
01:55:17,596 --> 01:55:19,832
As a birthday,
something

2308
01:55:20,332 --> 01:55:22,301
or my money coming
safe in Switzerland.

2309
01:55:26,739 --> 01:55:31,877
So that night my schedule and clean
me free of interfering substances.

2310
01:55:33,212 --> 01:55:34,747
It was time to celebrate.

2311
01:55:35,681 --> 01:55:36,682
Ok.

2312
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:38,084
So what is the dosage?

2313
01:55:38,217 --> 01:55:39,752
I have been told that only
need one.

2314
01:55:40,486 --> 01:55:41,554
Here you go.

2315
01:55:42,388 --> 01:55:43,389
Health.
Health.

2316
01:56:06,512 --> 01:56:07,680
Do you feel anything?

2317
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:12,218
No.

2318
01:56:14,954 --> 01:56:16,222
It's been 35 minutes.

2319
01:56:19,458 --> 01:56:22,261
Maybe develop immunity
after so many years.

2320
01:56:36,142 --> 01:56:37,243
This is bullshit.

2321
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:39,779
I do not feel shit.

2322
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,249
They're old, are they lost power?

2323
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,317
Look at the bottle.

2324
01:56:48,788 --> 01:56:49,922
January 1981.

2325
01:56:50,256 --> 01:56:51,490
It is Dutch.

2326
01:56:51,624 --> 01:56:53,092
Shit.
Take ...

2327
01:56:53,693 --> 01:56:54,927
2 more each.
Yes.

2328
01:56:57,496 --> 01:56:58,764
Jordan.

2329
01:56:58,964 --> 01:56:59,965
If honey?

2330
01:57:03,335 --> 01:57:04,737
What do two retarded?

2331
01:57:05,171 --> 01:57:06,372
Ejercitándonos honey.

2332
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:08,708
Bo Dietl is on the phone.

2333
01:57:08,908 --> 01:57:09,942
Ok.
OK?

2334
01:57:10,109 --> 01:57:11,177
Ok.

2335
01:57:13,045 --> 01:57:14,246
Hey Bo, what happens?
Jordan.

2336
01:57:14,447 --> 01:57:15,514
Listen to me.

2337
01:57:15,848 --> 01:57:18,184
We can not talk here
but I must speak.

2338
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:19,652
Do not mess around?
What?

2339
01:57:19,885 --> 01:57:22,822
Listen, damn salt
Jordan home.

2340
01:57:23,322 --> 01:57:25,091
Call me a phone
public.

2341
01:57:25,324 --> 01:57:26,492
It's a fucking joke
Jordan.

2342
01:57:27,093 --> 01:57:28,194
If ...

2343
01:57:29,428 --> 01:57:31,163
Shit.
What did he say?

2344
01:57:31,263 --> 01:57:32,665
I do not know what the fuck.
I must go!

2345
01:57:32,798 --> 01:57:33,966
All right Jordan?

2346
01:57:44,777 --> 01:57:46,512
The phone more public
was close

2347
01:57:46,512 --> 01:57:48,114
the country club
Brookville.

2348
01:57:49,548 --> 01:57:51,317
It was a fortress
wasps.

2349
01:57:51,484 --> 01:57:53,252
About a mile from my house.

2350
01:58:03,996 --> 01:58:05,965
I'm Bo, what happens?
I'm at a pay phone, what happens?

2351
01:58:06,365 --> 01:58:07,833
Listen carefully,
please.

2352
01:58:07,933 --> 01:58:10,069
Your friend Brad.
Your friend.

2353
01:58:10,302 --> 01:58:11,370
He's in jail.

2354
01:58:11,537 --> 01:58:13,639
Why the fuck?
What did?

2355
01:58:13,839 --> 01:58:14,874
I do not know what I did.

2356
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:17,343
But my friends in Long Island
they said they found

2357
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:19,612
in a shopping center and
locked him up.

2358
01:58:19,845 --> 01:58:21,681
Wait, what mall?
Yes.

2359
01:58:22,114 --> 01:58:25,484
It was with Donnie, due
give money to that damn.

2360
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:27,319
Speak to him.
Listen!

2361
01:58:27,553 --> 01:58:29,221
Do not go,
listen.

2362
01:58:29,622 --> 01:58:31,824
That kind Denham,
FBI agent.

2363
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:34,527
Someone told me that watching
your phone.

2364
01:58:34,794 --> 01:58:35,995
From your office and home.

2365
01:58:36,162 --> 01:58:37,763
Do not talk about them.
Ok.

2366
01:58:37,863 --> 01:58:39,298
Shit, I understand.

2367
01:58:39,532 --> 01:58:40,666
I get it.
Jordan ...

2368
01:58:42,001 --> 01:58:45,671
Not try to bribe him, do you?

2369
01:58:45,838 --> 01:58:49,375
Of course not, do you think
I'm stupid?

2370
01:58:49,575 --> 01:58:51,510
What the fuck you say?
I do not understand.

2371
01:58:51,744 --> 01:58:53,012
Say it again.
I said ...

2372
01:58:56,115 --> 01:58:57,350
What the fuck you say?

2373
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:00,252
I said ...

2374
01:59:00,386 --> 01:59:01,921
Are you high?

2375
01:59:04,056 --> 01:59:05,891
Jordan, are you stoned?

2376
01:59:07,493 --> 01:59:08,627
Jordan do me a favor.

2377
01:59:08,761 --> 01:59:11,297
Stay where you are.
Do not drive.

2378
01:59:12,998 --> 01:59:14,033
Jordan.

2379
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,068
After 15 years
stored.

2380
01:59:16,502 --> 01:59:18,971
Developed lemons
a delayed explosion.

2381
01:59:20,072 --> 01:59:22,675
I take them 90 minutes
take effect.

2382
01:59:22,842 --> 01:59:24,510
But once they did ...

2383
01:59:25,578 --> 01:59:28,681
I skip all phases and
I went straight to the drooling phase.

2384
01:59:29,582 --> 01:59:32,485
These bastards were so strong.

2385
01:59:32,885 --> 01:59:34,820
I discovered a new phase.

2386
01:59:35,154 --> 01:59:37,156
The phase of cerebral pause.

2387
01:59:39,592 --> 01:59:40,826
Come on, stand up.

2388
01:59:45,331 --> 01:59:47,299
Ok, I can not walk.

2389
01:59:48,634 --> 01:59:49,835
It's okay to think.
Think.

2390
01:59:50,069 --> 01:59:51,170
What other option is there?

2391
01:59:52,138 --> 01:59:53,873
Yes, I can crawl.

2392
01:59:54,173 --> 01:59:55,541
I can crawl like Skylar.

2393
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,842
Shit, she does
look so easy.

2394
02:00:37,616 --> 02:00:38,784
Think bastard, think.

2395
02:00:39,919 --> 02:00:41,087
Yes!

2396
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:42,388
I have it.

2397
02:00:42,788 --> 02:00:44,056
I got it!

2398
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:45,725
I can shoot.
I roll!

2399
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,308
Jordan.

2400
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:12,378
Jordan?

2401
02:02:13,179 --> 02:02:14,547
Jesus, where are you?

2402
02:02:16,515 --> 02:02:17,616
What?

2403
02:02:20,653 --> 02:02:22,054
Do not understand what you say.

2404
02:02:22,154 --> 02:02:24,590
You must come home
Donnie is out of control.

2405
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:26,926
This talking to a
chalet.

2406
02:02:27,093 --> 02:02:28,661
I do not know ...

2407
02:02:32,365 --> 02:02:34,433
I do not understand.

2408
02:02:38,904 --> 02:02:40,706
Do I understand Jordan.
Just come home.

2409
02:02:41,007 --> 02:02:42,341
Hurry.

2410
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,152
It was less than 1 mile
house.

2411
02:02:53,586 --> 02:02:55,621
I drove as slowly as I could.

2412
02:02:56,255 --> 02:02:57,990
Vi move gelatin
faster.

2413
02:03:04,096 --> 02:03:05,598
Have you delayed
$ 2 million?

2414
02:03:08,167 --> 02:03:10,136
Stop talking,
Stop talking!

2415
02:03:10,569 --> 02:03:11,637
Idiot.

2416
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:13,706
Out of the way, idiot.

2417
02:03:16,909 --> 02:03:18,177
Do you hate the $ 2 million?

2418
02:03:18,277 --> 02:03:19,879
No hate $ 2 million
Donnie.

2419
02:03:22,214 --> 02:03:23,416
By some miracle.

2420
02:03:23,749 --> 02:03:24,817
Get home alive.

2421
02:03:25,284 --> 02:03:27,086
I had no scratch
nor the car.

2422
02:03:39,365 --> 02:03:40,633
Jesus Christ.

2423
02:03:41,567 --> 02:03:42,835
What did you take?

2424
02:03:43,369 --> 02:03:44,637
What is it?

2425
02:03:56,182 --> 02:03:57,350
Jordan What the fuck?

2426
02:03:58,117 --> 02:04:00,086
You do it in our house,
I hope you know.

2427
02:04:00,386 --> 02:04:01,987
What are you doing here.

2428
02:04:25,077 --> 02:04:26,278
You go up, right?

2429
02:04:35,087 --> 02:04:36,589
It was what you did.

2430
02:04:36,822 --> 02:04:38,391
Piece of shit.

2431
02:04:39,091 --> 02:04:40,259
What?

2432
02:04:43,162 --> 02:04:46,499
Brad.

2433
02:04:46,999 --> 02:04:48,134
Damn ...

2434
02:04:53,673 --> 02:04:55,141
What did you do?

2435
02:04:55,474 --> 02:04:57,176
Piece of shit.

2436
02:04:57,677 --> 02:04:59,011
Fuck you.

2437
02:05:05,985 --> 02:05:07,319
Gotcha.

2438
02:05:31,577 --> 02:05:32,845
What the fuck happened?

2439
02:05:33,946 --> 02:05:35,047
Shit.

2440
02:05:35,348 --> 02:05:36,582
Jordan, are you okay?

2441
02:05:36,949 --> 02:05:38,284
Donnie.
Donnie!

2442
02:05:39,585 --> 02:05:41,153
Donnie, baby not breathing.

2443
02:05:41,554 --> 02:05:42,922
Shit I do not know what to do.

2444
02:05:43,255 --> 02:05:45,658
Jordan does not know what to do.

2445
02:05:45,991 --> 02:05:47,159
Jordan.

2446
02:05:48,627 --> 02:05:49,829
OMG is this
Jordan drowning.

2447
02:05:49,995 --> 02:05:51,530
Do something, my God.

2448
02:05:53,933 --> 02:05:55,401
Jordan is not breathing,
do something.

2449
02:06:22,328 --> 02:06:23,329
Move over.

2450
02:06:23,663 --> 02:06:26,866
OMG.

2451
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:28,701
Move over darling side.

2452
02:06:31,871 --> 02:06:33,005
Come here.

2453
02:06:36,409 --> 02:06:39,345
We will.

2454
02:06:43,916 --> 02:06:45,651
Jordan, not breathing.
Do something.

2455
02:06:47,653 --> 02:06:49,722
Jordan is a father
have children.

2456
02:06:49,822 --> 02:06:50,990
Do something.
Yes.

2457
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:52,658
Yes.

2458
02:07:14,013 --> 02:07:16,515
Are you okay?

2459
02:07:29,428 --> 02:07:33,499
Mr. Belfort.

2460
02:07:36,836 --> 02:07:38,571
What the fuck?

2461
02:07:39,572 --> 02:07:40,673
Lord ...

2462
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:41,974
we have to make
questions.

2463
02:07:42,808 --> 02:07:44,443
Are they kidding?
Púdranse.

2464
02:07:44,844 --> 02:07:45,845
We will stand up.

2465
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:47,380
Get out of my house.

2466
02:07:49,348 --> 02:07:50,416
Come on, get up.

2467
02:07:51,283 --> 02:07:53,786
I've been here all night,
What do they talk?

2468
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:57,256
Where are you taking him?

2469
02:07:57,423 --> 02:07:59,592
They can not enter the
persons house well.

2470
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:02,662
Did you drive your car last night
Sr, Belfort?

2471
02:08:05,264 --> 02:08:06,332
Well ...

2472
02:08:10,903 --> 02:08:12,505
It may not come
very well.

2473
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:30,723
Out of the fucking way.

2474
02:08:34,694 --> 02:08:35,761
Damn.

2475
02:08:39,098 --> 02:08:40,466
Did you drive?

2476
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,401
That car tonight?

2477
02:08:49,742 --> 02:08:51,444
It was a miracle that no
he was dead.

2478
02:08:51,677 --> 02:08:53,779
Neither they kill
another person.

2479
02:08:55,047 --> 02:08:57,817
The police took me in for questioning
but they could not press charges.

2480
02:08:57,983 --> 02:08:59,785
They had no evidence that it was
I managed.

2481
02:09:00,786 --> 02:09:05,324
Meanwhile, Brad went to prison 3 months.
By not informing Donnie.

2482
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:08,961
The result, I was free.

2483
02:09:09,362 --> 02:09:11,597
But I had my eyes on
like never before.

2484
02:09:11,764 --> 02:09:13,132
You're a man with
Luckily Jordan.

2485
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:15,501
Lucky to be alive
and not go to jail.

2486
02:09:16,802 --> 02:09:18,170
Do not believe in luck,
Right?

2487
02:09:18,337 --> 02:09:19,538
It's time ...

2488
02:09:19,739 --> 02:09:21,841
let me call the SEC
and make a deal.

2489
02:09:22,074 --> 02:09:23,342
Before you to stay
no luck.

2490
02:09:24,243 --> 02:09:25,411
Wait Daddy.

2491
02:09:25,945 --> 02:09:27,546
Hello sweetness.

2492
02:09:33,652 --> 02:09:35,321
What terms are we talking?

2493
02:09:37,423 --> 02:09:40,626
I do not know, you plead guilty to several
security breaches.

2494
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:45,431
Handling actions
sales pressure tactics, etc ...

2495
02:09:45,931 --> 02:09:47,166
Do you understand?

2496
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,201
You pay a few million in fines.

2497
02:09:49,335 --> 02:09:51,570
For the SEC did not bother
until the end of time.

2498
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,843
What about Stratton?
What happens?

2499
02:09:58,277 --> 02:10:01,213
There is no future, you must go.

2500
02:10:01,614 --> 02:10:03,049
Let Donnie take over.

2501
02:10:03,215 --> 02:10:04,450
Donnie.

2502
02:10:05,551 --> 02:10:07,386
The FBI is another animal.

2503
02:10:07,653 --> 02:10:11,157
I pursued criminally.
But if you resign voluntarily.

2504
02:10:12,391 --> 02:10:15,695
I think your best friend Denham
stay with his penis in his hand.

2505
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:18,664
Jordan.

2506
02:10:18,998 --> 02:10:20,766
What do you think?

2507
02:10:20,966 --> 02:10:23,202
You are important,
already won.

2508
02:10:23,669 --> 02:10:25,171
You do not have to work anymore.

2509
02:10:26,072 --> 02:10:28,207
Want to spend the rest
of your life in prison?

2510
02:10:28,474 --> 02:10:29,875
No.
Ok!

2511
02:10:29,909 --> 02:10:31,544
Ok, you have all the
money in the world.

2512
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:33,612
Need the money
everyone else?

2513
02:10:33,946 --> 02:10:35,214
Of course not.
Then?

2514
02:10:35,414 --> 02:10:37,016
I built it.
You know you do.

2515
02:10:37,616 --> 02:10:39,452
Built it now
I Preserve it.

2516
02:11:10,683 --> 02:11:11,784
Know ...

2517
02:11:12,385 --> 02:11:15,254
5 years ago when I started
Stratton Oakmont with ...

2518
02:11:15,821 --> 02:11:19,925
Donnie, I knew the day would come
where it should go ahead.

2519
02:11:22,828 --> 02:11:25,531
I come with a heavy heart
to tell you that ...

2520
02:11:28,234 --> 02:11:30,036
that day has come.

2521
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:38,177
I want to thank you for
their years of service

2522
02:11:38,411 --> 02:11:39,845
and admiration but ...

2523
02:11:40,379 --> 02:11:41,447
the point is this.

2524
02:11:42,214 --> 02:11:46,585
Under the leadership of Donnie together
Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg

2525
02:11:46,986 --> 02:11:50,089
who are in administrative positions
key, this place is seriously

2526
02:11:50,389 --> 02:11:51,991
better than ever
I promise.

2527
02:11:52,325 --> 02:11:53,659
OK?

2528
02:11:59,865 --> 02:12:01,901
This is your family.

2529
02:12:02,168 --> 02:12:03,869
Those who are
they come from.

2530
02:12:04,036 --> 02:12:06,572
If your relatives came from
damn Mayflower

2531
02:12:06,839 --> 02:12:08,374
or on a boat from Haiti.

2532
02:12:09,342 --> 02:12:11,410
This is the land of opportunity.

2533
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:13,779
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2534
02:12:17,983 --> 02:12:19,318
Everyone knows Kimmy Belzer,
Right?

2535
02:12:19,485 --> 02:12:20,619
Sure.

2536
02:12:21,087 --> 02:12:22,154
Púdranse.

2537
02:12:22,722 --> 02:12:25,257
Let Kimmy,
they did not know is that ...

2538
02:12:25,458 --> 02:12:28,995
is one of the first brokers here.
One of the original 20.

2539
02:12:30,496 --> 02:12:34,900
Many know the sophisticated woman
it is today.

2540
02:12:35,801 --> 02:12:38,571
Woman wearing costumes
Armani $ 3,000.

2541
02:12:40,806 --> 02:12:42,742
Driving a new Mercedes Benz.

2542
02:12:44,076 --> 02:12:47,513
Woman spends
winters in the Bahamas.

2543
02:12:47,747 --> 02:12:49,248
The summers in the Hamptons.

2544
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:56,155
That's not the Kimmy
I met.

2545
02:13:00,326 --> 02:13:03,195
The I never knew Kimmy did not have
2 cents to rub between them.

2546
02:13:05,031 --> 02:13:08,501
She was a single mother in trouble
with an 8 year old son.

2547
02:13:09,368 --> 02:13:11,470
He had 3 months of your income.

2548
02:13:13,406 --> 02:13:15,408
When he came to my
and called me a job.

2549
02:13:17,109 --> 02:13:19,745
He asked for an advance of $ 5,000
only ...

2550
02:13:20,012 --> 02:13:22,081
pay for education
your child.

2551
02:13:27,086 --> 02:13:28,287
What did Kimmy?

2552
02:13:28,921 --> 02:13:30,089
We will tell.

2553
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:33,859
I wrote a check.

2554
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:35,995
For $ 25,000.

2555
02:13:38,097 --> 02:13:39,298
Right.

2556
02:13:44,236 --> 02:13:45,304
Do you know why?

2557
02:13:49,508 --> 02:13:50,710
Because I believed in you.

2558
02:13:53,245 --> 02:13:55,014
Because believe you Kimmy.

2559
02:13:56,749 --> 02:14:00,252
Just as I believe in each
of you here.

2560
02:14:00,586 --> 02:14:02,088
I love you Jordan.

2561
02:14:02,254 --> 02:14:03,789
I love you for you.
I love you.

2562
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:05,458
I love you.
So do I.

2563
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:07,293
So do I.

2564
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:11,998
I love you all.

2565
02:14:13,265 --> 02:14:15,368
I love you all.
With all my heart.

2566
02:14:16,569 --> 02:14:17,670
Really.

2567
02:14:31,283 --> 02:14:33,085
For years they've been saying ...

2568
02:14:33,452 --> 02:14:35,321
never accept a non-
for an answer, right?

2569
02:14:36,422 --> 02:14:38,991
Continue pressing,
never hang up the phone.

2570
02:14:39,825 --> 02:14:41,661
Until they get what they want.

2571
02:14:43,195 --> 02:14:44,497
Because they deserve.

2572
02:14:46,666 --> 02:14:48,668
This fucking deal I'll sign.

2573
02:14:50,469 --> 02:14:53,906
I prohibited from participating in the industry
security and Stratton.

2574
02:14:55,641 --> 02:14:56,742
My house.

2575
02:14:59,845 --> 02:15:01,013
What the fuck is that?

2576
02:15:03,249 --> 02:15:04,750
I'll tell you what it is ...

2577
02:15:06,085 --> 02:15:07,820
I'm not taking a
response.

2578
02:15:08,054 --> 02:15:09,055
Do you know?

2579
02:15:10,489 --> 02:15:13,659
They are selling me me.
No backwards.

2580
02:15:15,928 --> 02:15:17,763
I'm being a hypocrite
that's what it is.

2581
02:15:23,869 --> 02:15:24,870
So ...

2582
02:15:31,944 --> 02:15:33,512
You know what?

2583
02:15:37,583 --> 02:15:42,822
I'm not leaving.

2584
02:15:45,291 --> 02:15:46,792
I'm not going!

2585
02:15:50,496 --> 02:15:51,797
Shit.

2586
02:15:55,568 --> 02:15:56,736
The continuous show.

2587
02:15:59,505 --> 02:16:00,673
This is my home.

2588
02:16:01,207 --> 02:16:03,676
They're going to need a killer.

2589
02:16:03,909 --> 02:16:05,678
To get me out of here.

2590
02:16:07,847 --> 02:16:10,416
They will have to send the
national guard

2591
02:16:10,683 --> 02:16:11,917
or a SWAT team.

2592
02:16:12,318 --> 02:16:14,086
Because I will not go anywhere.

2593
02:16:21,127 --> 02:16:22,595
Fuck them.

2594
02:16:58,164 --> 02:16:59,799
Jordan, Jordan.
Come here.

2595
02:17:01,801 --> 02:17:02,868
Hey.

2596
02:17:09,442 --> 02:17:11,777
What's this?
Is the jungle?

2597
02:17:13,913 --> 02:17:16,716
Hi, Irish.

2598
02:17:17,016 --> 02:17:19,885
Jordan Belfort just quit
his dealings with the SEC.

2599
02:17:20,086 --> 02:17:21,988
He is back in the ocean.

2600
02:17:22,254 --> 02:17:23,389
Happy fishing.

2601
02:17:36,235 --> 02:17:38,004
He wanted to
big party.

2602
02:17:38,404 --> 02:17:40,740
Just when Brad left
prison also.

2603
02:17:42,074 --> 02:17:45,344
I apologize, I even offered her
payment for time in prison.

2604
02:17:46,612 --> 02:17:48,280
But I said no,
retired.

2605
02:17:48,914 --> 02:17:50,349
She did not want anything
of us.

2606
02:17:50,616 --> 02:17:54,553
The sad thing is that two years
later he was dead.

2607
02:17:55,888 --> 02:17:57,923
Massive heart attack.
35.

2608
02:17:58,924 --> 02:18:00,526
The age at which
Mozart died.

2609
02:18:01,527 --> 02:18:03,996
Not that I have much in
common but ...

2610
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:06,432
do not know why I said that.

2611
02:18:09,702 --> 02:18:12,071
But within days, the citations
began to arrive.

2612
02:18:12,905 --> 02:18:16,008
They asked for documents, testimony,
what you imagine you.

2613
02:18:16,308 --> 02:18:18,611
Donnie could not drink water
fast enough.

2614
02:18:18,611 --> 02:18:20,346
Do these cops want to send
a subpoena?

2615
02:18:20,446 --> 02:18:23,082
This is what we do with citations
Stratton Oakmont.

2616
02:18:30,089 --> 02:18:32,258
Jedase bastards.
Jedase!

2617
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:34,760
Jedase.
Jedase!

2618
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:45,905
Jordan Belfort.

2619
02:18:46,238 --> 02:18:48,007
Alden is a nice name.

2620
02:18:48,474 --> 02:18:49,575
Thanks for that.

2621
02:18:49,842 --> 02:18:52,011
What kind of name is?
It is my name.

2622
02:18:52,078 --> 02:18:55,581
I do not remember that.

2623
02:18:55,748 --> 02:18:56,849
OK?
Mr. Ming ...

2624
02:18:57,383 --> 02:18:58,651
Thanks for coming.

2625
02:18:58,884 --> 02:18:59,819
Can I have one of those?

2626
02:19:00,319 --> 02:19:01,654
Can I eat?
Go ahead.

2627
02:19:01,921 --> 02:19:02,922
They questioned everyone.

2628
02:19:03,222 --> 02:19:05,057
I was low on sugar.

2629
02:19:05,291 --> 02:19:07,827
Duro months, it was a damn harassment.

2630
02:19:09,996 --> 02:19:12,098
No member was cracked.

2631
02:19:12,331 --> 02:19:13,466
What say?

2632
02:19:14,667 --> 02:19:17,737
Does not sound.
Sorry do not remember.

2633
02:19:17,903 --> 02:19:19,338
Nothing?
No.

2634
02:19:19,472 --> 02:19:21,474
No idea.
I do not remember that transaction.

2635
02:19:21,674 --> 02:19:22,842
Do you have more food?

2636
02:19:23,009 --> 02:19:25,511
Absolutely not.

2637
02:19:25,678 --> 02:19:27,880
Is that what you call
so many times ...

2638
02:19:28,047 --> 02:19:29,181
You should remember.

2639
02:19:29,415 --> 02:19:31,484
Do you remember any of those?

2640
02:19:31,751 --> 02:19:33,753
I do not remember any of it.
Abdul??

2641
02:19:33,919 --> 02:19:35,588
I do not remember.

2642
02:19:35,821 --> 02:19:38,824
It was a long distance call,
Remember?

2643
02:19:39,692 --> 02:19:42,328
We have spoken with several employees
of this firm.

2644
02:19:42,495 --> 02:19:44,864
Nobody remembers anything from the
IPO of Steve Madden.

2645
02:19:46,265 --> 02:19:47,333
It is strange.

2646
02:19:49,001 --> 02:19:50,970
Do you remember anything about that?

2647
02:19:52,905 --> 02:19:54,240
If ...
Do you remember?

2648
02:19:54,507 --> 02:19:55,675
Not at all.

2649
02:19:56,142 --> 02:19:59,011
Sorry, I must ask.
Is that your real hair?

2650
02:19:59,845 --> 02:20:01,080
Will you say something about it?

2651
02:20:01,947 --> 02:20:04,016
Will you comment on my hair?
Would that do?

2652
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:05,451
Personal Questions??

2653
02:20:05,618 --> 02:20:07,119
I wonder why
would use something.

2654
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:12,858
Anything else, gentlemen?

2655
02:20:13,159 --> 02:20:16,629
I have a medical condition that I
asks drink every 15 minutes.

2656
02:20:16,929 --> 02:20:17,997
Please.

2657
02:20:18,264 --> 02:20:21,200
We were told specifically
not to stop the country.

2658
02:20:21,567 --> 02:20:23,569
So we took our
wife to Italy.

2659
02:20:24,170 --> 02:20:27,840
I found it easier to work from there.
Giving orders to Rugrat.

2660
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:29,141
No one could arrest us.

2661
02:20:29,342 --> 02:20:32,011
They could not prove that his way
Stratton from my yacht.

2662
02:20:32,211 --> 02:20:33,679
Hey Rugrat.

2663
02:20:34,013 --> 02:20:36,916
Good morning bald eagle,
How are you?

2664
02:20:36,949 --> 02:20:38,317
Listen.

2665
02:20:38,584 --> 02:20:39,819
We have a problem, okay?
Your friend ...

2666
02:20:39,885 --> 02:20:42,488
Steve Madden is downloading
actions.

2667
02:20:43,322 --> 02:20:44,590
What do you say?
Who told you that?

2668
02:20:44,724 --> 02:20:46,492
What is it?
He's doing.

2669
02:20:46,492 --> 02:20:48,627
Says Steve Madden this
downloading actions.

2670
02:20:48,995 --> 02:20:50,296
Who told you that?
They are nonsense.

2671
02:20:50,696 --> 02:20:51,964
Give me that phone.
Wait ...

2672
02:20:52,131 --> 02:20:53,432
What?

2673
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:54,900
Jordan, listen.

2674
02:20:55,167 --> 02:20:59,205
I see the screen and many actions
Steve they are being sold.

2675
02:20:59,338 --> 02:21:03,175
Not we should be.
He is the only person with such actions.

2676
02:21:03,409 --> 02:21:04,677
Call me back.
Donnie.

2677
02:21:05,344 --> 02:21:07,013
Your little friend
I want to fuck, you know?

2678
02:21:07,179 --> 02:21:09,849
I want to fuck,
Contact him now!

2679
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:11,884
You do not know anything yet,
not jump to conclusions.

2680
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:16,489
Although he owned 85%
your damn business.

2681
02:21:16,756 --> 02:21:19,258
Actions lock your fucking name.

2682
02:21:19,692 --> 02:21:22,194
This fucking knew he was
in trouble with the feds.

2683
02:21:22,428 --> 02:21:23,663
I wanted to take advantage.

2684
02:21:23,863 --> 02:21:25,164
How do you play this?

2685
02:21:25,965 --> 02:21:27,500
Contact customers now.

2686
02:21:27,767 --> 02:21:28,701
Do they sell the shares
Steve Madden.

2687
02:21:28,868 --> 02:21:30,670
We're going down that price,
Do you understand?

2688
02:21:30,970 --> 02:21:33,572
Shut up,
is your fucking friend.

2689
02:21:36,542 --> 02:21:38,077
Will your company
a pink sheet, you know?

2690
02:21:38,678 --> 02:21:40,079
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.

2691
02:21:42,915 --> 02:21:45,718
A fuck it!

2692
02:21:48,321 --> 02:21:49,922
Starts the engine, we're going home.

2693
02:21:54,493 --> 02:21:55,461
Bebe.

2694
02:21:56,095 --> 02:21:57,129
What happened?

2695
02:21:58,497 --> 02:21:59,832
What?

2696
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:02,835
Aunt Emma.

2697
02:22:07,239 --> 02:22:08,708
What is it?
Why are you crying?

2698
02:22:10,343 --> 02:22:12,011
This dead.
Who?

2699
02:22:15,614 --> 02:22:17,016
Aunt Emma is dead.

2700
02:22:18,985 --> 02:22:20,653
Are you kidding?

2701
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:21,954
No.

2702
02:22:22,388 --> 02:22:23,622
Really?

2703
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:27,426
My God, baby.
Shit.

2704
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:29,328
Honey that's ...

2705
02:22:29,495 --> 02:22:30,696
A fucking heart attack.

2706
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:32,531
Life suddenly.

2707
02:22:32,798 --> 02:22:34,500
Eliminated from the face
land.

2708
02:22:34,734 --> 02:22:38,170
$ 20 million
in your bank account in Switzerland.

2709
02:22:38,204 --> 02:22:39,638
She was fine.

2710
02:22:40,039 --> 02:22:41,574
It was getting old.

2711
02:22:41,741 --> 02:22:44,176
God, it's terrible.

2712
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:46,178
Shit.

2713
02:22:46,412 --> 02:22:50,016
It's terrible, was a woman
very attractive.

2714
02:22:50,182 --> 02:22:51,550
My condolences.

2715
02:22:51,751 --> 02:22:53,753
Yes, we are devastated.

2716
02:22:53,919 --> 02:22:55,621
Thanks for your condolences.

2717
02:22:56,155 --> 02:22:58,991
How does that leave us as
Please log exactly?

2718
02:22:59,125 --> 02:23:00,359
What do we do?

2719
02:23:00,593 --> 02:23:02,028
Do not worry.

2720
02:23:02,194 --> 02:23:06,265
Before I die I signed a document
naming you as his successor.

2721
02:23:06,632 --> 02:23:08,300
Did it!

2722
02:23:08,501 --> 02:23:10,369
Fantastic,
that's good news.

2723
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:12,872
Well, that's not all.

2724
02:23:13,205 --> 02:23:14,707
What do you mean?

2725
02:23:18,010 --> 02:23:20,546
I can not hear you, I have bad reception.

2726
02:23:20,746 --> 02:23:21,847
Do you speak English?

2727
02:23:22,381 --> 02:23:24,483
Very fast, fast.

2728
02:23:24,917 --> 02:23:26,085
Should I go to Switzerland now?

2729
02:23:28,654 --> 02:23:30,723
Speaks English,
dammit.

2730
02:23:30,756 --> 02:23:31,991
Quiet, ok?

2731
02:23:32,258 --> 02:23:34,760
Go get your suit and get your ass.

2732
02:23:34,927 --> 02:23:36,295
Please.
Ok.

2733
02:23:36,362 --> 02:23:37,963
Wear my ass, yes.

2734
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:41,534
I must say that these Swiss were
a slippery bastards.

2735
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:45,671
In a few minutes I contact a scammer
I faked signature Aunt Emma.

2736
02:23:45,838 --> 02:23:47,340
American shit.

2737
02:23:47,673 --> 02:23:49,175
Just had to get there
morning.

2738
02:23:49,675 --> 02:23:51,210
O lost $ 20 million.

2739
02:23:51,444 --> 02:23:52,912
We're going to Monaco.

2740
02:23:53,679 --> 02:23:55,181
Monaco??
Now?

2741
02:23:55,381 --> 02:23:58,084
We're going to Monaco
for Switzerland, ok?

2742
02:23:58,484 --> 02:23:59,819
His aunt just died.

2743
02:24:00,119 --> 02:24:02,822
I understand but I must go
Switzerland now for business.

2744
02:24:03,222 --> 02:24:05,124
Nothing to discuss, sorry.
They are businesses.

2745
02:24:05,725 --> 02:24:07,326
We must go to London.

2746
02:24:08,027 --> 02:24:09,428
Why?
Why?

2747
02:24:10,930 --> 02:24:12,365
Does he funeral?
Love ..

2748
02:24:12,631 --> 02:24:13,632
Look ...

2749
02:24:14,333 --> 02:24:16,702
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the world.

2750
02:24:16,902 --> 02:24:17,970
Really I do.

2751
02:24:19,505 --> 02:24:20,673
But she's dead now
honey.

2752
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,808
Is dead and not anger
anywhere.

2753
02:24:23,209 --> 02:24:25,611
Even when life will continue
get to London, right?

2754
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,847
Captain Ted.

2755
02:24:28,381 --> 02:24:29,849
We're going to Monaco, ok?

2756
02:24:30,049 --> 02:24:31,717
A Monaco.
We're going to Monaco.

2757
02:24:31,751 --> 02:24:34,487
So we go to Switzerland and
do not ask us passport.

2758
02:24:34,587 --> 02:24:36,489
We take care of business.
We return to Monaco.

2759
02:24:36,489 --> 02:24:38,424
We will air the funeral.

2760
02:24:38,658 --> 02:24:40,660
We returned to New York in
3 business days, that's the plan.

2761
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:43,429
I wanted to say that perhaps
we meet storm.

2762
02:24:43,496 --> 02:24:45,765
Storm??
Can we handle it right?

2763
02:24:46,032 --> 02:24:47,333
It is a 175 foot yacht.

2764
02:24:47,566 --> 02:24:49,702
We're not going anywhere unless
he says it is safe.

2765
02:24:49,969 --> 02:24:51,003
Are you okay?
It is safe.

2766
02:24:51,203 --> 02:24:52,638
You know nothing about storms.

2767
02:24:52,838 --> 02:24:54,140
Really?
Your if?

2768
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:57,209
You're an expert.
Torment your credit card.

2769
02:24:57,777 --> 02:24:59,845
Okay, believe me.
All right.

2770
02:24:59,879 --> 02:25:01,347
Captain Ted Is it okay?

2771
02:25:03,049 --> 02:25:04,817
If we're slowly ...

2772
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:07,787
go slowly, they are uncomfortable.
Tell him that it is safe.

2773
02:25:07,953 --> 02:25:11,157
We'll be fine,
hatches closed.

2774
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:12,692
We ensure the cover.

2775
02:25:13,793 --> 02:25:16,262
Maybe they break
some dishes.

2776
02:25:16,529 --> 02:25:17,797
Piper.

2777
02:25:17,963 --> 02:25:18,998
That's nothing.

2778
02:25:19,165 --> 02:25:20,499
Is not it amazing?
No.

2779
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,968
Not really.
The pass well.

2780
02:25:23,169 --> 02:25:24,670
We will now Monaco.

2781
02:25:24,837 --> 02:25:26,339
Go!

2782
02:25:36,048 --> 02:25:37,917
What the fuck happened?

2783
02:25:38,784 --> 02:25:41,387
The Jet Ski fell
overboard.

2784
02:25:41,487 --> 02:25:43,322
Jesus Christ.

2785
02:25:45,925 --> 02:25:48,594
Is forming a wave
25 feet tall.

2786
02:25:48,694 --> 02:25:50,429
Let's go to the other side.

2787
02:25:50,529 --> 02:25:51,630
We can not.
Why?

2788
02:25:51,964 --> 02:25:54,266
We risk
turn us.

2789
02:25:54,467 --> 02:25:56,202
I am a professional diver.
Do you hear me?

2790
02:25:56,302 --> 02:25:58,504
I am a professional diver,
nobody will die.

2791
02:25:58,904 --> 02:26:00,339
I have you baby.

2792
02:26:00,506 --> 02:26:01,540
Trust me, okay?

2793
02:26:01,741 --> 02:26:02,842
I love you.

2794
02:26:03,075 --> 02:26:04,510
I love you, hold me tightly.

2795
02:26:06,245 --> 02:26:07,346
Donnie.

2796
02:26:08,681 --> 02:26:09,882
Hold on.

2797
02:26:10,016 --> 02:26:11,183
Donnie.

2798
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:15,054
Donnie!
What?

2799
02:26:16,055 --> 02:26:17,289
What the fuck?

2800
02:26:17,490 --> 02:26:20,026
Going to die, I did many
bad things.

2801
02:26:20,192 --> 02:26:21,427
I'm going to hell Jordan.

2802
02:26:21,761 --> 02:26:24,130
I messed up,
I did very badly.

2803
02:26:24,497 --> 02:26:26,599
Go to the room below.

2804
02:26:27,033 --> 02:26:28,167
What?

2805
02:26:30,903 --> 02:26:32,338
View by Ludes.

2806
02:26:32,571 --> 02:26:34,807
There can be 3 feet
water down there.

2807
02:26:35,074 --> 02:26:37,843
I will not die sober.

2808
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:39,578
Go get the damn Ludes.

2809
02:26:40,046 --> 02:26:41,280
Ok.
Go!

2810
02:26:41,414 --> 02:26:42,515
Ok.

2811
02:26:45,318 --> 02:26:46,819
Where are you going?
Hold on baby.

2812
02:26:46,952 --> 02:26:48,921
Donnie, are you crazy?

2813
02:27:02,335 --> 02:27:03,736
Jesus Christ.

2814
02:27:05,671 --> 02:27:07,840
Get away from the window.

2815
02:27:14,747 --> 02:27:16,015
I have them, I do.

2816
02:27:41,507 --> 02:27:43,509
Best of rescue
by Italian.

2817
02:27:44,010 --> 02:27:46,712
Are you fed,
do you drink red wine.

2818
02:27:47,847 --> 02:27:49,015
Then you dance.

2819
02:28:06,465 --> 02:28:07,800
Did you see that?

2820
02:28:08,534 --> 02:28:10,803
That was the plane that I sent
to rescue us.

2821
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:15,675
Do not lie to them, I explode
when the sea entered his motor.

2822
02:28:15,941 --> 02:28:17,343
3 people died.

2823
02:28:22,048 --> 02:28:23,582
It was a sign from God.

2824
02:28:24,183 --> 02:28:26,252
After all
finally got the message.

2825
02:28:32,792 --> 02:28:35,661
Do you dream of financial independence?

2826
02:28:36,095 --> 02:28:38,597
But do you have all the problems
months by paying your bills?

2827
02:28:38,998 --> 02:28:42,668
Do you want a house like that,
but you can not pay the rent?

2828
02:28:43,169 --> 02:28:44,570
My name is Jordan Belfort.

2829
02:28:45,037 --> 02:28:46,973
There is no secret to being rich.

2830
02:28:47,139 --> 02:28:49,608
No matter who you are
or where you come from.

2831
02:28:49,809 --> 02:28:53,713
You can too
in a few months.

2832
02:28:54,213 --> 02:28:56,415
You only need
strategy.

2833
02:28:56,682 --> 02:28:58,117
When he was 24.

2834
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:01,887
I needed a way not only
survive but to thrive.

2835
02:29:02,154 --> 02:29:04,490
At first I thought this
kind of thing possible.

2836
02:29:04,657 --> 02:29:07,860
But we have house and a
profit of $ 33,000.

2837
02:29:07,927 --> 02:29:09,428
Now if you think so.

2838
02:29:09,662 --> 02:29:10,763
Think a moment.

2839
02:29:10,997 --> 02:29:14,667
But have the guts to go
Jordan Belfort's seminar.

2840
02:29:15,368 --> 02:29:16,802
So as they want
make money?

2841
02:29:17,036 --> 02:29:18,571
You'll be a millionaire
someday.

2842
02:29:18,704 --> 02:29:20,306
Go ahead, make the decision.

2843
02:29:20,673 --> 02:29:22,074
He method Jordan Belfort
started working for me.

2844
02:29:22,241 --> 02:29:23,509
Why work hard for that.

2845
02:29:23,576 --> 02:29:24,844
But it works for you.

2846
02:29:25,344 --> 02:29:27,613
It's because you're lazy and you should
Mc Donalds trabajaren.

2847
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:30,116
Nothing prohibits you from
financial freedom.

2848
02:29:30,683 --> 02:29:32,985
Nobody stops to make millions.

2849
02:29:33,219 --> 02:29:35,921
Do not sit at home
with a lifetime of dreams.

2850
02:29:36,155 --> 02:29:37,790
Because that is just.

2851
02:29:40,459 --> 02:29:43,963
Change the lives of all these people,
I can do it with you too.

2852
02:29:43,996 --> 02:29:45,164
Come to my seminar.

2853
02:29:45,331 --> 02:29:46,465
We will take something ...

2854
02:29:48,501 --> 02:29:49,502
You're under arrest.

2855
02:29:49,835 --> 02:29:51,070
You must be joking.

2856
02:29:52,405 --> 02:29:54,373
Hey.

2857
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:55,641
Away from me.

2858
02:29:55,908 --> 02:29:57,009
Turn that camera.

2859
02:29:57,243 --> 02:30:00,079
I'm shooting a commercial,
bastards.

2860
02:30:00,379 --> 02:30:02,181
Turn off the camera.

2861
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:07,420
Jedase, I'm making money.
Pieces of shit.

2862
02:30:07,586 --> 02:30:10,256
Jordan will give you legal advice.

2863
02:30:10,656 --> 02:30:11,957
Shut the fuck up.

2864
02:30:12,325 --> 02:30:14,293
Fuck you asshole.

2865
02:30:18,764 --> 02:30:20,833
I leave the bullshit,
I went to rehab.

2866
02:30:20,933 --> 02:30:23,636
I am a TV personality.
Sober for 2 years.

2867
02:30:23,736 --> 02:30:24,870
And this happens.

2868
02:30:25,338 --> 02:30:27,573
Rugrat was arrested in Miami.

2869
02:30:28,841 --> 02:30:30,743
Guess who?
Saurel.

2870
02:30:30,876 --> 02:30:32,011
Are you going to hit me?
No sir.

2871
02:30:32,244 --> 02:30:33,346
I know your country.

2872
02:30:34,613 --> 02:30:35,881
What are the odds?

2873
02:30:36,015 --> 02:30:38,651
There are about 10,000 bankers
in Geneva.

2874
02:30:38,784 --> 02:30:42,288
But Rugrat elect the idiot who
moves arrest in America.

2875
02:30:48,094 --> 02:30:51,631
The worst was arrested
for things that did not involve me.

2876
02:30:51,998 --> 02:30:53,466
Nothing to do with me!

2877
02:30:53,833 --> 02:30:57,470
Something about money laundering
through boat races.

2878
02:30:57,703 --> 02:30:59,038
With a guy Rocky Aoki.

2879
02:30:59,205 --> 02:31:00,539
You know, the founder
Benihana.

2880
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:02,375
Benihana.

2881
02:31:02,675 --> 02:31:04,043
The Benihana cursed.

2882
02:31:04,744 --> 02:31:06,412
Benihana Damn!

2883
02:31:06,946 --> 02:31:08,914
Why?
Why God?

2884
02:31:09,215 --> 02:31:13,219
Why were you so cruel
email to a Japanese restaurant

2885
02:31:13,252 --> 02:31:14,654
to make me fall?

2886
02:31:17,123 --> 02:31:19,191
The short story is that
Saurel betrays me.

2887
02:31:19,592 --> 02:31:21,527
But not before ratting
Brad's wife.

2888
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:22,828
Chantelle.

2889
02:31:22,962 --> 02:31:25,831
Who is picked
every time I went to Switzerland.

2890
02:31:38,711 --> 02:31:40,446
2 counts of fraud
security.

2891
02:31:41,013 --> 02:31:43,916
1 count of conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

2892
02:31:44,583 --> 02:31:46,619
21 counts of money laundering.

2893
02:31:47,253 --> 02:31:48,754
1 count of obstruction
of justice.

2894
02:31:50,589 --> 02:31:52,491
Bail is set at
$ 10 million.

2895
02:32:08,174 --> 02:32:10,276
Uncle Donnie is here.

2896
02:32:10,576 --> 02:32:11,677
Rocky!

2897
02:32:11,911 --> 02:32:12,912
How are you?

2898
02:32:13,379 --> 02:32:15,348
Lobo, I hate that dog.

2899
02:32:15,848 --> 02:32:16,882
Yes.

2900
02:32:17,083 --> 02:32:19,485
It's getting old
is in the house.

2901
02:32:19,785 --> 02:32:20,987
You too.

2902
02:32:22,288 --> 02:32:23,923
Shit.
Good to see you friend.

2903
02:32:24,657 --> 02:32:25,825
It's good.

2904
02:32:30,496 --> 02:32:31,497
How are you friend?

2905
02:32:32,865 --> 02:32:33,966
You know.

2906
02:32:34,133 --> 02:32:35,201
It sucks man.

2907
02:32:35,968 --> 02:32:37,236
But I'm holding.

2908
02:32:39,572 --> 02:32:41,207
Look at this piece of jewelry.

2909
02:32:42,074 --> 02:32:43,676
I can not leave the house,
You know?

2910
02:32:44,543 --> 02:32:46,545
I'm turning crazy already.

2911
02:32:47,513 --> 02:32:48,881
Cursed Rugrat.

2912
02:32:49,882 --> 02:32:52,918
That fag, I can not believe it.
OMG.

2913
02:32:53,219 --> 02:32:54,820
I swear I want to hang him
to death.

2914
02:32:56,255 --> 02:32:57,790
Irresponsible idiot.

2915
02:32:58,758 --> 02:32:59,859
Tell you what.

2916
02:33:01,594 --> 02:33:03,496
I'll never eat
a Benihana again.

2917
02:33:05,264 --> 02:33:06,866
I do not care who
is the birthday.

2918
02:33:08,968 --> 02:33:10,069
How is Naomi?
How are you?

2919
02:33:11,304 --> 02:33:14,206
It's in the house if you want to say hello
but maybe not answer.

2920
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:15,908
Naomi, sweetness.

2921
02:33:20,012 --> 02:33:21,681
Are you mad at me?

2922
02:33:21,914 --> 02:33:25,484
No, you know ... had to
take out a mortgage to pay bail.

2923
02:33:26,052 --> 02:33:29,121
Maybe sell things for
pay the lawyers.

2924
02:33:30,156 --> 02:33:32,058
It has been a nightmare friend
it's the truth.

2925
02:33:32,992 --> 02:33:33,993
What can I do, right?

2926
02:33:35,261 --> 02:33:37,630
Anyway, how does this Stratton?
That's more important.

2927
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:38,998
How's the moral?

2928
02:33:38,998 --> 02:33:41,500
Are they upset because they have to
make legal money now?

2929
02:33:41,801 --> 02:33:42,802
Jordan.

2930
02:33:43,169 --> 02:33:45,237
I met members
founders.

2931
02:33:46,238 --> 02:33:47,807
They talk about to do.

2932
02:33:49,442 --> 02:33:50,676
I support you.

2933
02:33:51,711 --> 02:33:52,778
What do you mean?

2934
02:33:53,779 --> 02:33:55,748
The house, the money, do not worry.
I support you.

2935
02:34:03,789 --> 02:34:05,891
You're my friend, you know you
do for you, right?

2936
02:34:06,258 --> 02:34:08,160
Do you know it?
I know.

2937
02:34:09,962 --> 02:34:11,163
I can kiss you friend.
Okay, enough.

2938
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:12,598
Basta.

2939
02:34:14,333 --> 02:34:15,368
Want a beer friend?

2940
02:34:15,501 --> 02:34:16,736
What do you drink?

2941
02:34:17,003 --> 02:34:18,838
Shit without alcohol.

2942
02:34:19,171 --> 02:34:21,574
What's that?
A non-alcoholic beer.

2943
02:34:21,741 --> 02:34:23,175
It has no alcohol.

2944
02:34:23,442 --> 02:34:25,244
Are you a beer?
If no alcohol.

2945
02:34:26,178 --> 02:34:29,281
But if you take the sufficient
you get drunk?

2946
02:34:29,515 --> 02:34:31,751
No alcohol
that's the point.

2947
02:34:32,151 --> 02:34:34,153
I do not understand that
talk shit.

2948
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:35,755
I have beer
if you want.

2949
02:34:35,921 --> 02:34:37,223
I no longer drink, remember?

2950
02:34:38,224 --> 02:34:39,292
I do not drink.

2951
02:34:39,492 --> 02:34:41,661
Want to come and suck
lines of dust?

2952
02:34:43,763 --> 02:34:46,098
I can not imagine paradise
not drunk himself to death.

2953
02:34:46,198 --> 02:34:47,533
If ...
I love it.

2954
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:49,001
What is sober?

2955
02:34:49,235 --> 02:34:51,237
It's horrible.
Boring, right?

2956
02:34:51,504 --> 02:34:53,139
Too, I want to kill myself.

2957
02:34:54,407 --> 02:34:58,778
There is a term we use less
circumstances dictate

2958
02:34:58,911 --> 02:35:00,513
I think that applies to this case.

2959
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:01,914
The term is Granada.

2960
02:35:02,048 --> 02:35:04,383
Have you heard about Granada?
No.

2961
02:35:04,583 --> 02:35:05,985
It is very interesting because ...

2962
02:35:06,419 --> 02:35:10,656
It was a nation in an invaded island
by the American government.

2963
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:12,158
In 1933.

2964
02:35:12,291 --> 02:35:13,459
Almost 90,000 people.

2965
02:35:14,126 --> 02:35:17,196
What it means
is essentially ...

2966
02:35:17,296 --> 02:35:18,698
That this case can not be missed.

2967
02:35:19,532 --> 02:35:21,000
OK?, So ...

2968
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:24,036
We can insult,
show many things.

2969
02:35:24,203 --> 02:35:25,338
Nobody cares.

2970
02:35:25,571 --> 02:35:26,572
I will win.

2971
02:35:27,139 --> 02:35:29,508
You sir ...

2972
02:35:30,109 --> 02:35:31,277
This lost.

2973
02:35:32,845 --> 02:35:34,080
As was Granada.

2974
02:35:37,249 --> 02:35:39,819
He faces time
real in prison.

2975
02:35:40,586 --> 02:35:42,822
It can launder money
get up to 20 years.

2976
02:35:43,956 --> 02:35:48,427
Our case could not be stronger
even if we can find a more evidence.

2977
02:35:48,594 --> 02:35:50,029
All right.

2978
02:35:50,296 --> 02:35:51,697
Hey Jordan.

2979
02:35:51,998 --> 02:35:53,099
Jordan.

2980
02:35:53,666 --> 02:35:56,836
You're going to rot in jail until
your kids out of jail.

2981
02:35:57,236 --> 02:35:58,971
That is not our ambition.

2982
02:36:00,373 --> 02:36:02,308
There are other people
also involved.

2983
02:36:02,842 --> 02:36:05,511
We believe they should see
the court also.

2984
02:36:08,881 --> 02:36:10,683
Because I'm an Offer
in the air?

2985
02:36:10,883 --> 02:36:12,318
Look, it has a smell.

2986
02:36:12,652 --> 02:36:13,653
What race are you?

2987
02:36:14,887 --> 02:36:17,790
Full cooperation.
It gives a detailed list

2988
02:36:17,957 --> 02:36:21,494
of all conspirators.
Also used a microphone.

2989
02:36:23,629 --> 02:36:25,298
You said you use a microphone?

2990
02:36:25,331 --> 02:36:26,432
Microphone.

2991
02:36:26,832 --> 02:36:28,901
What does that mean?
Want to rat?

2992
02:36:29,201 --> 02:36:30,870
Is that what it says?
No, I want you to cooperate.

2993
02:36:31,003 --> 02:36:33,339
No, he wants to rat.
If we want to rat.

2994
02:36:33,506 --> 02:36:35,508
That is exactly
what we want.

2995
02:36:35,641 --> 02:36:36,842
To rat.

2996
02:36:41,247 --> 02:36:42,682
How was the party
Cristy?

2997
02:36:43,082 --> 02:36:44,283
Right.

2998
02:36:44,583 --> 02:36:45,618
What good.

2999
02:36:47,053 --> 02:36:48,988
Baby talk to lawyers
again today.

3000
02:36:49,588 --> 02:36:51,791
I have very good news.

3001
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:55,695
These safe.

3002
02:36:57,863 --> 02:36:58,998
I knew that.

3003
02:36:59,432 --> 02:37:00,666
Yes, exactly.

3004
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,035
Never do anything wrong
to start. Right?

3005
02:37:05,004 --> 02:37:08,507
Apparently everything the FBI
want from me

3006
02:37:08,641 --> 02:37:11,177
is to cooperate.

3007
02:37:13,245 --> 02:37:16,248
I have so much information on stock market
and Wall Street that I can

3008
02:37:16,515 --> 02:37:19,151
save the government years
problems, not to mention

3009
02:37:19,585 --> 02:37:20,653
countless dollars.

3010
02:37:23,222 --> 02:37:24,490
It even gets better baby.

3011
02:37:25,057 --> 02:37:27,126
Because if I decide to cooperate.

3012
02:37:27,693 --> 02:37:30,363
They only give me 4 years.

3013
02:37:31,163 --> 02:37:33,799
In this case we can
start from scratch.

3014
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,468
Maybe sell the house.

3015
02:37:35,668 --> 02:37:39,138
Any fines payable
will be after prison.

3016
02:37:39,372 --> 02:37:41,507
So there will be enough
money left over, you know?

3017
02:37:44,243 --> 02:37:47,279
The only thing that annoyed me
this is a bit small

3018
02:37:47,413 --> 02:37:49,248
thought of having to ...

3019
02:37:49,548 --> 02:37:51,584
give information
about my friends.

3020
02:37:51,784 --> 02:37:53,919
Like you said, no friends
on Wall Street.

3021
02:37:54,987 --> 02:37:56,222
Right.

3022
02:37:56,322 --> 02:37:58,891
Exactly, I thought so too fondly because

3023
02:37:58,991 --> 02:38:00,493
said eventually ...

3024
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:03,162
everyone will have to give
information in this case.

3025
02:38:03,329 --> 02:38:05,431
Maybe at the end of the day even
be a factor.

3026
02:38:05,698 --> 02:38:07,333
You know.
This is good news.

3027
02:38:08,034 --> 02:38:09,068
Right?
Yes.

3028
02:38:09,201 --> 02:38:10,303
Yes.

3029
02:38:10,536 --> 02:38:11,804
I'm happy for you.

3030
02:38:15,007 --> 02:38:16,208
What do you mean?

3031
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:19,412
You should be happy
both.

3032
02:38:19,912 --> 02:38:21,047
Right?
Yes, of course.

3033
02:38:21,847 --> 02:38:22,948
Right.

3034
02:38:24,784 --> 02:38:25,751
Come here honey.

3035
02:38:31,924 --> 02:38:32,992
No. ..
Please.

3036
02:38:33,292 --> 02:38:35,161
Jordan enough.

3037
02:38:35,328 --> 02:38:36,462
No, Jordan enough.

3038
02:38:45,004 --> 02:38:46,472
I hate Jordan.

3039
02:38:46,906 --> 02:38:48,307
Download.
Bebe ...

3040
02:38:48,674 --> 02:38:49,842
Do not do that.

3041
02:38:50,609 --> 02:38:51,944
You know how much I love you,
Right?

3042
02:38:52,778 --> 02:38:54,680
Stop saying that
please.

3043
02:39:00,319 --> 02:39:02,054
Do you want to fuck Jordan?

3044
02:39:04,590 --> 02:39:06,158
Do you want to fuck me?

3045
02:39:07,159 --> 02:39:08,995
Ok, do it.

3046
02:39:10,029 --> 02:39:11,597
Go ahead and do it.

3047
02:39:12,999 --> 02:39:15,167
I want you to fuck me
very strong.

3048
02:39:15,568 --> 02:39:18,404
I want you to do as
if it were the last time.

3049
02:39:18,671 --> 02:39:20,006
What are you doing?
Do it baby.

3050
02:39:20,339 --> 02:39:22,008
I want you to do baby.

3051
02:39:22,308 --> 02:39:23,409
We will.

3052
02:39:23,676 --> 02:39:24,844
Do it baby.

3053
02:39:25,511 --> 02:39:28,114
I want you to do as
if it were the last time.

3054
02:39:28,581 --> 02:39:29,582
Yes.

3055
02:39:33,552 --> 02:39:34,720
Yeah?
Yes.

3056
02:39:39,825 --> 02:39:40,960
Would you do it?
Yes.

3057
02:39:45,598 --> 02:39:46,666
OMG.
Bebe ...

3058
02:39:47,366 --> 02:39:53,673
God ...

3059
02:39:55,741 --> 02:39:56,842
Yes.

3060
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:03,683
Drink that was great.

3061
02:40:04,684 --> 02:40:05,751
God.

3062
02:40:08,220 --> 02:40:09,422
That was the last time.

3063
02:40:10,623 --> 02:40:12,091
What do you mean?

3064
02:40:12,291 --> 02:40:14,427
That was the last time
we have sex.

3065
02:40:16,862 --> 02:40:17,863
What are you talking about?

3066
02:40:20,666 --> 02:40:21,867
I want a divorce.

3067
02:40:24,370 --> 02:40:26,572
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

3068
02:40:26,839 --> 02:40:28,074
What do you divorce?

3069
02:40:28,174 --> 02:40:29,508
Let me go, I want a divorce.

3070
02:40:29,942 --> 02:40:31,510
Get off me.
You just make love.

3071
02:40:31,777 --> 02:40:34,280
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I no longer love you Jordan.

3072
02:40:36,182 --> 02:40:39,819
Do not you love me?

3073
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:42,588
Is not that convenient for you?

3074
02:40:42,788 --> 02:40:46,492
Now that I'm fucking with the Feds
and a bracelet on my ankle.

3075
02:40:46,659 --> 02:40:48,194
Now you decide that you no longer love me.

3076
02:40:48,494 --> 02:40:49,595
Is it right?
No.

3077
02:40:50,596 --> 02:40:51,664
What kind of person are you?

3078
02:40:52,365 --> 02:40:53,766
Tell me.
You married me.

3079
02:40:54,266 --> 02:40:55,401
What does that mean?

3080
02:40:55,635 --> 02:40:56,969
Jordan, so things will be.

3081
02:40:57,336 --> 02:40:59,038
I'll stay with the children.

3082
02:40:59,872 --> 02:41:01,474
If you agree to divorce
right now.

3083
02:41:01,674 --> 02:41:03,109
I will allow visits.

3084
02:41:03,409 --> 02:41:04,744
OK?, Not fight.

3085
02:41:05,277 --> 02:41:06,746
We save a lot of money.

3086
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:08,247
I feel that you'll need.

3087
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:13,319
You're not taking my children,
You hear me?

3088
02:41:14,553 --> 02:41:15,721
Now talk to my lawyer.

3089
02:41:15,821 --> 02:41:17,089
Although you do not condemn.

3090
02:41:17,323 --> 02:41:18,424
I have a good chance
to stay with them.

3091
02:41:18,724 --> 02:41:21,093
I have news for you,
not sticking with my children.

3092
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:22,795
Ambitious fucking whore.

3093
02:41:23,429 --> 02:41:25,264
Fuck you fucking bitch.

3094
02:41:25,431 --> 02:41:28,167
You're not taking my children,
You hear me?

3095
02:41:28,467 --> 02:41:31,070
Fuck you, you're not taking
my children.

3096
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:42,682
Bitch.

3097
02:41:45,418 --> 02:41:46,485
Damn bitch.

3098
02:41:50,923 --> 02:41:53,159
Fucking bitch,
piece of shit.

3099
02:42:03,469 --> 02:42:04,570
Look Jordan.

3100
02:42:05,671 --> 02:42:06,672
Sick.

3101
02:42:06,906 --> 02:42:08,174
These sick.
Fuck you!

3102
02:42:08,541 --> 02:42:10,343
You're not taking my kids.

3103
02:42:10,576 --> 02:42:12,345
Want that fails you?

3104
02:42:12,745 --> 02:42:14,013
Look at yourself.

3105
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,348
You know what they said
my lawyer?

3106
02:42:15,348 --> 02:42:18,618
They said they will go to jail
for 20 years, Jordan.

3107
02:42:18,884 --> 02:42:20,252
20 fucking years.

3108
02:42:20,419 --> 02:42:22,321
Never really over.

3109
02:42:22,488 --> 02:42:25,291
Do not you think?
Do not allow it!

3110
02:42:25,491 --> 02:42:27,760
Did not see you again?

3111
02:42:27,793 --> 02:42:29,428
Do not you dare touch them.

3112
02:42:30,663 --> 02:42:32,098
Do not touch me.

3113
02:42:34,266 --> 02:42:35,468
Sweetness.

3114
02:42:35,568 --> 02:42:37,370
You come to Daddy, okay?

3115
02:42:37,570 --> 02:42:38,904
Come to daddy.

3116
02:42:42,541 --> 02:42:44,410
Do not do Jordan.

3117
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:46,912
I swear I'll kill you.

3118
02:42:49,615 --> 02:42:51,584
It is well sweetie.

3119
02:42:52,151 --> 02:42:53,919
Let's take a trip, okay?

3120
02:42:53,986 --> 02:42:55,421
A journey together.

3121
02:43:04,130 --> 02:43:05,331
Buckle up.

3122
02:43:05,665 --> 02:43:08,467
I told you to take with me.

3123
02:43:08,701 --> 02:43:09,835
Damn bitch.

3124
02:43:09,969 --> 02:43:11,070
You will not stop me.

3125
02:43:11,203 --> 02:43:12,338
You will not.

3126
02:43:13,539 --> 02:43:15,074
A trip fondly.

3127
02:43:16,542 --> 02:43:17,610
Do not.

3128
02:43:18,110 --> 02:43:19,512
Back up.

3129
02:43:21,547 --> 02:43:22,848
Violet sees the door.

3130
02:43:23,215 --> 02:43:24,216
Mami.

3131
02:43:24,583 --> 02:43:26,652
Get out of here.
I'll kill you.

3132
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,988
Mami.

3133
02:43:32,558 --> 02:43:33,659
No!

3134
02:43:42,001 --> 02:43:44,370
God.
God help me.

3135
02:43:48,307 --> 02:43:49,909
Mami.
Honey, it's okay.

3136
02:43:50,509 --> 02:43:51,677
Mami.

3137
02:43:54,013 --> 02:43:55,081
Mami.
Honey.

3138
02:43:56,449 --> 02:43:59,285
Are you okay?

3139
02:43:59,952 --> 02:44:01,420
What is it?

3140
02:44:01,787 --> 02:44:03,089
Are you okay?

3141
02:44:22,575 --> 02:44:23,776
Speak normally.

3142
02:44:27,413 --> 02:44:28,547
Breathe normally.

3143
02:44:31,817 --> 02:44:34,220
In 5 minutes you forget
that what you're wearing.

3144
02:44:35,988 --> 02:44:37,056
Damn.

3145
02:44:37,590 --> 02:44:38,658
Shot.

3146
02:44:38,724 --> 02:44:42,495
The offender must not commit or
attempting to commit future crimes.

3147
02:44:42,762 --> 02:44:45,965
Please let me signs
damn thing once.

3148
02:44:46,198 --> 02:44:47,266
Thank you.

3149
02:44:50,970 --> 02:44:52,872
Right here?
That will do.

3150
02:44:55,374 --> 02:44:57,376
Thank you.
It was not an option.

3151
02:44:59,078 --> 02:45:01,514
Over the next 6 hours.
I made a list.

3152
02:45:02,014 --> 02:45:04,717
Friends, enemies.
Business partners.

3153
02:45:05,251 --> 02:45:08,788
Everyone who knew me or
received a court action.

3154
02:45:16,329 --> 02:45:17,964
Lobito Lobito.

3155
02:45:18,764 --> 02:45:20,333
The first name
of the list.

3156
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:22,335
It was Donnie.

3157
02:45:24,036 --> 02:45:26,839
Jordan, you know how good
are you back in the office?

3158
02:45:27,707 --> 02:45:29,442
Is not the same when there are.

3159
02:45:29,575 --> 02:45:31,777
It's sad, do you understand?

3160
02:45:32,044 --> 02:45:33,179
Damn Steve Madden, right?

3161
02:45:34,447 --> 02:45:36,048
I can not not think about it, you know?

3162
02:45:36,182 --> 02:45:38,150
Each time you do
my blood boil.

3163
02:45:38,417 --> 02:45:39,752
I can not even say his name.

3164
02:45:39,952 --> 02:45:42,888
It's disgusting, I grew
with this guy.

3165
02:45:42,989 --> 02:45:44,123
Why do this?

3166
02:45:45,725 --> 02:45:48,861
Do any you know something about ...

3167
02:45:48,995 --> 02:45:50,529
that account?

3168
02:45:50,963 --> 02:45:52,365
Do not incriminate,
Wear a microphone.

3169
02:45:56,802 --> 02:45:59,038
You know they were $ 4 or $ 5 million, right?

3170
02:45:59,839 --> 02:46:02,341
They had to give me those dividends.

3171
02:46:08,948 --> 02:46:11,717
Jordan was drunk ...

3172
02:46:11,917 --> 02:46:13,653
If of course, stupid.

3173
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,456
If they call you,
be sure to contact me.

3174
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:18,758
OK?

3175
02:46:19,825 --> 02:46:21,627
Course.

3176
02:46:21,861 --> 02:46:23,095
Yes.
Course.

3177
02:46:28,167 --> 02:46:29,835
Will you eat the last piece?

3178
02:46:31,504 --> 02:46:32,872
It's all yours.

3179
02:46:34,073 --> 02:46:35,141
Thank you.

3180
02:46:37,910 --> 02:46:39,412
So ...

3181
02:46:42,348 --> 02:46:43,449
How is this Naomi?

3182
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:45,651
You know how it is.

3183
02:46:45,952 --> 02:46:47,320
I hate death.

3184
02:46:49,789 --> 02:46:50,790
How about you?

3185
02:46:52,124 --> 02:46:53,459
She still lives so ...

3186
02:46:53,626 --> 02:46:55,294
my life is fucked.

3187
02:46:56,028 --> 02:46:57,029
Yes.

3188
02:47:03,836 --> 02:47:05,071
Mr. Jordan.

3189
02:47:06,839 --> 02:47:08,307
Mr. Jordan, you have a visitor.

3190
02:47:09,408 --> 02:47:10,676
What?

3191
02:47:10,876 --> 02:47:12,178
You have a visitor.

3192
02:47:28,427 --> 02:47:29,829
I need to get dressed.

3193
02:47:30,329 --> 02:47:31,931
Why?
What?

3194
02:47:37,570 --> 02:47:38,671
Going to jail.

3195
02:47:52,718 --> 02:47:53,953
I'll wear clothes.

3196
02:47:54,220 --> 02:47:55,454
We will help you with that.

3197
02:48:05,498 --> 02:48:06,499
Ok.

3198
02:48:18,744 --> 02:48:19,845
FBI.

3199
02:48:20,346 --> 02:48:23,182
Sit down, show their hands
and shut up.

3200
02:48:26,152 --> 02:48:27,219
Get your damn hands.

3201
02:48:43,002 --> 02:48:44,370
The dress is Chanel!

3202
02:48:57,450 --> 02:48:58,918
Give everyone.

3203
02:48:59,552 --> 02:49:04,657
In return I was given three years in Nevada.
In a space that neither knew existed.

3204
02:49:07,627 --> 02:49:09,528
As my father said 'Mad Max'

3205
02:49:10,363 --> 02:49:12,331
Someday will come the consequences.

3206
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:16,168
Apparently I was right.

3207
02:49:20,673 --> 02:49:23,409
I think we can agree that
Mr. Belfort behaved well.

3208
02:49:23,609 --> 02:49:25,578
In cooperation finish.

3209
02:49:25,711 --> 02:49:30,449
Mr. Belfort made the sentence
almost 2 dozen offenders.

3210
02:49:31,651 --> 02:49:35,655
I helped recover millions of dollars
to restore

3211
02:49:35,888 --> 02:49:37,156
their victims.

3212
02:49:39,592 --> 02:49:42,928
The judgment of the court is
36 months in federal prison.

3213
02:49:44,997 --> 02:49:46,465
Please escort the defendant.

3214
02:49:50,636 --> 02:49:51,637
Sorry.

3215
02:50:43,556 --> 02:50:44,924
I have no shame
to admit it.

3216
02:50:46,158 --> 02:50:49,528
When you get to prison
I was terrified.

3217
02:50:51,197 --> 02:50:52,331
Belfort standing.

3218
02:50:52,498 --> 02:50:53,699
But I should not be.

3219
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:56,902
You see for a brief moment.

3220
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,705
I forgot he was rich.

3221
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:04,176
He lived in a place where
everything was for sale.

3222
02:51:07,346 --> 02:51:09,048
Would you like to learn how to sell?

3223
02:51:09,849 --> 02:51:12,485
I have met in my life bad guys.

3224
02:51:13,085 --> 02:51:15,288
I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes.

3225
02:51:15,421 --> 02:51:16,555
Gangster.

3226
02:51:16,756 --> 02:51:18,391
I tell you, bad guys.

3227
02:51:18,424 --> 02:51:19,492
But this type.

3228
02:51:19,659 --> 02:51:22,028
My good friend Jordan Belfort.

3229
02:51:22,161 --> 02:51:25,931
It is the bad guy
I know.

3230
02:51:26,999 --> 02:51:28,367
So I want you

3231
02:51:28,834 --> 02:51:32,338
give warm applause from
New Zealand to my

3232
02:51:32,505 --> 02:51:36,008
good friend and the best
coach sales

3233
02:51:36,342 --> 02:51:38,744
Mr. Jordan Belfort.

3234
02:51:49,822 --> 02:51:50,823
Thank you.

3235
02:52:14,213 --> 02:52:15,348
Sell ??me this pen.

3236
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:23,389
It is an amazing pen.

3237
02:52:23,589 --> 02:52:26,459
It is for professionals.

3238
02:52:30,162 --> 02:52:31,163
Sell ??me this pen.

3239
02:52:32,665 --> 02:52:33,966
It is a nice pen.

3240
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:38,037
You can use it to write
many things, like remembering ...

3241
02:52:40,506 --> 02:52:43,075
Sell ??me this pen.

3242
02:52:45,878 --> 02:52:47,013
Well ...

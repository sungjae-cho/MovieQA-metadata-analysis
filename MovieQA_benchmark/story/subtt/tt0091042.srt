that I'm the bearer of bad tidings.

Your father called.

349
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,723

Dead grandmother?

353
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,004
Yes, that's what Mr. Peterson said.

354
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:22,124
I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
Poor little lamb.

355

Who's this girl going out with?

356

It's so hard to tell these days.

357
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,324
I do see her
with Ferris Bueller quite a little bit.

358
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,004
Would you get me
Mr. Peterson's daytime number, please?

359
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:36,163
Surely.

You still want his daytime number?

- Ed Rooney.
- Ed. This is George Peterson.

How are you today, sir?

367
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:03,843
We've had a bit of bad luck
this morning, as you may have heard.

368

Yeah, I heard, and I'm all broken up.

- Boy, what a blow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,803
Well, it's been a tough morning, and

371
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,763
we've got a lot of family business
to take care of. So

372
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:19,203
if you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.

373
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,603
Sure, I'd be happy to.

Yeah, you just produce a corpse, and

375
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,684
I'll release Sloane.

376
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,883

It's all right, Grace.
It's Ferris Bueller, the little twerp.

how you doing?

Listen, I'm sorry to disturb you at work,
but I'm not feeling very well today

possible for my sister to bring home

I really don't know, sir.

I mean, I didn't think
I was talking to you.

01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:25,879
Listen, I'm going to get myself settled
and I'll bring a hot cup of soup, okay?

1383
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,279
(EXCLAIMING)

1384
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,799
(SIGHS)

1385
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,199
Yup.

1386
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,919
I said it before and I'll say it again.

1387
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,119
Life moves pretty fast.

1388
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,079
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

1389
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,719
(OH YEAH PLAYING)

1390
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,239
ROONEY: Four years of chasing this kid.

1391
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,278
Four years he has been
making a fool of me.

1392
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,039
Hey, Mr. Rooney, what's going on?

1393
01:35:19,759 --> 01:35:21,999
Did you get in a fight?

1394
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,559
Want a lift?

1395
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:09,679
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before.

1396
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,158
Gummy Bear?

1397
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,798
They've been in my pocket.
They're real warm and soft.

1398
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,278
You're still here?

1399
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:20,159
It's over.

1400
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,238
Go home.

1401
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,519
Go.

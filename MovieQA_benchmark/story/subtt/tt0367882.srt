1
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,222
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,060
Hey! Hey, guys!

3
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,788
Faster!

4
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,749
Hey, what you got under there?

5
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,584
-Hey, you want to race?
-Oh, please.

6
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,711
-Come on!
-Come on, let's go!

7
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,887
Come on!

8
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,893
-Please?
-Come on! Let's go! Come on!

9
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,994
Come on. Let's go.

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,541
Go faster! Faster!

11
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,048
Sorry, gentlemen.

12
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,010
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

13
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,054
That includes all on-base personnel.

14
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,931
Good afternoon, sir.

15
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,732
I'm afraid that goes for you, too,
Colonel, sir.

16
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,150
The Pentagon sent out revised...

17
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,652
Russians.

18
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,781
This ain't gonna be easy.

19
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,616
Not as easy as it used to be.

20
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,494
-Well, we've been through worse.
-Yeah? When?

21
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,496
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

22
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,915
-We were younger.
-I still am young!

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,250
We had guns.

24
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,129
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

25
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,840
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

26
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,560
Let's call it 100.

27
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,482
You recognize building, yes?

28
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,699
Drop dead.

29
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,123
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,542
I meant drop dead, comrade.

31
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,021
-Where was he found?
-In Mexico.

32
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,649
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

33
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,115
You're not from around here, are you?

34
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,787
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

35
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,956
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth
into those wubble-u's,

36
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,460
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

37
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,504
Highest marks.

38
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,631
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

39
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,928
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

40
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:32,057
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

41
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,475
And why?

42
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:39,731
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

43
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,026
And what I do not know, I find out.

44
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:48,824
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

45
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,635
-You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
-Ouch.

46
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,515
So, we will do this,
what is expression, old-fashioned way.

47
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,102
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

48
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,751
This warehouse
is where you and your government

49
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,546
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

50
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,925
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

51
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,762
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

52
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,558
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

53
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,728
Contents of box, mummified remains.

54
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,230
This is no doubt familiar to you.

55
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,734
What makes you think I've got any idea
what box you're talking about?

56
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,903
Because 10 years ago

57
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,031
you were part of the team
that examined it.

58
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,535
Look...

59
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,164
Even if I
knew what you were talking about...

60
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,751
You will help us find it.

61
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,556
Compass. I need a compass.

62
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,350
You know, north, south, east...

63
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,768
West.

64
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,021
No compass?

65
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,816
I need your bullets.

66
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,786
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

67
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,995
I need gunpowder.

68
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,998
You want my help or not?

69
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,057
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

70
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,059
If it's still magnetic,

71
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,354
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

72
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,637
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

73
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,142
Pliers.

74
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,052
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

75
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,699
Why, Mac?

76
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,160
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

77
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,580
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

78
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,669
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

79
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,131
I thought we were friends, Mac.

80
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,343
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

81
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,971
Awful. Bloody awful.

82
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,267
I can't go home empty-handed again.

83
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,145
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

84
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,817
I like Ike.

85
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,402
Put down gun.

86
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,904
You got it, pal.

87
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,225
Damn, I thought that was closer.

88
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,606
Come on. Come on.

89
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,168
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

90
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,343
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

91
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,469
Know him. Know him.

92
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,679
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

93
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,849
You don't know him! You don't know...

94
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,409
You did well.

95
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,928
Hello? Hello?

96
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,018
Hello!

97
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,522
Hey. I knocked. You guys got a...

98
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,322
Wait a minute.

99
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,158
Come on, gang!

100
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,256
Oh, that can't be good.

101
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,012
All personnel,
it is now one minute to zero time.

102
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,848
Put on goggles or turn away.

103
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:49,187
Do not remove goggles or face burst
until 10 seconds after first light.

104
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,771
That can't be good at all.

105
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,283
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

106
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,538
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

107
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,248
Minus 15 seconds.

108
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,717
Minus 10 seconds.

109
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:26,057
Niner, eight, seven, six,

110
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:30,061
fiver, four,

111
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,315
three, two, one, zero.

112
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,326
I had no reason to believe
that Mac was a spy.

113
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,745
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

114
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,706
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

115
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,208
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

116
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,210
We all served.

117
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,671
No kidding? What side were you on?

118
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,507
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

119
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,093
You aided and abetted KGB agents

120
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,347
who broke into
a top-secret military installation

121
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,224
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

122
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,269
What was in the steel box they took?

123
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,105
You tell us. You've seen it before.

124
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,237
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

125
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,575
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

126
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,578
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

127
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,747
Hauled out in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere

128
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,375
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

129
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,542
Pieces of wreckage

130
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:03,297
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

131
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,300
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

132
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,053
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

133
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,971
So, you tell me, what was in the box?

134
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,390
Indy, thank God.

135
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,725
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

136
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,560
Those things can be deathtraps!

137
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,063
Good to see you, too, Bob.

138
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,565
Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

139
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,526
What the hell is going on?

140
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,320
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

141
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,197
Describe her.

142
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,907
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

143
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,701
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

144
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,165
Yeah, that's her.

145
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,834
You sure she's here?

146
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,294
Here and gone. Who is she?

147
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,965
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

148
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,927
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.

149
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,095
General Ross...

150
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,431
She's leading teams from the Kremlin
all over the world.

151
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,640
Scooping up artifacts

152
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,435
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

153
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,479
-General Ross!
-Back off, Paul.

154
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,108
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

155
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,612
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

156
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,780
Nothing yet.

157
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,782
But frankly your association
with George McHale

158
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,120
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

159
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,122
Are you nuts?

160
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,459
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

161
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,544
A great many, I'm sure.

162
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,298
But does he deserve them?

163
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,385
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

164
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,637
Of great interest.

165
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,274
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

166
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,819
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

167
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,530
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

168
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,325
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years

169
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,286
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

170
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,497
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants

171
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:04,418
decided to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment. Yes?

172
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,922
-May I have a moment, Professor?
-Yes.

173
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,466
Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4.

174
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,675
When I come back we'll discuss

175
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,720
the difference between
migration and exodus.

176
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,102
What?

177
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,606
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

178
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,024
The FBI showed up this morning,

179
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,693
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

180
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,612
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

181
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,947
They have no right.

182
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,449
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

183
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,952
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

184
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,497
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

185
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,707
not in this charged climate.

186
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,169
So you're firing me.

187
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,549
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

188
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,175
-You are firing me.
-During which

189
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,095
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period...

190
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,638
I don't want their money!

191
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,224
Please don't be foolish.

192
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,226
You don't know what I had to go through
to get that for you.

193
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,563
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

194
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,022
Henry...

195
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,026
I resigned.

196
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,411
Where will you go?

197
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,541
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

198
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,963
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

199
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,423
I'll wire you when I get settled.

200
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,216
You can send on
the rest of my things.

201
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,468
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

202
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,512
I barely recognize this country anymore.

203
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,682
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

204
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:46,312
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

205
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,439
How did Deirdre take the news?

206
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,816
How does any wife take such things?

207
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,069
The look on her face
was a combination of pride and panic.

208
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,114
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

209
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,951
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

210
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,000
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

211
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,671
First Dad, then Marcus.

212
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,133
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things

213
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,385
and starts taking them away.

214
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,724
Just another half glass.

215
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,117
Hey!

216
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,453
Hey, old man!

217
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,667
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

218
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,544
You're running out of platform, kid.

219
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,838
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

220
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,298
-Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
-Yeah.

221
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,925
What about him?

222
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,094
They're going to kill him.

223
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,850
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

224
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,478
He's a brilliant guy.

225
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,440
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

226
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,609
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

227
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,613
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

228
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,657
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

229
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,910
-Mutt? What kind of name is that?
-Yeah.

230
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,037
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

231
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:13,417
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

232
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:18,005
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

233
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,049
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

234
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,055
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

235
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,599
He's down in Peru.

236
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,393
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

237
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,105
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

238
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,524
-The one he found.
-Nice jacket.

239
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,946
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

240
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,198
How do you know about it?

241
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,574
Are you kidding? It's all he talked about.

242
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,451
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

243
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,453
What's it? It's like an idol?

244
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,331
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

245
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,541
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

246
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,377
I saw one in the British Museum.

247
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,340
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

248
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,259
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

249
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,305
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

250
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,141
-Akator? He said that? You're sure?
-Yeah.

251
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,895
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

252
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,607
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

253
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,652
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

254
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,823
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

255
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,660
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

256
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,329
It had aqueducts and paved roads

257
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:37,501
and technology that
wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years.

258
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:42,589
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

259
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,593
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

260
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,471
I don't think it exists.

261
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,432
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

262
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,353
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

263
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,355
in the 15th or 16th century,

264
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,067
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

265
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,361
will be given control over its power.

266
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,282
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

267
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,451
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

268
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,703
No.

269
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,706
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

270
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,832
You know, smog in the noggin,

271
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,210
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

272
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,045
Now they've got her, too.

273
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,589
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

274
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,925
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

275
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,136
Now, she said you'd help me.

276
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,055
Me? What's your mom's name again?

277
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,892
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

278
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,226
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

279
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,437
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

280
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,314
All right? That's my mother.

281
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,400
You don't have to get sore all the time
just to prove how tough you are.

282
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,652
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

283
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,948
She said if anybody could find the skull,
it's you.

284
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,578
Like you're some type of...
Like a grave robber or something.

285
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,497
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

286
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,835
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

287
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,921
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

288
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,506
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

289
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,258
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox

290
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,344
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

291
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,803
Then the line went dead. I opened it.

292
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,348
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

293
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,808
It's not even English lettering.

294
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,060
See?

295
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,231
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

296
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,901
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

297
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,486
Who are they?

298
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,198
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

299
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,033
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

300
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,534
Make that KGB.

301
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,704
-And bring letter with you.
-Letter? What letter?

302
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,122
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

303
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,124
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

304
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,960
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll...

305
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,211
Or what?

306
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,547
Nice try, kid,
but I think you just brought a knife

307
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,134
to a gunfight.

308
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,886
Outside now.

309
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,475
-Hit this guy.
-Who?

310
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,018
Joe College. Hit him hard.

311
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,062
-Here, hold this.
-What?

312
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,898
That's my boyfriend!

313
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,820
Take it outside!

314
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,738
Get that greaser!

315
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,872
Your mom didn't escape.

316
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,750
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter

317
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,087
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

318
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,091
Get on, gramps!

319
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,872
Go, go, go, go, go!

320
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:24,496
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

321
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,543
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

322
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,197
Left! Go left! Left!

323
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,173
Move, move! Move!

324
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,175
Split, split! Split, split!

325
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,677
-You're going too fast.
-That's a matter of opinion!

326
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,651
-Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
-Yes?

327
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,071
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

328
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,531
Forget Hargrove.

329
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,701
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

330
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,953
He spent most of his life in the field.

331
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,957
If you want to be a good archeologist,

332
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,628
you got to get out of the library!

333
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,467
Who is that?

334
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,678
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

335
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,014
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

336
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,601
And just as I thought.

337
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,686
Koihoma.

338
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,230
What's that?

339
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:18,318
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

340
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,615
See. Diagonal stresses
on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

341
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,575
-You speak it?
-Nobody speaks it.

342
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,995
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

343
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,333
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

344
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,628
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

345
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,463
Thanks a lot.

346
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,507
What are you, like, 80?

347
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,054
It's a riddle.

348
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,683
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

349
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:55,272
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read

350
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,441
"which lead to Orellana's cradle

351
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,777
"guarded by the living dead."

352
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,780
-He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
-What are those?

353
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,198
Hold on here.

354
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:12,455
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

355
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,292
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

356
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,004
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

357
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,923
because only gods live up there.

358
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:29,139
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

359
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,078
Finally. They saw him.

360
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,039
Ox wandered into town a couple
of months ago, raving like a madman.

361
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,541
Police locked him up in the sanitarium.
It's this way.

362
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,044
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

363
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,338
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

364
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,007
-Where'd you learn that one?
-Long story.

365
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,675
I got time.

366
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,178
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

367
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,930
Bullshit!

368
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,265
-You asked.
-Pancho Villa?

369
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,519
-Technically, I was kidnapped.
-By Pancho Villa?

370
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,064
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

371
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,358
-How old were you?
-About your age.

372
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,944
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

373
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,196
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

374
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,156
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

375
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,701
Treat her right, kid. You only get one
and sometimes not for that long.

376
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,078
It's not my fault. It's hers.

377
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,788
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

378
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,373
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

379
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,667
-You quit school?
-Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

380
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,919
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

381
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,671
and chess and fencing.

382
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,923
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

383
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,092
-You never finished.
-No.

384
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,803
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

385
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,264
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

386
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,766
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

387
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,477
-What do you do for money?
-Fix motorcycles.

388
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,272
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

389
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,941
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

390
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,444
No. Not if that's what you love doing.

391
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,405
Don't let anybody tell you different.

392
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,323
This is it. Sister.

393
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,597
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

394
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,727
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

395
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,984
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

396
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,570
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

397
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,161
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

398
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:43,917
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

399
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,294
Cradle, cradle, birth.

400
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,380
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

401
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,382
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

402
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,884
What happened to him?

403
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:57,222
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

404
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,670
He must have lost his mind.

405
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,680
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

406
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,524
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

407
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,943
Look at the elongated cranium.

408
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,779
And the same word

409
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,115
in different languages,
over and over again.

410
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,246
Return.

411
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,081
Return where?

412
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,208
Or return what?

413
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,794
You mean the skull?

414
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,422
Seems to have been on his mind.

415
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,174
Where was he supposed to return it to?

416
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,147
-Sweep.
-Yeah.

417
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,409
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

418
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,911
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

419
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:48,958
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

420
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,461
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

421
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:56,591
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

422
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,636
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

423
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,556
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

424
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,506
"Grave robbers will be shot."

425
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,549
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

426
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,727
-What are we looking for?
-I don't know yet.

427
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,690
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

428
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,040
I think I just saw something!

429
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,459
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

430
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,049
This way down.

431
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,519
-This way up.
-Yeah.

432
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,712
Those darts are poison!

433
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,882
Stay there.

434
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,950
You're a teacher?

435
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,453
Part-time.

436
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,798
Dead end.

437
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,384
Maybe.

438
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,017
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

439
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,561
Give me some light over here.

440
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,319
Bring it over here.

441
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,994
It's just a thing.

442
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,598
Dance on your own dime, will you?

443
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,725
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

444
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,935
-How big?
-Huge!

445
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,562
-Good.
-Good?

446
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,900
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

447
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,403
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

448
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:52,386
Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.

449
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,098
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

450
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,267
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

451
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,771
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

452
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,481
to elongate the skull like that.

453
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,192
-Why?
-Honor the gods.

454
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,528
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.

455
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,739
Depends on who your god is.

456
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,876
You're going nowhere fast.

457
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,342
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

458
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,642
Hey!

459
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,912
Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.

460
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,307
-This is incredible.
-Unreal.

461
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,271
Don't touch anything.

462
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,609
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

463
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,612
Recently.

464
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,325
Two sets of prints.

465
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:43,539
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

466
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,124
Not bad, kid.

467
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,761
One. Two.

468
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,222
Three. Four. Five. Six.

469
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,350
Seven.

470
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,147
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

471
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,359
Give me some light.

472
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,910
You don't have a knife, do you?

473
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,976
Looks like he just died yesterday.

474
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,813
It's the wrappings. They preserved him.

475
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,447
What just happened?

476
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,493
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

477
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,544
Thanks.

478
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,758
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

479
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,845
-That's fine.
-I was going to put it back.

480
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,602
Is this one open already?

481
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,166
It's him.

482
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,585
It's Orellana himself.

483
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:01,886
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

484
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,972
It's odd.

485
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,144
Somebody's been here and gone.

486
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:16,275
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

487
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,529
What were they looking for?

488
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,419
-Hold this.
-No. No.

489
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,983
Unbelievable.

490
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,619
No tool marks.

491
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,330
A single piece of seamless quartz.

492
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,751
Cut across the grain.

493
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,964
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

494
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,514
Crystal's not magnetic.

495
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,182
Neither is gold.

496
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,730
What is this thing?

497
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,943
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

498
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,862
-You think this is the one from...
-From Akator.

499
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:53,122
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

500
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,625
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

501
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,005
Maybe the Indians caught up with them,

502
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,632
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

503
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:07,177
over their prize, kill each other off.

504
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,514
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

505
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:15,686
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

506
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,398
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

507
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,570
But then he returns it here.

508
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,363
Return.

509
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,616
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

510
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,580
He put it back where he found it. Why?

511
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:02,232
-Hello, Jonesey.
-Hello, Mac.

512
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,892
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

513
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,228
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

514
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,856
That's the third time I've saved your life.

515
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,067
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.

516
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,070
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

517
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,905
the first time we met.

518
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,865
I had the situation under control.

519
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,451
-You owe me.
-What do you owe them?

520
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,996
After the war, when you turned,

521
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,248
how many names
did you give the Reds?

522
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,707
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

523
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,793
How many good men died
because of you?

524
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,170
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

525
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,632
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

526
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,052
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

527
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,513
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

528
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,390
It's just about money, isn't it?

529
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,267
No. Not only money.

530
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,772
A gigantic pile of money.

531
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,942
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

532
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,028
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

533
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,617
An entire city of gold.
It's what the conquistadors were after.

534
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,540
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

535
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,126
Blood money, every nickel.

536
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,420
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

537
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,381
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

538
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,802
Like in Berlin. Got me?

539
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,971
Just like in Berlin.

540
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:59,308
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

541
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,271
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

542
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,357
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

543
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,402
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

544
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:15,073
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

545
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,660
You recognize those words?

546
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:23,165
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

547
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,666
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

548
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,835
It was nuclear intimidation.

549
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,923
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

550
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,925
yours to fear.

551
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,511
Weapon? What weapon?

552
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,346
A mind weapon.

553
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,266
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

554
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,981
Now I know why Oxley
put the skull back where he found it.

555
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,316
He knew you were looking for it.

556
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,401
That skull is no mere deity carving.

557
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,529
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

558
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,657
It was not made by human hands.

559
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,492
Who made it, then?

560
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,247
Come on.

561
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,543
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

562
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,505
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

563
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,340
Saucer men from Mars.

564
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,551
The legends about Akator are all true.

565
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,053
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

566
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,305
It was a city of supreme beings

567
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,475
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

568
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,936
You got to be kidding me.

569
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,314
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

570
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,903
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

571
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,866
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

572
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,831
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

573
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,001
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

574
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:56,049
-There is no other explanation.
-There's always another explanation.

575
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,387
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

576
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,597
Whoever returns it...

577
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,099
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

578
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,144
I've heard that bedtime story before.

579
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,272
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

580
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,774
You should ask your friend
that question.

581
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,152
We're certain he's been there.

582
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,404
Oxley?

583
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,463
Ox, it's me, Indy.

584
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,798
Ox?

585
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,761
Ox, you're faking it, right?

586
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,764
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

587
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,851
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

588
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,394
You were born in Leeds, England.

589
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,230
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

590
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,567
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

591
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,738
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

592
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,240
What have you done to him?

593
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,576
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

594
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,871
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

595
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,374
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

596
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:15,170
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

597
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:22,260
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

598
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,513
opening a psychic channel.

599
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:28,684
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

600
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:33,355
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

601
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,191
I've got a better idea. You look at it.

602
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,403
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

603
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,365
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

604
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,034
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

605
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,204
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

606
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,873
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

607
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,543
Whoever finds them
will control the greatest natural force

608
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,795
the world has ever known.

609
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,675
Power over the mind of man.

610
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,387
Be careful,
you might get exactly what you wish for.

611
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,972
I usually do.

612
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,591
Imagine.

613
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:46,344
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

614
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,681
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

615
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,350
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

616
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,145
your soldiers attack on our command.

617
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,148
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

618
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,608
invading your dreams,

619
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,861
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

620
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,616
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

621
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,494
all of you, from the inside.

622
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,288
We will turn you into us.

623
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:18,210
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

624
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,838
Return.

625
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,051
Return?

626
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,972
That's enough.

627
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,812
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

628
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,356
Cover it.

629
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,904
Henry.

630
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,698
You all right, Jonesey?

631
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,831
-You broke my nose!
-I told you.

632
01:03:55,915 --> 01:04:00,627
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

633
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,256
Take him outside.

634
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,764
-You all right, kid?
-They left my bike at the cemetery.

635
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,683
-Yeah, but you're all right?
-They left my bike.

636
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:18,228
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

637
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:30,365
I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing.

638
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,033
You heard him.

639
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,620
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

640
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,498
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.

641
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:44,254
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

642
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,301
Indiana Jones.

643
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,598
About time you showed up.

644
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,558
-Mom!
-Sweetheart.

645
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,310
"Mom"?

646
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,728
What are you doing here?

647
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,897
Forget about me. Are you all right?

648
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,232
-"Mom"?
-Young man, I specifically told you

649
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,901
-not to come here.
-Marion is your mother?

650
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,028
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

651
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,280
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

652
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,575
For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard.

653
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,577
No, I mean, I just never thought...

654
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,245
I would have a life after you left.

655
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,831
-That's not what I meant.
-A damn good life!

656
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,501
-Well, that's fine.
-A damn good, really good life!

657
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,086
-Well, so have I!
-Yeah?

658
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,963
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

659
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,465
or have you retired?

660
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,050
Why? You looking for a date?

661
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,385
With anybody but you.

662
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,014
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

663
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,557
A simple "yes" will do.

664
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,101
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

665
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,354
Not like you did any better.

666
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,732
Same old, same old.

667
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,111
Henry Jones, Jr.

668
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:55,325
-Henry Jones, Jr...
-That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

669
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,411
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

670
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,331
-"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
-Palace of...

671
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,917
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

672
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,503
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

673
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,004
or they're gonna kill Marion.

674
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:12,425
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom..."

675
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,053
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

676
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,264
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

677
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,899
Get me paper. Something to write with.

678
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,746
Autowriting! I should have seen this.

679
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,380
-Henry Jones, Jr.
-Right. That's right, Ox.

680
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:55,010
Three times it drops. The way down.

681
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,929
-Three times...
-Pictographs.

682
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,182
Ideograms.

683
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,317
Good, Ox. Good.

684
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,206
Ox?

685
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,251
It's me, Ox.

686
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:33,882
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

687
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,801
It's me.

688
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:44,184
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

689
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:48,563
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

690
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,232
The word "now" is "until."

691
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,567
These two close together,

692
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:56,071
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

693
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,156
The horizon stood for the world,

694
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,534
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

695
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,582
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

696
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,710
These aren’t just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

697
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,050
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

698
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:20,178
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

699
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,644
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

700
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,771
Yes, good. Exactly.

701
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,860
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono

702
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,239
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

703
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:41,116
After that, I'm not sure.

704
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,620
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes...
I have no idea what he means.

705
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:46,704
This could be the route, though.

706
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,165
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

707
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,672
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

708
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,389
-Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
-They were going to kill us!

709
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,724
-Well, maybe.
-Somebody had to do something!

710
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,102
-Something else would have been good.
-At least I got a plan.

711
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:12,564
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

712
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:21,739
Mom?

713
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,659
-Stay back!
-Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

714
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,327
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

715
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,662
No, I think I can get out if I can just...

716
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,330
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

717
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,249
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

718
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,500
Okay, I'm calm.

719
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,877
-What is it? Quicksand?
-I'm calm.

720
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,962
-No, it's a dry sand pit.
-I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

721
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,047
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

722
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,008
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

723
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,384
-as people sometimes think.
-For Pete's sake, Jones,

724
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,052
we're not in school!

725
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,097
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a...

726
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,559
A void collapse.

727
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,396
I'll go get something to pull you out.

728
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,356
Ox, don’t just sit there.

729
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,151
For God's sake, man, go get help!

730
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,112
-Help?
-Help!

731
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,697
Help?

732
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,199
Help! Go!

733
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,579
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

734
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,789
It's not the worst quality in the world.

735
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,710
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

736
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,880
-Indy, he...
-He's a good kid, Marion.

737
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,632
You should get off his back
about school.

738
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,800
-Mutt, I mean...
-Not everybody's cut out for it.

739
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,552
His name is Henry!

740
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,179
Henry. Good name.

741
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,764
He's your son.

742
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,392
My son?

743
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,353
Henry Jones the Third.

744
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:40,401
Why the hell
didn't you make him finish school?

745
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,154
-Mom, grab on! Grab it!
-Yeah.

746
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,572
I got it.

747
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,952
Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!

748
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,286
Pull!

749
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,499
Grab on.

750
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,087
-Grab it.
-Just grab it, Indy.

751
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,713
It's a rat snake!

752
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,757
-Rat snakes aren't that big.
-Well, this one is, all right?

753
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,425
It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!

754
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,053
-Go get something else.
-Like what?

755
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,888
Like a rope or something.

756
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,183
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

757
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:17,772
-Maybe I can touch the bottom.
-There's no bottom. Now grab it.

758
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,774
No, I think I can feel it with my feet.

759
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,485
-Grab the snake!
-Stop calling it that!

760
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,279
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

761
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,239
-Say "rope."
-What?

762
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:28,408
Say "grab the rope."

763
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:31,035
-Grab the rope!
-Grab the rope!

764
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,037
Hold tight. It's slimy.

765
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:35,039
Pull!

766
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:45,633
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

767
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,343
Afraid of snakes.

768
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,972
You are one crazy old man.

769
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:58,271
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

770
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,110
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

771
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,903
Help.

772
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:44,025
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

773
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,402
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

774
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:50,198
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

775
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,075
We started dating
when you were three months old.

776
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,534
He was a good man.

777
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:57,789
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You...

778
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:01,542
You married him? I introduced you!

779
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,712
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married

780
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,715
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

781
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,134
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

782
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,678
You didn't know that.
Why didn't you ever talk to me about it?

783
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,639
Because we never had an argument
I won!

784
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,474
It's not my fault if you can't keep up!

785
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,725
I didn't want to hurt you!

786
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,436
For love of God, shut the hell up!

787
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,524
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

788
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,317
He hated that you ran away.

789
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,819
Would you two just stop?

790
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,489
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see
mom and dad fight.

791
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,741
-You're not my dad, okay?
-You bet I am.

792
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,159
And I got news for you.

793
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,245
You're gonna go back and finish school.

794
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:38,496
Really? What happened to,

795
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,081
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

796
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,457
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

797
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,792
You don't remember saying that?

798
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,585
That was before I was your father!

799
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,129
-You're not my father!
-Oh, yes, he is your father.

800
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,713
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

801
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,048
I had a right to know.

802
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,800
You vanished after that.

803
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,428
-I wrote.
-A year later!

804
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:57,306
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

805
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,183
Why are you bothering to tell me now?

806
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,602
Because I thought we were gonna die!

807
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,979
Not yet!

808
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,661
Got it?

809
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,333
Oh, shit.

810
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,432
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

811
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:42,477
There must've been
plenty of women for you over the years.

812
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:46,772
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

813
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,566
Yeah? What's that?

814
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,612
They weren't you, honey.

815
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,096
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull

816
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,433
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

817
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,239
What's he gonna do now?

818
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,616
-I don't think he plans that far ahead.
-Yeah.

819
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:42,703
-Scooch over, will you, Son?
-Don't call me "son." Don't.

820
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,997
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.

821
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,218
Duck! Duck!

822
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,181
Move, move!

823
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,852
Pull up next to that duck.

824
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,948
Henry Jones, Jr.

825
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,336
Jones!

826
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,353
Come on! Come on!

827
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,911
Get down!

828
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,718
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

829
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,136
That's not fair. She drove the truck.

830
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,264
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

831
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,317
Jonesey!

832
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,457
-Jonesey!
-Hi, Mac.

833
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:30,121
-Indy. Indy! Indy!
-Shut up! Shut up!

834
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:35,251
-You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
-CIA.

835
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:38,963
I almost screamed it at you in the tent.
I said, "Just like Berlin."

836
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,006
What were we in Berlin, mate?

837
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,925
-Double agents!
-The skull!

838
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:48,681
Throw me the skull!

839
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:11,912
Riposte.

840
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,420
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

841
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,422
It's not a match, Mom.

842
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:51,535
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

843
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,496
Mutt, disengage!

844
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,412
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

845
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,581
-Throw the bag! Throw it!
-Throw the bag!

846
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:39,750
-Gun!
-Gun!

847
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,675
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

848
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,110
This is very dangerous.

849
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,224
Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.

850
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,753
Jones!

851
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,592
Whoa.

852
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,137
Whoa!

853
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,268
Turn!

854
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,760
-Siafu.
-What?

855
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,595
Big damn ants! Go!

856
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,985
Run to the river!

857
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,882
Get to the river!

858
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,143
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

859
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,609
Mom, there's a cliff!

860
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:03,277
-Jonesey, come on!
-Get in, Jones!

861
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:22,045
-Mom, stop.
-Mom, slow down.

862
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,217
-Honey, stop.
-Slow down, Mom.

863
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,969
-You're gonna go off the cliff.
-That's the idea.

864
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:31,638
-Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
-Trust me!

865
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,098
Slow down!

866
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,421
-Don't ever do that again.
-Yes, dear.

867
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,768
Three times it drops.

868
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,024
Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!

869
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,901
-I'm trying! I'm trying!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

870
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,715
The way down.

871
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,762
He means by land. He came by land.

872
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:58,558
-Three times it drops?
-Three times it drops.

873
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,018
What is he talking about?

874
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,728
He means one!

875
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,816
Two!

876
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,335
Three.

877
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:02,873
You okay? Babe? Let go.

878
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,917
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

879
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:10,213
"The golden vision reappears!"

880
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,886
Gold. I'm in.

881
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:20,599
Through eyes... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

882
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:26,480
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

883
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,732
Who cares?

884
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,693
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

885
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:34,237
Look what it did to him.

886
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,491
-I have to return it.
-Why you?

887
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,618
Because it told me to.

888
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:56,843
-Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
-Oxy, stay with us.

889
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,553
How old is this?

890
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,806
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

891
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,769
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

892
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,816
This is fresh. These were just used.

893
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,499
More worshippers.

894
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,794
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

895
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,343
Someone came

896
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:44,766
and taught the Ugha farming.

897
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:50,355
Irrigation.

898
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,659
Ox, what is it?

899
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,553
I think I understand, Ox.

900
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,557
Someone came?

901
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,082
Are they the same?

902
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,043
There were more. Look.

903
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:58,715
Thirteen in a circle.

904
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,766
Show us the way, Ox.

905
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,402
-Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
-Go!

906
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,726
Indy!

907
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,395
Jonesey!

908
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:36,938
Oxley!

909
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,984
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

910
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:55,749
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

911
01:35:58,502 --> 01:35:59,586
Come on, come on, come on.

912
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,087
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

913
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,797
-"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
-Come on, Ox.

914
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,007
You did good, Ox. You did good.

915
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:31,493
City of gold. So where's all the gold?

916
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:34,704
Look at the state of this place.

917
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:37,582
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

918
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:42,462
Ox was here before,
but he couldn't get into the temple,

919
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:46,382
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

920
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:50,595
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

921
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:52,972
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

922
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,558
Key that ope's the palace.

923
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,562
The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?

924
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:09,405
What are you looking for, Ox?

925
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,368
What are you doing?

926
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:21,918
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

927
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:24,671
Excuse me, Professor.

928
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:41,062
Well done.

929
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,982
Go get your own.

930
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,542
Listen.

931
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,503
Hear that?

932
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:52,133
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

933
01:38:56,013 --> 01:39:01,100
Faster! Faster!

934
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,769
Faster!

935
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:05,146
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

936
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,607
Quick! Quick! Quick!

937
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,654
I don't like this! I don't like it!

938
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:14,739
-Mom, come on!
-Jonesey!

939
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:34,384
He dropped it. He dropped the skull!

940
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:35,718
Okay?

941
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,397
Hold this.

942
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:52,527
Ox, you okay?

943
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:57,532
Lovely.

944
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:00,576
All right, let's go.

945
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:08,876
This way?

946
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:17,987
Now that's more like it.

947
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:27,955
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

948
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,208
Macedonian.

949
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,919
-Sumerian.
-This place is the mother lode.

950
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:34,962
Etruscan. Babylonian.

951
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:39,175
There isn't a museum in the world
that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

952
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,343
Early Egyptian.

953
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:43,387
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

954
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:45,640
Collectors.

955
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:50,144
They were archeologists.

956
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:29,433
How do we open it?

957
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:38,234
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

958
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,107
No more forever waiting.

959
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,152
Soon now.

960
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,830
Sorry, Jonesey.

961
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,583
So what are you, a triple agent?

962
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:21,003
Nah, I just lied about being a double.

963
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,135
Look at them!

964
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:34,850
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

965
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:41,107
They are a hive mind.

966
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:47,738
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

967
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:52,785
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

968
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:04,380
Imagine what they could tell us.

969
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:06,215
I can't imagine.

970
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,800
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

971
01:45:07,884 --> 01:45:08,968
and neither can you.

972
01:45:09,052 --> 01:45:12,555
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

973
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,641
My sympathies.

974
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:19,395
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

975
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:57,433
-Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
-What does he say?

976
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,186
He says he's grateful and he wants...

977
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:03,481
It.

978
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:10,613
It wants to give us a gift.

979
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:15,284
A big gift.

980
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,746
Tell me everything you know.

981
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:25,628
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

982
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:36,305
I've got a bad feeling about this.

983
01:46:40,977 --> 01:46:42,311
Indy?

984
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,480
The eyes.

985
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:50,838
What are they? Spacemen?

986
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:54,633
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.

987
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:56,510
Welcome back, Ox.

988
01:48:07,939 --> 01:48:09,607
What the hell is that?

989
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:13,027
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

990
01:48:13,945 --> 01:48:16,572
I don't think we want to go that way.

991
01:48:32,088 --> 01:48:36,258
I want to know.

992
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:41,263
Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know.

993
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:50,856
Mac! Mac! Come on!

994
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:53,776
Mac!

995
01:48:56,279 --> 01:48:57,947
Mac, damn it, now!

996
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:12,294
I can see.

997
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:15,506
I can see!

998
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:19,802
Grab it!

999
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:27,476
Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone.

1000
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:30,813
Jonesey!

1001
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:34,316
I'm going to be all right.

1002
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,159
No more!

1003
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:49,873
Cover it. Cover it.

1004
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,388
Go!

1005
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:08,475
Enough!

1006
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:22,740
Go! Go!

1007
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:45,507
Like a broom to their footprints.

1008
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:51,555
Where did they go? Space?

1009
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:57,561
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

1010
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:08,155
I don't understand.

1011
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:12,659
Why this legend of a city of gold?

1012
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:15,913
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1013
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:20,083
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1014
01:53:20,919 --> 01:53:23,128
Knowledge was their treasure.

1015
01:53:38,853 --> 01:53:41,146
What? We're just going to sit here?

1016
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:42,898
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

1017
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:44,900
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

1018
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:46,235
No?

1019
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:50,989
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

1020
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:53,575
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

1021
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:59,039
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

1022
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:02,584
Dad!

1023
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:07,548
Dad?

1024
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:15,097
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

1025
01:54:31,781 --> 01:54:35,492
Marvelous! Perfect!
Make the letters bigger, much bigger.

1026
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:51,967
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

1027
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:57,055
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

1028
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,350
have promised your love for each other
by these vows

1029
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:03,770
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

1030
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:06,815
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

1031
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:12,362
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

1032
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:15,365
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

1033
01:55:16,534 --> 01:55:18,160
Congratulations.

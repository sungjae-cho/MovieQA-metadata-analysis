1
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,620
First love.
We've all been through it.

2
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,780
It can really take a hold of you.
Make you do some pretty crazy things.

3
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,580
They remind me of my first love.
But...

4
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,940
Imogen would never wear
that much jewelry.

5
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,540
And I wouldn't be caught dead
in shoes like that.

6
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,220
-Your coffee. I'm sorry about the wait.
-Thanks.

7
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,300
I remember when I first met her.
It was in this...

8
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,300
cool dive we used
to hang out at.

9
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,620
I guess we thought it was cool
because they didn't check IDs, but...

10
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,580
Anyway...

11
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
she sure looked great
that night.

12
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,020
There's no way! No way!

13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,900
No way!

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,940
There's no way!
No way.

15
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,100
Get outta here!

16
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,740
-Totally true.
-You're such a liar.

17
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,540
-They'd never had anyone so talented.
-They said that? For real?

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,980
-They want to put me under contract.
-You did it with a chick...

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,740
somebody filmed. I can go to the store
and rent it. You got paid US$2,5OO?

20
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,340
-Right, but they will tax that.
-This is the most uncanny thing...

21
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,580
...I've ever heard of.
-She's supposed to stop by later.

22
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,980
-Who?
-My co-star.

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,860
Hold on! You're telling me, the one
that you hot-housed in the movie...

24
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,180
...is coming here tonight?
-Are you two going out now?

25
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,780
She's cool, but I'm not into dating
people at the office.

26
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,580
Wait. Just hold it. Monk, c'mon,
you gotta break me into this business.

27
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,900
Look at me and then look at you.
I'm far better looking.

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,260
No doubt in my mind
that you are, my friend.

29
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,700
But I'm afraid
you're way too small.

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,940
Get outta here.

31
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,780
I got it. And I can outlast anyone
in this goddamn town!

32
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,260
-Then take a challenge.
-Let's go!

33
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,340
New freshman. Name's Lana.
She's always grabby.

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,540
Loves fooling around.
Go get lit with her...

35
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,780
and take her back to the dorm. I'll be
in Al's bunk, so she won't see me.

36
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,700
If you don't show, you have to buy me
an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner.

37
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,780
-When I win?
-Then I'll get you an audition.

38
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,780
You got yourself a bet.

39
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,300
You ever heard of that
drinking game, "Quarters"?

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,780
Where am I going to sleep?

41
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,260
With that freshman.

42
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,340
-"She's Got You".
-What?

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,180
-It's a better pick than "Crazy".
-Depends on your mood, I guess.

44
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,300
-Do you like Patsy Cline?
-Yeah! Patsy, Billie, Joni.

45
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,900
All the great female singers.
My mom's influence. She spins.

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,980
-Get out of here!
-Been a DJ her whole life.

47
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,500
You can't watch me pick, okay?

48
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,860
Okay.

49
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,940
I had to choose dance stuff because
this place needs friction.

50
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,180
-I'm Imogen.
-Imogen?

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,180
-My mom picked it out of a name book.
-Practical.

52
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm Al.
Alfred Connelly.

53
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,420
-Are you a junior?
-Sophomore. Are you a soph...?

54
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,940
Are you a freshman?

55
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,220
-This is a great pick for adrenaline.
-Have to endorphinize.

56
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,620
Later.
Singing, baby.

57
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,220
That guy looks like Jim Morrison,
from The Doors.

58
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,380
His name is Jim Morrison.

59
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,660
You okay?

60
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,300
That's what I get for drinking
in between drinks.

61
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,340
Wait.
Got to come up for air.

62
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,140
We're going to the Cat
and Mouse tavern. Coming?

63
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,500
-I see you with the twig in the corner.
-The frat boy without a frat.

64
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,780
-Al, this is Lana. Lana, Al.
-Hey you, Aley.

65
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,380
I'm going back to twig boy and then
we're going out. So, later.

66
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,660
She's really cool once you get to
know her. Do you wanna come?

67
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,140
I'd like to, but you should go
rage with the freshmen.

68
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,980
-I have my internship tomorrow.
-Doing what?

69
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,660
My dad has a cooking show,
so I'm learning about TV.

70
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,700
But I kinda would really like
to be a cook myself.

71
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,900
-Is he the chef?
-He's Chef Ray.

72
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,980
Your dad is Chef Ray?

73
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,940
Now Al, I want you to get this.
You cut into a piece of Jarlsberg...

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,780
you do not abuse the rind.
You don't say...

75
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,940
well, the rind is an inch big,
so I'm just gonna cut and chuck it.

76
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,300
You cut at the edge,
right here.

77
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,860
You know how much you're gonna
save? Are you seeing this?

78
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,100
You start adding these up,
that's fondue for a nation, buddy.

79
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,700
-Yes, Daddy.
-"Yes, Daddy". You are so smart.

80
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,580
My mom gave me one of his books. She
actually thinks I'm gonna cook here.

81
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,540
Imogen!

82
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,300
I'm in Sullivan's if you wanna come
over and listen to music sometime.

83
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,500
I'd like that.

84
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,860
Skinny. Do you know where
the man they call Horse is?

85
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,980
Monk?
Actually, he just left.

86
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,060
Well, I guess that
just leaves you and me.

87
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,460
-So you're in the business too?
-No. No.

88
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,660
-I'm Al. Monk's room-mate.
-Al, Monk's room-mate...

89
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,500
...buy Cyrus a drink.
-A friend of his is a friend of mine.

90
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,300
-She'll have a...
-An Old-Fashioned.

91
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,340
And a beer.

92
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,420
So...

93
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,740
...what kind of name is Cyrus?
-A man's.

94
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,060
Can I ask you a favor, Al?

95
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,100
Pass this to the Ox.
He's expecting it.

96
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,500
-Do you go to school with us?
-I was at the MIT doing chemistry.

97
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,180
-And?
-And...

98
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,140
I'm taking a break
to explore myself.

99
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Kinda like taking a break
to find yourself?

100
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,620
I'm looking to share myself.

101
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,780
And it looks like the
Sixties are in town.

102
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,340
Come on, you guys.

103
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,100
You're the cutest one
in New York.

104
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,580
I got the most incredible rush
when I hugged him that night.

105
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,020
But as a freshman I made a rule
for myself: no boyfriends.

106
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,140
In high school, I was always in
relationships. For the first time...

107
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,460
I just wanted to be free to have a good
time. But after seeing him in the bar...

108
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,180
What can I say?
I couldn't help myself.

109
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,740
I thought for sure
he wasn't interested.

110
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,620
But when I saw him in the courtyard,
I knew I had to throw away all rules.

111
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Monk...

112
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,300
-What's going on?
-I got action.

113
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,660
That sounds good.

114
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,620
It was poetry, Al. The kind that makes
you think about the first time.

115
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,300
Hicks, cut the crap. Look,
what's going on? And who's in there?

116
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,700
-We get naked.
-And then what?

117
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,940
-She did it.
-Did what?

118
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,860
-I couldn't believe it.
-Believe what?

119
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,420
-It had never happened to me before.
-What happened?

120
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,380
She...

121
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
she...

122
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,820
she shoved...

123
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,180
her finger in my butt.

124
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,420
-In my... you know.
-My God.

125
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,820
My God!

126
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,820
Does this mean I'm gay?
Am I gay?

127
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,660
-Then again...
-Shut up.

128
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,100
I saw the film last night.

129
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,780
It's not bad.

130
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,260
That chariot sequence must've
been kind of tricky.

131
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,500
That old and still in love.

132
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,340
-You ever been in love?
-Sarah. All through high school.

133
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,780
Tingles and everything.
Lost my virginity to her.

134
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,180
-But that's all extinct.
-Why?

135
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,340
Because it happens.
It's a probable fatality.

136
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,100
-How old are we?
-2O.

137
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,460
We don't need love in our lives.

138
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,100
-Hi.
-Hi.

139
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,540
-Hung over?
-It's ghastly.

140
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,900
Usually my parents never let me
drink more than two. Come in.

141
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,820
-Nice to have a single.
-It's the only lottery I've never won.

142
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,300
Something sacred.

143
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,140
Thank you.
Cake is my world.

144
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,020
I feel like I should pay admission.

145
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,940
These are really, really good.

146
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,140
Why, thank you.
I'm not gonna major in it, though.

147
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,300
Why not?

148
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,180
I was supposed to go to the
Art Institute in San Francisco. But...

149
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,180
my parents think that fine arts is for
graduate study, or something to do...

150
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,540
on weekends.
Did you always wanna be a chef?

151
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Actually, when I was younger I kind
of wanted to be a singer-songwriter.

152
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,100
-Me too.
-Really?

153
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,580
-But I've absolutely no musical talent.
-Me neither.

154
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,100
But that's how I found painting.

155
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,340
Come here. Let me show
you my album covers.

156
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,700
See?
I would paint myself in them.

157
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,780
These are so good!

158
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,100
-Sister?
-No, I'm an only child.

159
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,900
-Me too.
-We're prime for psychoanalysis.

160
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,460
-Tell me about it.
-So can I psychoanalyze you?

161
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,060
Sure.

162
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,340
Childhood: good or bad?

163
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,540
-Good and bad.
-Favorite foods?

164
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,940
This is such an intense
subject for me.

165
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,780
Fish. I love fish.

166
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,580
-Have you ever been to Oceana?
-No.

167
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,620
It's the most amazing restaurant.
It's truly religious.

168
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,620
-Vices?
-Sleeping, beer, wine, cheese.

169
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,780
Cigarettes, fashion magazines...

170
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,180
TV, chocolate...

171
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,940
...underachievers.
-You're single though, right?

172
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,860
-It's supposed to be about you, not me.
-It's been about you a little bit.

173
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,380
Who was your first kiss?

174
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,940
-I don't know her name.
-What?

175
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,300
I was twelve.

176
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,820
I'd just finished at the dentist,
who had Novocained my whole mouth.

177
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,620
My mom was supposed to pick me up.
And this lady comes out of this shop.

178
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,420
And she dropped something
out of her pocket. A ring.

179
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,980
I picked it up.
I tried to call out to her...

180
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,980
but my mouth wasn't opening
too much and it was all slurred.

181
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,180
She smiled.
So finally...

182
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,900
I gave it to her.

183
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,420
And then she kissed me.
A real kiss.

184
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,780
And even though I couldn't feel
anything, I got excited.

185
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,020
-Such a weird story.
-It was weird.

186
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,460
But then I felt powerful,
like I could kiss anybody.

187
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,860
How about you?

188
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,500
-I was eleven. My gym partner.
-You kiss like a fish.

189
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,700
He was a jerk.

190
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,260
-Some people like that kind of thing.
-Not when you're eleven and a half.

191
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,940
What kind of girls did you
date in high school?

192
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,860
First there was Megan Brokski,
a tenth-grade cheerleader.

193
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,580
Go, Al!
My cute little beau!

194
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,620
Take me out
for a good time, yo!

195
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,060
Then there was Faith Keenan,
the eleventh-grade klepto.

196
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
Here, hide these.

197
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,340
And Haley Heller, the
twelfth-grade science prodigy.

198
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,780
Look at this rare slug
I found in your garden.

199
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,620
-How about you?
-There was Ted McGurran.

200
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,540
-He was allergic to me.
-We can work things out.

201
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,500
Gabe Stiano. New Age
freak with the crystal.

202
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,220
If you hold this, things
will work out. I know it.

203
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,020
And Ricky James.
But my dog didn't like him.

204
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,300
So, can you make
any conclusions, doctor?

205
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,340
And why not?

206
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,220
-Because I need to know the rest.
-Have you ever been to India?

207
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,060
I just knew she'd appreciate
a place like this.

208
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,100
I just felt completely
comfortable with him.

209
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,860
-Do I have anything in my teeth?
-No.

210
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,900
Do l?

211
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,740
What?

212
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,980
She even stuck around while I got
some secret cooking tips.

213
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,340
His passion for food
was adorable.

214
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,260
And there, in the middle of the park,
we had our first kiss.

215
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,420
That kiss belongs in a box so I
can show my grandkids one day.

216
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,420
Can I use your bathroom?

217
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,260
-Can you smell the essence, Emogin?
-Imogen.

218
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,380
-Imogen.
-Yes, it's very nice.

219
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,140
You know, it's like in music.
You know how tone is intangible?

220
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,820
This is tone, except to the palate.
It is so powerful.

221
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,020
Easy, tiger! We don't want her to think
we're part of some epicurean cult.

222
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,860
All right, I need the pepper now.
Right now. A little sprinkle, okay?

223
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,820
That's a shower,
not a sprinkle.

224
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,540
You have to learn to live
in the in-between.

225
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,140
So, how long have you
guys been together?

226
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,700
-Two months.
-And a week.

227
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,340
-But, who's counting?
-Do you have a song?

228
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,540
-Actually, no.
-Not yet.

229
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,540
-But everybody should have a song.
-We have a song.

230
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm not going to sing it.

231
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,340
I got a great idea. Why don't I show
Imogen my record collection?

232
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,140
Then you can pick out a track. And
I can dedicate it to you on the air.

233
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,140
This is perfect, come here.
I keep everything upstairs.

234
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,420
Alfred, she is adorable.
Get back to those potatoes.

235
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,220
-What song did my mom suggest?
-Something personal and timeless.

236
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,820
-A classic.
-So...

237
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,740
-"You Can Be My Bitch", by Master B?
-The live version or radio edit?

238
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,500
Live, since he burns the stage down
and starts a riot.

239
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,900
Nice.
Very nice.

240
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,300
-How about "Endless Love"?
-Doesn't one of them die in the end?

241
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,500
Good point.

242
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,940
-I've got it.
-What?

243
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,820
A little soul
is necessary in life.

244
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,580
Excuse me.

245
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
-Stick with the painting thing, please.
-Sometimes you just got to loosen up.

246
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,940
Can't be an old man.

247
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,980
You rock!

248
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,580
You know, I taught her that.

249
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,180
All right, maybe I had
to loosen up a little.

250
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,260
So I volunteered
for her art project.

251
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,860
-This sucks.
-Don't move an inch.

252
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,860
-You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
-More than you know.

253
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,060
As you've heard many times
before right here...

254
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,900
you're not prepared to cook vegetables
unless you're prepared to pick them.

255
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,500
You don' t just ask anybody to dance.
You ask the girl that looks good to you.

256
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,860
Now, what's wrong
with this picture?

257
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,140
This lady has had
a night of self-indulgence.

258
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,460
You don't take her home
to your mom.

259
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,940
This is perfection.
"P" for perfect.

260
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,500
No detergents
smelling up her aroma.

261
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,260
No bruises shading her figure.

262
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,900
No, this is perfect. Wait!
Where is Al?

263
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,180
Alfred?

264
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,940
There he is. Al, my son.
Al, come out here. Come on.

265
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,820
Don't dawdle. These people
have got places do go.

266
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,780
My son, Al,
ladies and gentlemen.

267
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,460
He's going to be a chef too.
He's so cute.

268
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,100
Feel that. You tell me,
is that perfection?

269
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,780
Yeah, it's pretty ripe.

270
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,500
Al knows how to pick perfection.
How do I know?

271
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,780
Because she's in the audience
right now. And she is a tomato.

272
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,940
Imogen. I said it right this time.
Stand up, honey.

273
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,100
Stand up. Come on.
There she is.

274
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,260
-Say hello to your parents.
-Hi.

275
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,140
-Did you pick perfection or what?
-Yeah, dad. She's perfect for me.

276
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,340
When you're falling in love, sometimes
one night makes it complete.

277
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,780
In our case, it was my birthday.

278
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,020
Imogen went all out.

279
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,660
"Find the other candle."

280
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,340
The other candle?

281
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,740
Happy birthday.

282
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,860
-You look...
-You like?

283
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,780
-I like it a lot.
-Good.

284
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,940
-Where are we?
-I wanted this night to be special.

285
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,660
I wanted to share something that's
important to me with you.

286
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,100
This is my favorite place
in New York. I come here a lot...

287
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,980
if I'm feeling down or homesick,
or if I just need a little inspiration.

288
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,260
This place has real soul.

289
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,260
It's not like those cheesy art galleries
which have T-shirts and postcards.

290
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,380
This is why I want
to be an artist.

291
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,940
Here, come on.

292
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,580
They're all so beautiful.

293
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,940
I don't know much about art.
I kind of stopped with finger-painting.

294
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,620
But I like this...

295
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,740
...blurry one.
-It's impressionistic.

296
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,100
It's not about how you see the world.
It's how the artist sees it.

297
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,420
It's somehow completely personal.

298
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,460
What do you see in this?

299
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,220
-Morning?
-Morning.

300
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,660
Well, yeah. See, because all the
colors, the oranges and yellows...

301
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,420
it kinda reminds me of
two people having eggs.

302
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,740
-I don' t know.
-Do you see what the artist did...

303
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
with the way the colors
blend with the light?

304
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,220
And the brush technique says
something about the ambiance.

305
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,660
It sets a mood with
its luminous tones...

306
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,940
and brilliant colors.
It's really just a moment captured...

307
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,500
but in away that
makes it feel...

308
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,980
alive.

309
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,180
You make me feel alive.

310
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,500
This is the best birthday
I've ever had.

311
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,340
There's more upstairs.

312
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,540
I'm falling in love with you.

313
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,420
I love you.

314
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,260
-What about foreplay?
-We've had it for 3 months. Relax.

315
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,980
It'll never be that
fast again. I promise.

316
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,100
Look, I was really nervous
that first night...

317
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,900
but I think I more than made up
for it the second time.

318
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,060
He really did make up for it.

319
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,500
And the cake was
a perfect encore.

320
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,340
She used to do
the cutest things...

321
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,980
Like scratching my stomach
when she wanted it in the morning.

322
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,140
Understandably, we'd have to keep
our faces from each other.

323
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,820
Morning breath is a killer.

324
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Of course, when he wanted it
in the morning he wasn't so subtle.

325
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,300
-But those were the best days.
-The honeymoon days...

326
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,700
-Where nothing mattered.
-Nothing but us.

327
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,780
But it wouldn't be long before
the year was over ...

328
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,100
-I was going to France that summer.
-I told her it's only France, 3 months.

329
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,940
-It wouldn't be so bad.
-I didn't want to leave.

330
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,620
I didn't want the year to end.
It was the best year of my life.

331
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,180
I'm in love.

332
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,260
-Tingles and everything?
-Yeah, tingles and everything.

333
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Love is a hoax. Our emotions are
all provoked by chemical reactions.

334
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,220
It creates this euphoria
that makes you stupid.

335
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,940
It's all biochemistry. Trust me.
It was my major.

336
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,060
I'm afraid it's true, Al.
All romantics are simply addicts.

337
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,740
You guys just need to experience
something of substance.

338
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,460
-Then you'll know my language.
-Prove this love.

339
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,740
You speak of its power.
Why not show us?

340
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,900
One of these is love,
the other, illusion.

341
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,980
Drink each and choose,
but choose wisely...

342
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
for there is no second chance.

343
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,020
You cannot have a test
without a wager.

344
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,180
Point taken.

345
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,540
If you fail, you have to be an extra
in the picture tomorrow night.

346
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,820
-And if I win?
-Then I'll buy you...

347
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,180
...an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner.
-I don't want all the sushi I can eat!

348
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,220
Trust me, you will.
Now drink.

349
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,340
Chop-chop.

350
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,540
The second one.

351
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,660
-You're certain?
-I'm positive.

352
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,300
This is love.
You chose illusion.

353
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,580
I... I didn't.
It's love, I know it.

354
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,980
Call us at 9 PM, baby.
Be ready to shine.

355
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,780
There's a party in 4O6.
Want to go?

356
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,820
I'm your friend so it's my duty
to warn you.

357
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,620
Soon those tingles will disappear
and you won't know what hit you.

358
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,740
Actually, I'm not going
to be around tonight.

359
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,100
No? Why?

360
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,300
I promised Monk I'd be en extra
in a film he's directing.

361
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,980
What?

362
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,820
I promised Monk I'd be an extra
in a film he's directing.

363
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,500
-You'll be an extra in a porno movie?
-An epic. They reinvented the genre.

364
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
-You're not going...
-No.

365
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,580
Besides, they're
paying me fifty bucks.

366
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,140
You'd rather be on
a movie set than...?

367
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,460
It's a battle scene and
the regular extras are on strike.

368
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm leaving for France in two weeks
and instead of sleeping with me...

369
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,820
you'd rather be a day-player
in some flick?

370
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,860
-It's an extra. It's a pay difference.
-Fine. This way we have it.

371
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,740
You can decide if we eat it too.

372
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,980
Action!

373
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,420
Watching Monk prepare to lead his
troops into battle, I kept wondering...

374
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,180
what was I doing?
I chose this over Imogen?

375
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,780
All I wanted to do was see her.

376
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,340
To be with her.

377
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,540
When you have moments
like that one...

378
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,660
you can't even imagine
it won't stay that way.

379
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,180
Look at those two.

380
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,900
They can't keep their hands
off each other.

381
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,340
I'll bet you they think they'll
always be that happy.

382
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,460
I have some errands to run.

383
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,700
So Imogen ended up going to France
for the summer.

384
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,860
Remember how I told her it was just
France and three months?

385
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,180
It turns out that whole distance thing
was a little harder than I thought.

386
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,700
Welcome back.

387
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,700
So, what do you think?

388
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,220
Very beefy, Eddie.

389
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,820
-What's with the Mullet cut?
-This? It's pretty cool, right?

390
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,980
These are coming back.

391
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,420
They are, just you wait.

392
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,260
-Your eyes are open.
-So?

393
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,100
-That's weird.
-Is it? Let me see.

394
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,740
-That is weird.
-Too weird.

395
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,620
Why? Don't you want to watch me,
watch my eyes while I kiss you?

396
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,460
-Isn't it better with the eyes closed?
-It depends on your mood, I guess.

397
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,820
-Stop.
-Why?

398
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,100
-What?
-I don't know.

399
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,740
-You like it?
-I don't know, it's different.

400
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,260
This needs to go upstairs
for approval.

401
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,220
So I'm in France for the summer. I've
spent summer there since I was a kid.

402
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,460
I'm meeting my dad's relatives in Nice,
clubbing with friends in Saint-Tropez.

403
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,100
I even took that funny-looking boat to
Corsica. I was having so much fun.

404
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,020
Did I miss Al?
Absolutely.

405
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,580
He was all I talked about with friends.
Then my cousin Maeva asked me:

406
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,420
-And I said: "What?"
-Married. Are you going to be married?

407
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,540
Of course not.
I'm only nineteen years old.

408
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,620
So now I'm back and lying in his arms.
It's so nice to back in those arms.

409
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,540
We're kissing and all I could think of
was that word: married.

410
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,340
And I started getting
really confused.

411
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,540
And my new room-mate
only offered, well...

412
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,980
...other distractions.
-Put this on. It's a doobie cap.

413
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,580
It, like, totally intensifies it.

414
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,340
Like, the pores in your head...

415
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,620
I don't know.

416
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,340
It just holds the smoke in your head
for, like, a lot longer.

417
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,220
It's so right.

418
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,180
Thank you.
I am so proud of you.

419
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,980
You did such a great job
on the show.

420
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,020
Everybody loves you.
You worked so hard.

421
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,740
You're going to be a senior.

422
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,900
So?

423
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,220
Don't you think you should get your
butt into gear? You have a future.

424
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,260
I plan on going to the French
Culinary Institute after I graduate.

425
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,980
That's a very smart move.

426
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,940
-I think I might have a smarter one.
-What?

427
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,220
I think we should do a show together.
Don't you think...

428
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,980
a father and son show
would be a great hook?

429
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,300
-What is it?
-You watch TV, right?

430
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,260
-What kind of shows do you watch?
-Talk-shows.

431
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,940
Right, what else?

432
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,820
-Enjoy it.
-"Cops".

433
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,620
So I say we do a reality
cooking show.

434
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,580
Explain.

435
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,340
Are you sitting down?
It's called "Cooks".

436
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,340
Now, imagine a truck, a big rig.

437
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,820
And it is stock piled with food
and wines and spices.

438
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,220
We travel around the country,
just you and me.

439
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,740
I do the driving.
I call the shots.

440
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,780
We drive all over the country and we
come to homes. Average homes.

441
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,940
Go! Go! Go!

442
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,740
At the homes we rush in and say:
"We're going to make you dinner."

443
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,540
We use the exciting style of all those
shows. Shaky camera and everything.

444
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,540
We've got a SWAT guy hold the mat
gun point so they can't runaway.

445
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,380
While we're in the kitchen, we say:
"What kind of meal would you like?"

446
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,180
-Chateaubriand?
-And then we cook.

447
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,740
But while we're cooking,
we teach.

448
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,140
-If we need something special...
-Garlic!

449
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,020
...a meat, a fish, a cheese, everyone
likes cheese... you got the truck.

450
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,460
It's bread!

451
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,940
Every week a new cuisine.
Every week...

452
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,740
a new home.
What do you think?

453
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,460
-Sounds like a winner, Dad.
-What's wrong?

454
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,380
-Imogen.
-No.

455
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,420
Things locked inside become cancer.
Do you know what a cancer does?

456
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,940
Costs a lot of money to treat.
I'm sorry. It's just...

457
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,940
she's been back awhile now
and it's not the same.

458
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,180
It's all about growing up
and growing together.

459
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,540
It's all about growing old
and growing apart.

460
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,500
Excuse me. It takes work, Al. So,
either you do the work or you get out.

461
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
That one's no good.

462
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,740
When guys drift from their loved ones
they sometimes drift toward...

463
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,940
how should I put this?
Less productive pursuits.

464
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,380
What's up?

465
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,820
Monk called.
Having people over.

466
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,460
I got a mid-term in the morning.

467
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,660
-He left this for you.
-You're lame, man.

468
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,220
Don't mess with these guns!
Don't mess with them!

469
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,460
You may be pretty, buff. But you look
a little bit like a Solid Gold dancer.

470
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,420
But my dad was right.
You gotta do the work.

471
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,500
So, I thought a day
in the country...

472
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,820
along with my famous smoked salmon
would help turn things around.

473
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,860
Is this cheese fat-free, yo?

474
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,420
Rid yourself of this health curse.
It'll only backfire in later days.

475
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:50,220
Yeah, eating habits are reflexive of,
like, sexual technique.

476
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,060
So did you really smoke
that fish yourself?

477
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,660
It's no big deal once you get
the hang of all the steps.

478
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,380
Then maybe you could cook
for me sometime.

479
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,060
That would be...

480
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,180
nice.
What do you fancy?

481
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,660
Any kind of meat.

482
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,700
-Catch us if you can.
-I'll be driving.

483
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,300
-No, you're a mess.
-You're drunk.

484
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,500
-Plus I got the keys.
-No, you don't.

485
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,060
Yes, you do.

486
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,780
"We should just sit here and wait."

487
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,420
Okay, relax. Somebody's bound
to come along.

488
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,500
-We're in the middle of nowhere.
-Don't worry. We're going to be okay.

489
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,700
-Don't be moody about it.
-I'm not. Don't give that moody crap.

490
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,860
Don't even think about it.

491
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,220
It didn't take much to see
the accident as a sign.

492
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,420
So while Monk was training
to play Macbeth...

493
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,700
Imogen and I decided
to start over.

494
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,260
-I cherish our walks in the park.
-They are nice.

495
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,700
Makes me feel good
about myself.

496
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,020
Your wounds from the crash
have healed. But tell me...

497
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,180
are things well between you
and Lady Imogen?

498
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,460
Very well, indeed.

499
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,340
Can you make a fair judgement?
Is she forever?

500
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,060
Well, we're much more
serious these days.

501
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,700
Enlighten me. I'm eager to hear
the talk of mortals.

502
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,420
What's great is the sharing.
She's really getting back into her art.

503
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,740
And she's really talented.

504
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,300
It's nice to accept each other's vices.
She's cut down since the crash.

505
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,260
It's her outlet.
I have my own.

506
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,860
And her work ethic is kicking in.
Which is good for anyone.

507
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,340
We've...

508
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,740
spruced up our sex life.

509
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,900
Making it a little bit more exotic.

510
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,220
On Sundays I cook a nice dinner.
We sit afterwards.

511
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,780
Sometimes we'll fool around
on the kitchen table.

512
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,700
But usually it's me reading
and her sketching.

513
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,420
Sure, we fight. One time, I
finnaly beat her at Ping-Pong.

514
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,340
And she didn't even high-fived me.
Maybe I was being a sore winner.

515
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,500
And that's when
the making up feels best.

516
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,620
-And you know what comes then?
-What?

517
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,140
The tingles.

518
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,660
-It's an enchanting tale.
-It's true.

519
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,180
You realize, of course, that this could
be your descent into timely separation.

520
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,460
-How?
-Like a ripe fruit...

521
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,460
it falls from the tree.
And that is nature's course.

522
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,140
I don't know what Monk
was talking about.

523
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,460
I thought things were
going pretty good.

524
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,780
In the morning.

525
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,300
-Why?
-Because I'm tired.

526
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,460
Are they ever going to shut up?

527
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,540
It's Friday night.
People are out.

528
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,180
Wait up. I just took
a dump in my pants.

529
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,820
Hello?
We're closed!

530
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,100
-It's what I wanna...
-Because...

531
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,300
-I've already got smell-o-vision.
-You must be a mom.

532
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,620
Welcome back to "The Man Show".
Tonight's topic:

533
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,460
men who wear the skirts
in their relationship.

534
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,900
Let me introduce you
to our guest, Al Connely.

535
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,580
Al can't even get sex from
his own girlfriend. Pathetic.

536
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,260
You're still in college, right?
Only going out for a year.

537
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,820
-For a while. It's not every night.
-What are you studying there?

538
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,700
Liberal arts.
But I want to be a chef.

539
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,420
I see. So you're bi, but you eventually
wanna go gay. Very ambitious.

540
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,340
-What kind of chef you wanna be?
-French cuisine.

541
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,820
French cuisine?

542
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,020
Cuisine? First of all,
it's food, all right?

543
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,020
That's your problem right there.
You're not much of a guy, Al.

544
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,500
No, I'm trying to respect her.

545
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,580
Al, can l... by the way,
can I call you Alice?

546
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,620
Let me tell you what women respect:
not being respected. Right, Jimmy?

547
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,220
Let's go to the audience, see if they
have any questions. You.

548
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,020
Al, could you cross your legs for me?
Your panties are starting to show.

549
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,140
What a nightmare.

550
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,940
Remind me to cancel cable.

551
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,660
Who can sleep now?

552
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,300
I didn't want him to feel rejected.
But I had other things on my mind.

553
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,980
Thing she couldn't understand.

554
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,260
When you watch people go through
this stuff on TV, it always seem fake.

555
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,820
But when it happens to you,
there's nothing fake about it.

556
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,820
-I thought we were careful.
-Oh, that's sincere.

557
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,060
-Why did you wait so long to tell me?
-I was hoping it 'd come.

558
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,500
-But you're usually pretty regular.
-You don't know, it's not your body!

559
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,540
-Relax.
-I will not relax!

560
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,620
Let's just get it over with.
We are here together.

561
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,540
We can do this together.

562
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,140
I'm sorry.

563
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,180
I just need to be
by myself right now.

564
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,700
I'm sorry.

565
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,060
So there I was, smacked in the middle
of every girl's nightmare.

566
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,620
I know it must have been
just as hard for Al.

567
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,620
And he was so sincere when he said
we can do this together.

568
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,860
But I just needed to be alone.

569
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,980
Who am I kidding?
I needed to freak out.

570
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,700
Now, instead of the word "married"
frightening me, it was "mother".

571
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,660
I was so terrified and nervous
I asked Lana to read the results.

572
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,020
I think it's like, pink.
That means "no", right?

573
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,180
The biggest relief
I have ever felt in my life.

574
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,820
But after the false alarm,
we started getting distant.

575
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,660
We were carrying more responsibilities
than we could handle.

576
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,820
We just wanted to act our age.

577
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,340
Actually, I wanted to work things out.
Al wanted to act our age.

578
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,220
What do college kids do
when they can't handle reality?

579
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,060
Party! Party!

580
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,940
Al thought it 'd be better to go to one
of Monk's parties and forget about us.

581
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,940
And I ended up going, but with
a chip on my shoulder. A big one.

582
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,260
-Is everything in full swing here?
-Yes.

583
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,820
No one goes hungry or thirsty.
No one goes home alone.

584
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,260
Hello, darling. How are you?
Have you tried the machine? Do try.

585
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,060
Here's where the beautiful
people are hiding.

586
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,900
-How about a drink?
-The bar's straight left, friend.

587
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,060
I've never seen
your "Camelot" before.

588
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,300
Then see it from
the king's eyes.

589
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,260
Don't worry, friend.
I'll return her.

590
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,340
Does that feel good?

591
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,060
-Yes.
-You want to go next, big boy?

592
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,340
So you're ready for another?

593
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,540
-Name, rank and serial number.
-How goes it?

594
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,020
Tipsy goes it.
Want some?

595
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,500
Is this love or illusion?

596
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,580
Burgundy.

597
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,020
Feel those endorphins?

598
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,820
I have more.

599
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,380
-What's this?
-Don't you wanna make me pancakes?

600
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,140
But that's part of the challenge.

601
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,580
-Don't you get tired of doing press?
-Yes, yes.

602
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,060
Quite, quite. But it sells
pictures, sweetheart.

603
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,380
-Just make me pancakes.
-I think...

604
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,740
And you can make them before...

605
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,820
or after.

606
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,100
I was reluctant to take the role.

607
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,540
Mr. Morrison!
You've met Lady Imogen?

608
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,220
We know each other.

609
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,660
No one ever made me pancakes.

610
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,380
Cyrus.

611
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,260
I'm in love with someone else.

612
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,660
I can't make you anything.

613
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,700
When I'm with my bass...

614
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,460
It's like I'm with a woman.
And when I play...

615
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,980
it's like we're spooning.
But while we spoon...

616
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,660
we make music.
That's why I play, man.

617
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,460
-That's cool.
-There you are.

618
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,740
Name's Morrison. Jim...

619
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,260
...Morrison.
-I'm sorry. This is...

620
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,820
Alfred Connely.

621
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,340
-So, what year are you?
-Dropped out.

622
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,740
I felt like I had to focus
my energy on my music.

623
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,460
-And I deal drugs on the side.
-How productive.

624
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,180
Imogen tell you she's designing
my album cover?

625
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,820
I didn't want to jinx it in case I felt
pressured while I was working on it.

626
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,340
Yo, folks?

627
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,820
So I'm baking hash cakes over
at Lana's, right?

628
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,060
And Imogen comes over, and so I start
to hit on her because she's hot.

629
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:36,740
She tells me she's got this boyfriend
or something, but I'm cool with that.

630
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,220
So then I asked her if I could see some
of her paintings. They're so good.

631
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,660
-She's a very talented lady.
-Yeah! So good!

632
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,380
I'm going to the bathroom.

633
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,820
I'll go with you.

634
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,140
Wait up.

635
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,340
So what's your deal, man?

636
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,860
-I work in TV. "Cops".
-No way.

637
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,900
My old man is a cop.
Real tough one.

638
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,420
Blew somebody away the other day
right in front of me.

639
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,060
-You got some beer on your back.
-So what?

640
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,700
Don't let that
get you down, man.

641
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,420
Light my fire, moron.

642
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,740
What the hell is this
about an album cover?

643
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,140
-So?
-So? He just wants to ring your bell.

644
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,580
What about Cyrus's bell? You have
naked pictures of her under your bed!

645
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,260
-And last week I saw you with her.
-We're just friends.

646
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,620
-She's going through a bad time.
-I'm sure.

647
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,460
Why the hell didn't you tell me about
that lizard king's album cover?

648
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,980
So what? Are you afraid that I'm
gonna do something without you?

649
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,980
-You're being a real bitch, you know!
-You are an old man and I hate that!

650
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,660
And I hate you!

651
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,940
They don't understand me.

652
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,620
And I bet they don't
get you either, huh?

653
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,460
I'm going to say something
real important here.

654
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,140
This is definitely the best
conversation I've had all night.

655
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,620
Look, Hicks,
would you cut it out?

656
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,860
Hicks, cut it out.

657
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,300
Get your damn hands off of her.

658
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,420
Why can't I get
a girlfriend like yours?

659
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,540
It's me. I'm downstairs.

660
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,620
I'm sorry.

661
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,820
I am.

662
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,300
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

663
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,980
I slept with Jim last night.

664
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,260
Get the fuck out!

665
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,580
All right. Just, before
you hate me, hear me out.

666
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,260
It was a horrible mistake. In one night
I destroyed everything Al and I had.

667
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,220
And I was an absolute coward for it.
But I just wanted my youth back.

668
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,700
There was no way to apologize
after that. It was over.

669
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,220
I felt like there was only one thing
I could do: leave.

670
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:46,380
Just go and start over. But I couldn't
do that until I told him how I felt.

671
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,860
I just wish I had
the courage to stay.

672
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,700
I used to sit in my room
with my sketchpad...

673
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,260
whether it was
at home or here...

674
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,180
and within a few seconds,
I would be somewhere else.

675
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,820
And that was so special to me.

676
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,500
But...

677
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,900
for some reason...

678
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,660
I can't get to
that place anymore.

679
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,580
I'm so sorry that I hurt you
the way that I did.

680
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,740
I can't do this anymore.

681
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,620
I have, I need to go.

682
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,460
Ouch!
That kind of sucked.

683
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,900
Anyway. After that, Imogen moved
to San Francisco to finish school.

684
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:08,020
And me? How did I end up?
Well, you'll see.

685
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,260
Graduation came and went.

686
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,420
You'd think I'd feel fulfilled,
but I didn't.

687
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,620
I was starting to get down,
so I went to Monk for advice.

688
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:23,300
-I need to talk.
-Should I open with a joke?

689
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,740
-I can't even eat anymore.
-There's too much base on my cheeks.

690
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,020
My regular make-up girl
is free-lancing for Stallone.

691
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,020
He was giving a lecture
about censorship and art.

692
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,100
And he wouldn't
even listen to me.

693
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,300
Time to summon the blood,
time to summon the blood.

694
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,460
We stopped being friends
after that.

695
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,540
I found myself staying
indoors, a lot.

696
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:03,780
One day, a little spider
came down from the ceiling.

697
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,900
His name was Owen, he told me he'd
lived in that apartment his whole life.

698
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,180
And that he'd never seen a tenant
spend so much time alone.

699
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,180
He asked if I wanted him to spin a web
over the door, so no one could get in.

700
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,180
I told him: "No, thanks".

701
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,660
Even though it sounded
like the best idea yet.

702
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,620
But Owen the spider had a good point:
"Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

703
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,460
It's boring."
So I decided to date again.

704
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:37,380
I only allow myself to have crabs on
weekends. So thank God it's Friday.

705
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,500
Are you going to eat your bread?

706
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:46,020
He's cute and he didn't bring me
to a cheap restaurant. Okay. Bye.

707
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
My dad.
He just likes to check in.

708
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,780
State requires that I wear a tracking
device or I violate my parole.

709
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,460
I know this is a little bit silly,
but do I have any food in my teeth?

710
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,820
As you can see,
my choices were limited.

711
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:11,220
So one day I bumped into Cyrus
and we started having a fling.

712
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:16,340
Trouble is she had this thing
about Barnes and Noble bookstores.

713
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,900
But I could never bring myself
to make her pancakes.

714
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,380
I heard she went back to MIT.

715
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,700
So, I thought going to the Culinary
Institute would turn my life around.

716
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,260
But food never tasted
like it used to do.

717
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,860
I started cutting class.

718
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,980
I flunked the pop quiz
on fish fileting.

719
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,060
And pretty soon
I was a culinary drop-out.

720
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,820
With nothing else to do, I was forced
to go bar-hopping with Hicks.

721
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,180
I'd sure like to unfold
her napkin, you know?

722
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,300
-God, I'm feeling grabby tonight.
-Last night wasn't enough?

723
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,900
I didn't arrive.

724
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:17,660
-You didn't arrive?
-No, I was too wasted.

725
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,900
-Was she older or younger?
-Sixty.

726
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:25,820
-You slept with a 6O-year old woman?
-When you work in physical therapy...

727
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,020
...you make friends fast.
-My God.

728
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,420
-I'm not interested anymore...
-No way!

729
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,940
It's just what I need.

730
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,340
-The economy catch.
-It was your idea, damn it!

731
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,660
She's with a guy.

732
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,020
-But they are fighting, Al.
-Go!

733
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,580
They are fighting.

734
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,900
'Sup?'sup?

735
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,900
You want some of this?

736
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,500
Get the hell out of here!

737
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,380
I had moved into
my own little studio.

738
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,700
I stood there wondering where
she was at that moment...

739
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,940
what she was doing.
How did her hair look?

740
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,940
I just wanted to see her again.

741
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,140
I'd saved all these things
from our past.

742
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:36,100
Letters, tapes we made
to each other, pictures.

743
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,100
I just wanted to look
through it all again.

744
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,420
Remember it.
Remember her.

745
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:50,020
When I was thru, instead of feeling like
I could shake things off and move on...

746
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,980
I felt the opposite.

747
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,580
We can do silly things for love.

748
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,820
You wouldn't believe what I did.

749
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,060
Luckily he had a phenomenal amount
of alcohol in his blood...

750
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,940
which kept the shampoo from circulating
before we could get it out of him.

751
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,180
Shampoo?

752
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:04,020
We're gonna have a psych evaluate
him. Maybe we'll get some answers.

753
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,460
-Can we see him?
-Sure.

754
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,660
Come on. Shampoo?

755
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,900
-What did you do?
-We were worried sick.

756
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,260
-Look what you put your mother through!
-They want a psych to check you out.

757
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,260
Mom, Dad, stop.

758
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,500
I'm okay.

759
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,620
Yes, you are.

760
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:39,340
So why don't you tell us
about this shampoo thing?

761
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,900
You drank the shampoo because
you hoped you were immune to it?

762
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,180
-Right.
-You hoped you were immune to it?

763
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,780
-The shampoo.
-Why did you hope you were immune?

764
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,060
Because if I was immune to it
then I wouldn't need it again ever.

765
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:55,140
-The shampoo?
-No, her.

766
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,060
But you weren't immune to it. You
needed to have your stomach pumped.

767
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,300
-That's what worries me.
-When was the last time you saw her?

768
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,820
It's been a while.
She moved out west to start over.

769
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,700
I found out she's working for
a publishing company, doing artwork.

770
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:12,740
Have you had any
girlfriends since?

771
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,340
That's my number. From the sound of
all this, I think I found my next book.

772
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,740
-How are you feeling?
-Pumping me with garlic and olive oil.

773
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,620
-What are you going to do next?
-I was thinking about...

774
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,700
giving Paul John Breslin
at Oceana a call.

775
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:41,300
Oceana? He's a Mussolini. Why not
just go dry dishes somewhere?

776
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,180
-You don't need that.
-Dad, I do need that.

777
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,900
I wasn't going to tell you this
until you were better.

778
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:53,500
You know our show, "Cooks"?
It's been approved.

779
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,260
We can do it the way
we talked about it.

780
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,460
Dad, I kinda wanna work my way up.
"Cooks" is your thing.

781
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,980
You know, sometimes I don't even
know if you're making sense.

782
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,300
Dad.

783
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,740
I know what I need to do.

784
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:21,260
I was thinking about having
this party for you, for the show.

785
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,500
Maybe we should have it anyway.

786
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,780
You can invite all your friends.
We'll have fun.

787
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,420
No shampoo.

788
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:52,300
-Excellent choice.
-I knew you'd approve.

789
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,340
-Always.
-Remember the first time we heard it?

790
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,420
I do.

791
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,940
I would like you to meet Emma.

792
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,380
Sorry we didn't meet at the club, but
I was busy looking to take Eddie home.

793
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,860
We had ice-cream and
he listened to my problems...

794
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,260
and then we fell asleep
in each other's arms.

795
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,940
We...

796
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,380
kind of hit it off.

797
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,540
-That's really cool.
-Shit.

798
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,900
We're going to miss Shark Week.

799
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,020
She loves the Discovery Channel.
What can I tell you?

800
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,740
-Let's take a cab, okay?
-No, subway is faster.

801
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,180
I'm not good with open wounds.

802
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,260
You were always my Lancelot.

803
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,460
I was just never your king.

804
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,140
A lot of good moments
in that park down there.

805
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,260
How is the Renaissance?

806
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:30,300
It's good. My new book
is out next month.

807
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:36,780
I'm doing the university lecture
tour thing.

808
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,220
The movies are always there,
always making money.

809
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,780
But I'd only admit this to you.
I miss the tingles.

810
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,460
I heard a rumor you tried to...

811
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,580
end it.

812
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,340
I tried to get my life back
through a...

813
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,260
romantic exorcism.

814
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,780
It's not the meaning of life, Alfred.
It's the feeling of life.

815
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,220
Look at that park down there.

816
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,660
Just think how many loves
lost and found in it.

817
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:23,820
How many first kisses kissed.
Frisbees lost.

818
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,140
And just remember...

819
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,780
that's your park, friend.

820
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:35,300
And you've got your whole life
to walk through it.

821
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:15,260
I was in town so I called you at your
old number. It was disconnected.

822
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:20,380
-I moved.
-I know. I called your parents.

823
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,260
They filled me in.

824
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,540
San Francisco seems
to agree with you.

825
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,540
You even have a tinge
of Haigh-Ashbury.

826
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,300
It's kinda hard to dodge that style
when you live in the Haigh.

827
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:55,140
Must be nice, though. Having a job,
doing what you love.

828
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,620
Sometimes I think it's silly.

829
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,340
But then when I go to the bookstores
and I see the covers that I've done...

830
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:06,100
-I don't know. It's kind of cool.
-It's really cool.

831
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,020
I mean, they flew you out here
for a book convention...

832
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,980
and put you up in a hotel
for the whole weekend.

833
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:16,180
Sounds like you're doing
really well.

834
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,660
So...

835
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,140
you're going to work in fish.

836
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,660
You know how I feel about fish.

837
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,820
-That one has a really nice view.
-I've seen better.

838
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,580
Megan, sweetie, come on.

839
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,140
You know what my fear is?

840
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,220
-What?
-One day we'll pass on the street...

841
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,020
...and have an artificial conversation.
-That's the worst.

842
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,020
So, you're going home tomorrow?

843
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,700
Actually, today.
My flight is in two hours.

844
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,180
The sun will be up soon.

845
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,620
I can't believe we spent
the whole night walking around.

846
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:58,060
-This looks familiar.
-I try to avoid this corner.

847
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,340
Let's go over there. It'll help you
overcome your demons.

848
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,540
-Now you're the therapist again.
-And you're the patient again.

849
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,660
As always.

850
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,780
So can I psychoanalyze you?

851
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,740
Sure.

852
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:28,020
Post-collegiate years:
half-empty or half-full?

853
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,740
-Half-empty.
-I'd have to go with half-empty too.

854
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,700
Greatest accomplishment
since I last saw you?

855
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,620
Making friends with a spider.

856
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:45,820
-Vices?
-Shampoo.

857
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,940
Was that rumor true?

858
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,780
It's open to interpretation.

859
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,140
What are your vices?

860
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:00,500
-It's supposed to be about you, not me.
-It's been about you a little bit.

861
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:05,380
-The sun's going to come up soon.
-Don't change the subject.

862
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,700
You.

863
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,540
You mean that?

864
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,980
I should go.

865
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,020
I really should go.
My flight's in...

866
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,940
I've gotta go to my hotel and get
my bags, and I'm gonna be late.

867
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,860
Will I see you again?

868
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Just open it after I leave.

869
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,180
How can this work?

870
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,300
I don't know.

871
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,740
-But we've come this far.
-I thought we met too young.

872
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,460
But in starting over we could get
some place different.

873
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,260
Some place we never imagined.

874
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:32,300
Al was right.
We met too young.

875
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,180
But Imogen was right.
We could start over.

876
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:39,060
-Starting over meant making choices.
-So I made one.

877
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,900
I got a job at
a four-star restaurant...

878
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,020
in San Francisco.

879
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,060
-Now...
-I'm home.

880
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,860
I had one thing left to prove.

881
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,940
"Why are you walking around in
the dark? Go turn on the lights."

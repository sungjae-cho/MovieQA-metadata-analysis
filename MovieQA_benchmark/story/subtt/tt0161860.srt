1
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,764
I couldn't really remember
what Germany was like.

2
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,833
I knew they had snow and seasons...

3
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:14,569
and our family had lived there.

4
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,173
Not only Mama and Papa,
but the whole family.

5
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,007
And it was nice.

6
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,884
But I also remember
that I was always afraid...

7
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,119
of other children and people...

8
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,555
and even dogs.

9
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,417
Watch out!

10
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:42,612
Come here. Let me help you.

11
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:54,440
NOWHERE IN AFRICA

12
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,515
I remember Germany as a dark place.

13
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,685
Not as bright and hot as Kenya.

14
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,922
A place with large buildings
and dismal rooms.

15
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,691
Papa always says,
"Germany is our home."

16
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:09,427
I think he just misses his father...

17
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,898
my grandfather.

18
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:14,767
He couldn't eat cookies with nuts,
because he was allergic.

19
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,537
He really liked Heinrich Heine's poems...

20
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:21,153
especially the ones about Germany.

21
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:27,581
I had two aunts in Germany
that I liked an awful lot.

22
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,818
Aunt Käthe was Mama's sister.
Papa's sister was Liesl.

23
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:35,366
Sometimes they helped out in Grandpa's
hotel, the "Adler" in Sohrau.

24
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:39,768
That was in the good old days
before the Nazis came.

25
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:48,869
Can I help you?

26
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,638
No, thank you.

27
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,762
We have to go now.

28
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:18,035
The Nazis forbade Papa to work as a
lawyer and took away Grandpa's hotel.

29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,338
Soon none of our family had a job.

30
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:26,149
When I asked my parents why that was so,
I always got the same answer:

31
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:30,051
"Because we're Jews, Regina. That's why."

32
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,109
What's wrong?

33
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,812
An urgent message!

34
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,241
Walter!

35
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:04,778
Wake up!

36
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:08,654
- This is quinine. It's good for you.
- Leave me alone!

37
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,090
Come on! Wake up!

38
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,728
Give me the coffee.

39
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,521
Hurry!

40
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:23,243
Good heavens, Walter, wake up!

41
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,961
Come on, open your mouth!

42
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,937
Breslau, January 1938

43
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:56,842
- Jettel, can I have some apple juice?
- Ask Klara, please.

44
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:03,418
Anna, I'm glad you could come
despite the snow. Come in.

45
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,815
- Good evening, Mrs. Redlich.
- Good evening.

46
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,012
Move it!

47
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,417
Don't talk to Jews!

48
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,198
Stop playing with those matches!

49
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:25,746
- You're going to burn down the house!
- Sure thing, Klara!

50
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:30,835
Here, a sausage.

51
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,211
You gotta get used to it!

52
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,380
Negroes always eat it black.

53
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:38,249
- No, they don't.
- Or raw and bloody!

54
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:41,686
I know they eat dogs
from my Geography book.

55
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,791
They eat grasshoppers, too.
Here, hold him.

56
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:50,696
You wanna go to Africa?
You're even afraid to touch a dachshund.

57
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:51,790
Grandpa!

58
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:57,369
- Are there nuts in it?
- They're the only cookies I could get.

59
00:06:57,475 --> 00:07:01,041
- Oh, Klara.
- There aren't many nuts in them anyway.

60
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,243
- You have to sneeze, right?
- Right.

61
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:08,054
Every time I eat nuts I have to sneeze.
Every darn time.

62
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,553
I really loved the green one.

63
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:17,692
Walter bought me this for New Year's,
but it isn't really my style.

64
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,627
I think it's very elegant.

65
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,222
Then take it.

66
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:27,748
You're such a sweetheart, Jettel.
Thanks.

67
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:31,106
Käthchen, don't cry today, okay?

68
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,675
Do I dare to wear this?

69
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,677
It fits your rear end!

70
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:36,979
- Mrs. Redlich--
- Men like 'em round.

71
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,551
That's for me!

72
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:42,130
This is for you, Klara!
Glitter is what you need.

73
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,389
Thank you.

74
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,326
What's wrong?

75
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,052
It's from Africa.

76
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:01,239
Rongai, Kenya, 2 December 1937.

77
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,777
My beloved Jettel:

78
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:07,912
I can imagine that this letter
will upset you, so try to be strong.

79
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:10,181
Last week,
the Jewish community in Nairobi...

80
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:13,284
agreed to pay for your immigration.

81
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,587
After six months here...

82
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,761
I'll finally be able
to organize the trip for you and Regina.

83
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,595
I beg you not to wait another day.

84
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,531
Go see Karl Silbermann at once.

85
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:29,045
He can help you
with the tickets for the ship.

86
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,872
It doesn't matter
what kind of ship or how long it takes.

87
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,385
Just so it takes you.

88
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,778
What we need here is a refrigerator.

89
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:43,183
If it doesn't fit in our chests,
then throw out the Rosenthal china.

90
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,949
It's useless here.

91
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,623
Also, get kerosene lamps, mosquito nets...

92
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,359
and sturdy shoes for you and Regina.

93
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,162
Don't try to bring any cash
or jewelry with you.

94
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:58,866
You know what Nazis do to smugglers.
And say as little as possible.

95
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,003
There's no one you can trust...

96
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,406
not even people we called
our best friends.

97
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,978
Oh, Jettel, my heart wants to burst
at the thought of embracing you two.

98
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:15,290
But it grows heavy imagining how much
this letter will hurt your mother.

99
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:24,094
Walter, you've got malaria.

100
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:28,098
You have to take this quinine.
It's very important.

101
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:31,701
I have to get back to the farm.
Owuor will take care of you.

102
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:34,605
He needs the quinine 3 times a day.

103
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,871
3 times 40 drops.

104
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:43,442
Understand?

105
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:44,945
I understand.

106
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,599
Max, we have to go!

107
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,671
I hate having to say goodbye.

108
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:09,287
I can't stand train stations either.

109
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,590
This will all be over in one or two years.

110
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,672
So you two are sticking together?

111
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:33,412
Promise me that
you'll stick it out together.

112
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:43,352
One person always loves more.
That's what makes it so difficult.

113
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:48,221
And the one who loves more
is vulnerable.

114
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,358
My son loves you...

115
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,222
very much.

116
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:05,505
I'm going to miss you so much, Max.

117
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,272
Mama!

118
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,639
Tell her goodbye, please.

119
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:36,807
Eat this.
It will take the fire out of your body.

120
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:39,841
Very good!

121
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:48,413
- Ever heard of the "Silesian Heaven?"
- "Silesian?"

122
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,724
Meat, potatoes, bacon and dried fruit
all mixed together.

123
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:57,792
I don't understand a word!

124
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,974
In my first life I was a lawyer.

125
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,242
Owuor, this is for you.

126
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:48,443
- You're giving me your coat?
- It's a robe.

127
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:51,577
I was ill, and you looked after me.

128
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,920
I am very grateful to you, Owuor.

129
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:58,789
I wore the robe in my homeland.

130
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,729
I wasn't a bwana there.

131
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:06,705
I worked with my head.

132
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,774
And here you don't want
to wear the robe anymore?

133
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,570
You have to be smart to wear a robe.

134
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:19,846
Here in Rongai you're smart. Not me.

135
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:25,681
I'll have to say the word often...

136
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:29,024
so I can pronounce it
just like you do.

137
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:32,859
Thank you.

138
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:42,199
We traveled 6 weeks
by steamship around Africa.

139
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:45,836
On 20th April 1938,
the Führer's birthday...

140
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:47,504
we arrived in Nairobi.

141
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,552
Regina, take this please.

142
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:53,476
Mrs. Redlich?

143
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,214
Mr. Morrison, who owned the cattle farm
where Papa worked...

144
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,420
picked us up at the train station.

145
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,145
It reminded me of chocolate
and what Mama told me on the ship.

146
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,718
We were poor now.

147
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,351
"So there's no chocolate for poor kids,"
she said.

148
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,798
And I had promised to be brave.

149
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,632
Hey, come here!

150
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,539
- What did the cow die of?
- We don't have enough water.

151
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,655
Shit! It's always the same!

152
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,011
You have to dig a well!

153
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,311
A well!

154
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:17,067
There's a car!

155
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:28,710
Where?

156
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:30,912
Over there!

157
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,323
Everything's all right now.

158
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,690
My dearest.

159
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,734
Welcome.

160
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,607
Welcome, little memsaab.

161
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,042
Come here.

162
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,249
Welcome to Rongai!

163
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:52,235
Regina, my girl! Come here!

164
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:56,274
Papa! We traveled by ship,
and we were in England and Morocco...

165
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:57,974
and all over the harbor.

166
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,649
I saw dolphins, and Mama danced.

167
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,156
Bwana, he means water.

168
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:55,003
Tell the man what to do.

169
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:56,473
Yes, bwana.

170
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:47,992
Your father took care of the paperwork,
the refugee tax and everything.

171
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:52,431
We were lucky. In Hamburg they only
opened one chest full of clothes.

172
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:54,266
Max gave me "Magic Mountain" for you.

173
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:58,577
Thank goodness
the books were in the other chest.

174
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,369
I'm sorry, Jettel.

175
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,376
I know this isn't what
you were expecting.

176
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,880
It's lovely.

177
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,563
But we can't live here.

178
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:29,003
Not that one!
Don't unpack the patterned china.

179
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:32,278
We won't be staying here long.

180
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:54,764
Learn German
if you want to talk to me.

181
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,029
Plate.

182
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,705
Careful!

183
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:44,286
Jettel, my name is Süsskind.

184
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,887
Also Walter.

185
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,531
- But everyone calls me Süsskind.
- I see.

186
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:55,636
Walter is showing Regina the farm.
They'll be back soon.

187
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,003
- Like to have dinner with us?
- Very kind of you. Yes.

188
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:04,006
I just spent four hours
driving through the desert.

189
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:08,180
You'll probably have to
put up with me for the night.

190
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:13,820
I brought you some onions and sugar.

191
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:16,112
And cigarettes.

192
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,612
Thank you.

193
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,196
Thank you.

194
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,331
Blessed Sabbath.

195
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,703
I haven't heard the Kiddush for ages.

196
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:06,639
Up to now I've never felt I needed God.

197
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,275
If you take quinine every day,
you'll go blind.

198
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,007
What about malaria?

199
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:15,151
You can always combat it
if you catch it in time.

200
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,553
Here's to the arrival
of Jettel and Regina.

201
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,091
To our second life.

202
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,354
Cheers.

203
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,899
How long have you been
away from home?

204
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,335
This is my home.

205
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,437
Süsskind was smart enough
to leave Germany in '33.

206
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,972
It was easier to leave back then.

207
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:41,611
They let you take all your money, right?

208
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,448
- And all your books.
- What about your wife?

209
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:48,551
Weren't you ever married?

210
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,124
No, I wasn't.

211
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,919
- Why not?
- Jettel!

212
00:24:54,629 --> 00:25:00,132
It was always my bad luck to fall
in love with women who were already taken.

213
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:07,170
My mother says
someone will have to stop the Nazis.

214
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:12,152
Germany is rich in culture,
the home of Goethe and Schiller.

215
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:15,446
Papa, I think I heard some lions.

216
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:19,717
Nonsense. There aren't any lions around
here. Those are monkeys, baboons.

217
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:23,789
Maybe the lion is just acting
like a monkey.

218
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:26,158
You have a great future here.

219
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:29,830
You're already talking like a Negro.

220
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,105
"The air is cool and darkling

221
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,008
"And peaceful flows the Rhine

222
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:45,678
"The mountain top is sparkling
The setting sunbeams shine

223
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:49,516
"The fairest maid is reclining
in wondrous beauty there

224
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:51,652
"Her golden jewels are shining

225
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:54,687
"She combs her golden hair

226
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:58,292
"With a golden comb she is combing,
and sings a song so free

227
00:25:58,397 --> 00:26:02,705
"It casts a spell on the gloaming,
a magical melody

228
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:07,536
"The boatman listens, and o'er him
wild-aching passions roll

229
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:12,483
"He sees but the maiden before him
He sees not reef or shoal

230
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:17,345
"I think, at last the wave swallows
the boat and the boatman's cry

231
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,948
"And this is the fate that follows

232
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,285
"The song of the Lorelei"

233
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,297
Sleep tight, my angel.

234
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:56,258
You didn't bring the fridge, did you?

235
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:01,092
No, I didn't.

236
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,392
Why not?

237
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,598
There was no room in the chests--

238
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:08,101
But enough room
for your floral-patterned china?

239
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:12,877
- There wasn't enough money, anyway.
- What did you do with the money?

240
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,876
If you really want to know...

241
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,879
I bought this at Wertheim's in Breslau.

242
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:23,291
It cost 45 marks and is beautiful.

243
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,126
You bought an evening gown.

244
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:30,819
Yes.

245
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,072
...that he gives...

246
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:48,537
his name to...

247
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,916
...and leaves the mark
of his personality...

248
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:57,653
indelibly on his time...

249
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,156
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear his voice.

250
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,660
I'll leave it here so you can stay
in touch with the outer world.

251
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,790
And you?

252
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:07,765
- Goodbye.
- We can't accept it.

253
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,540
Of course you can. I have another one.

254
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:17,248
Anyway, it'll give me a reason
to stop by now and then...

255
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,411
to charge the battery.

256
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:22,116
Do you have to go now?

257
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:27,052
In this country we should forget
formalities and use the personal "you."

258
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:28,919
Don't you think so?

259
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,927
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- Yes, why?

260
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:40,665
- Since Jettel and Regina are here.
- Morrison left me one.

261
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:43,974
Good luck with the well.

262
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:06,472
Come on, little memsaab!

263
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,695
You see that mountain?

264
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,530
That's Mount Kenya.

265
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,333
It's holy.

266
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,732
Mount Kenya.

267
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:21,119
Come with me, little memsaab.

268
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:26,792
Mama said I wasn't allowed
to go any further than this ridge.

269
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,878
Can you help me?

270
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:02,051
- Memsaab?
- Help me!

271
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:07,066
I'm a cook.
Cooks don't dig in the ground.

272
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,032
The ground is thirsty.

273
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:15,128
You need more water.

274
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:17,797
Come with me!

275
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,102
Water.

276
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:45,032
No men?

277
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:48,436
No, men don't carry water.

278
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,532
That's women's work.

279
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:10,137
Help me! It's so heavy!

280
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:28,880
Owuor, help me, please!

281
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:31,616
The water is so heavy.

282
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,348
Help us, too!

283
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,248
Please, give me the shovel!

284
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,624
Fire.

285
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,133
Yes, fire.

286
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,973
There's no water in this ground here.

287
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:28,350
- I told you so.
- You were right, Cepoi.

288
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,983
I'm sorry.

289
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:37,891
Go home!
And thank you. Thank you very much.

290
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,494
6 months later.

291
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:55,572
Why doesn't Owuor ever slaughter
a chicken? Nobody would notice.

292
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:58,543
- Regina, put the doll down.
- We aren't allowed to eat them.

293
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:02,779
It's our agreement with Morrison.
Only the eggs.

294
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:06,317
I can't stand this muck anymore!
I need meat!

295
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,049
Thank you, Owuor.

296
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:13,725
Fire!

297
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:24,403
You have to look at a fire...

298
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:27,780
when it has slept for a long time.

299
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:31,073
Don't worry, Jettel.

300
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:35,628
It's just a common bushfire.
It won't reach the house.

301
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,668
Where are you going?

302
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,106
- To pack! I'm leaving!
- Nonsense!

303
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:00,641
- I can't stand it here any longer!
- You have to.

304
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,237
You always say that!

305
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:06,081
But I want to go home to Mother
and Käthe, to people I understand.

306
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:09,485
You don't earn a thing.
All we eat are eggs and cornmeal.

307
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,756
How can we ever send Regina to school?
She can't always hang around with Owuor!

308
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:17,326
- Damn it! We're alive!
- Yes, we're alive!

309
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,989
But what for?

310
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:24,701
To hope for rain,
so these cows that aren't ours don't die?

311
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,104
My God, I feel like I'm dead,
and sometimes I wish I were!

312
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,342
Don't ever say that again!
We just got out in the nick of time.

313
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,515
What are you talking about?

314
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:41,921
Last night the Nazis in Germany burned
down synagogues and looted Jewish shops.

315
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,456
They smashed everything to pieces.

316
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:48,573
People, buildings, stores, everything.

317
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:52,431
How did you find out
on this goddamn farm?

318
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:56,309
From a Swiss radio station this morning.

319
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:06,011
The Nazis no longer see us as humans.

320
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:10,083
Damn it. I saw it coming.

321
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:13,120
I saw it from the beginning.

322
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:18,399
Don't you realize that it doesn't matter
when and if Regina learns to read?

323
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:24,265
What about Mama, Käthe...

324
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,767
- your father?
- I have no idea!

325
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:30,782
I kept telling them they had to leave!

326
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:50,088
10th November 1938.

327
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:51,863
Dear Father:

328
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:56,766
I am very upset about the news
I hear from Germany.

329
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:59,803
People fear that war is inevitable.

330
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,569
What do you think?

331
00:36:03,012 --> 00:36:05,843
If I only knew how you are doing.

332
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:09,146
If I earned some money,
I'd have you come here.

333
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,883
Don't you see any opportunity
to leave Germany?

334
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,456
I beg you...

335
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:16,990
Father...

336
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:20,358
How I long for a conversation
with you...

337
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:23,872
for your advice, your sympathy.

338
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:32,872
Being abroad, I have become aware how
blessed I am to have parents like you...

339
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:36,642
and how grateful I am for everything
you did for me.

340
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:41,748
Your money wasn't wasted by allowing me
to study so long after mother's death.

341
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:47,265
One day your son will certainly be
the lawyer you were always so proud of.

342
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:08,946
Come here, little memsaab.

343
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:27,802
It needs you. It is a child like you.

344
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,062
- It's so cold!
- Do you want to run around like a Negro?

345
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,225
I don't care.

346
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:02,701
I don't have anything against Negroes,
and there aren't any other kids here...

347
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:04,831
but be careful.

348
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,507
They have illnesses like malaria and so on.

349
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:11,244
They are very dirty,
and I don't want you to get sick.

350
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:14,614
A white child is not a black child.

351
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,717
And promise you don't eat anything
they give you.

352
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:20,992
And never enter their huts.

353
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,320
So...

354
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,756
Now swallow this.

355
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,431
It's too bitter.
And anyway, it'll make me go blind.

356
00:38:30,536 --> 00:38:33,479
Nonsense. Open your mouth.

357
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,509
Hey, Mama.

358
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:43,078
There's a ceremony tonight. They'll
slaughter a lamb and ask Ngai for rain.

359
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:46,349
- Ask whom?
- Ngai, their god who lives on the mountain...

360
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:49,317
Mount Kenya, and the fig tree, too.

361
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:51,821
They're asking him for rain.
It's a big ceremony.

362
00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:53,688
You're not going.

363
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,059
They're asking Ngai for rain.

364
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:58,828
Could you tell me
why you always repeat everything?

365
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,396
Do the Negroes do that, too?

366
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,265
You can't repeat good things enough.

367
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,133
- Who says?
- Everyone.

368
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,570
- Everyone?
- You can't repeat good things enough.

369
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:10,448
My God, Regina!
What should I do with you?

370
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,077
- Remember Grandma?
- What?

371
00:39:13,182 --> 00:39:14,809
She always said:

372
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:19,418
"Don't worry about Regina.
She has the luck of a Gentile."

373
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,855
Exactly...

374
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,423
the luck of a Gentile.

375
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,492
That's what Grandma always said.

376
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,662
So you don't have to worry, Mama.

377
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,198
My angel. I'm so afraid
something might happen to you.

378
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:37,212
Don't worry. It's nice here.

379
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,805
Toto! Toto!

380
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,870
Memsaab!
Bwana has gone out with the big gun!

381
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:58,584
Kill it.

382
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:07,541
I can't do it! You see that I can't!

383
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:13,642
I just wanted you to have your damn meat!

384
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,618
They don't want anything?

385
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:30,928
No. They said they're not hungry.

386
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,008
Good night.
I don't mind if you go on reading.

387
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:51,078
I've read this book 3 times!

388
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:54,213
Who cares if I read it
a fourth time!

389
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:55,649
Regina.

390
00:42:58,724 --> 00:43:03,156
I didn't expect you to be able to hunt.
I couldn't have done it either.

391
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:05,125
You never killed an animal before.

392
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,464
But I want to! I'm warning you,
don't treat me like a loser!

393
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:13,301
Did I? I didn't ask you to go hunting!

394
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:15,703
You act like I'm a leper!

395
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:17,276
You've changed.

396
00:43:17,444 --> 00:43:22,443
The hell I have! Truth is, you only let
me under your skirt when I'm a lawyer!

397
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:25,613
I got no chance in the desert,
unshaved and sweaty.

398
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,584
- Watch your tongue!
- I'm your husband!

399
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,987
I can tell you what I think,
even if you don't like it!

400
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:35,831
You have no right to a privileged life!

401
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:41,163
We've just been lucky up to now.

402
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:45,736
Stop playing the spoiled daughter,
and wake up to what's going on here!

403
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:47,137
Where are you going?

404
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:49,238
To the bar.

405
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:53,010
But now that we've brought it up,
the way you treat Owuor...

406
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:55,146
reminds me of some people in Germany...

407
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:58,693
to whom you certainly
don't want to be compared!

408
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,252
It's nice and warm.

409
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:36,589
Yeah, nice and warm.

410
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:48,880
Hey, little dog.
Where did you come from?

411
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:55,777
- Cepoi, whose dog is this?
- This dog has no home.

412
00:44:55,882 --> 00:44:59,655
It's a wild dog.
It comes from the huts.

413
00:45:00,653 --> 00:45:04,753
Daddy, this dog has no home.
Can I keep him, please?

414
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:08,357
- But you're afraid of dogs.
- No, not here.

415
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:12,963
Yes, I like him. We'll keep him.

416
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:16,832
We'll call him Rummler,
like the Nazi chairman in Leobschütz.

417
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:19,636
- Rummler is a nice name.
- Exactly.

418
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,038
Every day we can say,
"Rummler, you bastard"...

419
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:25,211
and nobody will arrest us.

420
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:30,146
The trucks! They're driving fast!

421
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:41,989
Süsskind!

422
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:46,295
- What does it mean?
- Don't you listen to the radio?

423
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,199
War has broken out.
We're being interned.

424
00:46:49,304 --> 00:46:51,935
You don't think I'll leave Jettel
and Regina here!

425
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,029
Don't worry.

426
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:57,441
The British are reliable.
They're taking us to Nairobi.

427
00:46:57,547 --> 00:47:02,424
- Tell me I have nothing to fear.
- You have my word of honor.

428
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,249
I'm not going away!

429
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:14,560
Owuor! Take care of the two!

430
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,188
Yes, bwana. I will.

431
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,320
May I take this, too?

432
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:44,198
No, only one thing.
Either the bear or the doll.

433
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:56,037
Don't forget your passport.

434
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:59,118
- You speak German?
- Yes.

435
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:01,408
My mother is German.

436
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,615
Don't cry, little memsaab!

437
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,954
I'll find you everywhere,
and follow you.

438
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,048
Promise?

439
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:15,992
Promise.
I'll catch a new Toto for you.

440
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:19,267
No, I don't want a new Toto.

441
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:23,933
I didn't protect him very well.
His mother should have looked after him.

442
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:28,271
I'm not a good mother
for an antelope baby.

443
00:48:28,376 --> 00:48:31,785
You're wise, little memsaab.

444
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,879
Take care of our things!

445
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:39,722
Goodbye, Owuor! Goodbye, Rummler!

446
00:49:08,652 --> 00:49:12,285
Suddenly, we were no longer refugees,
but enemy aliens.

447
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,089
We really didn't know why
the British wanted to lock us up.

448
00:49:16,194 --> 00:49:19,160
We were Germans,
and England and Germany were at war...

449
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:23,869
but, after all, we were Jews
who certainly didn't side with Hitler.

450
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:33,413
What a nice prison, Mama.

451
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:07,318
- Do you understand all this?
- No.

452
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:12,188
They probably didn't know
where to put us.

453
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,818
- I bet that's a plum pudding.
- What's that?

454
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:18,891
Something English.

455
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:45,850
This reminds me of better times.

456
00:51:45,955 --> 00:51:50,555
- In the end we'll have to pay for this.
- The chef worked on a luxury liner.

457
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:54,228
- He can't help it.
- I'm really hungry!

458
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,391
No, thanks.

459
00:51:58,502 --> 00:51:59,627
No, thanks.

460
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:12,891
In Breslau, we were always going
to dinner parties and receptions.

461
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:18,384
I tell you, it was such a nice life.

462
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,399
Before emigration
every jerk was a prince.

463
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:28,502
Are you finished? Thank you.

464
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:47,026
No message for your husband?

465
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:54,156
It's the feeling of being alone...

466
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:57,393
of knowing
that you really have nothing to say...

467
00:52:57,498 --> 00:53:02,698
nothing to share but the time you spend
together, and a child maybe.

468
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:06,669
It's a painful realization.
You know what I mean?

469
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:08,139
Oh, well.

470
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:12,343
Being alone is one thing.
I know all about it.

471
00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:15,446
But with a woman like Jettel...

472
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:18,148
such a beautiful woman...

473
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:21,287
So cheerful and full of life.

474
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:25,564
Maybe you aren't giving her
a real chance.

475
00:53:25,728 --> 00:53:31,173
Back in Leobschütz everything was fine.
We both played our parts.

476
00:53:31,368 --> 00:53:32,595
You see.

477
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,004
She won't accept reality.

478
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:40,909
I want a mature woman
I can talk to.

479
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:46,546
I have to cope with everything, too.
My father, Liesl...

480
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:48,278
Will you shut up!

481
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:06,169
Sometimes I think
we're like two packages.

482
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:11,012
All tied up, lying in a train...

483
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:15,043
which is taking us
to an unknown address.

484
00:54:15,148 --> 00:54:20,389
We travel a long way together,
but we don't really know what's inside.

485
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:22,384
You worry too much.

486
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:25,884
Perhaps. Sleep well.

487
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:45,576
After a few weeks,
the hotel wanted to get rid of us.

488
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:49,748
Every day we wandered with our mothers
from one shady spot to the next...

489
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:52,082
wondering about
what we were having for dinner.

490
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:56,820
If only we could go out for a walk.
I'm going crazy in here.

491
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:00,258
If my husband were interned,
I'd fight to have him released...

492
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,694
instead of sitting here complaining.

493
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,630
- But how?
- Mama, I'm hungry!

494
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,768
- Hey, you greedy little pig.
- You're all Jews.

495
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:12,705
Why don't you write a letter
to your community in Nairobi?

496
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,608
Jews here have influence, don't they?

497
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,376
That'd be the first time.

498
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:19,345
Can anyone speak English?

499
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,575
I can.

500
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,951
The Jewish community had no problem
convincing the British...

501
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:28,188
that not every German sided with Hitler.

502
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:32,159
Two weeks later, we were allowed
to visit the men at the internment camp.

503
00:55:32,264 --> 00:55:35,495
Wearing khakis, it was nearly impossible
to distinguish...

504
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:39,373
between our imprisoned fathers
and the British soldiers.

505
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,452
Papa, I have a girlfriend,
a real girlfriend!

506
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:59,021
Her name is Inge.
And she can read.

507
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,123
And Mama wrote a letter.

508
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:02,627
A letter?

509
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:06,367
So we could visit you.

510
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:22,079
- You wrote a letter to the British?
- Not just me. All the women.

511
00:56:22,184 --> 00:56:25,182
- Maybe we can return to Rongai soon?
- What's changed your mind?

512
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:30,026
You were desperately unhappy there.
Like something to drink?

513
00:56:30,427 --> 00:56:34,632
- They all want to go back to their farms.
- I see.

514
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:45,638
- We can't return to Rongai.
- What?

515
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:48,641
Morrison fired me
because of the war.

516
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:51,010
He doesn't want an enemy alien
on his farm.

517
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:52,706
What does that mean?

518
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:57,021
I'm out of work,
and we have no home.

519
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,097
We'll have to pick up
our things at the farm.

520
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:11,798
Maybe he's still waiting for us...

521
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:14,434
because he thinks
that we're coming back.

522
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,771
Maybe Papa will see Owuor.

523
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:20,808
- And he'll bring him here.
- Of course.

524
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:22,279
Of course.

525
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,988
Could I be of assistance?

526
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,292
Yes, please.
I need a "special permission."

527
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:11,597
I have to leave the premises for a few
hours to meet Mr. Edward Rubens...

528
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:16,077
the head of the Jewish community
in Nairobi. It's urgent.

529
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:27,680
My husband and I were in Berlin...

530
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:31,017
in '36 for the Olympics.

531
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:34,855
That was our last time in Germany.
My God, we were naive!

532
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,025
It was no different with us.
We believed to the bitter end...

533
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:42,229
No, thanks.
Our civilized friends would stop Hitler.

534
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:43,322
Friends?

535
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,600
The Germans were never friends
to the Jews.

536
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:47,797
I don't agree.

537
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,938
Where are your "friends" now?
And in '38?

538
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:55,954
- Without Hitler--
- Hitler didn't invent anti-Semitism.

539
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,384
How can we be of assistance?

540
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,054
Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm...

541
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:07,556
won't employ any enemy aliens.

542
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,493
But without work,
Walter can't leave the camp...

543
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:13,262
and we don't know
where to find a job for him.

544
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:15,765
So, I ask you to help us again.

545
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:18,869
We'd do everything to be good farmers.

546
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:20,871
And that's why you've come to me?

547
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:25,609
You think you're the only people
to suffer from this stupid war?

548
00:59:25,714 --> 00:59:29,881
You think we're responsible for you,
because we let you enter this country?

549
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:34,657
You're alive! You're here!
My God! Make something out of it!

550
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:46,230
We have relatives in Europe,
in Poland.

551
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:49,600
My husband hasn't heard from them
for months.

552
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:51,435
Sorry to hear that.

553
00:59:57,047 --> 01:00:00,923
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

554
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:45,428
What are you doing here?

555
01:00:45,534 --> 01:00:48,737
Was your little outing successful?

556
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,574
What do you mean?

557
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:05,926
You're looking for a job
on a farm for your husband?

558
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:10,562
I have a friend here in the army.

559
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:12,024
He needs someone.

560
01:01:15,498 --> 01:01:17,260
I could talk to him.

561
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:25,713
That would be very nice of you.

562
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:55,403
- Come on.
- I tagged you!

563
01:01:55,508 --> 01:01:56,906
Catch me!

564
01:02:06,453 --> 01:02:10,719
Where have you been?
A letter for you.

565
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:13,664
It looks quite important.

566
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:18,962
Darn it! How do you say "morgen?"

567
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:22,578
My gosh, Jettel! It's "tomorrow!"

568
01:02:22,837 --> 01:02:25,541
Try to remember that!

569
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:29,334
You see? You got it!

570
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,419
Oh, Regina!

571
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,422
Walter!

572
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,199
- How did you manage it?
- What?

573
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:05,944
Here we are, Owuor!

574
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:24,564
The holy mountain
looks like a Chinaman's hat.

575
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:28,102
Get down from there!
You're going to break your neck!

576
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:32,582
This is the most beautiful place
in the whole world!

577
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,313
Thank you.

578
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:42,417
Süsskind, I'm afraid.

579
01:03:42,523 --> 01:03:43,887
Afraid of what?

580
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:46,956
This place is further away
from your farm than Rongai.

581
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:49,525
You can hardly ever visit us.

582
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:51,760
I'd drive 20 miles more to see you.

583
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:53,093
Promise?

584
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:57,713
I'll be here more often than you like.

585
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:17,023
At least we've gotten rid
of those damn cattle.

586
01:04:19,629 --> 01:04:22,639
Are you doing all right?

587
01:04:24,234 --> 01:04:27,631
- I'm your bwana, and I order you...
- Well, bwana?

588
01:04:27,737 --> 01:04:31,536
- ...to take off your blouse.
- Are you meshuga, or what?

589
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:35,278
If you do you'll get a fried chicken.

590
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:46,662
And now you have to walk down the path
like an African woman.

591
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:05,774
Hey! Did you miss me in your hotel?

592
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:08,786
Ouch! What are you doing?

593
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,212
Good morning.

594
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:49,027
My name is Walter Redlich.

595
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:53,335
I'm the new bwana here.

596
01:05:56,066 --> 01:05:57,657
You'll need my help.

597
01:05:57,733 --> 01:06:02,337
- I've lived here for 40 years.
- I'd appreciate your help.

598
01:06:10,581 --> 01:06:14,046
- Is Bwana Gibson dead?
- No.

599
01:06:14,152 --> 01:06:17,450
Bwana Gibson can't be here.
He's serving in the Royal Army.

600
01:06:17,555 --> 01:06:19,986
He asked me to run his farm.

601
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:21,682
Show me what to do.

602
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,891
You aren't a British bwana?

603
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:27,227
No,
I didn't come here to get rich.

604
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:31,465
I came here because I was chased
out of my own country.

605
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,034
- What country are you from?
- Germany.

606
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,844
It is far away from here.
It is at war.

607
01:06:40,714 --> 01:06:43,545
If someone steals your cow...

608
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:46,381
it will be killed and eaten.

609
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:49,284
And you can forget it.

610
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:53,089
But if someone steals your land,
it is always there.

611
01:06:53,194 --> 01:06:56,791
You can visit it.
It will always be there.

612
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:59,964
You can never forget it.

613
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:39,337
Daji Jiwan is Indian.
He's a good Fundi.

614
01:07:39,443 --> 01:07:42,544
He can help you build the house.

615
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,077
When you work for me
you will get maize...

616
01:07:45,183 --> 01:07:48,381
firewood, 2 liters of milk a day
and 12 shillings a month.

617
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:50,983
12 shillings aren't much.

618
01:07:51,089 --> 01:07:55,999
I don't bargain. If you don't want
to work, someone else will, Daji.

619
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:05,437
- These men can't build a house for you.
- I'll teach them.

620
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:22,384
Bwana, Kania is my brother.
He can sweep the floors.

621
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:26,022
Can Kania cook, too? We need a cook.

622
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:31,697
No, Kania isn't a cook.
Kania can sweep the floors.

623
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,998
Kamau can cook for the dog.

624
01:08:35,104 --> 01:08:38,341
For what dog?
We don't have a dog.

625
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:45,795
Yes or no?

626
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,819
It's very expensive!

627
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:53,424
I've come for the mail.

628
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:16,167
Letters with this stamp
always bring tears.

629
01:09:16,273 --> 01:09:18,397
I will give it to bwana.

630
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:22,005
That's good. You are his friend.

631
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,914
Sohrau, 2nd October 1940.

632
01:09:31,019 --> 01:09:32,416
My dear son:

633
01:09:33,188 --> 01:09:37,821
It's wonderful to hear about
your good fortune with the second farm.

634
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:40,789
For us it's impossible
to emigrate now.

635
01:09:40,895 --> 01:09:44,261
Hitler will be closing the borders soon.

636
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:47,831
Anyway, we have nothing left
that we could sell for cash.

637
01:09:47,936 --> 01:09:51,536
They say that the Jews
are going to be taken to ghettos.

638
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:57,347
If that happens, I'll have Grescheck
send you our new address immediately.

639
01:09:57,913 --> 01:10:02,857
Walter, I'm afraid
for the first time in my life.

640
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,449
Afraid...

641
01:10:04,787 --> 01:10:08,422
for Liesl, but also for myself.

642
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:14,891
We feel like our old Germany
is a desert island.

643
01:10:14,996 --> 01:10:18,361
Hardly anyone dares to talk to us.

644
01:10:18,466 --> 01:10:19,955
It is horrible.

645
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:22,295
My son...

646
01:10:22,605 --> 01:10:26,971
I'm sending you some rose seeds
as you wanted.

647
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:30,608
May these seeds
sprout in the African earth...

648
01:10:30,713 --> 01:10:33,611
and bring joy to Jettel, you...

649
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:36,848
and my little Regina.

650
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:38,951
My thoughts are always with you.

651
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:40,578
Yours, Father.

652
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:45,189
They've taken a long journey.

653
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:48,024
Yes, a long journey.

654
01:10:54,904 --> 01:10:57,868
I want us to register Regina
at school soon.

655
01:10:57,973 --> 01:11:00,004
Five pounds a month,
we can afford it.

656
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:04,815
The next time Süsskind goes to Nakuru
he can ask about it.

657
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:20,190
Rummler.

658
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:30,931
Owuor?

659
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:39,519
Have you learned to cook?

660
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,977
You've found us!

661
01:11:45,356 --> 01:11:47,919
Memsaab doesn't have a cook
in OI Joro Orok?

662
01:11:48,024 --> 01:11:49,688
No, we don't have a cook.

663
01:11:49,794 --> 01:11:52,158
How did you know?
And how did you find us?

664
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:56,206
Rummler has a good nose.

665
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:04,931
A bit of flour.

666
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:10,643
Thank you!

667
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:15,180
A little boy and a little girl...

668
01:12:15,285 --> 01:12:17,684
are lost in the forest.

669
01:12:17,789 --> 01:12:21,753
They are afraid.
The forest is dangerous at night.

670
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:24,657
This is an angel.
It lives in heaven.

671
01:12:24,763 --> 01:12:26,959
- And what's this?
- Those are his wings.

672
01:12:27,064 --> 01:12:28,928
He needs them to fly up to Heaven.

673
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:30,730
Have you ever seen an angel?

674
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:33,033
No. Angels are invisible.

675
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:35,001
The ancestors are invisible, too.

676
01:12:35,107 --> 01:12:39,709
Yes. Angels protect us, too,
when we're in danger.

677
01:12:39,978 --> 01:12:44,285
I'm an angel,
and I'll drive away the evil spirits!

678
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:04,497
Come here!

679
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:10,031
No!

680
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:17,646
Yummy, kids!

681
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:26,283
Come to me!

682
01:13:27,494 --> 01:13:29,324
Go away! Go away!

683
01:13:47,914 --> 01:13:50,712
When you come back,
I won't be a child anymore.

684
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:53,748
Nonsense.
I'll always come home for vacation.

685
01:13:53,854 --> 01:13:57,887
I'll be back for the next maize harvest.

686
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:13,706
Swear that you'll come back.

687
01:14:15,508 --> 01:14:16,734
I swear.

688
01:14:42,837 --> 01:14:44,598
I think that's him.

689
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,193
Learn all you can, angel.

690
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:07,690
Mama, I'll be back for vacation.

691
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:09,456
I know, my angel.

692
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:16,171
When I come back,
I'll tell you all about it, Owuor.

693
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:51,200
Come home!

694
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:35,285
We're Jewish. We have to step out.

695
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,650
I learned very quickly
what it means to be an outsider.

696
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:14,419
As Jews, we didn't have to pray...

697
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:17,122
and we could eat
what we liked on Fridays.

698
01:17:17,228 --> 01:17:21,259
Every once in a while a snake fell
on the playing field...

699
01:17:21,364 --> 01:17:24,330
the lost prey of a falcon.

700
01:17:24,435 --> 01:17:26,365
I was happy to have Inge.

701
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:28,367
She didn't like sports either...

702
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:32,641
at least not those stupid games
the British played.

703
01:17:48,392 --> 01:17:51,758
It's strange how some words
lose their meaning here.

704
01:17:51,863 --> 01:17:55,873
For example,
"tax return" or "streetcar".

705
01:17:58,102 --> 01:18:01,601
Sometimes I wonder why
I even get dressed in the morning.

706
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:05,405
I might as well wear a sack.
Nobody around here would care.

707
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,736
I would.

708
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:10,943
Do you still find me attractive?

709
01:18:11,048 --> 01:18:14,057
You do have your great moments.

710
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:22,655
Did you get to know someone
in Norfolk?

711
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,626
Do you think people should
stay together for their entire life?

712
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:28,196
I guess not.

713
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:34,541
It's probably just some nonsense which
our ancestors persuaded us to adopt.

714
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:40,247
If you had your choice,
would you leave?

715
01:18:41,814 --> 01:18:45,679
I sometimes wonder if there could have
been a happier way of life for me.

716
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:47,341
Do you understand?

717
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,859
If I'd decided differently at one time.

718
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:58,692
Listen, I want to make it with you.
I want it to work for us.

719
01:18:58,797 --> 01:19:02,136
You're my wife and I love you!

720
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:08,077
I miss them all so much...

721
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,035
my mother, Käthe.

722
01:19:12,244 --> 01:19:13,870
It hurts so much!

723
01:23:26,403 --> 01:23:28,800
Well? Isn't that nice, Jogona?

724
01:23:28,906 --> 01:23:30,869
You can't talk to the night.

725
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:34,814
You're right.
You can't talk to the night.

726
01:23:37,648 --> 01:23:41,414
The poet imagined
that the night had ears.

727
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,154
It is lovely to make music with words.

728
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,853
Your father is a wise man.

729
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,188
He can talk to the thunder
and lightning.

730
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:54,236
He talks to the ancestors.
That's different.

731
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:02,709
You must take off your blouse,
or it will get dirty.

732
01:24:03,474 --> 01:24:05,204
I won't take off my blouse anymore.

733
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:07,607
I'm no longer a little child.

734
01:24:07,712 --> 01:24:10,878
You're a stupid child
if you dirty your school blouse.

735
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:15,149
I'm no longer a child.
You can't see my breasts anymore.

736
01:24:15,254 --> 01:24:19,285
They are no different than the breasts
of the women in the village.

737
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:23,724
Yes, they are. The breasts of a Mzungus
are different. You can't see them.

738
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:27,840
The Mzungus' schools
teach very strange things.

739
01:24:27,999 --> 01:24:32,238
Are Mzungus like you
still allowed to climb trees?

740
01:24:37,742 --> 01:24:42,913
Yes. But only when they don't
dirty their school uniform.

741
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,223
Wait, Jogona!

742
01:25:31,798 --> 01:25:33,525
Be careful, Regina!

743
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:45,006
My dear loved ones,
we are very nervous.

744
01:25:45,111 --> 01:25:48,041
We are being sent
to Poland tomorrow to work.

745
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:51,678
Don't forget us. Mother and Käthe.

746
01:25:51,784 --> 01:25:53,147
What does that mean?

747
01:25:54,487 --> 01:25:58,692
They weren't allowed to write more
than 20 words.

748
01:25:59,593 --> 01:26:01,320
They gave away one.

749
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,749
They are bad days
when Memsaab Kidogo has to go to school.

750
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:31,421
Maybe they want to leave via Poland.

751
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:39,467
Maybe they've found a way out.

752
01:26:40,968 --> 01:26:45,810
Say something, Walter!
Please! Talk to me!

753
01:26:48,843 --> 01:26:53,877
Your mother wanted you to know.
Or she wouldn't have written it.

754
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:57,980
- Poland means death.
- No!

755
01:26:58,086 --> 01:27:02,251
You know what?
I envy you for getting this letter...

756
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:07,095
for the certainty!
I have no idea how my father's doing...

757
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,425
where he is...

758
01:27:10,664 --> 01:27:12,153
where my sister is.

759
01:27:22,811 --> 01:27:27,744
Every day the German troops in the East
suffer a new defeat.

760
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:29,446
German casualties are...

761
01:27:29,551 --> 01:27:31,347
no less significant.

762
01:27:33,255 --> 01:27:36,553
The number of Germans
who have died or been captured...

763
01:27:36,658 --> 01:27:39,389
since the beginning
of the Russian winter offensive...

764
01:27:39,494 --> 01:27:43,403
is now more than 400,000.

765
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,745
What are you doing?

766
01:28:01,015 --> 01:28:03,580
This woman needs no help.
She wants to die.

767
01:28:03,686 --> 01:28:06,684
And her family has left her here?

768
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:10,264
The hyenas will take away her body
at night.

769
01:28:15,698 --> 01:28:19,367
Kimani, I can't allow this.

770
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:24,202
I am the memsaab of this farm!
Carry the woman into the house!

771
01:28:24,307 --> 01:28:27,071
If she dies in the hut,
it will no longer be pure.

772
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:31,448
It would be a great sacrifice
for the family to cleanse it.

773
01:28:32,548 --> 01:28:34,911
It would cost the family
a lot of money.

774
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:37,848
I don't care. It's an order!

775
01:28:37,953 --> 01:28:39,784
As soon as the memsaab is inside...

776
01:28:39,889 --> 01:28:43,521
she will be carried out again.
The woman wants to die outside.

777
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:45,990
That is what the tradition requires.

778
01:28:46,096 --> 01:28:47,992
It's all right, memsaab.

779
01:28:48,098 --> 01:28:53,098
My mother won't die alone. The ancestors
are with her. She isn't afraid.

780
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:23,228
If you like,
you can be out of here soon.

781
01:29:23,334 --> 01:29:27,066
They call it "Operation J,"
the restructuring of troops in Kenya.

782
01:29:27,171 --> 01:29:29,534
They're really taking Germans?

783
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:33,138
Jewish men your age stand a chance.

784
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:36,175
Nobody will accuse them
of siding with Hitler.

785
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,513
But don't be a fool and tell them
you're fed up with farm life...

786
01:29:40,618 --> 01:29:44,283
and you need a change.
They want to hear that you're for the Allies...

787
01:29:44,388 --> 01:29:47,921
and you're ready to fight
for the right cause.

788
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:54,703
- What about Jettel?
- She could live in Nairobi.

789
01:29:55,967 --> 01:30:00,603
I can hardly believe that I'll get
a chance to take part in this war.

790
01:30:01,205 --> 01:30:02,727
What about you?

791
01:30:04,509 --> 01:30:09,077
This isn't my war.
Germany has nothing more to do with me.

792
01:30:29,034 --> 01:30:31,365
- I'm not going with you to Nairobi.
- What?

793
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:35,201
I'm staying here with Owuor.
I've made up my mind.

794
01:30:35,306 --> 01:30:37,837
Be reasonable.
It's too dangerous here for you.

795
01:30:37,942 --> 01:30:39,635
Leave us your gun.

796
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:46,313
For the past few years
you've wanted to be somewhere else.

797
01:30:46,418 --> 01:30:50,284
You wanted to return to Germany,
then Rongai. You were never satisfied.

798
01:30:50,389 --> 01:30:54,421
- And now you don't want to leave here.
- I'm not afraid of being alone.

799
01:30:54,527 --> 01:30:59,971
- You'll be among people in Nairobi.
- I don't want to keep following you!

800
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:04,331
What if something happens to you?

801
01:31:04,437 --> 01:31:09,278
You're the one who should watch out.
They're sending men to Burma.

802
01:31:10,877 --> 01:31:15,742
For the first time in years, I feel
I'm doing something out of conviction.

803
01:31:15,847 --> 01:31:20,654
I can't keep sitting around here.
I feel so useless.

804
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:26,665
- I understand.
- Then come with me to Nairobi.

805
01:31:28,094 --> 01:31:31,069
I'm staying here with Owuor.

806
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,411
If I don't see you for a day,
where are you?

807
01:32:55,517 --> 01:32:58,248
I go see my wives and my children.

808
01:32:58,353 --> 01:33:00,416
On the lake. Near Kisumu.

809
01:33:00,522 --> 01:33:03,253
They don't often see you.

810
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:07,926
They understand that I can't leave
the memsaab alone so often.

811
01:33:16,737 --> 01:33:21,036
- But your wife is always alone.
- That's different.

812
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:24,743
White women are helpless,
black women are not.

813
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,611
How many children do you have?

814
01:33:27,716 --> 01:33:31,192
I have six children and three wives.

815
01:33:31,387 --> 01:33:32,750
Three wives?

816
01:33:33,254 --> 01:33:37,561
- Then you have a lot to do!
- I bring them my money.

817
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:41,358
It isn't much.
12 shillings isn't much.

818
01:33:41,464 --> 01:33:44,461
It's enough.
They have shambas with maize and beans...

819
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:48,165
and fish from the lake.

820
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:49,702
Do they respect you?

821
01:33:49,772 --> 01:33:51,033
They respect me.

822
01:33:51,407 --> 01:33:54,746
I work in the house of a bwana.

823
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:03,114
I respect you very much, too.

824
01:34:03,219 --> 01:34:07,697
I don't know what we'd have done
in this country without you.

825
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:10,323
Will you help me?

826
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:16,470
I'm a cook, not a barber.

827
01:34:17,466 --> 01:34:20,975
Please! I can't do it alone.

828
01:34:59,376 --> 01:35:02,174
So your maize fields are fine?

829
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:06,518
The maize? Yes, it's doing well.

830
01:35:08,853 --> 01:35:11,116
Like to go out for a drive?

831
01:35:11,222 --> 01:35:12,346
Yes.

832
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:13,985
I'd love to.

833
01:35:14,825 --> 01:35:17,835
Then I'll wait for you outside.

834
01:35:19,496 --> 01:35:22,199
I'm glad you're here.

835
01:35:40,017 --> 01:35:43,249
This country is so beautiful!

836
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:47,920
The Allies landed on the French coast
with over 300,000 men.

837
01:35:48,025 --> 01:35:51,491
Thank you.
So is that good or bad?

838
01:35:51,596 --> 01:35:55,162
Bad for Hitler,
so I'd say it's good.

839
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:59,510
Don't you care
what happens in Germany?

840
01:36:00,104 --> 01:36:01,330
And you?

841
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:06,540
- What's wrong?
- Don't do this to me.

842
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:10,536
What am I doing?

843
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:14,354
Come on!
It'll be dark in two hours.

844
01:36:28,967 --> 01:36:30,627
You're already here?

845
01:36:31,303 --> 01:36:32,792
I was worried.

846
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:36,934
Regina!

847
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:42,644
I showed your mother Lake Bogoria.
We were very near your school.

848
01:36:49,321 --> 01:36:53,456
Why are you angry at me?
Because I wasn't here?

849
01:36:54,027 --> 01:36:56,356
Why didn't you go to Nairobi with Papa?

850
01:36:56,461 --> 01:37:00,801
You're asking me?
You're the one who loves this farm!

851
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:06,838
You don't love him anymore.

852
01:37:08,006 --> 01:37:11,982
Süsskind took me out for a drive.
That's all.

853
01:37:13,046 --> 01:37:17,779
Don't you think I was aware of what
happened at the Norfolk?

854
01:37:17,884 --> 01:37:21,450
You had an affair with that soldier.

855
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:25,352
He organized this farm for us.
We had no home.

856
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:29,730
I see. What can Süsskind do for you
when you sleep with him?

857
01:37:56,757 --> 01:37:58,487
Have you seen my child?

858
01:37:58,592 --> 01:38:00,559
The Mzungu child?

859
01:38:00,927 --> 01:38:04,062
- Back there in the hut.
- Thank you.

860
01:38:23,984 --> 01:38:27,051
I'll be right there, Mama.

861
01:38:47,842 --> 01:38:50,472
I've often spent the night
with Jogona and his mother.

862
01:38:50,578 --> 01:38:51,634
Often?

863
01:38:51,712 --> 01:38:55,511
You didn't notice,
because I was home by sunrise.

864
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:00,219
My wild little girl.
Don't disappear like that.

865
01:39:03,525 --> 01:39:07,556
It's so beautiful, Mama.
I understand why you wanted it.

866
01:39:07,662 --> 01:39:11,394
Don't tell Papa. He almost sent me back
to Germany because of that dress.

867
01:39:11,499 --> 01:39:15,031
- And you've never worn it?
- Never.

868
01:39:15,136 --> 01:39:19,909
I was just able to prevent him
from wrapping the meat in it.

869
01:39:20,075 --> 01:39:25,213
Your grandmother and I bought it
in Breslau for 45 marks.

870
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:29,754
After that we had some cheesecake
at Café Mohnheim.

871
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,185
I can't remember Germany at all.

872
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:39,300
Only when I eat nuts.
Then I think of Grandpa.

873
01:39:43,699 --> 01:39:47,697
Mama, why are the Jews hated?

874
01:39:47,803 --> 01:39:51,302
You and Papa aren't really Jewish.

875
01:39:51,407 --> 01:39:55,006
You eat all kinds of meat,
and you never pray, do you?

876
01:39:55,111 --> 01:39:56,805
Here I do sometimes.

877
01:39:59,648 --> 01:40:03,955
At school they say that the Jews
killed the son of God.

878
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:10,087
Judaism has never been
so important for Papa and me.

879
01:40:10,192 --> 01:40:13,997
We thought we were as German
as anyone could be.

880
01:40:14,397 --> 01:40:18,896
German culture, the language,
that was home to us.

881
01:40:19,035 --> 01:40:22,233
Maybe we Jews really are different.

882
01:40:22,338 --> 01:40:25,269
Do you remember Aunt Ruth
and Uncle Salomon?

883
01:40:25,374 --> 01:40:27,371
Of course they're different.

884
01:40:27,477 --> 01:40:31,610
They live according to the Jewish religion,
and that makes them different.

885
01:40:31,715 --> 01:40:36,522
Tolerance doesn't mean that everyone
is the same. That'd be stupid.

886
01:40:37,587 --> 01:40:42,724
What I've learned here
is how valuable differences are.

887
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,691
Differences are good.

888
01:40:47,796 --> 01:40:52,068
And intelligent people
will never hold it against you.

889
01:40:55,038 --> 01:40:58,036
The Pokots are celebrating
a big ngoma tonight.

890
01:40:58,141 --> 01:41:03,085
They slaughtered a cow under the holy
tree. There'll be beer and singing.

891
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:08,016
You have to see it.

892
01:41:08,553 --> 01:41:11,289
It is very "different."

893
01:43:51,051 --> 01:43:52,881
9 May 1945

894
01:44:30,624 --> 01:44:33,759
The war in Germany is over.

895
01:44:43,705 --> 01:44:47,304
A few days ago I got a letter
from a German teacher in Tarnopol.

896
01:44:47,409 --> 01:44:49,137
From whom?

897
01:44:49,476 --> 01:44:51,807
I don't know the man.

898
01:44:51,913 --> 01:44:55,184
He was a teacher before the war.

899
01:44:55,682 --> 01:44:58,657
He knew Father and Liesl.

900
01:45:06,127 --> 01:45:08,892
Father gave him my address.

901
01:45:08,997 --> 01:45:11,903
A week before his death.

902
01:45:21,277 --> 01:45:25,082
Father and Liesl hid
in the basement of a school.

903
01:45:25,514 --> 01:45:31,050
Father was beaten to death
by two SS men on 17 November 1942.

904
01:45:33,555 --> 01:45:37,654
Liesl was taken to Belsec a month later
with the third transport.

905
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,316
Nobody returned.

906
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:49,033
She got married while fleeing,
to a Czech...

907
01:45:49,138 --> 01:45:50,660
Erwin Schweiger.

908
01:45:51,574 --> 01:45:54,412
He was a truck driver.

909
01:47:14,824 --> 01:47:17,823
Wiesbaden, 4th November 1946.

910
01:47:17,928 --> 01:47:19,554
Dear Dr. Redlich:

911
01:47:20,364 --> 01:47:24,563
It is our pleasure to inform you
that your application...

912
01:47:24,669 --> 01:47:29,702
for a position in the Justice Dept.
of Hesse has been accepted.

913
01:47:29,807 --> 01:47:33,438
You will be installed as a judge
at the Frankfurt District Court.

914
01:47:33,543 --> 01:47:37,375
Your wish to participate in rebuilding
a liberal system of justice...

915
01:47:37,481 --> 01:47:40,979
... is seen as a sign of hope
for the budding democracy in our state.

916
01:47:41,084 --> 01:47:45,016
While expressing our best wishes
to you and your family...

917
01:47:45,122 --> 01:47:49,722
I remain yours sincerely,
Dr. Erwin Pollitzer...

918
01:47:49,828 --> 01:47:53,531
Department of Justice, Hesse, Germany.

919
01:48:56,828 --> 01:49:01,728
- How did you get here?
- A uniform can work wonders.

920
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:04,843
Want to see where I sit?

921
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:07,401
I sit here, and Inge sits there.

922
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:13,349
And a girl from the 9th grade sits
at the head, a stupid English cow!

923
01:49:17,784 --> 01:49:19,148
What's wrong?

924
01:49:19,952 --> 01:49:22,717
- Is something wrong with Mama?
- No, don't worry.

925
01:49:22,822 --> 01:49:24,618
Everything's fine.

926
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,785
I need your help.

927
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:32,868
I want to return to Germany.

928
01:49:33,266 --> 01:49:37,004
I know. You want to,
and Mama doesn't.

929
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:40,501
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

930
01:49:40,606 --> 01:49:42,804
I want to and I have to return.

931
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:46,385
Please, don't make it
so difficult for me.

932
01:49:48,182 --> 01:49:51,647
I could never forgive myself
for making you unhappy.

933
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:53,849
Why do we have to go back to Germany?

934
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:55,984
The others don't have to.

935
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,555
Inge said her father's becoming
an Englishman. You can, too.

936
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:02,727
You're in the army, and he isn't.

937
01:50:03,864 --> 01:50:07,830
Perhaps Inge's father
will get an English passport.

938
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:10,633
But that doesn't mean
he'll ever be an Englishman.

939
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:14,936
Do you really think an English family
would ever invite him over?

940
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:16,971
For example, your headmaster Brinkley.

941
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:20,208
- He never would.
- Or anyone else.

942
01:50:20,313 --> 01:50:22,378
An English passport
isn't enough for me.

943
01:50:22,483 --> 01:50:25,814
I don't want to be a man
with a name that isn't mine.

944
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:30,319
I would always be an outsider in Kenya.
Do you know what that means to me?

945
01:50:30,425 --> 01:50:31,754
Yes, I do.

946
01:50:34,495 --> 01:50:36,018
My brave angel.

947
01:50:38,433 --> 01:50:42,498
Promise you won't be sad
when we go back home.

948
01:50:42,604 --> 01:50:45,772
Promise you'll trust me.

949
01:50:50,946 --> 01:50:53,887
If we have to return to Germany...

950
01:50:56,984 --> 01:50:59,822
can Owuor go with us?

951
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:05,489
Not this time.

952
01:51:36,124 --> 01:51:37,987
Hello, my friend.

953
01:51:43,398 --> 01:51:46,062
Very nice. Where is the memsaab?

954
01:51:46,168 --> 01:51:49,905
She's out on the field.
With Bwana Süsskind.

955
01:51:50,906 --> 01:51:54,177
Was Bwana Süsskind often here?

956
01:52:22,638 --> 01:52:27,012
Then a corncob
fell out of his left pant leg.

957
01:52:27,309 --> 01:52:31,610
The maize is really tall this year.
The rain came at the right time.

958
01:52:31,715 --> 01:52:34,011
- Gibson can be--
- This isn't our farm!

959
01:52:34,116 --> 01:52:37,251
And I don't care about the maize!

960
01:52:52,369 --> 01:52:55,401
I applied for repatriation.

961
01:52:55,506 --> 01:52:56,767
For what?

962
01:53:04,381 --> 01:53:08,323
The army is required to send
its soldiers back home.

963
01:53:11,022 --> 01:53:14,120
In our case that means Germany.

964
01:53:14,225 --> 01:53:17,131
They pay for the ship.

965
01:53:18,129 --> 01:53:20,493
And you decided that all by yourself?

966
01:53:20,598 --> 01:53:23,563
But there are three of us.
Maybe Regina and I don't want to.

967
01:53:23,668 --> 01:53:26,506
I've already talked to her.

968
01:53:30,275 --> 01:53:32,672
Why are you doing this?

969
01:53:32,777 --> 01:53:36,286
Why don't you talk to me about it?

970
01:53:43,888 --> 01:53:47,052
I don't understand you!
How can you even consider returning?

971
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:48,714
Stay out of this!

972
01:53:48,859 --> 01:53:52,529
You're not going to destroy my family!

973
01:53:52,965 --> 01:53:57,498
Know what your problem is?
You don't know who you are!

974
01:53:57,903 --> 01:54:02,675
We're Jews, Walter,
even if it doesn't mean much to you.

975
01:54:22,927 --> 01:54:25,937
I'll only say this once.

976
01:54:26,231 --> 01:54:29,706
If you like, you can stay with me.

977
01:54:30,835 --> 01:54:34,003
It would make me very happy.

978
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:54,856
These will be
the best Königsberger meatballs...

979
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:57,759
that memsaab has ever eaten.

980
01:54:57,864 --> 01:54:59,727
But you don't have any capers.

981
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:02,296
And you don't even know
what capers are!

982
01:55:02,401 --> 01:55:04,798
I don't know what capers are...

983
01:55:04,903 --> 01:55:08,436
but I know that capers aren't necessary!

984
01:55:15,148 --> 01:55:18,714
Happy New Year, Rummler!

985
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,697
Maybe it's because
she has a girlfriend.

986
01:55:35,803 --> 01:55:40,767
Those were the best meatballs
I've ever had.

987
01:55:40,872 --> 01:55:41,963
Thank you.

988
01:55:45,879 --> 01:55:49,980
I believe she prefers your ugali.

989
01:55:52,453 --> 01:55:57,056
When she was four in Leobschütz
she loved Königsberger meatballs.

990
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,725
Happy New Year, Jettel.

991
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:11,570
We need more guards for the fields.
A lot of corn is being stolen at night.

992
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,316
Perhaps you could talk to the men.

993
01:56:18,745 --> 01:56:24,086
Jettel, they're waiting
for my decision in Frankfurt.

994
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:29,117
I'm not going back to Germany.

995
01:56:29,223 --> 01:56:31,753
What about us?
Are you really ready to give us up?

996
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:35,368
How can you still believe
in that country?

997
01:56:39,501 --> 01:56:42,565
I'm a lawyer, and I love my job.
Perhaps you'll laugh at me...

998
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:46,368
but I feel I could be useful
in a new Germany.

999
01:56:46,474 --> 01:56:50,840
You're such a damn idealist! Do you
think the Nazis suddenly disappeared?

1000
01:56:50,945 --> 01:56:53,275
We'd have to deal
with our parents' murderers.

1001
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:57,747
I'm proud to be an idealist, because
it shows that I believe in mankind!

1002
01:56:57,852 --> 01:56:59,482
That may seem naive...

1003
01:56:59,587 --> 01:57:03,495
but every other belief
will lead to destruction!

1004
01:57:08,997 --> 01:57:13,405
This country saved our lives,
but it isn't our country!

1005
01:57:39,229 --> 01:57:43,204
- Can't you sleep?
- No.

1006
01:57:48,971 --> 01:57:52,402
In Germany there's lots of snow
in the winter, you see?

1007
01:57:52,508 --> 01:57:56,211
Isn't all that snow very cold?

1008
01:57:56,445 --> 01:57:57,501
Yes.

1009
01:58:02,084 --> 01:58:03,481
I hate snow.

1010
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:19,830
Hey, busy beaver,
you're doing Owuor's work.

1011
01:58:19,936 --> 01:58:22,434
Mama needs your help.

1012
01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:24,130
It's harvest time.

1013
01:58:25,507 --> 01:58:29,540
She's managed quite well without me
the past few years.

1014
01:58:29,646 --> 01:58:32,813
I'd rather be at school than here.

1015
01:58:36,352 --> 01:58:38,012
Why is that, Papa?

1016
01:58:45,228 --> 01:58:46,693
I don't know.

1017
02:00:36,141 --> 02:00:37,471
Locusts!

1018
02:01:03,002 --> 02:01:04,599
The locusts are coming!

1019
02:01:04,705 --> 02:01:07,976
Many of them! Many of them!

1020
02:01:12,912 --> 02:01:17,515
When the locusts land on the field,
they'll eat everything!

1021
02:03:23,177 --> 02:03:26,949
They're leaving, Mama!
They're leaving!

1022
02:04:17,567 --> 02:04:20,031
Like some? It's good for your voice.

1023
02:04:20,136 --> 02:04:21,466
Thank you.

1024
02:04:32,014 --> 02:04:34,956
Thanks for coming back.

1025
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:14,014
- You have to be careful.
- Why?

1026
02:06:14,119 --> 02:06:16,923
Because I'm pregnant.

1027
02:06:17,723 --> 02:06:20,781
- From me?
- You bet!

1028
02:06:24,362 --> 02:06:27,803
Jettel, I don't want to lose you.

1029
02:06:55,595 --> 02:06:59,036
Can't we sit like this all night?

1030
02:07:58,792 --> 02:08:01,356
The men and the women in the village
never kiss.

1031
02:08:01,461 --> 02:08:03,826
They don't even know what kissing is.

1032
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:04,954
Really?

1033
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:07,097
What a shame.

1034
02:08:15,642 --> 02:08:19,811
Everything I love is lying on this bed.

1035
02:08:36,296 --> 02:08:40,662
The song of the Pokot women
inspired me more than usual.

1036
02:08:40,768 --> 02:08:44,778
That morning,
Papa told me Mama was pregnant.

1037
02:08:45,639 --> 02:08:47,704
I sensed Owuor close by and knew...

1038
02:08:47,809 --> 02:08:52,149
he understood that this good news
was also sad news.

1039
02:09:12,801 --> 02:09:16,332
The letter, I'll tear it up.

1040
02:09:16,437 --> 02:09:19,569
- What letter?
- From the Justice Dept. in Wiesbaden.

1041
02:09:19,674 --> 02:09:22,741
I can't leave without you.

1042
02:09:30,585 --> 02:09:34,517
My parents went to Frankfurt
on their honeymoon.

1043
02:09:34,623 --> 02:09:39,293
The first night my father
got terribly drunk on apple wine.

1044
02:09:39,495 --> 02:09:42,562
And Mama was very disappointed.

1045
02:09:45,768 --> 02:09:49,802
I'm so afraid of the people there.
Aren't you?

1046
02:09:49,939 --> 02:09:51,269
Yes, I am.

1047
02:09:56,112 --> 02:09:57,635
Do you love me?

1048
02:09:59,782 --> 02:10:01,271
If you let me.

1049
02:10:10,893 --> 02:10:13,834
Then you decide for us.

1050
02:12:11,749 --> 02:12:14,047
What are you doing here?

1051
02:12:14,152 --> 02:12:16,916
- I'm waiting for the sun.
- And why?

1052
02:12:17,022 --> 02:12:20,653
Are you going to sell the dog
at the market?

1053
02:12:20,759 --> 02:12:22,923
I didn't want you to see me.

1054
02:12:23,029 --> 02:12:25,993
Rummler and I are going
on a long safari.

1055
02:12:26,098 --> 02:12:29,768
The first to go on safari
has dry eyes.

1056
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:39,012
A man must go on safari
when his time has come.

1057
02:12:50,255 --> 02:12:52,753
Tell little memsaab goodbye.

1058
02:12:52,858 --> 02:12:56,256
Should I tell my daughter, "He left
and didn't want to see you again"?

1059
02:12:56,362 --> 02:12:58,592
Should I tell her,
"Rummler is gone forever"?

1060
02:12:58,697 --> 02:13:01,396
The dog is a part of my child.

1061
02:13:01,501 --> 02:13:05,808
You were there
when Rummler and Regina became friends.

1062
02:13:06,005 --> 02:13:11,039
The little memsaab will understand.
She always understands everything.

1063
02:13:11,144 --> 02:13:13,107
She has eyes and a heart like us.

1064
02:13:13,212 --> 02:13:16,912
Please, Owuor. Tell her goodbye.

1065
02:13:17,017 --> 02:13:21,649
Papa, Owuor has to go,
or do you want his heart to dry up?

1066
02:13:21,754 --> 02:13:26,053
- He doesn't want to die.
- What nonsense! Parting won't kill you!

1067
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:29,430
Otherwise I'd already be dead.

1068
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:37,632
Here is my black robe.
You've forgotten it.

1069
02:13:37,737 --> 02:13:40,903
I haven't forgotten anything.
The robe doesn't belong to me.

1070
02:13:41,008 --> 02:13:44,907
But I gave it to you
when you saved my life!

1071
02:13:45,012 --> 02:13:48,309
At that time you told me,
"I don't need the robe anymore.

1072
02:13:48,415 --> 02:13:50,945
"It is from a life
which I have lost."

1073
02:13:51,051 --> 02:13:53,515
Now you've found that life again...

1074
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:56,562
the life with the robe.

1075
02:13:57,759 --> 02:14:02,429
Please, Owuor, take it!
Without the robe you'll forget me.

1076
02:14:02,995 --> 02:14:04,793
My head won't forget you, bwana.

1077
02:14:04,898 --> 02:14:08,568
I have learned so many words from you.

1078
02:14:11,572 --> 02:14:16,845
No, Owuor. Pick me up again
like my first day in Rongai!

1079
02:14:21,048 --> 02:14:24,114
Don't leave.
You don't want to go on safari.

1080
02:14:24,219 --> 02:14:26,950
Take care of bwana.
He is still like a child!

1081
02:14:27,055 --> 02:14:31,191
You are wise.
You must show him the way!

1082
02:15:11,066 --> 02:15:12,555
All the best.

1083
02:15:13,235 --> 02:15:16,767
Same to you. Thank you.

1084
02:15:29,785 --> 02:15:32,760
I hope you'll find happiness.

1085
02:15:35,090 --> 02:15:38,065
Take care of yourself.

1086
02:16:46,996 --> 02:16:48,959
I can't buy anything.

1087
02:16:49,065 --> 02:16:51,830
I'm as poor as a monkey.

1088
02:16:51,935 --> 02:16:55,308
- For the monkey.
- Thank you.

1089
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:25,464
My brother was born on 6th June 1947.

1090
02:17:25,569 --> 02:17:30,321
Thanks to the almighty god Ngai,
there were no complications.

1091
02:17:30,427 --> 02:17:33,653
He was big and strong,
and my parents named him Max...

1092
02:17:33,758 --> 02:17:36,668
after my grandfather.

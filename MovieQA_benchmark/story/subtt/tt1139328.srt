1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:40,583
Come on!

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,752
But you realize
I know nothing about politics?

4
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,255
- You voted for him, didn't you?
- Adam Lang? Of course I did.

5
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:12,633
Everyone voted for him.
He wasn't a politician, he was a craze.

6
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,051
Well, there you go.

7
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:18,681
Look, it's a new ghostwriter he needs,
not another goddamn politico.

8
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,892
He was paid $10 million for these memoirs,

9
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:24,895
but rumor has it
the manuscript's a crock of shit.

10
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,149
Rhinehart's lending him his house
at the ocean so they can fix it,

11
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,985
and the pressure
must have gotten to McAra.

12
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,696
Pathologist said his blood was,
like, three parts booze.

13
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,823
You mean he drowned by accident?

14
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,493
Accident, suicide, who cares?
It was the book that killed him.

15
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,786
Well, that's encouraging.

16
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,748
Who is this McAra?
Should I have heard of him?

17
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:47,793
Yeah. He was some kind of aide to Lang
when he was Prime Minister,

18
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,755
so don't admit that you haven't.
He was with him for years.

19
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,509
I don't know, Rick.

20
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:01,056
This is a great opportunity for you.

21
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,184
Plus the money is good. Kids won't starve.

22
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,186
- I don't have any kids.
- I do.

23
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:20,868
Roy.

24
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,707
Who're you expecting to bomb you,
Random House?

25
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,167
We're publishing Lang's memoirs.

26
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,878
That's enough to make us a target,
apparently.

27
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,880
Thank you.

28
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,976
- How many have you seen?
- Five. You're the last.

29
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:54,819
I must be honest.

30
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,029
I don't think you're the right man
for this assignment.

31
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,906
Then it's a good job
it's not your decision, Roy.

32
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,578
John Maddox, chief executive
of Rhinehart, New York.

33
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:05,663
Sir.

34
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,458
Sidney Kroll,
Mr. Lang's Washington attorney.

35
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:10,501
Mr. Kroll.

36
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,587
And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know.

37
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:14,964
All right, Rick.

38
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:22,179
All right, I gather from Rick
you're aware of the situation?

39
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,015
Perhaps you can enlighten us

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,227
and tell us what exactly
you're gonna bring to this project.

41
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,562
Nothing.

42
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,191
No, I'm not gonna pretend
to be someone I'm not.

43
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,734
You have my CV.

44
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,113
His last effort was
the autobiography of a magician,

45
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,448
I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered.

46
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,243
Yeah, and it went straight
to number one, so...

47
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,495
After you turned it down, Roy.

48
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,125
Look, I don't read political memoirs.
Who does?

49
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:55,963
And I gather you've spent
$10 million on this book.

50
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,591
How much of that are you gonna see back?

51
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,801
Two? Three?

52
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,137
It's bad news for your shareholders.

53
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,223
And it's worse news
for your client, Mr. Kroll.

54
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:10,978
Adam Lang, he wants a place in history,
not in the remainder tables.

55
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,146
Oh, please!

56
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,398
It's because I know nothing about politics

57
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,193
that I'll ask the questions that get
right to the heart of who Adam Lang is.

58
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,738
And that is what sells autobiographies.

59
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,531
Heart.

60
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,869
Wow! That's nicely done.

61
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,580
- What utter balls.
- You think so?

62
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:33,334
John, of course.
Adam Lang's a world historical figure.

63
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,878
His autobiography is gonna be
a world-publishing event.

64
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,672
Yeah, well, I got warehouses filled with

65
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,425
world-publishing events
waiting to be pulped.

66
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,094
Sid?

67
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:48,766
Adam is obviously still very upset
by what happened to Mike McAra.

68
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,187
He was irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable, and yet he has to be replaced.

69
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:58,776
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits
of trying someone different.

70
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,029
In the end, it's about chemistry.
Do you work out, maybe?

71
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,531
- Not really.
- That's a pity. Adam likes to work out.

72
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,118
Actually, I know a good writer
on the Guardian who uses a gym.

73
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:14,458
Okay, maybe we could just run over
the publishing schedule, yeah?

74
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,960
We need to wrap this up in a month.

75
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,252
A month?
- Yes.

76
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,463
- You want the book in a month?
- We already have a first draft.

77
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,216
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.

78
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:27,137
That's why I like your résumé here.
You're fast, and you deliver.

79
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,015
You name it, he ghosts it.

80
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,600
And you're a Brit.

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,769
The ghost should be a Brit.

82
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,980
To get the jolly old tone right, right?

83
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:41,443
- Do you have any family commitments?
- No, I have no family. Why?

84
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,237
Adam is locked into a US lecture tour,

85
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:47,366
also a fundraising program
for the Adam Lang Foundation.

86
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,535
It's a month in the States. That's okay.

87
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,578
Couldn't I bring the manuscript back here
to work on?

88
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:56,041
I'm afraid not. It's in a secure environment
in Marty Rhinehart's own house.

89
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,460
Only a few people are allowed to handle it.

90
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,087
Sounds more like a bomb than a book.

91
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,343
I will need to see it myself at some point.
I am supposed to be editing it.

92
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:09,888
Yeah, in theory.
Actually, we need to talk about that.

93
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,726
How soon can you get over there?
- As soon as you want.

94
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,935
- He'll fly tonight.
- Rick.

95
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
It's okay.

96
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,446
Okay, you're in.

97
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,823
Oh!

98
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,950
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thanks.

99
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,410
- Rick.
- Thank you.

100
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,163
Actually, I have something here

101
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,414
- you might want to look at.
- Is that... Is that...

102
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:38,292
No, no, no, this isn't Adam's book.
No, it's another client of mine.

103
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,794
Yeah, perhaps you can let me know
what you think.

104
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,255
Sure.

105
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,132
Okay, if you're gonna get
that evening flight,

106
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,634
we'd better talk contracts with Rick here.

107
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,512
Wanna show our friend to the door?
Would you?

108
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,805
Roy?

109
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,726
Call you in an hour, buddy.

110
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:56,894
Hey!

111
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,437
Remember...

112
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,066
Heart.

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,864
There's something not quite right
about this project.

114
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,033
- What? Me, you mean?
- Obviously you.

115
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,535
And McAra. Suicide?

116
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:17,664
He didn't strike me as the suicidal type.

117
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,541
Always nice to see you, Roy.

118
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,545
Good luck.

119
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,435
Oh, God.

120
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,285
Thank you.

121
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,829
- Yeah?
Congratulations!

122
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,456
- On what?
- On having me as your agent.

123
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,625
Yeah, I can hardly believe my luck.

124
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:44,793
Are you packed?

125
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,295
I just got mugged.

126
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,215
Shit! Are you okay?

127
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,136
Yeah, all they took was the manuscript
that Sidney Kroll gave me.

128
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,846
What? Why?

129
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:57,931
I don't know. You tell me.

130
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,808
Are you hurt?

131
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,978
No, I'm fine. I think they must
have followed me from Rhinehart's.

132
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,856
Why would they do that?

133
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,942
Well, maybe they thought
I had Lang's book.

134
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,361
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.

135
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,615
You're still okay to fly tonight, right?

136
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,783
For God's sake, Rick, I'm in shock.

137
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,203
Well, here's another shock for you.

138
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,164
For one month's work
on a manuscript that's already written,

139
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:28,170
Rhinehart Inc. Is willing
to pay you $250,000, plus expenses.

140
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,215
Window seat or aisle?

141
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,843
Islam has
issued a statement claiming responsibility.

142
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,846
We hope to bring you more on that
later in the bulletin.

143
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,975
Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang is back in the news tonight.

144
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,895
According to leaked documents,
Mr. Lang authorized

145
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,105
the illegal use of British special forces

146
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,235
to seize four suspected al-Qaeda terrorists
in Pakistan

147
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:55,072
and then hand them over
for interrogation by the CIA.

148
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,368
The men, Nasir Ashraf, Marwat Sayed,
Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed,

149
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:04,373
all British citizens, were seized in the
Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago.

150
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,918
All four were allegedly transferred
out of the country

151
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,420
to a secret location and tortured.

152
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,798
Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died
under interrogation.

153
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,968
Such an operation
would have been illegal under...

154
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,678
Yeah?
- Where are you?

155
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:21,098
Heathrow, like you.
Waiting for my flight to New York.

156
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,182
Can you see the news?

157
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,768
The Lang story? Yeah, I'm watching it now.

158
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,104
What have you gotten me into?

159
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:31,692
I got you into a quarter of a million bucks,
pal, that's what I got you into.

160
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,277
They're calling my flight. I gotta go.

161
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,820
Listen, I just realized

162
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,656
Sidney Kroll could have given me
that manuscript deliberately

163
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,617
so it would look like
I was carrying Lang's book.

164
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:41,952
Why the hell would he do that?

165
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:45,747
I don't know. To use me as a tethered goat?

166
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,751
Get some sleep on the plane.
You're sounding weird.

167
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:53,297
"A tethered goat".
I'll call you next week.

168
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,465
...and long-term psychological trauma.

169
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,050
In other words, torture.

170
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,760
Hello, sir.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

171
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,096
- Have you got the Evening Standard?
- We do, yes.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,806
Thanks. Thank you.

173
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,808
Hello, madam.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

174
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,644
Yes, please. Thank you.

175
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,149
Passport?

176
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,134
This is an absolute scandal!

177
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,218
Amelia Bly. Welcome.

178
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,471
I'm Adam's assistant.

179
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:51,224
Adam's in New York, unfortunately,
and won't be back until later this afternoon.

180
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,977
Actually, forget I said that,
it's bloody ridiculous!

181
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,356
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid Ruth's having one of those days.

182
00:14:58,441 --> 00:14:59,983
If this isn't a good time, I could go to...

183
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,277
No, no. She's keen to meet you.

184
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,947
- Right. Shall we make a start?
- Right.

185
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,118
- How was yourjourney?
- Long.

186
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,828
We're a small team.
Thanks.

187
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,288
This is Alice.

188
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,957
Lucy's traveling with Adam.

189
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,669
We need another pair of hands, but Adam
couldn't bring himself to replace Mike.

190
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,838
- They were together so long.
- How long were you with him?

191
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:24,341
Eight years.
I'm an attachment from Number 10.

192
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,009
Ah. Poor Number 10.

193
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,511
Before I show you the manuscript,

194
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,597
I need you to sign
this confidentiality agreement.

195
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,436
Sign here.

196
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,653
And here.

197
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,791
Wow, quite a place.

198
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,960
Don't you get lonely at night?

199
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,711
It's my husband I miss the most.

200
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,922
Are you married?
I noticed you don't wear a wedding ring.

201
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,049
I can't, sadly. It's far too large.

202
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,302
- It bleeps when I go through airport security.
- Oh.

203
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,888
Here we are.

204
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:19,312
The manuscript is not to be removed
from this room. It's not to be copied.

205
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,775
You have six hours
before Adam gets in from New York.

206
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,778
- Can you finish by then?
- I'll try.

207
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,781
I'll ask Dep to bring you up
a sandwich for lunch.

208
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:30,907
Thanks.

209
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,622
Have fun.

210
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,466
"Langs are Scottish folk,
originally, and proud of it.

211
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:52,971
"Our name is a derivation of 'long,'
the Old English word for 'tall,'

212
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,516
"and it is from north of the border
that my forefathers hail".

213
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,184
Fuck.

214
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,272
"My great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lang,

215
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:06,109
"was born in 1862 in Pitlochry, Scotland.

216
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,153
"One of nine children, seven of them boys".

217
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,989
"The American President
was much taller than I had expected".

218
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,285
"This year's European summit
was particularly interesting".

219
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,288
"I always found the Queen, in private,
to have a delightful sense of humor".

220
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,516
Thanks.

221
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,378
"I've always been an optimist.
The present is where we live.

222
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:10,340
"Ruth and I look forward to the future,
whatever it may hold".

223
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,595
As bad as that?

224
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,098
Oh, hello.

225
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:21,643
Well? How bad is it?

226
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,269
You haven't read it?

227
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,688
Not all of it.

228
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,941
- Well, let's just say it needs some work.
- How much work?

229
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,111
Well, all the words are there.
They're just in the wrong order.

230
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,657
Come on. You look like you need a break.

231
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,954
You were my idea.

232
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,081
I was?

233
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,542
You wrote Christy Costello's memoirs,
didn't you?

234
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,252
You read those?

235
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,755
We stayed at his house in Mustique,
last winter.

236
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,257
The book was beside the bed.

237
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,092
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, why?

238
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,470
It was brilliant, in a horrible sort of way.

239
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:02,642
How you turned his ramblings
into something vaguely coherent.

240
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:07,522
I said to Adam, "Here's the guy
to write your book, not Mike".

241
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:12,652
God, I miss home.

242
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,618
It's like being married
to Napoleon on St. Helena.

243
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,705
- Why don't you go back to London?
I don't feel I can leave him alone.

244
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,207
There's something not quite right
with him at the moment.

245
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,879
Amelia told me he was very upset
at the death of Michael McAra.

246
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,297
Oh, she did, did she?

247
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:37,135
Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert
on my husband's emotions, I'm not sure.

248
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,099
Losing Mike was a blow, of course,

249
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,894
but it's not just that.

250
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:50,982
It's having to relive everything,
year by year, for this bloody book.

251
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,403
Oh, dear.

252
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:59,699
You must be wondering
what you've let yourself in for.

253
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,871
Fine, fine. I'll tell him.

254
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,539
They're just about to land.

255
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,749
On Thursday, he's in Chicago.

256
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,001
Actually, I think I'll go and meet him.

257
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:13,213
Amelia can stay here
and polish her nails or something.

258
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,381
Why don't you come, say hello?

259
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,594
Fine. I'll travel in the backup car.
I can do my nails in there.

260
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,435
Hi, darling.

261
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,437
- How was New York?
- Short and sweet.

262
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:13,648
Hi, Barry. Hi, Amelia.

263
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,568
Hello. Who are you?

264
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,819
I'm your ghost.

265
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,737
Right.

266
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:22,198
Don't worry. He isn't always such a jerk.

267
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,960
This place really comes alive at night.

268
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,409
You'll be with us for four weeks,
is that right?

269
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,535
I'm afraid so.

270
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,954
And the bill goes directly
to the Rhinehart Corporation?

271
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,039
Good.

272
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,499
That doesn't include the mini-bar.

273
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,629
All right. He's ready for you.

274
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,218
How's your hotel? Quiet?

275
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,386
Monastic.

276
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,721
That's nice. No distractions.

277
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,314
Thanks, love.

278
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,111
Hi, man. You ready to start?

279
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,529
Absolutely.

280
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,297
Is the manuscript loaded on this?
- It is.

281
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,340
Can I have it?

282
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,384
I'm sorry,
that would be a security risk.

283
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,095
You mean I've got to retype
the whole manuscript?

284
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,514
Have you really got my entire book
on that little thing?

285
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,266
We can get 100 books on it, Adam.

286
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,519
And it can be copied in a flash.
That's the trouble.

287
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,854
Amazing.

288
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,315
You know the worst thing about my life?
You get so out of touch.

289
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,610
Everything's done for you.
You don't drive, you don't carry money.

290
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:07,989
If I need cash,
I have to borrow it from the protection boys.

291
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,992
This is the kind of details
we need in the memoirs.

292
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,203
I couldn't put that in.
People would think I was a complete idiot.

293
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:18,541
No, not at all. No, this shows what it's like
being Prime Minister.

294
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,418
That's exactly
what the readers want to know.

295
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:24,047
How does it feel to run a country?
How does it feel to be so cut off?

296
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,174
How does it feel to be so hated?

297
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,550
Thanks a lot.

298
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,385
And so loved.

299
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,054
Amelia, what do you think?

300
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,681
I think I should leave you two alone.

301
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,151
So, how do we go about this?

302
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,820
I interview you.

303
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,615
I turn your answers into prose.

304
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,659
Here and there, I'll add linking passages,
imitating your voice.

305
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:54,827
Okay.

306
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,915
- You heard about Mike?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

307
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,088
We should put in
something nice about him.

308
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,090
I think his mother would like that.

309
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,508
Of course.

310
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,640
Well, um, the first thing that struck me was,

311
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,683
you became such a successful politician

312
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,353
precisely because
you didn't appear to be a politician.

313
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,064
It's certainly not something I wanted to do
when I was younger.

314
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,775
I thought most student politicians
were complete nerds.

315
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,112
Well, I'm with you there.
So, what turned you on to politics?

316
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,406
Turned me on, indeed.

317
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:39,747
Let's see, I was 23, something like that,
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

318
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,418
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
it was raining.

319
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:48,214
I was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.

320
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,135
And, you know,
I'd been out the night before

321
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,720
and had a few drinks and what have you.

322
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:57,598
So, I get the pillow and I put it
over my head, and it starts up again.

323
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,183
Knock, knock, knock, knock!

324
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:03,229
And I get up, I'm swearing,
I go to the door and there's this girl.

325
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:07,191
She's soaking wet, but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections.

326
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,818
And that's it.

327
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,864
- I'm in love.
- And this is Ruth?

328
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,241
This is Ruth.

329
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,871
And the only way I can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

330
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,414
This is great.

331
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,499
You want to use this?

332
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,294
Use it? I think we should open
the whole book like this.

333
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,212
"I went into politics out of love,

334
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:32,466
"not love for a party or an ideology,
but out of love for a woman".

335
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,304
Could you transcribe this
as quickly as possible, please?

336
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,722
Of course.

337
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,557
- Thanks.
- How's it going?

338
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,517
Pretty well. He keeps calling me "man".

339
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,645
He always does that
when he can't remember someone's name.

340
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,023
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.

341
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,144
Oh, shit.

342
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,938
It's awful.

343
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,982
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't realize there was anyone up there.

344
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,525
What on earth is going on?

345
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,194
It's just a security drill, sir.
We have it once a week.

346
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,989
So, there you are.
I'd rather lost track of you.

347
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,158
I'm a big boy now.
Can't keep your eye on me all the time.

348
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,744
Don't wander around on your own.
The security boys don't like it.

349
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:05,995
Gotcha.

350
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,376
- Did you win?
- Didn't play tennis. Gym.

351
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,757
Gym? What's he in training for?
The Olympics?

352
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,260
Here's your transcript.

353
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,644
Cambridge. Let's talk about that.

354
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,314
Sorry? Um...

355
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,399
Cambridge?

356
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,987
It was such a long time ago,
I can hardly remember.

357
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,614
You did a lot of acting?

358
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,407
Some.

359
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,078
It must have been good training
for politics, acting?

360
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,497
It was a good way to meet girls.

361
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,041
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?

362
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,835
Still, acting must have been
very important to you.

363
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,253
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.

364
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,339
You know, you go on the stage,
pretend to be somebody else,

365
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,050
and people actually applaud you for it.

366
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,593
Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.

367
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,719
- No.
- Why not?

368
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,638
Because these are the memoirs
of a Prime Minister.

369
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,932
And whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with,

370
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,059
they always said I was a bloody actor!

371
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:13,479
Do you know what the Times ofLondon
said the day I resigned?

372
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,481
"Kindly leave the stage".

373
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:19,151
So, no, we won't dwell, if you don't mind,
on my student days as an actor.

374
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:22,071
We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it.

375
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,157
Would you like to take
a break for a minute?

376
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,577
Actually, that would be a good idea,
thank you. I need to make a call.

377
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,009
What a bastard.

378
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,764
Look at this.

379
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,105
"Former British Foreign Secretary
Richard Rycart

380
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,233
"has asked the International Criminal Court
in The Hague to investigate allegations

381
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,318
"that the former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang

382
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,029
"ordered the illegal handover
of terrorist suspects

383
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,157
"for torture by the CIA."

384
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,617
Don't!

385
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,372
The pack is on the move.

386
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,291
Unplug all the phones.

387
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,794
Is Ruth still out walking?
Shit! She is, isn't she?

388
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,255
- Barry! Barry!
- Yeah.

389
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:24,800
Would you please find Mrs. Lang
and get her back here as soon as you can?

390
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,552
- Right.
Let's go.

391
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,305
- Rycart has made a statement.
- Yes, I know.

392
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,723
- He just called me.
It's unbelievable.

393
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,058
He wanted very much to let me know
it was nothing personal.

394
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,144
He wanted very, very much to tell me
that it was only

395
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:39,148
because of his well-known stand
on human rights

396
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,484
that he couldn't keep quiet any longer.

397
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,112
"His well-known stand on human rights".
Dear God!

398
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,205
- Sorry to lose my temper earlier.
- Forget it.

399
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,666
And have you told her?

400
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,628
Yes. Just called her.
And how did she take it?

401
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,963
Sorry, Adam. This is running on AP.

402
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,759
"According to sources in The Hague,

403
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:10,012
"the prosecutor's office
of the International Criminal Court

404
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,972
"will issue a statement in the morning".

405
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,349
Oh, Adam.

406
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,809
Thank you, Alice.

407
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:19,021
Why weren't we given some warning
of this? Where's Downing Street?

408
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,231
The phones are disconnected.

409
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,857
Switch is probably
trying to get through now.

410
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:26,153
Now? What freaking use is now?
What are you people doing?

411
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,363
I mean, you're not telling me that

412
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,114
the Cabinet Office
didn't know this was coming?

413
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,368
The war crimes court doesn't warn
a suspect who's under investigation.

414
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,828
That's what Adam is now, a suspect?

415
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,163
You need to call Sid Kroll.

416
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,249
I think we should call London first.

417
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,835
Adam! If it suits them,
they will hang you out to dry.

418
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,046
You need a lawyer. Call Sid.

419
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,300
- Get Sid on the line.
- What about the media?

420
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,844
Issue a holding statement, something short.

421
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,721
This is when we need Mike.

422
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,557
I'll write something.

423
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,976
Let him do it.
He's supposed to be the writer.

424
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,353
- Hang on a minute.
I should sound confident.

425
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:02,856
Not defensive, that'd be fatal.
But I shouldn't be cocky.

426
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,608
No bitterness, no anger, and don't say

427
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:08,112
I'm pleased at this opportunity
to clear my name or any balls like that.

428
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,531
So, you're not defensive,
but you're not cocky.

429
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,199
You're not angry, but you're not pleased?

430
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,868
That's it.
- Then what exactly are you?

431
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,248
Told you he was funny.

432
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:22,126
I've always been a passionate supporter...

433
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,711
No, scrub that.

434
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,548
I've always been
a strong, no, committed supporter

435
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:31,051
of the work
of the International Criminal Court. Has he?

436
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,761
You're the writer.

437
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,431
The struggle against terror is too important

438
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,642
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge.

439
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,646
Very good.
You could be the new Mike McAra.

440
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:46,317
- Hello?
John Maddox.

441
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:50,154
This is gonna be big.
This can only be good for us.

442
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,948
- Could be.
- Here's the first chapter right here.

443
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,241
Okay.

444
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,410
What've you covered so far?

445
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,703
Um...

446
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,664
The early years, childhood, university.

447
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:03,584
All right, forget that crap.
Get him focused on the war crimes.

448
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,420
And he can't talk to anybody else, all right?

449
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,297
- Right.
- It's gotta be our exclusive.

450
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,049
Any chance of you
finishing the manuscript sooner?

451
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,133
Sooner?

452
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,926
Yeah, yeah, sooner.

453
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,012
Well, how much sooner?

454
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,972
I'm thinking two weeks.

455
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,558
Jesus.

456
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,895
Look, I know it's tough,
but if anyone can do it, you can.

457
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,314
I'm relying on you. We'll talk.

458
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,822
Shit.

459
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,496
I'd never have guessed you smoked.

460
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,249
I only allow myself one
at times of great stress or contentment.

461
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,752
- And which is this?
- Very funny.

462
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,171
Maddox just called. He wants the book
in two weeks instead of four.

463
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,464
Christ. Good luck.

464
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:54,051
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a lift back to my
hotel. I could get on with some work there.

465
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,594
You're not planning on
taking that manuscript

466
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,513
- out of here, are you?
- Course not.

467
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,474
Because you do realize
how serious this is getting, don't you?

468
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,519
- You can search me, if you like.
- That won't be necessary.

469
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:08,774
All right. Fetch your stuff.
I'll get one of the boys to take you.

470
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:12,444
Mr. Lang insisted he had always been
a committed supporter

471
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:15,489
of the work
of the International Criminal Court.

472
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,157
Mr. Lang added, quote,

473
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,535
"The struggle against terror
is too important

474
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,204
"to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge".

475
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,248
- Same again, sir?
- This is being widely interpreted as...

476
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,749
- Yes, thanks.
...an attack on the former British

477
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:29,336
Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart,
who has asked...

478
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:30,546
Could we change the channel?

479
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,631
- Sure.
- Thanks.

480
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,176
At issue is the practice
of so-called waterboarding,

481
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,387
an interrogation technique
considered a war...

482
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,475
- Something to eat?
- What've you got?

483
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,146
- Club sandwich. Clam chowder.
- Chowder will be fine.

484
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,191
You're English?

485
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,904
And so are you.

486
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,823
Indeed I am.

487
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,285
- You here on a holiday?
- No, I'm working.

488
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,162
So, what's your line?

489
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,622
Just this and that. Excuse me.

490
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,669
I hear Adam Lang's on the island.

491
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,340
Is he?

492
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,759
So I hear.

493
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,429
You don't happen to know
his whereabouts, do you?

494
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,513
No.

495
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,142
No, I'm afraid not. If you don't mind.

496
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,353
Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund.

497
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:32,024
A slap pass to Lukas Krajicek.
He's in trouble against

498
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,486
Barret Jackman and the referee...

499
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,654
Asshole.

500
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,241
...and Ohlund can't hold it in again,
and this power play is just about over.

501
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,786
Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on.

502
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,532
Hello?

503
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,502
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

504
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:37,464
Yeah, can you tell me,
has anyone gone up to my room?

505
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,590
No, sir.

506
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,759
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.

507
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,098
What about that other guest? The, um...

508
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,892
There's an Englishman.

509
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,687
You're the only guest in the hotel, sir.

510
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,369
- Hello?
You need to check out

511
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,204
of the hotel immediately.

512
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,498
Things have changed. A car is on its way.

513
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,708
What?

514
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,376
See you then.

515
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,545
Hello?

516
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,576
Okay.
- Just check on that. Okay?

517
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,878
- It's getting big, huh?
- So I see.

518
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,505
Who're you with?

519
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,216
I'm on my own.

520
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,680
Oh, sod it. Here we go again.

521
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,649
You've reached the office
of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.

522
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,485
Hi, Rick.
Now they want the book in two weeks.

523
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,946
Thanks for getting me this job.

524
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,782
Can't talk.
Some peace protestors are trying to kill me.

525
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:30,702
You're working for a murderer!
You're working for a murderer!

526
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,790
Liar! Liar! Liar!

527
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,506
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm aging.

528
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,801
This place is Shangri-La in reverse.

529
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,345
I tried to call you
several times last night.

530
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,554
You didn't answer.

531
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,348
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

532
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,642
Really? And the hotel phone?

533
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:54,851
I'm a heavy sleeper.

534
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,479
Well, you can do your heavy sleeping here
from now on.

535
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,690
- Here?
We're under siege.

536
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,275
You can't run the media gauntlet every day.

537
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,822
Eventually, they'll discover who you are.
And that would be horrid for you.

538
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,249
So, this is where you put the granny.

539
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,375
No.

540
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,378
This is where we put Mike McAra.

541
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:31,346
We haven't had a chance to clear it yet.
The sheets have been changed, though.

542
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,057
Actually, I make it a rule
never to stay in a client's house.

543
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:37,185
But now you can have constant access
to the manuscript.

544
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,353
Isn't that what you want?

545
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,689
Besides, Sid Kroll
will be arriving any minute.

546
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:44,192
Why don't you settle in,
and then come up and join us?

547
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,862
- You're practically one of us now.
- I am?

548
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:51,033
You drafted the statement yesterday.
That makes you an accomplice.

549
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,456
So, here's the score. You're not being
charged, you're not being arrested.

550
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,874
None of this is gonna amount
to a hill of beans.

551
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,751
The only thing the prosecutor is asking for

552
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,878
is permission to launch
a formal investigation.

553
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,172
- Investigating me for what?
- Connie?

554
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,132
Either crimes against humanity
or war crimes.

555
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,885
Well, that's absurd.
It's not exactly genocide.

556
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,888
"Under Article 25,
a person shall be guilty of a war crime

557
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:15,599
"if that person facilitates the commission
of such a crime

558
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,351
"or aids, abets or otherwise assists
in its commission".

559
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:21,104
- That's rather sweeping.
- Well, if it's any comfort,

560
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,649
you're in no jeopardy
as long as you stay here, among friends.

561
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,027
Are you saying
I can't leave the United States?

562
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:30,739
As your attorney, I strongly advise you
not to travel to any country

563
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,867
that recognizes the jurisdiction
of the International Criminal Court.

564
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,411
Well, just about every country in the world
recognizes the ICC.

565
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,621
America doesn't.

566
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,331
- Who else?
Josh?

567
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:42,334
Iraq, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Israel.

568
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:46,880
- And that's it?
There are some parts of Africa.

569
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,048
Wait!

570
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:51,593
I wish to make a short statement.
I won't be taking questions.

571
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,096
This morning, I was granted power
to investigate

572
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,766
the former British Prime Minister,
Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang,

573
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:03,522
under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court.

574
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,983
I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang
and the British government

575
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,027
to ask for their full cooperation. Thank you.

576
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:18,578
Oh, God.

577
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,039
Okay, we need to get you to Washington,
Adam, right away.

578
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,332
My plane is at the airport.

579
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,668
We can get you in to see
the Speaker of the House at lunchtime

580
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:27,170
and have a photo-op
with the Secretary of State in the afternoon.

581
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:29,131
Won't it look as if I'm panicking?

582
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,299
No, they'll both say
that the meetings were fixed weeks ago.

583
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,801
Well, what the hell
are we supposed to be discussing?

584
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,137
AIDS? Poverty? Climate change?

585
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,223
Who cares? The important thing
is to show the world it's business as usual.

586
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,434
- What do you think, Ruth?
- I think it's a terrible idea.

587
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,103
You'll look as though
you're America's whipping boy,

588
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,729
running crying home to daddy.

589
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:47,482
- So, what would you do?
Fly to London.

590
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,860
The government will support you.

591
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:54,239
"The British government
will cooperate fully with the investigation".

592
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,950
Really? And what makes you think that?

593
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,911
I'm not thinking it, Ruth, I'm reading it.

594
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,456
...believe we can now go live
to the UN in New York,

595
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:07,169
where the former British Foreign Secretary,
Richard Rycart,

596
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,962
is about to make a statement.

597
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:12,340
I watched the announcement in The Hague
today with great shock and sadness.

598
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,843
Adam Lang was
and is an old friend of mine.

599
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,469
You cheeky bugger!

600
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:19,848
I regret that he's chosen to bring this down
to a personal level.

601
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,601
This isn't personal. This is about justice.

602
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,896
This is about making sure
every political leader knows

603
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,522
when they make a decision,

604
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:30,442
they will be held to account
by international law.

605
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:31,985
Thank you.

606
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:33,862
If you're called to testify, sir, will you go?

607
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:37,365
Certainly, I'll go.
- Of course you will, you little shit!

608
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,701
That settles it. Washington it is.

609
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,411
I still say it'll look bad.

610
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:44,372
Not as bad as being led away
from Heathrow in handcuffs.

611
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:45,665
It would show you had some guts.

612
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,667
Well, then why the hell
don't you just fly back without me?

613
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:51,546
If the British government wants to hand me
over to this kangaroo court, then sod them!

614
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,840
I'll go where people want me.

615
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:58,094
Amelia, tell the boys we're leaving.
Have one of the girls pack me a bag.

616
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:00,055
You'd better pack one for yourself.

617
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:03,725
Why don't you share a suitcase?
It's so much more convenient.

618
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:32,587
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to abandon you.

619
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,006
At least this might help sales.

620
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,592
Perhaps Rhinehart's PR department
organized the whole thing.

621
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,055
Well, tell them to stop it, will you?

622
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:51,231
Okay, people,
remember, happy, happy faces.

623
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:02,200
So, just to summarize
what we know so far, it's now official,

624
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:05,078
the special prosecutor
of the International War Crimes Court

625
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:06,788
is to launch an investigation...

626
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:13,753
...the special prosecutor announced
she was going to investigate Mr. Lang,

627
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,339
well, there was a big cheer, I can tell you.

628
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,675
So, let's talk to some of these protestors.

629
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,969
- You, sir, you're English, I believe.
- I am.

630
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,470
So, what brings you so far from home?

631
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:26,099
My son. He was killed
in one of Mr. Lang's illegal wars.

632
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:29,811
Lang's never visited the injured.
He's never apologized.

633
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:33,064
I was in the British Army for 30 years.
It's a disgrace!

634
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:34,607
Thank you.
Can I ask you the same question?

635
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,777
You're a murderer, Lang!
You're a war criminal!

636
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:40,155
Liar, liar, liar!

637
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,157
Lang, Lang, Lang!

638
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,992
Killer, killer, killer!

639
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:47,746
Lang, Lang, Lang!
Liar, liar, liar!

640
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,251
Lang, Lang, Lang!
Killer, killer, killer!

641
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:56,838
Over here, Mr. Lang!

642
00:45:56,922 --> 00:46:00,008
I apologize for keeping you waiting so long
in the cold.

643
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:02,385
What's your reaction
to Mr. Rycart's statement?

644
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:06,765
I'd like to say a few words
in response to the news from The Hague.

645
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:12,729
These are strange times when
those who stand for freedom and justice

646
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,023
are accused of being criminals,

647
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:19,277
while those who incite hatred
and seek to destroy democracy

648
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:22,447
- are treated as victims.
War criminal!

649
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,117
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

650
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:30,830
While I have breath in my body,
I shall fight terrorism...

651
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:31,915
Liar!

652
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:36,544
...whether it's on the battlefield
or, if necessary, in the courts.

653
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,713
Thank you very much.

654
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:41,299
Have you spoken
to the President, Mr. Lang?

655
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,596
Oh, for God's sake.

656
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,979
God.

657
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,414
Shit!

658
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,669
One minute!

659
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:28,007
Yes?

660
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,846
Sir? You want lunch?

661
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:37,141
That would be great.
Give me five minutes, thanks.

662
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:01,332
P. Emmett?

663
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:38,036
Richard Rycart.

664
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:41,623
Who is this?

665
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,747
- Dep?
- Sir?

666
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:24,999
Is there a map of the island
that I could borrow?

667
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,684
Look. It's rain soon.

668
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,144
I don't know. I think it will be all right.

669
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:50,316
Why don't you take the car?
It's for guests. Here's the key.

670
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:54,320
- For our guests, it's very nice car.
- Oh. Yes.

671
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:57,281
Mr. McAra loved this car very, very much.

672
00:51:57,825 --> 00:52:01,327
Do you know... I'm gonna take the...
I'm gonna take the bicycle. Thanks.

673
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:03,037
This is... Just a moment, just a moment.

674
00:52:03,122 --> 00:52:07,959
It's rain. I give...
I give you my hat and my gloves.

675
00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:10,378
- That's very kind, thank you.
- Good luck for you.

676
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:13,297
- Thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye.
- Bye-bye.

677
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:45,705
Just one moment.

678
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,873
God, you frightened me.

679
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:13,751
- You're British.
- I am, yeah.

680
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:17,046
It's okay, you can shelter. Sheltering's free.

681
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:20,299
No, no, no, no! Rosie, Rosie!

682
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:22,301
In you go. In, in.

683
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,262
Here.

684
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,017
- So, you're British, huh?
- Yeah.

685
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:34,355
- You anything to do with this fellow, Lang?
- In a way, yes.

686
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,107
Seems intelligent.

687
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,526
Now why did he go
and get himself mixed up

688
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,194
with that damn fool in the White House?

689
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:42,029
Well, that's what everyone wants to know.

690
00:54:42,114 --> 00:54:45,116
What brings you to this part of the island?

691
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,451
I'm sightseeing.

692
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:51,372
Well, you sure picked a heck of a day for it.

693
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:55,877
Someone I knew was found washed up
on the beach there.

694
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:59,463
- You mean the British guy from the ferry?
- That's right.

695
00:55:00,132 --> 00:55:03,342
- Now that was a funny business.
- What do you mean?

696
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:07,430
No way should that current have carried him
that far west.

697
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,223
- No?
- No way!

698
00:55:09,308 --> 00:55:10,808
Are you sure?

699
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,769
I've lived here 54 years.

700
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:16,063
Did you mention that to the police?

701
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:20,776
The police? At my age,
I've better things to do, young man.

702
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,821
Annabeth's the one dealing with the police.

703
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,072
Your wife?

704
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:29,201
Annabeth Wurmbrand,
Mars Wurmbrand's widow.

705
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:33,122
She's the one
who told them about the lights.

706
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,918
- Lights?
- The flashlights on the beach.

707
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:40,922
- When?
- The night the body was washed up.

708
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,301
Could, could you, um...

709
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:49,013
Could you point me in the direction
of Mrs. Wurmbrand's house?

710
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,140
Oh, sure. You just...

711
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:54,185
Here. Follow it down the beach there.

712
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:57,438
It's the house nearest the ocean.
But she won't talk to you.

713
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,316
- Why not?
- She's in a coma.

714
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:03,653
Fell down stairs a week ago.

715
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:06,697
Been in a coma ever since.

716
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,740
Come down!

717
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:00,543
Come down!

718
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:06,841
Dep told me you were here!

719
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:08,509
What?

720
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:12,263
I said Dep told me you were here.

721
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:15,349
We came to get you before the storm came.
What are you doing?

722
00:57:15,434 --> 00:57:17,351
- Just taking the air.
- No, really.

723
00:57:17,436 --> 00:57:19,854
I wanted to see
where Mike McAra was found.

724
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,022
Why?

725
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:24,734
Adam's asked me
to write something about him in the book.

726
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:27,361
- Where's your bike?
- Up there.

727
00:57:27,446 --> 00:57:30,031
Barry, will you come around with the car?
We'll meet you out by the road.

728
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:32,825
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang.
Have to stay with you at all times.

729
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,785
For God's sake!

730
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,704
If we meet any terrorists, I'll text you.

731
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,206
All right, well, stay on the path.
Don't speak to anyone.

732
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,293
We won't talk to a soul, Officer, I promise.

733
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:50,301
Poor Mike. I can't bear the idea of him
ending up so far from home.

734
00:57:51,178 --> 00:57:54,597
I wonder if we'll ever know
whether it was accident or suicide.

735
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:57,058
Can't help you. I never met him.

736
00:57:58,477 --> 00:58:00,644
I suppose it doesn't really matter.

737
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:04,774
He was drunk. He drowned. End of story.

738
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:09,528
- What was he doing on the ferry?
- No idea.

739
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,492
Funeral's on Monday, in London.

740
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,746
I'm thinking of going.

741
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,039
One of us should put in an appearance,

742
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:22,458
and it doesn't seem likely
to be my husband.

743
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:23,793
I thought you didn't want to leave him.

744
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:27,379
Rather seems as though he's left me,
wouldn't you say?

745
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:43,038
- Hello?
- Sorry. I did knock. It's just me.

746
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:46,959
- I brought you some dry clothes.
- That's all right. I can manage.

747
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:49,170
Dinner's in an hour, okay?

748
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:54,091
Fine, thanks. For God's sake.

749
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:15,863
"It was at the time
of the London elections

750
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:18,199
"that I first got to know Ruth.

751
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:19,867
"She had gained a First at Oxford

752
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:24,246
"and then done a year's postgraduate
research as a Fulbright scholar".

753
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:25,998
Ruth.

754
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,463
Mmm.

755
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:36,217
- Perfect fit. Now all you need is a drink.
- What are we having?

756
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:40,679
Biodynamic white wine from
the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley.

757
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,811
Rhinehart. He doesn't
own a distillery, I suppose?

758
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:53,567
Mmm. Evening news.

759
01:00:54,736 --> 01:00:56,904
For war crimes.
Our political editor has more.

760
01:00:56,988 --> 01:00:58,322
Christ, we're the lead story.

761
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:01,951
Pour us some more wine, will you?

762
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:04,578
I may have to get drunk for a change.

763
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,874
In Washington,
Mr. Lang received firm promises of support,

764
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:12,086
both from congressional leaders
and the Secretary of State,

765
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,089
before going on to a private dinner tonight
with the Vice President.

766
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:18,634
Adam Lang has stood by America's side
in the war against terror,

767
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:21,762
and I'm proud to stand by his side
this afternoon.

768
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,348
- Adam, good to see you.
Thank you.

769
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,642
Thank you very much, indeed.
It's good to see you.

770
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,102
Don't grin.

771
01:01:28,937 --> 01:01:30,312
In Iraq, a suicide bomber...

772
01:01:30,397 --> 01:01:31,605
For God's sake!

773
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:45,911
Adam.

774
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:50,582
Calling to find out how I think it went.

775
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:54,295
- Let him sweat.
- Does he always ask for your advice?

776
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:55,879
Yes,

777
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:59,049
and always usually takes it.

778
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:01,635
Until lately.

779
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:06,140
- Are you married?
- Certainly not.

780
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:08,225
- Gay?
- No.

781
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,812
- Did you have a...
- I had a... Um...

782
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:15,024
- What? Girlfriend?
- Well, a bit more than that.

783
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:16,442
Partner?

784
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:18,610
A bit less than that.

785
01:02:18,695 --> 01:02:20,487
I don't know,
40,000 years of human language

786
01:02:20,572 --> 01:02:22,740
and there's no word
to describe our relationship.

787
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:23,991
It was doomed.

788
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,871
Come on. Let's eat.

789
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,961
- How's it going?
- The book?

790
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,424
- Well, it's not, to be honest.
- Sit there.

791
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:43,427
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

792
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:48,015
I find it difficult
to understand certain things.

793
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,601
- What things?
- Well...

794
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:55,314
I can't understand
why this good-looking lad

795
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:59,401
who goes to Cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics

796
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:03,238
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls,

797
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,783
- suddenly ends up...
- Married to me?

798
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,786
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.

799
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,539
No, what I don't get

800
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:15,959
is why, at 22,
he's suddenly a political activist.

801
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:18,754
- I mean, where does that come from?
- Didn't you ask him?

802
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,507
He said he joined the party because of you.

803
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:24,385
Told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain.

804
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:27,262
- I was gonna start the whole book with it.
- And now you're not?

805
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:30,391
No, I can't. It's not true.

806
01:03:31,643 --> 01:03:34,269
- Isn't it?
- Well, you know it's not.

807
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,730
He'd been a member for two years
before he met you.

808
01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:38,649
How do you know that?

809
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:42,486
I've got a copy
of his original party membership card.

810
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,532
Mike McAra found it in the archives.

811
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:50,369
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story
with too much research.

812
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:52,413
Did he find anything else?

813
01:03:52,497 --> 01:03:54,957
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.

814
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,421
You were more political than he was.

815
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:03,924
I was certainly a change
from his Cambridge girlfriends.

816
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,635
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.

817
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,638
And so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital,

818
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:12,266
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party.

819
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,185
And I thought he married me for my body.

820
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:21,984
Did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right?

821
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:25,279
Of course.
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?

822
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:27,781
Ouch.

823
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:33,203
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.

824
01:04:34,414 --> 01:04:37,249
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.

825
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:39,877
We are sensitive spirits.

826
01:04:42,005 --> 01:04:44,715
Talking of spirits, could you...

827
01:04:45,592 --> 01:04:47,050
Let me get you a proper drink.

828
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:59,229
White wine,
never really seen the point of it.

829
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:02,107
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.

830
01:05:02,192 --> 01:05:04,776
Ah! At last, something in common.

831
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:10,866
Do you know the coroner reckoned
he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?

832
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,618
That's convenient.

833
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:15,913
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

834
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,670
- You think his death was suspicious?
- Don't you?

835
01:05:23,755 --> 01:05:24,922
Yes.

836
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,425
Yes, I do.

837
01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:34,765
Today at the beach,

838
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:38,685
I met a man, an old timer
who was familiar with the currents.

839
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,521
And he said that there was no way

840
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:43,899
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot.

841
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:45,025
You're kidding.

842
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:49,279
He also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night.

843
01:05:49,364 --> 01:05:53,200
And then she fell down the stairs,
and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.

844
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:56,245
That's all you know? Jesus.

845
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,794
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Why?

846
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,296
I need to call Adam.

847
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:14,721
- What?
- Nothing.

848
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:18,183
- Aren't you gonna call him?
- Later. I'm going out for a walk.

849
01:06:18,268 --> 01:06:20,852
But it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.

850
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:22,938
- It'll clear my head.
- Well, I'll come with you.

851
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:26,733
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one
through on my own.

852
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:29,820
Stay here. Have another drink.
Don't wait up.

853
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:53,010
Are you awake?

854
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:57,014
- Well, I am now.
- I'm sorry.

855
01:06:57,765 --> 01:07:01,018
It's all right. Hang on.

856
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:08,525
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

857
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:12,362
I called Adam.

858
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:16,825
- And?
- Can I come in?

859
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:33,383
The day before Mike died,

860
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,261
he and Adam had a terrible row.

861
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:38,430
I've never told anyone this before,
not even the police.

862
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:40,557
- What about?
- I don't know.

863
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:44,936
But it was furious. They never spoke again.

864
01:07:48,483 --> 01:07:51,902
When I asked Adam about it,
he refused to discuss it.

865
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:57,449
After what you just said,
I felt I should ask him again.

866
01:07:58,034 --> 01:07:59,826
And what did he say?

867
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:02,704
He was having dinner
with the Vice President.

868
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:06,291
That bloody Bly woman
wouldn't even give him the phone.

869
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:10,253
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

870
01:08:11,756 --> 01:08:13,965
What's he got himself mixed up in?

871
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:17,928
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.

872
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:21,431
I'm scared.

873
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:26,269
I've never been scared in my life before,
but I am now.

874
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:32,234
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched.
Let me get you a towel.

875
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:49,876
Bad idea.

876
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:53,296
Do you mind?

877
01:08:54,132 --> 01:08:55,507
Course not.

878
01:09:55,193 --> 01:09:57,694
The modesty of the morning after?

879
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:59,529
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.

880
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:01,740
You mean you thought I'd be gone?

881
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:21,259
You've taken out the family tree.
He's very proud of the Langs.

882
01:10:21,803 --> 01:10:25,555
You know, if you want a family tree,
go to a garden center.

883
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:29,935
Why have you underlined my name
every time?

884
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:32,312
I was surprised
there wasn't more about you.

885
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,898
Why? I'm just the wife.

886
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:38,109
Yeah, even so.
You ought not to be written out of history.

887
01:10:38,194 --> 01:10:39,945
Why not? Most women are.

888
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:42,072
Then I'll reinstate you.

889
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,491
I'll put in all the occasions
that he's forgotten.

890
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:48,954
How kind. Like the boss's secretary
that remembers his wife's birthday for him?

891
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:53,333
Something like that. But then,
like you say, I'm not a proper writer.

892
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:56,002
- What are you planning to do?
- Leave.

893
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,840
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.

894
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:02,384
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.

895
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:05,178
- Where will you go?
- Back to the hotel.

896
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:08,890
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed
in a client's house.

897
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:12,727
- It always ends up with...
- With you screwing the client's wife?

898
01:11:12,812 --> 01:11:14,771
No, not always.

899
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:17,566
But it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance.

900
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:22,320
And the thing we discussed last night?
What do you propose to do about that?

901
01:11:22,405 --> 01:11:26,116
- That's none of my business.
- Well, you can't just ignore it.

902
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,370
Look, I'm his ghostwriter.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

903
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:34,082
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.

904
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,042
Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells All.

905
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:37,836
Well, if you ever decide to do that,
give me a call.

906
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,338
You think I need someone like you
to produce my book?

907
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:43,300
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.

908
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,678
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.

909
01:11:47,555 --> 01:11:49,598
And she can do the prison visits.

910
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:25,884
Morning, sir.

911
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:29,054
- Finished for the night, have we?
- Why don't you just piss off?

912
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:23,066
BMW ConnectedDrive.

913
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,235
Traffic is clear to your destination.

914
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,005
Join the road when possible.

915
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:06,067
In 200 yards, turn left.

916
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:09,112
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.

917
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,326
Turn around when possible.

918
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,537
This is getting ridiculous.

919
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:40,268
Turn around when possible.

920
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:42,145
All right, you win.

921
01:14:56,494 --> 01:14:59,370
In 50 yards, turn left.

922
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:08,421
Turn left.

923
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,674
You've got to be joking.

924
01:15:25,856 --> 01:15:27,690
Single or return?

925
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:29,692
Return. I hope.

926
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:32,695
Forty bucks, please.

927
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:35,406
- Have a good one.
- Ta.

928
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:01,891
Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.

929
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,310
A little more. Stop.

930
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:36,593
In 50 yards, turn left.

931
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:47,061
Please proceed to the indicated road.

932
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:50,231
In 200 yards, take the next exit.

933
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:54,068
In half a mile, make a sharp right turn.

934
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:55,612
Turn left.

935
01:16:57,489 --> 01:17:00,825
In 200 yards,
you will have reached your destination.

936
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:10,460
You have reached your destination.

937
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:21,739
Paul Emmett?

938
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,787
Professor Paul Emmett?

939
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:34,794
"Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University

940
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:37,297
"has written of the unique importance
of the English-speaking peoples

941
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:39,799
"in the spread of democracy
around the world.

942
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:42,010
"As these nations stand together,

943
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:45,888
"whenever they have faltered,
tyranny has gathered strength".

944
01:19:31,352 --> 01:19:32,435
Hello?

945
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:34,520
- Is that Mrs. Emmett?
- Who is this?

946
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:36,856
I wondered if I might have a word
with Professor Emmett.

947
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,274
Do you have an appointment?

948
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:41,986
It's about Adam Lang.
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.

949
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:44,405
Just a moment, please.

950
01:19:47,117 --> 01:19:50,995
This is Paul Emmett.
I think you must have made a mistake.

951
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,331
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?

952
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:57,543
We were contemporaries, yes,
but I can't claim to know him.

953
01:19:57,628 --> 01:20:00,171
I have a photograph of you together.

954
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:03,216
Come on up to the house.

955
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:36,082
I make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment.

956
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:40,378
But your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity.

957
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:45,842
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

958
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:48,428
Yes, he's here now.

959
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:51,722
- May I?
- Sure.

960
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:54,517
Yes. Yes, he's on his own.

961
01:20:55,394 --> 01:20:56,936
He didn't say.

962
01:20:57,688 --> 01:20:59,439
British, about 40.

963
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:03,443
Well, well.
I literally have no recollection of this.

964
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:05,445
- But that is you?
- Yes, it is.

965
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:08,739
I was on the board of the Dramat.
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.

966
01:21:08,824 --> 01:21:12,952
- The Dramat?
- I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.

967
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:14,954
I maintained my theatrical interests

968
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:18,374
when I went to Cambridge
for my doctoral research.

969
01:21:21,003 --> 01:21:22,753
- Could I keep this?
- No, I'm afraid not.

970
01:21:22,838 --> 01:21:26,924
- I'm sure I could get you a copy.
- Would you? That would be kind.

971
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:30,344
Maybe you could tell me
how you came by it.

972
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:32,096
I'd be happy to.

973
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,726
Come into my study.

974
01:21:41,148 --> 01:21:43,608
Yes, the wall of ego.

975
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:47,695
We all have one.
It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.

976
01:21:50,282 --> 01:21:51,741
Have a seat.

977
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:01,626
So, the picture.

978
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:02,793
Um...

979
01:22:03,879 --> 01:22:05,838
I've been working with Adam Lang
on his memoirs.

980
01:22:05,923 --> 01:22:08,007
Yes, I know, you told me.

981
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:12,929
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business,
this posturing by The Hague.

982
01:22:13,472 --> 01:22:16,807
As for Rycart, the worst
British Foreign Secretary since the war.

983
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:18,017
Lang was right to fire him.

984
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:20,937
- How well do you know Lang?
- Hardly at all.

985
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:25,441
- You seem surprised.
- He mentions you in his memoirs.

986
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:26,776
Oh, really?

987
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:32,240
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised.
What does he say?

988
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:52,677
That's very decent of him.

989
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:56,097
As Prime Minister,
he always had good instincts.

990
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:58,266
- But that doesn't mean I know him.
- But the...

991
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:01,394
That. That was taken at a reception
in London

992
01:23:01,812 --> 01:23:04,438
to mark the 10-year anniversary
of the Arcadia.

993
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:06,941
- Arcadia?
- Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.

994
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:09,777
Very highbrow.
No reason why you should have heard of it.

995
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:12,989
The Prime Minister graced us
with his presence.

996
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:16,701
What can you remember of him
from Cambridge?

997
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,955
- I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

998
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,541
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.

999
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:26,961
No one's mentioned the Cambridge
connection between us in all these years.

1000
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:30,673
- But you performed together?
- In one production.

1001
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:35,052
It was the summer revue.
I can't even remember what it was called.

1002
01:23:35,137 --> 01:23:38,681
- Can I show you something else?
- If you must.

1003
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,524
Oh, my.

1004
01:23:49,985 --> 01:23:52,069
Is that what I think it is?

1005
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,113
Let's hope he didn't inhale.

1006
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,073
But that is you standing behind him,
isn't it?

1007
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:57,617
I do believe it is.

1008
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:00,786
And I do believe I'm on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him

1009
01:24:00,871 --> 01:24:03,080
on the perils of drug abuse.

1010
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:08,085
Is Mr. Lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs?

1011
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,088
If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.

1012
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:13,174
My children would be mortified.

1013
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:15,801
They're so much more puritanical
than we were.

1014
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:19,722
- Can you tell me about any of the others?
- No, I'm afraid not.

1015
01:24:20,057 --> 01:24:23,225
The whole summer is a blur,
a very happy blur.

1016
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:28,314
Now, you were going to tell me
about these pictures.

1017
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:31,233
I got them from Michael McAra.

1018
01:24:32,069 --> 01:24:34,654
And he is whom, exactly?

1019
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:37,239
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.

1020
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:40,576
- He resigned?
- No, he died.

1021
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:42,870
I'm sorry to hear that.

1022
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:46,582
Yes, a couple of weeks ago.
He drove up here to see you.

1023
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,542
And he died a few hours afterwards.

1024
01:24:48,627 --> 01:24:52,088
He drove up to see me?
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

1025
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:55,841
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

1026
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:57,343
Poor fellow.

1027
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:03,224
I've never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless, have you?

1028
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:05,810
Seems to me it must be agonizing.

1029
01:25:06,436 --> 01:25:08,354
And the police never said anything to you
about this?

1030
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:10,856
I've had no contact with the police.

1031
01:25:10,941 --> 01:25:12,692
But were you here that weekend?

1032
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:15,027
This would have been
January, the 11th and 12th.

1033
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:23,119
A less equable man than I might start
to find your questions impertinent.

1034
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:32,837
Nancy?

1035
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:37,383
Our visitor wishes to know where we were
on the 11th and 12th of January.

1036
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:39,802
Do we possess that information?

1037
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:49,353
That was the Colorado weekend.

1038
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:53,315
Yes, of course, the Aspen Institute.

1039
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,027
Bipolar relationships in a multi-polar world.

1040
01:25:57,112 --> 01:26:00,364
- Sounds fun.
- Yes, it was. I was the main speaker.

1041
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:01,907
Look, just to return to Cambridge...

1042
01:26:01,992 --> 01:26:05,494
No, if you don't mind,
let's not return to Cambridge.

1043
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:08,873
I've said all I have to say on that subject.

1044
01:26:10,459 --> 01:26:14,545
I'm an avid reader of political memoirs.
I'll get hold of Mr. Lang's when they appear.

1045
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:17,548
Perhaps he'll send you a copy,
for old time's sake.

1046
01:26:17,632 --> 01:26:19,258
I doubt that very much.

1047
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,469
The gate will open automatically.

1048
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:25,139
Be sure to make a right
when you get to the end of the drive.

1049
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:27,850
If you turn left, the road
will take you deeper into the woods

1050
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,311
and you may never be seen again.

1051
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,709
BMW ConnectedDrive.

1052
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,095
When is the last ferry?

1053
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:13,182
- You're just in time.
- Here, I've got a return.

1054
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:14,642
All right.

1055
01:30:05,402 --> 01:30:06,568
Ticket?
- Uh...

1056
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:09,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

1057
01:30:41,563 --> 01:30:42,855
Shit.

1058
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,471
Hey, you! Stop!

1059
01:31:57,555 --> 01:31:59,598
Don't do that! Where you going?

1060
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:03,060
Man, get out of here!
Get out of here, asshole!

1061
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:06,146
Shit!

1062
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:55,445
You've reached the office
of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.

1063
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:56,780
Piss off.

1064
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:12,421
What can I do for you, sir?

1065
01:33:12,505 --> 01:33:14,339
You wouldn't happen to know
if there are any flights leaving

1066
01:33:14,424 --> 01:33:15,465
the airport tonight, would you?

1067
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,467
Not unless you've got your own private jet.

1068
01:33:17,552 --> 01:33:19,511
I lent it to my butler.

1069
01:33:19,596 --> 01:33:21,138
You Brits!

1070
01:33:22,974 --> 01:33:25,058
There's a flight to Boston

1071
01:33:25,143 --> 01:33:27,060
- 8:30 tomorrow morning.
- Shit!

1072
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:31,440
- How much for a room?
- For you, $89.

1073
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:35,611
- I'll pay cash.
- Who's got your card? The nanny?

1074
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:13,482
You rang back.

1075
01:34:16,152 --> 01:34:18,570
Are you going to stay on the line this time?

1076
01:34:18,655 --> 01:34:19,696
Yes.

1077
01:34:20,156 --> 01:34:22,115
I've been trying to call you.

1078
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:24,910
I know, I'm sorry...

1079
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,664
It didn't seem right, speaking to you.

1080
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:30,499
Who are you?

1081
01:34:31,334 --> 01:34:34,086
I'm the new ghostwriter...

1082
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:36,421
No names, don't use any names.

1083
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:38,966
How did you get this number?

1084
01:34:40,468 --> 01:34:44,763
It was in my predecessor's effects.

1085
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,266
The...

1086
01:34:48,101 --> 01:34:50,143
The thing is, I'm in trouble.

1087
01:34:50,228 --> 01:34:52,145
Is it because of your client?

1088
01:34:53,106 --> 01:34:54,231
Yeah.

1089
01:34:54,983 --> 01:34:57,609
There's something wrong,
but I didn't know who to talk to.

1090
01:34:57,694 --> 01:35:00,946
Where are you? Without being too specific.
On the island?

1091
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:06,410
I'm in the... No, I'm on the mainland,
on the... This motel by the ferry.

1092
01:35:06,494 --> 01:35:07,869
Room number?

1093
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:13,667
201.

1094
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:16,086
- Have you got the book with you?
- Yeah.

1095
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,796
Okay. Stay there.

1096
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:13,977
Hatherton?

1097
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:36,792
With $35 billion of funds at its disposal,

1098
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:39,586
the Hatherton Group brings together
a family of companies

1099
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,130
devoted to defense and security.

1100
01:36:42,215 --> 01:36:44,716
And with unrivaled expertise
in the Middle East,

1101
01:36:44,801 --> 01:36:47,552
including the services
of two former Presidents,

1102
01:36:47,637 --> 01:36:51,390
three Prime Ministers
and two directors of the CIA,

1103
01:36:51,474 --> 01:36:56,061
Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront
of the struggle against terror.

1104
01:36:58,898 --> 01:37:01,233
Hatherton, a shelter from harm.

1105
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:44,443
"According to CIA whistleblower
Frank Molinari,

1106
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:46,570
"Yale graduate Paul Emmett

1107
01:37:46,654 --> 01:37:50,532
"was reported to have joined the Agency
as an officer in 1971,

1108
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:54,953
"and was assigned to the Foreign
Resources Division of the Directorate of..."

1109
01:37:55,705 --> 01:37:57,038
1971?

1110
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,917
It's 1974.

1111
01:38:17,602 --> 01:38:19,394
- Hello?
You're alive.

1112
01:38:21,147 --> 01:38:22,189
Yeah, just about.

1113
01:38:22,273 --> 01:38:23,982
I've been worried sick.

1114
01:38:24,066 --> 01:38:27,444
The police called to say
they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!

1115
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:31,823
I'm so sorry. I parked it,
and then, and then I got off the boat.

1116
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:34,826
What the hell were you doing
on the mainland, anyway?

1117
01:38:34,911 --> 01:38:37,579
- I drove to New York.
- Why?

1118
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:40,916
I needed to see John Maddox.

1119
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:42,834
And where are you now?

1120
01:38:42,919 --> 01:38:46,630
I'm still at the ferry terminal.
I missed the last crossing.

1121
01:38:46,923 --> 01:38:49,007
You really are bloody hopeless!

1122
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:52,344
I just had Adam on the phone,
trying to get hold of you.

1123
01:38:52,428 --> 01:38:56,056
He's flying back tonight.
He sounds in a right state.

1124
01:38:56,891 --> 01:38:58,558
You didn't tell him about us, did you?

1125
01:38:58,643 --> 01:38:59,684
God's sake, Ruth!

1126
01:39:01,103 --> 01:39:03,605
I've got to go. I'll call you back.

1127
01:39:09,654 --> 01:39:12,030
- Who is it?
- Mr. Rycart sent me.

1128
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:14,199
Hold on.

1129
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:46,690
Just gonna do a quick check,
if you don't mind.

1130
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,998
Get your stuff together. We're leaving.

1131
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:09,045
Hey! That's private!

1132
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:34,029
- He's clean.
Thanks, Frank.

1133
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:41,369
Sorry about that. Please, get in.

1134
01:40:57,345 --> 01:41:00,472
- You thought it was a trap?
- It crossed my mind.

1135
01:41:00,556 --> 01:41:01,806
You do work for Lang.

1136
01:41:01,891 --> 01:41:03,850
Yeah, for three days. I hardly know the guy.

1137
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:08,730
Who does? I worked for him for 15 years,
till he fired me, and I still can't fathom him.

1138
01:41:08,814 --> 01:41:10,690
Yeah, his wife said more or less the same.

1139
01:41:10,775 --> 01:41:15,362
There you go. If someone as sharp as Ruth
can't get him, what hope do we have?

1140
01:41:15,446 --> 01:41:18,073
- Tough day?
- Yeah, you could say that.

1141
01:41:18,449 --> 01:41:20,033
You have the book?

1142
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:21,993
Yeah.

1143
01:41:22,495 --> 01:41:23,912
He's got it.

1144
01:41:31,087 --> 01:41:35,423
Before we go any further, I wonder
if I might take a look at that book.

1145
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:44,516
No. Before we go any further,
there's a few things I'd like to know first.

1146
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,519
Such as,
why did Mike McAra have your number?

1147
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:53,525
Okay. Sure.

1148
01:41:54,318 --> 01:41:55,777
He was helping me.

1149
01:41:56,696 --> 01:41:57,821
McAra? How?

1150
01:41:57,905 --> 01:42:01,449
Mike found the documents linking Lang
to the torture flights.

1151
01:42:01,534 --> 01:42:03,159
What? It was McAra
who gave you the documents?

1152
01:42:03,244 --> 01:42:07,497
- Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal.
- But why?

1153
01:42:07,581 --> 01:42:11,126
He didn't like discovering
he was working for a war criminal.

1154
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:12,502
Would you?

1155
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:15,296
Oh, I forgot. You are.

1156
01:42:17,633 --> 01:42:18,842
The book?

1157
01:42:48,581 --> 01:42:50,039
Well, don't tell me
you're gonna read it now.

1158
01:42:50,124 --> 01:42:52,500
Not all of it. Just the beginning.

1159
01:42:53,169 --> 01:42:55,253
There's something very important about it.

1160
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:57,881
Yeah. It's the cure for insomnia.

1161
01:42:57,965 --> 01:43:01,050
There you go, guys.
Can I get you anything else?

1162
01:43:01,135 --> 01:43:02,719
No, thanks, love.

1163
01:43:06,807 --> 01:43:11,352
Mike said he'd discovered something new.
It's the last time he called me.

1164
01:43:11,687 --> 01:43:15,148
He said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government.

1165
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:17,942
- What was it?
- He wouldn't say over the phone.

1166
01:43:18,027 --> 01:43:22,864
He just kept saying if anything happened
to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.

1167
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,866
"It's all there in the beginning".

1168
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,493
The beginning?

1169
01:43:27,578 --> 01:43:29,537
Then he means Cambridge.

1170
01:43:41,425 --> 01:43:42,717
What the hell's this?

1171
01:43:42,802 --> 01:43:45,595
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.

1172
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:48,973
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?

1173
01:43:49,058 --> 01:43:52,727
On the day that Mike McAra died,
he drove up to see Emmett,

1174
01:43:53,145 --> 01:43:55,021
and I think he was murdered
on his way home.

1175
01:43:55,105 --> 01:43:56,481
- What?
- I went to see Emmett today,

1176
01:43:56,565 --> 01:43:59,776
and two guys followed me from his house.
That's why I called you.

1177
01:44:01,028 --> 01:44:03,488
At the time that this photograph was taken,

1178
01:44:04,073 --> 01:44:07,992
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.

1179
01:44:08,494 --> 01:44:09,494
Emmett?

1180
01:44:09,578 --> 01:44:12,580
- Foreign Resources Division.
- Oh, my God.

1181
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:16,918
You realize how important this is,
don't you?

1182
01:44:17,336 --> 01:44:20,213
This explains why Lang went into politics.

1183
01:44:20,714 --> 01:44:24,509
Everyone knows he didn't have
a political thought in his pretty little head.

1184
01:44:25,094 --> 01:44:29,764
This is why he rose so quickly,
with a little help from his friends.

1185
01:44:30,391 --> 01:44:32,600
- Well, do you think it's possible...
- Okay, a quiz for you.

1186
01:44:32,685 --> 01:44:36,104
Name one decision Lang made in 10 years
as Prime Minister

1187
01:44:36,188 --> 01:44:38,940
which wasn't in the interests of the USA.

1188
01:44:40,651 --> 01:44:43,444
Well, come on, it's not a trick question.

1189
01:44:44,029 --> 01:44:47,699
Iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense,

1190
01:44:48,617 --> 01:44:52,078
buying American nuclear missiles,
support of terrorist rendition.

1191
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:55,790
The sacking of any minister
Washington didn't like,

1192
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,167
including yours truly.

1193
01:44:58,794 --> 01:45:00,378
McAra was right.

1194
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,297
This explains everything.

1195
01:45:07,136 --> 01:45:08,761
It's Amelia Bly.

1196
01:45:09,263 --> 01:45:10,597
Answer it.

1197
01:45:12,683 --> 01:45:16,019
- Hello, Amelia.
- Good evening. I have Adam for you.

1198
01:45:17,354 --> 01:45:18,521
Lang.

1199
01:45:18,856 --> 01:45:20,440
We're coming to get you.

1200
01:45:20,524 --> 01:45:21,649
What?

1201
01:45:22,109 --> 01:45:24,485
Ruth tells me
you're stuck at the ferry terminal.

1202
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:26,654
We've just taken off from New York.

1203
01:45:26,739 --> 01:45:29,532
Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up.

1204
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,327
Really? There's no need.

1205
01:45:32,411 --> 01:45:34,662
We've got a book to write, remember?

1206
01:45:36,332 --> 01:45:37,957
Hold on a sec, Adam.

1207
01:45:40,002 --> 01:45:42,712
He said he wants to
pick me up in his private jet.

1208
01:45:42,796 --> 01:45:44,672
- Say yes.
- What if it's a trap?

1209
01:45:44,757 --> 01:45:48,009
If you refuse, he'll get suspicious.
Tell him yes.

1210
01:45:50,346 --> 01:45:54,349
That'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks.
I'll get to the airport.

1211
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,351
See you there.

1212
01:45:58,354 --> 01:46:00,021
He sounds worried.

1213
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:03,066
I really don't think this is a good idea.

1214
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,317
You have no choice.

1215
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:06,444
Emmett must have told Lang
that I'd been to see him.

1216
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:08,863
So, what's he gonna do about it?
Dump you in the ocean?

1217
01:46:08,948 --> 01:46:11,741
- Well, it happened before!
- Which means it can't happen again.

1218
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:16,037
He can't drown two ghostwriters,
for God's sake. You're not kittens.

1219
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:21,250
All this is just theory.
We don't have any proof.

1220
01:46:21,335 --> 01:46:23,503
- You'll get us the proof.
- Me?

1221
01:46:23,587 --> 01:46:26,130
You're his ghostwriter.
Presumably, he lets you tape him.

1222
01:46:26,215 --> 01:46:28,424
- I use discs, actually.
- Discs, tapes.

1223
01:46:28,509 --> 01:46:30,802
You've got to confront him with this.
Record his reaction.

1224
01:46:30,886 --> 01:46:32,595
Even if he denies it, it's something.

1225
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:36,808
I'm in a tricky position here.
I signed a confidentiality agreement.

1226
01:46:36,892 --> 01:46:37,934
It's a bit late for that.

1227
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:41,270
- It means the discs are his property.
- The court can subpoena them.

1228
01:46:42,064 --> 01:46:44,649
And what if I don't record any discs?

1229
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:47,318
Then you'll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story.

1230
01:46:47,403 --> 01:46:48,486
Then I'll deny it.

1231
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:50,571
Then I'll give them this.

1232
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,326
Frank is recording every word.

1233
01:46:55,411 --> 01:46:57,036
Aren't you, Frank?

1234
01:47:00,582 --> 01:47:02,083
Oh! Come on!

1235
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:04,002
Don't look so shocked.
What did you expect?

1236
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:06,462
That I'd come into a meeting
with a man working for Lang

1237
01:47:06,547 --> 01:47:08,756
without taking any precautions?

1238
01:47:09,383 --> 01:47:12,093
Except you're not working
for Lang anymore.

1239
01:47:12,177 --> 01:47:14,095
You're working for the good guys.

1240
01:47:15,806 --> 01:47:17,974
You know all this is pointless, don't you?

1241
01:47:18,517 --> 01:47:21,728
In the end, he'll just retire over here
with his CIA pension,

1242
01:47:21,812 --> 01:47:25,481
and he'll tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.

1243
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:42,290
Good evening, sir.
Hatherton welcomes you aboard.

1244
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,042
Thank you.

1245
01:47:45,461 --> 01:47:47,336
It's my first time in a private jet.

1246
01:47:47,421 --> 01:47:49,297
Well, let's hope it's not your last.

1247
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,518
Hi, man.

1248
01:48:03,729 --> 01:48:05,688
- Take your seat.
- Thanks.

1249
01:48:07,107 --> 01:48:10,610
- Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados.
- Yes, sir.

1250
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:33,091
Do you mind?

1251
01:48:33,175 --> 01:48:34,967
Leave it off for now.

1252
01:48:35,511 --> 01:48:38,471
Ruth said you were in New York
to see Maddox.

1253
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:41,766
- That's right.
- How was he?

1254
01:48:42,643 --> 01:48:43,684
He was fine.

1255
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:45,269
Full of energy?

1256
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:48,064
- You know John.
- Yes, I do know John.

1257
01:48:49,483 --> 01:48:52,193
As a matter of fact, I was just with him.

1258
01:48:52,277 --> 01:48:54,695
You never saw him today, did you?

1259
01:48:56,573 --> 01:48:57,657
No.

1260
01:48:58,325 --> 01:49:00,159
Do you have something to tell me?

1261
01:49:00,244 --> 01:49:02,036
I went to see Emmett.

1262
01:49:02,121 --> 01:49:05,373
That windbag! Why?

1263
01:49:05,457 --> 01:49:06,874
I know about you and Emmett.

1264
01:49:06,959 --> 01:49:08,918
- Me and Emmett?
- I know that he was your...

1265
01:49:09,002 --> 01:49:11,671
- My?
...handler, if that's what they're called.

1266
01:49:11,755 --> 01:49:15,383
- My handler?
- Yeah, that he was your handler in the CIA.

1267
01:49:26,311 --> 01:49:28,437
Oh, my God.

1268
01:49:30,482 --> 01:49:32,567
You're serious, aren't you?

1269
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:44,662
When McAra found this,
he went to Boston to show it to Emmett,

1270
01:49:44,746 --> 01:49:48,291
and he died on the way home,
and I think he was murdered.

1271
01:49:48,876 --> 01:49:51,669
I think you've had a few too many
of those already.

1272
01:49:51,753 --> 01:49:55,965
It was McAra who believed that Emmett told
you to go into politics in the first place.

1273
01:49:56,049 --> 01:49:58,176
- Emmett? I barely knew the man.
- And that story of yours

1274
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:02,054
about why you joined the party and Ruth
and the canvassing, well, the dates don't fit.

1275
01:50:02,139 --> 01:50:03,973
I got the dates wrong. Big deal!

1276
01:50:04,057 --> 01:50:05,516
Then when he found this photograph,

1277
01:50:05,601 --> 01:50:07,685
and he heard the rumors
about Emmett being in the CIA...

1278
01:50:07,769 --> 01:50:09,562
- Rumors?
- It's on the Internet.

1279
01:50:09,646 --> 01:50:12,940
I've never heard such utter balls
in my entire life.

1280
01:50:14,526 --> 01:50:19,530
Mike would never have believed such crap.
He was too clever. Too loyal.

1281
01:50:20,199 --> 01:50:22,325
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.

1282
01:50:26,622 --> 01:50:28,831
- How do you know that?
- He told me.

1283
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:30,958
Rycart?

1284
01:50:32,961 --> 01:50:34,295
He's lying.

1285
01:50:39,051 --> 01:50:42,470
This phone number on the back
of the photograph, it's Rycart's.

1286
01:50:43,138 --> 01:50:46,307
The handwriting, that's McAra's.

1287
01:50:47,017 --> 01:50:48,142
Mike.

1288
01:50:50,103 --> 01:50:52,730
- Mike, Mike.
- And you knew he was disillusioned.

1289
01:50:52,814 --> 01:50:54,398
You had a big row with him
just before he died.

1290
01:50:54,483 --> 01:50:58,527
Yes, I know, but he never mentioned this.
This is just... This is grotesque.

1291
01:50:59,655 --> 01:51:01,739
I've never taken orders from anyone.

1292
01:51:01,823 --> 01:51:04,909
Whatever I did,
I did because I believed it was right.

1293
01:51:04,993 --> 01:51:07,578
What, even supporting illegal kidnapping
for torture?

1294
01:51:07,663 --> 01:51:11,582
Oh, for God's sake,
spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit!

1295
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:13,668
Do you know what I'd do
if I was in power again?

1296
01:51:13,752 --> 01:51:15,836
I'd have two queues at airports.

1297
01:51:15,921 --> 01:51:18,881
One for flights
where we'd done no background checks,

1298
01:51:18,966 --> 01:51:23,803
infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties,
used no intelligence gained by torture.

1299
01:51:23,887 --> 01:51:27,390
And on the other flight,
we'd do everything we possibly could

1300
01:51:27,474 --> 01:51:29,141
to make it perfectly safe.

1301
01:51:29,226 --> 01:51:32,019
And then we'd see which plane
the Rycarts of this world

1302
01:51:32,104 --> 01:51:33,854
would put their bloody kids on!

1303
01:51:33,939 --> 01:51:35,731
And you can put that in the book!

1304
01:52:02,384 --> 01:52:03,592
Go home!

1305
01:52:04,094 --> 01:52:05,636
Go home!

1306
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:08,723
Here comes the killer!

1307
01:52:08,807 --> 01:52:11,600
Prosecute for torture!

1308
01:52:11,685 --> 01:52:13,144
Over here, Mr. Lang!

1309
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:16,480
Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang, will you live in America?

1310
01:52:19,067 --> 01:52:21,527
Mr. Lang, will you take
American citizenship?

1311
01:52:26,241 --> 01:52:29,160
When we get back to the house,
we need to have a meeting.

1312
01:52:32,164 --> 01:52:34,040
Oh, my God!
- Murderer!

1313
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:35,583
Firing from the roof!

1314
01:52:40,756 --> 01:52:44,800
Let me go to him! No! No!

1315
01:52:48,055 --> 01:52:49,680
Move, move, move!

1316
01:53:29,888 --> 01:53:31,722
How long had you known Mr. Lang?

1317
01:53:31,807 --> 01:53:34,308
- Couple of days.
- In what capacity?

1318
01:53:34,393 --> 01:53:36,060
I was his ghost.

1319
01:53:36,144 --> 01:53:37,770
His ghostwriter.

1320
01:53:39,606 --> 01:53:41,357
Do you recognize this man?

1321
01:53:43,026 --> 01:53:46,987
He was one of the protestors.
His son was killed in Iraq.

1322
01:53:47,072 --> 01:53:48,989
Did you ever speak with him?

1323
01:53:49,074 --> 01:53:51,575
He was in the bar one night
in the hotel where I was staying.

1324
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:53,411
But did you speak with him?

1325
01:53:53,495 --> 01:53:55,621
He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang
was staying on the island.

1326
01:53:55,705 --> 01:53:59,125
- I told him that I didn't.
- Did you report this conversation?

1327
01:53:59,209 --> 01:54:00,251
Sorry?

1328
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:02,837
Did you report this conversation
to Mr. Lang's protection team?

1329
01:54:02,921 --> 01:54:03,963
No.

1330
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:06,507
What was Mr. Lang's demeanor
this evening?

1331
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:09,844
He was... He was fine. He seemed fine.

1332
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:13,848
One witness said she thought
she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you.

1333
01:54:14,516 --> 01:54:15,599
No.

1334
01:54:43,378 --> 01:54:45,796
- We're gonna need your passport.
- Why?

1335
01:54:45,881 --> 01:54:49,800
A serious crime was just committed
in US territory, and you're the key witness.

1336
01:54:56,057 --> 01:54:57,808
We need to keep you close.

1337
01:55:02,772 --> 01:55:06,442
Like a fallen soldier,
Adam Lang went home today,

1338
01:55:06,526 --> 01:55:09,195
home to a shocked and grieving nation.

1339
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:14,909
Not just his family, but friends
and political opponents joined in tribute.

1340
01:55:14,993 --> 01:55:18,245
A great colleague and a true patriot.

1341
01:55:18,997 --> 01:55:23,042
We had our disagreements,
but we always stayed friends.

1342
01:55:23,668 --> 01:55:25,503
My heart goes out to Ruth and the family.

1343
01:55:27,172 --> 01:55:29,840
And I would like to say Adam will be...

1344
01:55:38,517 --> 01:55:39,600
Who is it?

1345
01:55:39,684 --> 01:55:41,268
Congratulations!

1346
01:55:43,313 --> 01:55:44,438
On what now?

1347
01:55:44,523 --> 01:55:46,774
Still having me as your agent. Hmm?

1348
01:55:48,944 --> 01:55:50,778
They don't need you anymore.

1349
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:54,532
You're free to go.

1350
01:55:59,746 --> 01:56:02,831
- You ready to get back to work?
- I don't think I can, Rick.

1351
01:56:02,916 --> 01:56:05,584
- I'm sorry. Not after all this.
- Don't be a jerk.

1352
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:10,422
This is a hot book now.
It's Adam Lang's voice from the grave.

1353
01:56:10,507 --> 01:56:13,175
- The guy, he's a hero.
- I just want to go home.

1354
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,552
You can.

1355
01:56:14,636 --> 01:56:18,305
Go. Go home.
And finish the book from London.

1356
01:56:21,893 --> 01:56:23,394
I don't know, Rick.

1357
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:49,086
Here we are.

1358
01:56:49,504 --> 01:56:51,130
Oh, here we are.

1359
01:57:02,851 --> 01:57:04,184
I'm sorry.

1360
01:57:05,145 --> 01:57:08,397
I think I'm over it,
and then suddenly I realize I'm not.

1361
01:57:09,983 --> 01:57:13,777
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Of course. My invitation said plus one.

1362
01:57:13,862 --> 01:57:16,947
Only I wondered if you might've wanted
to bring your husband.

1363
01:57:17,032 --> 01:57:18,532
That didn't work out.

1364
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:22,870
I hadn't appreciated quite how bored
he was with being my plus one.

1365
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:29,251
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah.

1366
01:57:35,967 --> 01:57:38,385
- Amelia Bly, plus one.
- Thank you.

1367
01:57:43,475 --> 01:57:45,726
That was a bit of a turn-up, for the books,
you calling me.

1368
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:47,811
I heard you weren't invited,
and I thought you should be here.

1369
01:57:47,896 --> 01:57:50,105
Ghosts are never invited
to the launch party, as a rule.

1370
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:53,233
We're an embarrassment.
Like a mistress at a wedding.

1371
01:57:54,778 --> 01:57:55,944
Sorry.

1372
01:57:57,739 --> 01:57:59,448
I brought you a present.

1373
01:58:01,618 --> 01:58:02,910
Thank you.

1374
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,379
That's very funny.

1375
01:58:13,463 --> 01:58:15,214
I thought, seeing as
you were so keen to hold onto it,

1376
01:58:15,298 --> 01:58:16,590
you might like it as a souvenir.

1377
01:58:16,675 --> 01:58:19,551
Between you and me, it wasn't us,
it was the Americans.

1378
01:58:19,636 --> 01:58:23,055
They thought the book was
a potential threat to national security.

1379
01:58:23,139 --> 01:58:24,181
But there's nothing in it.

1380
01:58:24,265 --> 01:58:27,309
Something about the beginnings.
I think that's what I heard.

1381
01:58:27,394 --> 01:58:30,521
- The beginning?
- No, beginnings. The beginnings.

1382
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:33,315
Beginnings?

1383
01:58:43,952 --> 01:58:45,452
You all right?

1384
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:48,997
Do you know that man?
The one who's speaking to Ruth.

1385
01:58:49,207 --> 01:58:51,750
- Paul Emmett?
- What's he doing here?

1386
01:58:51,835 --> 01:58:54,545
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard
when she was a Fulbright scholar.

1387
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:56,213
Why shouldn't he be here?

1388
01:59:01,928 --> 01:59:04,138
Do you mind if I have that back a second?

1389
01:59:07,976 --> 01:59:09,268
I'm...

1390
01:59:13,648 --> 01:59:15,524
Madam?
No, thank you.

1391
01:59:37,922 --> 01:59:39,965
"Langs are Scottish folk, originally".

1392
01:59:50,185 --> 01:59:53,687
"Wife and child in tow, I decided to...

1393
01:59:54,147 --> 01:59:55,647
"I decided to settle".

1394
01:59:55,732 --> 01:59:58,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.

1395
02:00:00,195 --> 02:00:04,573
Thank you.
I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.

1396
02:00:08,703 --> 02:00:10,746
I miss Adam all the time.

1397
02:00:12,373 --> 02:00:14,124
But never more than tonight.

1398
02:00:14,584 --> 02:00:17,503
Not just 'cause we're meeting
to launch his wonderful new book

1399
02:00:17,587 --> 02:00:21,215
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us,

1400
02:00:22,008 --> 02:00:25,969
but because he was so brilliant
at making speeches

1401
02:00:26,888 --> 02:00:28,388
and I'm so terrible.

1402
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,058
"Langs are Scottish folk".

1403
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:33,644
"Wife and child, Langs are Scottish".

1404
02:00:34,187 --> 02:00:36,188
"Wife, Langs. Lang's wife".

1405
02:00:37,524 --> 02:00:38,857
"Lang's

1406
02:00:40,235 --> 02:00:42,569
"wife Ruth

1407
02:00:43,863 --> 02:00:45,989
"was recruited

1408
02:00:46,825 --> 02:00:52,640
"as a CIA agent

1409
02:00:54,082 --> 02:00:58,377
"by Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University".

1410
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,508
Well, you'll be relieved to hear
I'm not making a speech this evening.

1411
02:01:04,592 --> 02:01:06,677
I just want to thank
our wonderful publishers,

1412
02:01:06,761 --> 02:01:09,346
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox,

1413
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:12,599
and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.

1414
02:01:13,685 --> 02:01:19,481
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.

1415
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:22,234
Mike, our thoughts are with you.

1416
02:01:23,027 --> 02:01:27,823
In these very difficult few months,
I've drawn great comfort from this book,

1417
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:32,744
from knowing that, despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them,

1418
02:01:33,246 --> 02:01:37,082
Mike and Adam did at least live long
enough to complete it.

1419
02:01:37,917 --> 02:01:41,837
And I really believe that,
as people read these pages,

1420
02:01:41,921 --> 02:01:45,966
Adam's voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come,

1421
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:48,635
eloquent, strong and full of hope.

1422
02:01:49,387 --> 02:01:52,931
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.

1423
02:01:54,392 --> 02:01:58,395
If I've left out anyone's name,
I hope you'll forgive me.

1424
02:02:01,774 --> 02:02:03,901
But now I must make a toast.

1425
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:07,195
To the memory of a great man

1426
02:02:08,531 --> 02:02:10,991
and a great patriot,

1427
02:02:11,075 --> 02:02:13,827
a wonderful husband and a devoted father.

1428
02:02:13,912 --> 02:02:14,912
To Adam!

1429
02:02:14,996 --> 02:02:16,413
To Adam!

1430
02:02:50,531 --> 02:02:52,240
You were marvelous.

1431
02:02:54,243 --> 02:02:55,535
Would you...

1432
02:03:30,363 --> 02:03:31,697
This one looks nasty.

1433
02:03:31,781 --> 02:03:34,658
Yeah, it's just happened just now.
Yeah, if you could.

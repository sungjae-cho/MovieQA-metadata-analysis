00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:21,230
Hey, something´s up.

80
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,200
<i>We have unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>this morning</i>

81
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,670
<i>that a plane has crashed into one of</i>
<i>the towers of the World Trade Center.</i>

82
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:31,104
-<i>CNN Center right now...</i>
-Holy shit.

83
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,005
<i>...work on this story, calling our sources</i>

84
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,806
<i>and trying to figure out</i>
<i>exactly what happened, but, clearly,</i>

85
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:39,007
<i>something relatively devastating</i>
<i>happening this morning there.</i>

86
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:42,279
<i>We´re going to join</i>
<i>another one of our New York affiliates</i>

87
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,546
<i>for their live coverage.</i>

88
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:48,853
<i>Here at the top of this tower, there´s</i>
<i>a huge, gaping hole, flames still inside.</i>

89
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,221
Can you believe this?

90
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:53,421
What schmuck would fly a plane
into the Trade Center?

91
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,729
Maybe they ran out of gas or something.

92
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,735
Yeah, Colovito. Right.

93
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:02,931
Maybe some jerk-off forgot
which lever to pull on his twin-engine.

94
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,974
That´s not a small plane.

95
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,703
Hell, no.

96
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:09,939

Let me have your attention here!

98
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,585
They´re telling us it´s a commuter plane.

99
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,220
Tower One is being evacuated
as a precaution.

100
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,055
They´ve asked us to send
a team down to assist.

00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,148

102
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,818

119
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:09,339
Come on, everybody. Off the bus.
Get off the bus. Step this way.

120
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:12,839

Hey, guys, you won´t believe this!

129
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,064
My wife says the other one got hit,
the other tower.

130
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,938
How the hell did the other tower get hit?

131
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:49,205
She was listening to HOT <i>9</i>7
and they said it.

132
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:52,612
What? Who gets their news

133
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,744
-l told you it was no damn private plane.
-No, I got it.

134
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,189
What special equipment
we got down there?

135
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:04,620
-What?
-We´re prepared for everything.

136
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:09,495
Car bombs, chemical, biological,

137
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:14,628
But not this. Not for something this sie.

138
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:17,363
There´s no plan. We didn´t make it.

139

<i>Only emergency transmissions</i>

Tower Two did take a hit.

147

What did I tell you?

148
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:58,905
No, no, that´s the smoke blowing over
from Tower One.

149
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:02,042
All right, that´s enough.
Everybody sit down. Now!

150
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,820
Yo, Dom, let me see your phone
for a sec, yeah?

151

Hey, let me see your phone.
I got to call Allison.

-This is gonna be a bitch.
-Relax.

157

Well, l´m just saying
that it looks like it´s gonna...

158
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,441
You think they´re bringing you
down there to scratch your ass?

159

McLoughlin will tell you what to do.

160

Why the Sarge?

He was Emergency Services

He´s one of the guys who came up
with a plan after the attack in ´<i>9</i>3.

<i>to the World Trade Center now.</i>

170
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,311
We got to get that building evacuated!

171
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,747
<i>Which tower?</i>
<i>Which tower are we responding to?</i>

172
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:44,309
-l got to get a team to go up!
-l´ll check in with headquarters.

173
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,515
<i>Roll every available ambulance you got</i>
<i>to this position.</i>

174
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:53,222
<i>Fire out on the north side.</i>

175
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,195
<i>They´re now coming out</i>
<i>of the west side</i>

176
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,266
<i>of the World Trade Center.</i>

177
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:35,366
All right, everybody stay here. l´m gonna
find out what the hell´s going on.

178
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:36,439
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh, my God.

180
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,525
Nothing´s gonna help them.

181
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,126
No, we´ll get up there.

182
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,535
How are you gonna save people
that high up? lt´s impossible.

183
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,164
We got to try.

184
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,400
Sarge!

185
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,809
Officer? Officer?

186
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:22,547
The daycare center.
There´s kids there. Over there.

187
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,382
Hey, Sarge! There´s kids in the...

188
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,855
Yeah, at the daycare at Five.
I know, they got them out.

189
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:32,020
-Okay, listen up. Where´s Kassimatis?
-He´s looking for you, Sarge.

190
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,994
We got to evacuate the Tower.

191
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:38,129
Who knows how to use a Scott Pak?
And don´t give me any PBA bullshit.

192
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:41,170
Hey, Sarge, to tell you the truth,
I haven´t used one in like four years.

193
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:42,966
Look, what did I just say?

194
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,971
Who´s coming?

195
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,576
Step forward.

196
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,075
I got it, Sarge.

197
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:55,610
l´ll go.

198
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,957
l´m with you, Sarge.

199
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:07,823
All right.

200
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:09,924
All right, we got a team.

201
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,264
We´re headed into Building Five.
The rest of you wait for Kassimatis.

202
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,167
Follow me. Stay together.

203
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,049
-Jimeno.
-Sarge.

204
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:31,780
Take everyone´s memo books,
nightsticks, hats. They´re useless here.

205
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:34,986
Put them in the Suburban.
lt´s over on Church and Vesey.

206
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,822
And meet us back at the police desk
in the lobby of Five. You got it?

207
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,520
Which one´s Five?

208
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:41,329
There´s two towers.

209
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,966
North tower is One. South tower is Two.

210
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:47,832
Right behind it, there´s Five,
right in front of us,

211
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:49,235
which is where the police desk is.

212
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,307
Take the alley. Hurry up. Hey!

213
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,906
Let´s go.

214
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:05,080
They´re all dying!

215
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,419
They´re all dying!

216
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,867
Grab those bottles.

217
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:24,166
Get the helmets.

218
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,175
<i>People trapped at 87th and 89th floors.</i>

219
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:30,405
<i>10-4. They´re getting a TVpicture</i>
<i>with numerous injuries.</i>

220
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,277
<i>Numerous injuries out there.</i>

221
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:35,881
Okay, turn them on.
Double check. Test them.

222
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,521
Massi? Anything more here?
Helmets? Scott Paks?

223
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:43,821
No, Sarge. Try the E room
near the truck docks in the basement.

224
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,258
Jimmy Lynch is down there.

225
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,092
Thanks.

226
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,594
Okay, there´s more stuff down on B-1 ,
the truck docks.

227
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,204
We´ll drop down to the Concourse,
go around One to Two,

228
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,205
and there´s some stairs there.

229
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:00,805
Keep your eyes open. Follow me.
Don´t get separated, okay?

230
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:01,969
Well, Sarge, we got plenty here.

231
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,705
Hundred and ten floors. Fire with fuel.

232
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:06,408
We´re gonna be using up bottles.
We need them.

233
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:09,617
Sarge, you won´t believe this.

234
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,420
Your Suburban on Church? lt´s gone.
Roof smashed in.

235
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,625
Stay together and stay focused.

236
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:23,357
-Yo, Dom, where we going?
-Sarge wants more stuff.

237
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,626
-What?
-Don´t worry about it.

238
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,429
He knows what he´s doing.

239
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:28,228
What the...

240
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,737
Don´t think. Keep moving.

241
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,432
Jesus, Sarge, we got to get up there.

242
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,339
You aren´t rescuing anybody
if you can´t breathe, Rodrigues.

243
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,877
Stay focused.

244
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:45,754
This way.

245
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,686
Where´s the fire?

246
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,333
Now you´re talking.
Got the BT dogs up in here.

247
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:41,274
What´s up, Sarge?
Sarge, l´m telling you we got to get up.

248
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,868
There´s a ton of people stuck up there.

249
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:45,470
-We´re going up.
-Yeah? I gotta go with you.

250
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,516
-Sure, Chris. We can use you.
-Yeah?

251
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,949
We need more equipment.
Get a tank on.

252
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,213
A-Rod!

253
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:52,849
Yo, what´s up, Chris?

254
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:56,050
Yo, what happened to your eye, man?
What happened to your eye?

255
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,148
I was carrying this woman out,

256
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,750
something whacked me
in the freaking head.

257
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,955
-She okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got her clear.

258
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:04,500
Hey, hey, Sarge, we ain´t gonna find
any equipment left in One.

259
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,801
-Coming through. Coming through.
-Excuse us. Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:11,339
Lynch has got gear down
at the B-1 truck docks next to Two.

261
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,602
There´s a staircase right over there
at Ben & Jerry´s.

262
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,678
I heard they were
evacuating Two, Sarge.

263
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,770
Must have caught fire from One.

264
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,872
I heard Two got hit,
that there was a second plane.

265
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:23,384
No, Fields just said one plane,
Tower One. Now, stay together.

266
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,388
You see the TV?
There´s a big fire up there.

267
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,015
There ain´t no TVs down here.

268
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,493
You guys hear about the Pentagon?
lt got hit. A missile or something.

269
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,564
lsrael? lt´s gone. lt´s nuked.

270
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:38,361
Whole freaking world´s
coming to an end today, Willy.

271
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:39,594
-Yo, Chris.
-Yeah.

272
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:42,103
-Nice timing on that transfer.
-Yeah, no kidding, right?

273
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,570
-Jimeno?
-Yeah.

274
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,599
You stay with the cart.

275
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:48,243
The rest of you, come with me.

276
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,381
Stay safe.

277
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,786
<i>We´re receiving... On the 106th floor...</i>

278

285
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:34,552
-You all right?
-Yeah. You helping evacuate?

Up One. l´m waiting for my sarge.

288

Yeah. Well, it´s gonna be a long day.

289
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:55,840
You´ll be all right, kid.
A lot of good people here.

290
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:01,080

I was down on B-1 .
The shafts there are buckling.

303
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:36,648
There´s gonna be people trapped
in those elevators.

304
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:37,879
Jee.

305
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:40,683
lt just took us an hour to get up to 30
in Tower One.

306
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,655
Now they want us over in Two.

I can´t move my legs.

340
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:24,239
I think l´m okay.

341
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,778
How you doing, Sarge?

342
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:31,443
I don´t think l´m hurt, but I can´t move.

343
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,587
I got some movement here.

344
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,596
8-13!

345
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,336
PAPD!

346
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,902
Officers Jimeno, Peulo

347
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:57,609
and McLoughlin are down.

348
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,279
We´re trapped on the Concourse level

349
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:04,745
between Towers One and Two.

350
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,419
We´re trapped near
freight elevator Five.

351
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,859
-Oh, thank God.
-lt goes down to the B-1 truck dock.

352
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,952
Yeah, here you go. Get some air.

353
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:16,531
Get some air. Some fresh air.

354
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,270
You´re okay, Willy. You´re okay.

355
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,565
Got any radio?

356
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,339
Here you go.

357
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:28,334
No, mine´s smashed. lt´s not working.

358
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:33,208
All my stuff on the left side is buried.
The mike´s gone.

359
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,419
You got to get this...
You got to get this off of me.

360
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:44,087
lt´s good to see you, Dom.

361
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,320
Good to see you, Willy.

362
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:50,862
-You okay? You good?
-Yeah, l´m good.

363
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,365
l´m going to get you out.
Don´t worry about it.

364
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,562
l´m gonna get you out, Willy.

365
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,138
lt´s working, Sarge!

366
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,270
Dom´s got us covered!

367
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,935
Good. That´s good.

368
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,349
How´d you know to run in here, Sarge?

369
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:11,883
The elevator shaft´s
the strongest part of the building.

370
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,722
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,322
How did this happen, Willy?

372
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:24,199
l´m gonna take care of you.

373
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,467
l´m gonna get you out, buddy.

374
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:37,275
Looks like there´s light! Maybe some air!

375
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:40,841
l´d say about 20 feet up!

376
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:42,684
Hey!

377
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:45,620
8-13!

378
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:47,680
Officers down!

379
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:50,859
Hey!

380
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,866
-You ready?
-Come on.

381
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:10,075
Come on, Dom!

382
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:11,743
Oh, Jesus.

383
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,782
I can´t get this off him by myself, Sarge.

384
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:24,089
Maybe I should go up and get some help
and then come back for you guys.

385
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:27,788
No! No! You´re gonna get him out!

386
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:30,962
You´re gonna get him out!

387
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,037
All right.

388
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:43,810
Here we go, Willy.

389
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:45,738
Come on!

390
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,857
I can´t get you out, Willy.

391
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,790
Come on, Dom.

392
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:06,891
Don´t leave us here.

393
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:11,269
Do me a favor.

394
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:16,077
You can do it. I know you can do it.

395
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:26,347
All right.

396
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:29,322
l´m going to get you out, Willy. All right?

397
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,423
l´ll get you out. Yeah, l´ll get you out.
All right.

398
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:32,784
Dom?

399
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:36,321
Dom?

400
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:42,728
l´m hurt.

401
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:50,838
Dom, it´s me, Willy.

402
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,638
Look at me.

403
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,642
Stay awake.

404
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,579
Can I get a 3-8, Sarge?

405
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:07,356
Yeah, Dom. You take a break.

406
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,724
l´m dying, Willy.

407
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:17,958
No. No, you´re not. Dom, stop this.

408
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:23,767
Don´t forget
I really tried to save you guys.

409
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:36,878
I love you, Willy.

410
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:40,952
I love you, too, Dom.

411
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,144
Dom´s gone.

412
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:11,710
Dom´s gone!

413
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:14,352
I know.

414
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,331
Jimeno,

415
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,305
can you still see the light?

416
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:29,737
can you still see the light?

417
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:31,698
Yeah.

418
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:34,335
Yeah!

419
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:37,475
How far up?

420
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:43,478
I don´t know. Maybe 20 feet up.
There´s still stuff in the way.

421
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:46,414
What else do you see?

422
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:50,025
Beams. Plaster. Nothing.

423
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,128
<i>lt is with deep sadness and regret</i>

424
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:34,202
<i>that I have to advise you</i>
<i>that two hijacked planes</i>

425
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:36,837
<i>have crashed into the Twin Towers</i>

426

<i>...from what remains</i>

<i>One airplane crashed into</i>
<i>World Trade Center Two.</i>

428
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:45,512
<i>About 1 5 minutes later, an airplane</i>
<i>crashed into the second one.</i>

429
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:48,344
<i>About an hour later,</i>
<i>both of them collapsed.</i>

430
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:22,984
<i>Associated Press is reporting</i>
<i>that a plane or helicopter</i>

431
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:27,078
<i>crashed at the Pentagon,</i>
<i>and the Pentagon is being evacuated.</i>

432
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:32,149
<i>Whether that fire is in the building itself</i>
<i>or outside, we have not yet confirmed.</i>

433
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:34,723
<i>This is a live picture of the Pentagon</i>

434
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,233

<i>he could see the tail of a large airliner</i>

435

<i>as it plowed into the Pentagon.</i>

436
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:43,268
<i>And that fire there in Washington</i>

437
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:44,498
Bastards!

438
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:51,944
<i>...just a few minutes after that,</i>
<i>it wasn´t very long,</i>

439
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:57,111

<i>The second tower came tumbling down.</i>

440
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,553
<i>That was the first tower collapse</i>
<i>that we just saw.</i>

441
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,222
<i>This is the collapse</i>

442
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:08,786
<i>And so now, as we stand here,</i>

443
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:11,731
<i>The tops of both towers are gone.</i>

444
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:12,858
Allison, let´s sit outside.

445
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:17,405
<i>Behind somewhere that plume of smoke</i>
<i>that continues to rise over the...</i>

446
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:19,606
He´s probably still at the bus terminal.

447
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:23,906
<i>What is left of those buildings,</i>
<i>we cannot tell you.</i>

448
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:26,103
<i>We cannot tell you.</i>

449
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:28,376
-<i>Allison.</i>
-Jerry.

450
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,615
Al, l´m looking at the Tunnel.

451
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,048
There´s no one there.

452
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:38,183
<i>No Port Authorities there.</i>

453
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,794
Al, I don´t...

454
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:45,129
I guess they got called in.

455
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,261
<i>Can you get someone to drive you?</i>

456
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,898
-<i>Allison?</i>
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:59,046
<i>Okay, l´ll see you at home</i>
<i>in half an hour.</i>

458
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,676
l´ll call Mom and Dad.

459
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:06,254
Okay.

460
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,718
We got to pick up Bianca.

461
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:13,960
<i>Both towers came down,</i>
<i>trapping thousands</i>

462
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:16,088
<i>and thousands of people inside.</i>

463
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:17,995
<i>We do not know the numbers yet,</i>

464
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,503
<i>but we do know thousands of people</i>
<i>work inside those buildings.</i>

465
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:24,731
<i>That... The buildings are gone.</i>

466
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,775
<i>There are reports</i>
<i>that hundreds and hundreds</i>

467
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:30,902
<i>of fire and police and rescue crews</i>

468
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,740
<i>are missing or unaccounted for.</i>

469
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:38,115
<i>Officials seem simply stunned</i>
<i>by the scale of the losses...</i>

470
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,280
They keep showing the same thing
over and over and over.

471
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,618
Jay´s there.

472
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:45,694
They must have called in
every company in the city.

473
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:47,591
He would have been there early.

474
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:49,664
Yeah, John, too, probably.

475
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:52,425
He knows those buildings so well.

476
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:55,864
<i>They´ve seen something</i>
<i>no one has ever seen before.</i>

477
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,495
<i>One man who came by said</i>

478
00:38:57,606 --> 00:38:59,437
<i>he had seen this building come down.</i>

479
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,009
<i>lt looked as though it was imploding.</i>

480
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:07,276
<i>This was complete chaos and utter hell</i>
<i>that has come to Lower Manhattan.</i>

481
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:10,782
Oh, my God.

482
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:14,886
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.

483
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:19,252
They evacuated those buildings.
All right?

484
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:22,825
l´m sure most everybody got out.
They´re fine.

485
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,763
ln the ´<i>9</i>3 attack,
John said everybody got out real quick.

486
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,531
God. ln ´<i>9</i>3,
the buildings didn´t fall down.

487
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,500
All right, well,
l´m going to call everybody and cancel.

488
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,569
A Den Mothers meeting right now
sounds pretty dumb, right?

489
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,589
I keep looking for John.

490
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,286
There´s so many policemen
running around.

491
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:52,087
Maybe l´ll see him.

492
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,166
-Judy.
-Yeah?

493
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:24,426
Judy...

494
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,228
-They´re here to tell us they´re dead.
-No.

495
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,924
No, they´re not. They´re not.

496
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:47,272
-Hey, Judy. Jay...
-No. No.

497
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:49,907
Look, we know he´s alive. All right?

498
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:53,778
They know where he is.
They´re communicating with him.

499
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:55,517
He´s alive?

500
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:58,422
Yes. Yeah, we´re gonna go
down there now and help out.

501
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:00,154
-Oh, thank God.
-Yes!

502
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:03,855
There you go.

503
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,729
-Thank God. Oh, my God.
-There you go.

504
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,358
Oh, that´s good.

505
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,668
-That´s good.
-Thank you, God.

506
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,677
PAPD.

507
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:18,743
8-13.

508
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:23,416
Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.

509
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:29,779
We´re trapped near
the FE Five vestibule.

510
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:34,925
Will you please work?

511
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,028
l´m so thirsty.

512
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,638
You´re not kidding.

513
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:46,265
My mouth feels like a beach.

514
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:53,639
-How´s your pain?
-Comes in waves.

515
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,148
Every 20, 30 minutes.

516
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:02,186
Every wave, I feel the pain less.

517
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:05,526
But l´m more numb.

518
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:10,660
The number I get
the more I want to sleep.

519
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,427
What´s wrong with sleep?

520
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:17,038
I wish I could
so this pain would go away.

521
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,106
You´re bleeding inside, Will.

522
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:24,441
You sleep, you don´t know
if you´re coming back.

523
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,247
Awake, at least you got a shot.

524
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,519
Your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.

525
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:35,924
That´s what I think, anyway.

526
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,758
You know that movie, <i>G.l. Jane?</i>

527
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:44,592
What´s-her-name?

528
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:48,896
-Yeah, Demi Moore.
-Yeah.

529
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:53,501
You know the part where
the drill sergeant says,

530
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:58,505
´´Pain is good. Pain is your friend.
lf you´re feeling pain you´re still alive´´?

531
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:02,383
I didn´t see the movie.

532
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,820
I keep thinking of that line.

533
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,156
Pain is your friend.

534
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:11,250
lt means you´re alive.

535
00:43:13,128 --> 00:43:14,755
We´ll make it, Will.

536
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,528
Just don´t go to sleep.

537
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,641
Sarge, I got a fire here!

538
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:29,935
Sarge!

539
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,379
There´s nothing I can do here!

540
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:36,910
Sarge!

541
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:48,125
l´m burning! l´m burning!

542
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,677
Please God.

543
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:05,611
Where´d that wind come from
all of a sudden, Sarge?

544
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:09,080
I don´t know.

545
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:12,249
The fire just goes out like that, Sarge?

546
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,487
Why´s that?

547
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,887
I don´t know.

548
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,253
You´re not a big talker, are you?

549
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,557
No.

550
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,826
Well, see, you got to talk to me ´cause...

551
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:36,232
I can´t,
´cause my knees are crushed together!

552
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:38,446
That´s why I can´t fucking talk!

553
00:44:38,547 --> 00:44:40,344
Oh, God!

554
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,550
Oh, God. Oh, God.

555
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:50,919
Holy shit!

556
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:58,957
Dom´s gun is cooking off!

557
00:45:00,268 --> 00:45:01,326
Will!

558
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:11,911
Will! Will, that´s it!
All the rounds got to be done, Will.

559
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:14,938
I can´t believe this is happening!

560
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,077
-Not in my whole goddamn life!
-Breathe, Will.

561
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:18,516
Come on, breathe.

562
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:21,822
Get your mind right!

563
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:36,426
<i>Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.</i>

564
00:45:36,805 --> 00:45:40,241
<i>...Pennsylvania. This is where</i>
<i>the United Airlines flight,</i>

565
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:42,640
<i>l believe it is 1 76...</i>

566
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:46,771
<i>l´m sorry, l´m correcting...</i>
<i>United Airlines 93...</i>

567
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:49,749
<i>l´m sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can´t make</i>
<i>that kind of assessment yet.</i>

568
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:51,113
-We just...
-ls that Allison Jimeno?

569
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,551
We grew up together.
Let me talk to her.

570
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,154
Al, it´s Brian. I just got in.

571
00:45:56,258 --> 00:45:58,158
-Hi, Brian.
-<i>Allison,</i>

572
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,927
listen, they sent Will down on a bus
with a bunch of the guys.

573
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:05,890
-So he did go down there?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

574
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:11,604
And did he go in the buildings?

575
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:14,405
We don´t know.

576
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:19,005
Brian, did he go in the buildings
or did he not go in the buildings?

577
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:20,843
<i>We´re trying to find that out.</i>

578
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:25,352
lt´s very basic.
Did he go in or did he not go in?

579
00:46:25,554 --> 00:46:27,988
<i>Allison, l´ll call you</i>
<i>as soon as we know.</i>

580
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,385
Bianca? Sweetie, l´m sorry.

581
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:34,826
Brian, l... Brian, why don´t you
tell me what´s going on?

582
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,988
-l´ll take Bianca to my place.
-No.

583
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,428
-l´ll keep her here. I wanna...
-My parents are there.

584
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:40,990
They´ll take care of her. Okay?
She´ll be five houses away.

585
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,070
Want to go play?

586
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:45,206
<i>...shards of metal coming past...</i>

587
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:46,365
Brian?

588
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:49,909
<i>President Bush was in Florida</i>
<i>when the attacks began.</i>

589
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:53,742
<i>He spoke a short time ago</i>
<i>from an Air Force base in Louisiana.</i>

590
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:55,339
<i>Here´s some of what the President said.</i>

591
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,547
<i>The resolve of our great nation</i>
<i>is being tested.</i>

592
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:05,925
<i>But make no mistake, we will show</i>
<i>the world that we will pass this test.</i>

593
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:07,421
<i>God bless.</i>

594
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:10,020
<i>We´re told the President´s plane</i>
<i>has flown on,</i>

595
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:11,598
<i>but for security reasons,</i>

596
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,568
<i>the government will not say where</i>
<i>Mr. Bush is going or for how long.</i>

597
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,162
I don´t know if you guys know it yet,
but this country´s at war.

598
00:47:47,936 --> 00:47:50,234
Pastor, I gotta go down there.

599
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,436
-Where?
-New York.

600
00:47:55,577 --> 00:48:00,446
You can´t. Only emergency responders
are being allowed in.

601
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,921
l´ve spent my best years
with the Marines.

602
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:13,088
God gave me a gift
to be able to help people,

603
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,889
to defend our country.

604
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:20,231
And I feel him calling on me now
for this mission.

605
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:24,437
Then find a way to listen, Dave.

606
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,649
<i>l´ll leave that to you</i>
<i>to determine just how widespread</i>

607
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:41,025
<i>the human loss will be</i>
<i>in New York City alone.</i>

608
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:46,893
<i>America has changed today.</i>
<i>This is a dark day in this country.</i>

609
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,527
<i>lt´s in bold print in future history books</i>

610
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:54,232
<i>about how America was attacked</i>
<i>within its continental borders</i>

611
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,774
<i>to devastating effect by terrorists</i>

612
00:48:56,876 --> 00:49:01,245
<i>in a coordinated assault</i>
<i>using hijacked civilian airliners.</i>

613
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:04,409
-Hey, Mom?
-Yes, sweetie.

614
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:07,247
Dad knows it´s
my birthday party Saturday, right?

615
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:10,420
Your birthday, are you cray?
Of course he does.

616
00:49:10,523 --> 00:49:11,615
He´s just...

617
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:15,216
He´s still working to help people
at the disaster at the Trade Center.

618
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:18,695
But they keep saying a lot
of those people aren´t coming back.

619
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,201
l´m not supposed to tell you this, okay?

620
00:49:24,704 --> 00:49:27,571
But he told me that he was gonna
take you to the playoffs next month.

621
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:30,575
-The playoffs? Are you serious?
-l´m serious.

622
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,271
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? I knew it.
I knew he was going to.

623
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:35,347
Mom, you better come here.

624
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:49,621
Stay here, okay?

625
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:52,126
What´s wrong?

626
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:54,297
Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.

627
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,166
lf anything happens to one of them,
they go and tell the other family.

628
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,604
Are you here to tell me something?

629
00:50:07,514 --> 00:50:10,506
Don´t come in here, Pat. I mean it.
Don´t you come into this house.

630
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,016
Donna, he´s not.

631
00:50:12,252 --> 00:50:13,913
We don´t know. We don´t know.

632
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,454
They´ve declared him as missing,
that´s all. He´s just missing.

633
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,990
I know. I know. l´m with you. Come here.

634
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,053
I know.

635
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:27,460
We got confirmation. John went in.

636
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,643
Oh, Dad.

637
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,884
lt´s okay, baby.

638
00:50:50,557 --> 00:50:52,787
lt´s okay. lt´s gonna be okay.

639
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:56,362
Hey. Hey.

640
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:01,797
Will´s a tough nut. He´s gonna make it.

641
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:03,996
-l know it, honey.
-Dad.

642
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,627
-l just know it. Come on.
-Dad.

643
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:07,228
-Dad.
-Your mom´s out there.

644
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,001
-l´ll clean you up.
-Dad.

645
00:51:10,043 --> 00:51:11,237
What?

646
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,076
How...

647
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,912
How would I tell Bianca
her father´s dead?

648
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,325
Missing means missing, Ma.
lt doesn´t mean dead.

649
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:30,919
She´s very strong.
She´s gonna be all right.

650
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:32,730
-Jer.
-Yeah.

651
00:51:34,434 --> 00:51:37,130
We´ve got to call a doctor.
Give her something fast.

652
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,198
-Why?
-She could lose it.

653
00:51:40,406 --> 00:51:42,306
What is happening to this world?

654
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:46,204
<i>...of this horrible and vicious</i>
<i>act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.</i>

655
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:51,306
<i>And our focus now has to be</i>
<i>on saving as many lives as possible.</i>

656
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:53,908
<i>Do we know the number of casualties</i>
<i>at this point?</i>

657
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,319
<i>l don´t think we really want</i>
<i>to speculate about that.</i>

658
00:51:57,857 --> 00:52:03,557
<i>The number of casualties will be more</i>
<i>than any of us can bear, ultimately.</i>

659
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:07,595
Sounded like a truck bomb.

660
00:52:08,468 --> 00:52:10,197
Like in ´<i>9</i>3.

661
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:14,898
Blasted out the lobby.
Pushed everything in here.

662
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:17,975
Concourse must have collapsed.

663
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,249
You never answered, Sarge.

664
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,152
What have we got?

665
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,383
How long does this
internal bleeding take?

666
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:36,428
I don´t know. l´m not a doctor.

667
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:41,093
Twenty-four hours
is the most l´ve heard of. Maybe 1 4,

668
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,498
16.

669
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:45,368
Just don´t sleep.

670
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:53,073
So we´ve been in six, seven hours.
What does that mean?

671
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,408
Another seven, eight hours from now?

672
00:53:02,288 --> 00:53:07,555
You remember that earthquake?
Where was it? Turkey?

673
00:53:08,294 --> 00:53:10,194
There was a little girl there.

674
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:13,855
She lived four days
buried in the rubble like this.

675
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:17,402
She was, like,
three years old or something.

676
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:21,835
lf she could make it, we can make it.

677
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:27,646
Maybe we ain´t bleeding so bad inside.

678
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:39,756
-Sarge?
-Yeah, Will.

679
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:41,820
You got any kids?

680
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,360
Four. I got four.

681
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,960
-That´s a lot of kids.
-Yeah.

682
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,835
lt´s a lot of work for my wife.

683
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,069
What are their names?

684
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:00,611
Steven. He´s the oldest.

685
00:54:01,347 --> 00:54:02,814
He´s 15.

686
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:09,713
Caitlin´s 12. Peanut.

687
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:14,888
JJ, he´s 10.

688
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:20,232
We got a little girl.

689
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,798
Erin.

690
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,897
She´s four.

691
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:30,174
We had her late.

692
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:35,673
lt wasn´t planned. It just... It happened.

693
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,747
I don´t know.

694
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,829
-What´s that?
-What´s what?

695
00:54:56,803 --> 00:54:57,929
That sound.

696
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,368
I got a pipe here.

697
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,175
Keep doing that!

698
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,738
What about JJ´s tuition?

699
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:37,871
-lt´s not easy.
-Right.

700
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:40,974
Did you vomit yesterday?

701
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:44,480
Yeah. Yeah, yesterday and today.

702
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:46,745
-And today?
-Yeah.

703
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:50,585
You know what?
I probably just have the flu, hon.

704
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,021
Yeah? Okay.

705
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:56,521
So, wait...

706
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:59,462
Yeah, there´s supposed to be a stripe.

707
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,965
-A stripe? lt´s a stripe.
-Yeah.

708
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:03,695
Yeah, it´s a stripe.

709
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,203
That´s good.

710
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,832
lt´s good. lt´s good. lt´s good. lt´s good.

711
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:12,706
Yeah, it´s good. Yeah.

712
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:16,206
lt´s good.

713
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:19,682
<i>...seems just like a ghost town</i>
<i>in the financial district. Very eerie.</i>

714
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:22,253
<i>You saw people being wheeled</i>
<i>on gurneys</i>

715
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,582
<i>away from the site of the explosions.</i>

716
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,954
<i>People were coming out</i>
<i>with masks over their face,</i>

717
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,526
<i>anything they could put over their face</i>

718
00:56:28,628 --> 00:56:30,823
<i>because the air was</i>
<i>still very thick with debris.</i>

719
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,899
<i>The ash on the ground</i>
<i>is at least two inches thick.</i>

720
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,297
<i>lt´s more like snow cover.</i>

721
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:36,732
Mom, listen.

722
00:56:38,905 --> 00:56:40,463
<i>Officials are saying that as many</i>

723
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:44,475
<i>as 400 police, fire and rescue teams</i>
<i>entered the towers,</i>

724
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:48,411
<i>and there are fears that half of them</i>
<i>are missing and feared lost.</i>

725
00:56:48,514 --> 00:56:51,039
<i>We are waiting for more</i>
<i>on the survivors.</i>

726
00:56:51,484 --> 00:56:53,714
<i>There are no clear estimates</i>
<i>yet on numbers,</i>

727
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:57,186
<i>but it is clear that many</i>
<i>of New York´s finest</i>

728
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,155
<i>have been lost on this day.</i>

729
00:56:59,258 --> 00:57:02,159
<i>These are the so-called</i>
<i>first responders.</i>

730
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:03,626
Oh, my God.

731
00:57:05,264 --> 00:57:07,960
That´s so many.
What are we going to do?

732
00:57:08,935 --> 00:57:10,459
Mom, let´s go get him.

733
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:14,303
Can we just go to the city and find Dad?

734
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:17,069
-We don´t even know where he is.
-You´re gonna go drive and get him?

735
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:19,440
-Can´t you call someone?
-The phones don´t work.

736
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:21,206
Come on, JJ,
there´s really nothing we could do.

737
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:24,147
-You´re just worried about your birthday.
-No, Caitlin, stop it.

738
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,514
He needs us. I know if we just go
down there, we can find him.

739
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:27,984
Dad doesn´t need you to go find him.

740
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:29,111
Come on, Mom, please.

741
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:32,281
JJ, would you just stop it?
Stop it for a minute. Okay?

742
00:57:32,391 --> 00:57:33,983
They´ll call when they know something.

743
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:36,994
Lay off your ma, please. This is tough
enough on everybody. Come on.

744
00:57:38,898 --> 00:57:40,525
You don´t really care, do you?

745
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,799
l´ll go talk to him.

746
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:50,938
Hey, JJ, come on.
Come back here, kid. Let´s go.

747
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,271
He´s scared. He´s just a kid.

748
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:54,379
Yeah.

749
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:58,076
He´s right, you know?

750
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,583
I don´t even remember
the last thing I said to John.

751
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:11,192
Excuse me.

752
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,829
This is it.

753
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:26,571
l´m sorry. No, sir.
Nobody gets by here. Nobody gets by.

754
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:27,839
United States Marines.

755
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:31,110
-Sure thing. ls your unit down there?
-Yes, sir.

756
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,874
l´m gonna take a 3-8, Sarge.

757
00:59:05,885 --> 00:59:07,011
Okay.

758
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,156
Just don´t go to sleep.

759
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,256
´´Let me get that.´´

760
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:20,758
What?

761
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:24,159
That´s what he said to me.

762
00:59:24,904 --> 00:59:26,201
Antonio.

763
00:59:27,306 --> 00:59:29,035
´´Will, let me get that.´´

764
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,868
The cart.

765
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,778
lf he hadn´t switched places with me...

766
00:59:39,151 --> 00:59:40,618
And Dom.

767
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:44,522
I made him stay and help me.

768
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,653
I told him to stay.

769
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:50,691
Yeah, I begged him.

770
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,591
´´Don´t leave me, Dom.
Please don´t leave me.´´ And he stayed.

771
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:58,500
You know, there was time.
He could have gotten out.

772
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:03,399
And Chris. After being cut so bad,
he didn´t have to go in.

773
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,279
You tell them.

774
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:14,375
You tell them.

775
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,515
I took them in.

776
01:00:22,728 --> 01:00:23,990
For what?

777
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,695
What good did we do?

778
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:31,130
We wanted to go in.

779
01:00:31,437 --> 01:00:33,029
Kassimatis said you were the best.

780
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:35,437
You were the guy
who knew everything down here.

781
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:40,603
Dom, Antonio and Chris, nothing was
gonna stop them from trying to help.

782
01:00:41,147 --> 01:00:44,275
We figured
we might as well follow the best guy in.

783
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:46,777
The best?

784
01:00:46,952 --> 01:00:49,352
They did what they had to do, Sarge.

785
01:00:49,755 --> 01:00:53,020
They couldn´t have lived
with themselves if they hadn´t gone in.

786
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,792
That´s who they were.

787
01:00:56,795 --> 01:00:57,921
Okay.

788
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:01,690
Thank you, Will.

789
01:01:13,812 --> 01:01:14,938
Will?

790
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:20,608
lf this is it,
I am gonna see you someplace better.

791
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:24,453
Sarge, I don´t know you too good...

792
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:25,785
Our Father...

793
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,051
...but I love you!

794
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,626
...who art in heaven...

795
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,589
-Goodbye, John!
-...hallowed be thy name.

796
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:34,195
Give us this day our daily bread...

797
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:37,594
Thank you, God, Allison and Bianca,

798
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:39,934
who needs a daddy.

799
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:43,270
Oh, God! Forgive us

800
01:01:44,143 --> 01:01:47,203
our trespasses as we...

801
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:48,940
Let her know I love her!

802
01:01:49,215 --> 01:01:51,513
...forgive those
who trespass against us!

803
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:45,763
John?

804
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,103
You there?

805
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:56,710
Yeah, Will.

806
01:02:59,585 --> 01:03:00,847
l´m here.

807
01:03:03,022 --> 01:03:04,546
l´m still here.

808
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:12,364
<i>About 20 minutes ago,</i>
<i>we were reporting on another building</i>

809
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:14,398
<i>at the site of the World Trade Center</i>

810
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,128
<i>that they referred to as Building Seven.</i>

811
01:03:17,236 --> 01:03:20,535
<i>Officials were watching</i>
<i>very closely because</i>

812
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,608
<i>it was on fire</i>
<i>and in danger of collapsing.</i>

813
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:26,467
<i>Well, moments ago, it did collapse.</i>

814
01:03:26,879 --> 01:03:29,848
<i>So that would be the third building</i>
<i>in the World Trade Center complex</i>

815
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:31,882
<i>that has collapsed today.</i>

816
01:03:31,984 --> 01:03:34,612
<i>There are no reports yet</i>
<i>of additional casualties...</i>

817
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,857
<i>Rescue officials in the area</i>

818
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,824
<i>have suspended</i>
<i>the search for survivors.</i>

819
01:03:45,898 --> 01:03:49,834
<i>No word yet on when rescue teams</i>
<i>might get back to trying to find anyone...</i>

820
01:03:49,935 --> 01:03:51,994
That´s a lot of guys not with him.

821
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:56,869
Port Authority Police.
Sergeant King speaking.

822
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:34,370
I got cars cooking off.
I got rounds flying all over the place.

823
01:04:34,813 --> 01:04:39,375
l´ve got guns all over the place.
Now back off. lt´s getting dark out.

824
01:04:39,485 --> 01:04:41,953
Chief, you got to let us in.
My whole battalion´s in here, Chief.

825
01:04:42,054 --> 01:04:44,522
-There´s still guys in there.
-l know it, boys. Not tonight.

826
01:04:44,623 --> 01:04:48,059
Tomorrow´s another day.
lt´ll be dark in a half an hour, man!

827
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,927
God bless their souls,
but l´m not letting you join them!

828
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:16,085
Everybody report to the station there.

829
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,602
What´s the status here?

830
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:32,932
The search has been called off.

831
01:05:33,038 --> 01:05:36,769
They say the Marriott´s gonna go, too,
and until it´s more stable, we´re out.

832
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:41,441
This whole thing is crap, man.

833
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:44,243
Our guys are in there.
They´re dying in there.

834
01:05:47,186 --> 01:05:50,155
lt´s like God made a curtain
with the smoke,

835
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:54,120
shielding us
from what we´re not yet ready to see.

836
01:05:57,696 --> 01:05:59,425
All right, nut bag.

837
01:06:52,618 --> 01:06:54,586
Didn´t even finish them.

838
01:07:12,471 --> 01:07:15,099
<i>...a 45-degree angle.</i>

839
01:07:16,275 --> 01:07:17,674
See? Okay?

840
01:07:17,776 --> 01:07:21,644
You put the plywood here.
Put the saw here. Nice and easy.

841
01:07:21,813 --> 01:07:24,304
Don´t force anything. All right?

842
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,044
Want to try again? Okay.

843
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:34,552
Don´t force it. There you go.

844
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:53,867
Sarge? You never told me
your wife´s name.

845
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:57,746
lt´s Donna.

846
01:07:58,984 --> 01:08:01,680
Donna? That´s a good name.

847
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,816
lt´s real American, you know?

848
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,557
Mine´s Allison.

849
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:10,753
She´s ltalian and some German.

850
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:13,824
Don´t get her mad.

851
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,861
Yeah. She´s a wild one.

852
01:08:17,436 --> 01:08:21,896
Donna can get mad, too.
She wants a new kitchen.

853
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:26,837
l´m okay carpenter, so

854
01:08:27,946 --> 01:08:29,743
l´m building her one.

855
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:33,113
There´s no cabinets right now.

856
01:08:34,186 --> 01:08:35,653
She´s pissed.

857
01:08:37,589 --> 01:08:38,715
So

858
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:42,156
I got to get out of here.

859
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,789
Donna, she´s...

860
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:52,202
I married the right one, you know?

861
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:55,206
Yeah, I know.

862
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:57,369
Me, too.

863
01:08:58,276 --> 01:09:00,244
Tell me about your wife.

864
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,570
Well, she´s

865
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,950
five months pregnant now.

866
01:09:09,788 --> 01:09:11,255
lt´s gonna be a girl.

867
01:09:13,592 --> 01:09:16,026
I already got one. Bianca.

868
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:17,960
She´s four.

869
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:55,699
You got to name Bianca.

870
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:59,067
You love that name Bianca.

871
01:09:59,171 --> 01:10:01,867
No. I love the name, but you picked it.

872
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:04,201
So?

873
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,478
So I get to choose the name this time.

874
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,044
Alyssa.

875
01:10:10,982 --> 01:10:12,449
Alyssa?

876
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:16,977
Kids are gonna love that name.
´´Alyssa the pisser.´´

877
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:19,714
Look, I like Olivia.

878
01:10:20,358 --> 01:10:23,794
Olivia? Olivia sounds like Olive Oyl.

879
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:25,192
-Will.
-What?

880
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:27,295
Olivia.

881
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:30,562
Olivia Jimeno.

882
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,564
l´m naming the baby Alyssa.

883
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,268
lt´s what Will wanted.

884
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,111
What?

885
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:20,644
-l´m gonna pick up that prescription.
-What prescription?

886
01:11:21,153 --> 01:11:24,054
The doc called in
a prescription for you, honey.

887
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:25,623
You know, for the baby.

888
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:29,025
Said we got to have it on hand,
just in case.

889
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:31,021
ln case what?

890
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:34,490
ln case you need it, honey. You know?

891
01:11:37,469 --> 01:11:39,494
-l´ll go with Jerry.
-No, Allison...

892
01:11:39,604 --> 01:11:43,370
l´m not sitting here waiting for a call
that Will´s dead.

893
01:11:43,975 --> 01:11:45,533
-Allison...
-l´m coming, too.

894
01:11:58,256 --> 01:11:59,280
What am I doing here?

895
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:01,382
-Al, you all right?
-Yeah.

896
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,354
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

897
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:07,495
Will could be never coming home.

898
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,730
l´m walking around CVS
like there´s nothing wrong.

899
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:12,270
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

900
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,635
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

901
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:15,968
You have your cell phone?

902
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,841
I left it.

903
01:12:20,478 --> 01:12:21,809
Karen, you have your cell phone?

904
01:12:21,913 --> 01:12:23,005
Karen.

905
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:28,210
I forgot it.

906
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:31,519
We left the house with no phone?

907
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:58,639
Al, what are you doing?

908
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,719
Got to get home.
This stupid light is taking forever!

909
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,117
Come on!

910
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:07,725
-Allison!
-Al.

911
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:12,191
Allison! Would you get back
in the goddamn car?

912
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:13,894
We´re going home.

913
01:13:21,806 --> 01:13:23,239
Did he call?

914
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,049
Sarge?

915
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:43,654
I don´t think
l´m gonna make it to the morning.

916
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:48,357
-l feel like...
-Will.

917
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:50,962
-Like...
-Will.

918
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:55,164
You die, l´m gonna die.

919
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:57,873
Okay?

920
01:13:58,543 --> 01:13:59,737
You die,

921
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:03,244
l´m just gonna die.

922
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:07,744
Well, you can´t die, either.

923
01:14:09,087 --> 01:14:10,486
Sounds good.

924
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,450
But in case...

925
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,922
You think you could do me a favor?

926
01:14:17,762 --> 01:14:19,229
What´s that?

927
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:21,925
Could you put it out over the radio

928
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:25,091
that I request

929
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:29,607
my daughter to be named Olivia?

930
01:14:31,743 --> 01:14:33,040
And tell them

931
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:36,473
to tell Allison that I love her,

932
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,446
and that she should name
my daughter Olivia.

933
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,392
8-13.

934
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:56,529
This is McLoughlin

935
01:14:57,602 --> 01:14:58,694
PAPD.

936
01:14:59,671 --> 01:15:04,370
Officer Jimeno requests
his daughter be named

937
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,537
Olivia.

938
01:15:08,313 --> 01:15:09,871
Officer Jimeno

939
01:15:11,816 --> 01:15:15,377
would like his wife, Allison,

940
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:18,849
to know he loves her.

941
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:25,659
Further to that,

942
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,198
please tell

943
01:15:32,303 --> 01:15:33,770
my family

944
01:15:35,206 --> 01:15:37,504
I love them

945
01:15:41,946 --> 01:15:43,277
very much.

946
01:16:59,057 --> 01:17:00,581
Jee Louise.

947
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:11,393
JJ!

948
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:13,664
<i>...psychologically across the country.</i>

949
01:17:13,905 --> 01:17:15,634
<i>lt´s had such an enormous...</i>

950
01:17:24,215 --> 01:17:26,240
JJ, what are you doing?

951
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:27,978
I told you before.

952
01:17:33,258 --> 01:17:35,556
-Sweetie, get out of the car.
-No.

953
01:17:37,128 --> 01:17:39,528
-JJ, get out of this car. Now!
-No.

954
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:41,564
-Don´t say no to me.
-What´s wrong with you?

955
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:43,827
-Don´t you want to find him?
-Yes, I want to find him.

956
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:46,165
-What if he´s dying?
-There´s nothing that we can do.

957
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:47,829
What if we never see him again?

958
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,050
All right, l´ll go. Get out.

959
01:18:00,785 --> 01:18:03,015
I said l´m going. Now, come on.

960
01:18:06,457 --> 01:18:08,482
You want some tuna without the bread?

961
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,520
No, Mom, l´m not hungry.

962
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,630
You have to eat something.

963
01:18:18,536 --> 01:18:20,299
The baby´s going through this,
too, honey.

964
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:23,499
How about a waffle?

965
01:18:23,608 --> 01:18:25,906
Forget it, Patricia. She´d throw it up.

966
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:43,722
I could cook up some macaroni.

967
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:49,332
No, that´s okay, Ma.
l´m going to put Bianca to bed.

968
01:18:53,805 --> 01:18:56,205
<i>lt´s also a great test for us all,</i>

969
01:18:56,307 --> 01:18:59,470
<i>wherever we live, whatever our age,</i>
<i>whatever our beliefs.</i>

970
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:04,380
<i>Just look at that scene</i>
<i>and think about what happened today.</i>

971
01:19:06,017 --> 01:19:10,249
<i>Rescue officials predict that hundreds,</i>
<i>if not thousands...</i>

972
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:50,651
-Mommy!
-Hey, baby.

973
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:03,640
ls Daddy coming home?

974
01:20:11,215 --> 01:20:12,307
Honey,

975
01:20:15,953 --> 01:20:17,420
I don´t know.

976
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:53,156
United States Marines!
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

977
01:20:58,429 --> 01:21:02,126
United States Marines.
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

978
01:21:05,803 --> 01:21:07,430
United States Marine?

979
01:21:14,045 --> 01:21:16,172
Are you heading in, too, Devil Dog?

980
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:20,480
l´ve reconned the area, Sergeant.

981
01:21:22,754 --> 01:21:25,416
Our best shot is going up.

982
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:28,455
All right.

983
01:21:34,031 --> 01:21:35,931
Someone says stop, you don´t stop.

984
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:38,831
You don´t hear them.
There´s no going back.

985
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:41,535
Let´s go.

986
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,937
Thomas.

987
01:21:47,812 --> 01:21:49,006
Karnes.

988
01:21:57,155 --> 01:22:00,613
United States Marines.
lf you can hear me, yell or tap.

989
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:44,064
Sarge?

990
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:46,929
John.

991
01:22:49,373 --> 01:22:50,499
Yeah.

992
01:22:52,743 --> 01:22:55,211
The most amaing thing just happened.

993
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,205
I saw Jesus.

994
01:23:01,419 --> 01:23:02,886
And you know what?

995
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,847
He had a bottle of water.

996
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,856
And I could have drunk it, you know?

997
01:23:12,897 --> 01:23:14,694
But I didn´t drink it.

998
01:23:17,001 --> 01:23:19,299
He´s telling us something, Sarge.

999
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:23,032
He´s telling us to come home.

1000
01:23:26,944 --> 01:23:28,809
Don´t sleep on me, John.

1001
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:31,711
No.

1002
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,980
The pain´s keeping me alive.

1003
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:38,488
Keep talking.

1004
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,389
You remember <i>Starsky and Hutch?</i>

1005
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,655
When I was a kid, it was on TV.

1006
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,298
I remember the theme song.

1007
01:23:58,943 --> 01:24:00,410
When that would come on,

1008
01:24:00,511 --> 01:24:03,878
l´d run around the house
and arrest my sister, Karen.

1009
01:24:08,019 --> 01:24:10,249
Took me six years to be a cop.

1010
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,490
The only thing
I ever wanted to be was a cop.

1011
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:19,055
How long you been in?

1012
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:22,961
Twenty-one years.

1013
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:25,328
Boy, that´s a lifetime.

1014
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,232
You´re one tough guy, Sergeant.

1015
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:35,709
I don´t smile a lot.

1016
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,011
That´s why l´m not

1017
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:46,112
lieutenant.

1018
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:48,455
People

1019
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,194
don´t like me ´cause

1020
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,256
I don´t smile a lot.

1021
01:25:06,377 --> 01:25:08,504
Yeah, that´s it. You got it.

1022
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,611
We got Frank Sinatra over here.

1023
01:25:27,064 --> 01:25:29,555
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

1024
01:25:58,429 --> 01:25:59,726
John.

1025
01:26:00,898 --> 01:26:02,525
John.

1026
01:26:03,734 --> 01:26:05,531
Remember what you said?

1027
01:26:06,604 --> 01:26:09,095
You sleep, you ain´t coming back.

1028
01:26:09,807 --> 01:26:12,674
You got to come back,
´cause we´re getting out of here.

1029
01:26:23,087 --> 01:26:24,384
Sarge!

1030
01:26:27,658 --> 01:26:29,285
John McLoughlin!

1031
01:26:30,761 --> 01:26:33,457
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

1032
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:35,758
Can you hear me?

1033
01:26:38,102 --> 01:26:39,399
Are you sleeping?

1034
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,302
Sarge!

1035
01:26:47,878 --> 01:26:49,072
Will?

1036
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:54,184
Where are we?

1037
01:26:55,853 --> 01:26:57,150
ln hell.

1038
01:27:00,024 --> 01:27:01,787
We´re alive in hell.

1039
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:03,720
How about that, John?

1040
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:07,494
Pipe.

1041
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,527
Keep trying.

1042
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:13,267
Try the pipe.

1043
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:27,441
Good.

1044
01:27:28,486 --> 01:27:29,953
Keep doing it.

1045
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:41,758
We could circle back.

1046
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,931
Never mind.

1047
01:27:54,011 --> 01:27:55,137
Yeah.

1048
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:03,950
We hear you!

1049
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:06,716
We hear you!

1050
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:12,125
-Go!
-Keep yelling!

1051
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,227
8-13! PAPD down!

1052
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:19,066
-Who´s down there?
-PAPD.

1053
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,797
McLoughlin and Jimeno.

1054
01:28:22,406 --> 01:28:24,374
-Hello?
-Here!

1055
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,639
I don´t see you!

1056
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:28,378
You got to be kidding me.

1057
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,877
Here!

1058
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,944
Gotcha.

1059
01:28:34,051 --> 01:28:35,348
Gotcha!

1060
01:28:39,957 --> 01:28:42,289
Just hang on! Just hang on, okay?

1061
01:28:42,927 --> 01:28:45,327
Don´t leave us.
We´ve been here a long time.

1062
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:49,593
We´re not leaving you, buddy.
We´re Marines. You are our mission.

1063
01:28:51,502 --> 01:28:54,300
That´s great! Oh, that´s great!

1064
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:00,973
The Marines, John!

1065
01:29:02,179 --> 01:29:04,147
Can you believe that?

1066
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:11,882
Sergeant, if we leave this spot,
we might never make it back.

1067
01:29:11,989 --> 01:29:13,456
That´s what l´m thinking.

1068
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:17,524
-lt´s overloaded?
-Yeah.

1069
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:22,899
My sister in Pittsburgh.

1070
01:29:25,669 --> 01:29:27,068
<i>Hello?</i>

1071
01:29:27,371 --> 01:29:29,339
lt´s me. l´m at the Trade Center.

1072
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,139
Yeah. Emergency Command.

1073
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,637
You got an exact location on that?

1074
01:29:39,516 --> 01:29:40,676
Great. Yeah.

1075
01:29:40,784 --> 01:29:44,220
Guys, I got two Port Authority cops
found in the middle of the rubble.

1076
01:29:44,355 --> 01:29:45,879
They´re still alive.

1077
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,130
I got it.

1078
01:30:01,338 --> 01:30:02,965
Thank God!

1079
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:05,734
They found him, Donna!
You hear that? They got him.

1080
01:30:05,843 --> 01:30:08,277
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. All right.

1081
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:11,314
All right. All right. Thank you.
We´re on our way.

1082
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:15,347
He´s okay! The son of a bitch
walked right out onto Liberty Street.

1083
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,716
They want us to meet him
at the bus terminal.

1084
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:20,153
I am going to kick his ass
when I see him!

1085
01:30:21,825 --> 01:30:23,793
He just walked right out.

1086
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:26,422
He just walked right out.

1087
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,299
-Allison, he´s alive.
-What?

1088
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:40,877
He´s alive. They couldn´t kill him.
They couldn´t kill him.

1089
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:41,945
They found him.

1090
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:44,405
He´s trapped,
but they´re digging him out right now.

1091
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:47,814
He´s the toughest son of a gun I know.
He´s made of rocks, is he not?

1092
01:30:48,619 --> 01:30:50,416
-He´s coming home.
-Come on. Let´s go.

1093
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:55,614
Have you been working out?
I can´t keep up to you here.

1094
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,727
I told you. Didn´t I tell you?

1095
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:08,964
So where are we supposed
to pick him up?

1096
01:31:09,373 --> 01:31:11,341
Where are we supposed to pick him up?

1097
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,507
No one asked?

1098
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,805
Jerry! What´re you doing?

1099
01:31:29,426 --> 01:31:31,053
-You´re the Marine?
-Yeah.

1100
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:33,789
Scott Strauss, Emergency Service Unit.

1101
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,130
What do we got? How many
are down there? Two down there?

1102
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:41,363
They´re Port Authority cops.

1103
01:31:41,839 --> 01:31:44,535
The first one´s down about 20 feet,
in pretty bad shape.

1104
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:46,302
The second one´s even deeper.

1105
01:31:46,577 --> 01:31:50,877
lt´s a tough hole to get down,
but they´re in there, and they´re alive.

1106
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:52,978
We got to hold them off, Paddy.

1107
01:31:53,517 --> 01:31:54,814
All right, listen up.

1108
01:31:55,786 --> 01:31:57,413
No one make any sudden moves.
All right?

1109
01:31:57,521 --> 01:32:00,422
This whole thing´s
like a pile of pick-up sticks.

1110
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:03,382
-ls there any F.D. up here?
-Any F.D. up here?

1111
01:32:03,494 --> 01:32:04,859
-Ed! Ed.
-Yeah.

1112
01:32:04,962 --> 01:32:07,522
Go back to Church.
Get the fire department up here.

1113
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:08,689
Got it.

1114
01:32:08,799 --> 01:32:11,063
ls Captain Yee on the radio?
Captain Yee on the air?

1115
01:32:11,168 --> 01:32:12,294
<i>On the air.</i>

1116
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:15,065
-Captain. Captain, it´s Scott Strauss.
-<i>Go ahead.</i>

1117
01:32:15,172 --> 01:32:17,367
I got two cops here buried in the rubble.

1118
01:32:18,342 --> 01:32:21,800
Right in the pile near the globe.
I need equipment and manpower.

1119
01:32:22,146 --> 01:32:24,774
Also get F.D. up here forthwith.
We´re gonna burn.

1120
01:32:24,882 --> 01:32:26,179
<i>Got it, Scotty. Stay safe.</i>

1121
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,818
I need a paramedic!
Who here´s a medic?

1122
01:32:29,053 --> 01:32:30,350
I used to be.

1123
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:34,958
Used to be? Jesus Christ. Come on!
I need a paramedic here.

1124
01:32:35,325 --> 01:32:37,293
My license lapsed.

1125
01:32:38,495 --> 01:32:40,360
I had a few bad years.

1126
01:32:41,465 --> 01:32:43,865
But I know what l´m doing.

1127
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:46,164
l´m good.

1128
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:49,637
You know this whole thing
could collapse on our heads and kill us?

1129
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:51,838
Yeah.

1130
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:54,741
What´s your name?

1131
01:32:55,245 --> 01:32:56,735
Chuck Sereika.

1132
01:32:57,081 --> 01:32:59,311
l´m Scott. Come on. All right.

1133
01:33:00,818 --> 01:33:01,807
Hey.

1134
01:33:01,919 --> 01:33:04,854
-Seen the way to one of them.
-All right, Paddy. Call it.

1135
01:33:05,155 --> 01:33:06,952
lt´s real tight, Scotty.

1136
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:09,125
Hey.

1137
01:33:09,326 --> 01:33:11,794
You´re never gonna get down there
with all that gear, buddy.

1138
01:33:11,895 --> 01:33:15,023
Try this, Marine KBAR.
Best knife ever made.

1139
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:18,431
Thanks. You got a name, Marine?

1140
01:33:18,669 --> 01:33:20,159
Staff Sergeant Karnes.

1141
01:33:20,737 --> 01:33:22,705
I mean, something a little shorter.

1142
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,565
Staff Sergeant.

1143
01:33:27,778 --> 01:33:29,575
-Okay.
-You all right?

1144
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,647
Yeah.

1145
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:33,447
Okay.

1146
01:33:41,525 --> 01:33:43,425
My wife is Pat Strauss.

1147
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:47,096
You tell her and my kids
that I love them, okay?

1148
01:33:51,802 --> 01:33:53,269
You ready?

1149
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,367
-Let´s go.
-All right.

1150
01:34:04,648 --> 01:34:06,639
Hi. Where´s John McLoughlin?

1151
01:34:07,117 --> 01:34:08,812
-Mrs. McLoughlin?
-Yes.

1152
01:34:10,254 --> 01:34:13,451
He´s alive,
but l´m afraid there´s been a mistake.

1153
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:15,849
Mistake?

1154
01:34:15,959 --> 01:34:18,189
When they called me,
they really thought John walked out.

1155
01:34:18,295 --> 01:34:21,753
He didn´t. He´s still trapped,
but they´re working on him.

1156
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:25,191
ls he hurt bad?

1157
01:34:25,302 --> 01:34:26,269
Oh, my God.

1158
01:34:30,274 --> 01:34:32,504
Oh, this is not right.

1159
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:34,236
This is not right!

1160
01:34:34,945 --> 01:34:36,879
He gave you everything,
years of his life!

1161
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,971
And you can´t even get this right?

1162
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,490
Where is he? l´m going down there.

1163
01:34:49,026 --> 01:34:51,620
l´m sorry, Mrs. McLoughlin.
lt´s too dangerous.

1164
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:56,366
Where are they taking him?

1165
01:34:56,867 --> 01:34:58,164
Bellevue.

1166
01:34:59,703 --> 01:35:01,136
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1167
01:35:10,013 --> 01:35:12,072
Where do we take him
when we get him out?

1168
01:35:12,182 --> 01:35:13,615
Triage at One Liberty.

1169
01:35:13,717 --> 01:35:15,514
And what´s the status of McLoughlin?

1170
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:17,348
He´s further down.
We´re still working on him.

1171
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:23,756
Easy, easy.

1172
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:26,790
We need more length! Kink it!

1173
01:35:32,002 --> 01:35:33,469
What the hell?

1174
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:36,269
-103!
-Yeah.

1175
01:35:37,307 --> 01:35:39,176
We need a line down here fast.

1176
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,885
Okay, breathe this. Breathe. Okay.

1177
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,524
Chuck, how´s he doing?

1178
01:36:05,168 --> 01:36:07,966
Blood pressure´s holding. He´s stable.

1179
01:36:08,939 --> 01:36:11,407
But he´s swelling,
and he´s getting colder.

1180
01:36:11,608 --> 01:36:12,905
Paddy!

1181
01:36:13,644 --> 01:36:15,612
Get something to cover him, will you?

1182
01:36:16,713 --> 01:36:18,078
Hey, Willy.

1183
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:31,759
Brother, take a blow. Take the blow.
We got fresh guys up there.

1184
01:36:31,862 --> 01:36:32,920
All right.

1185
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:35,658
I got to get down below you.
We got a guy down below you.

1186
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:47,201
l´m sorry, Will.

1187
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:51,613
Why can´t I ever get a female cop?

1188
01:36:51,782 --> 01:36:53,409
At least somebody skinny.

1189
01:36:54,084 --> 01:36:56,484
What do you want?
My wife´s a great cook.

1190
01:36:57,721 --> 01:36:59,313
She´d better be,

1191
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:02,688
´cause l´m bringing 20 people
to that barbecue you´re giving for me.

1192
01:37:02,793 --> 01:37:05,728
Scotty! They say
they can´t control the fires.

1193
01:37:05,996 --> 01:37:08,362
Building Four and Five
might come down.

1194
01:37:08,765 --> 01:37:10,733
Nothing like a little pressure, right?

1195
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:32,878
God damn it. lt´s not working.

1196
01:37:33,156 --> 01:37:34,783
Try more cribbing.

1197
01:37:38,595 --> 01:37:40,062
Chuck. Paddy.

1198
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,797
Just get out of here.

1199
01:37:42,032 --> 01:37:44,000
This whole damn thing
could come down on us.

1200
01:37:44,334 --> 01:37:46,268
There´s no sense in all of us
getting killed.

1201
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:49,066
You gonna pry up that slab
and get him out of here yourself?

1202
01:37:50,507 --> 01:37:52,236
l´ve been in and out of rehab for years.

1203
01:37:52,342 --> 01:37:55,607
Finally figured out the only thing
l´ve ever been good at is helping people.

1204
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,179
We´re doing this together.

1205
01:37:57,848 --> 01:37:59,076
I ain´t leaving.

1206
01:37:59,182 --> 01:38:01,446
I don´t mean to break up the moment,

1207
01:38:01,551 --> 01:38:03,712
but we´re all
getting out of here together.

1208
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:10,159
ls someone there? You got water?

1209
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,391
Who the hell´s that?

1210
01:38:12,829 --> 01:38:15,161
I told you. That was my partner.

1211
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,400
-Hey, John!
-l thought he was your partner.

1212
01:38:18,769 --> 01:38:20,634
l´m almost out, okay?

1213
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,262
They´re coming soon. I promise.

1214
01:38:24,074 --> 01:38:26,167
-Okay, Will.
-Who´s that?

1215
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,275
McLoughlin.

1216
01:38:28,578 --> 01:38:31,706
Scott Strauss, ESU. How you doing?

1217
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:35,275
l´m okay. Need water.

1218
01:38:35,752 --> 01:38:39,483
We hear you. When we get Will out,
we´re coming for you.

1219
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:42,885
We can´t get anything to you
down there right now, John.

1220
01:38:42,993 --> 01:38:44,620
There´s just no room.

1221
01:38:48,765 --> 01:38:50,027
This guy.

1222
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,398
He´s gonna die
if you don´t get him out soon.

1223
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:57,572
And the only thing in the way is my leg.
I want you to cut it off.

1224
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:01,304
Just cut it off. I can live without a leg.

1225
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:05,807
Okay.

1226
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:11,947
l´m not cutting your leg off. I can´t.

1227
01:39:12,756 --> 01:39:15,486
You´re coming out in one piece,
you hear me?

1228
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:17,059
You gotta...

1229
01:39:17,427 --> 01:39:21,056
Look, it´s my leg.
Just juice me up and cut it off.

1230
01:39:21,498 --> 01:39:24,194
lf he dies, I die. That´s just the way it is.

1231
01:39:24,434 --> 01:39:27,835
Look, Will,
your partner must be 20 feet deeper.

1232
01:39:27,971 --> 01:39:30,201
Probably more compacted than you.

1233
01:39:30,574 --> 01:39:34,533
Even if I cut your leg off, he´s not gonna
get out of there for hours.

1234
01:39:35,245 --> 01:39:37,873
l´m sorry, man. Now, let me do my work.

1235
01:39:38,248 --> 01:39:40,045
We´re going again!

1236
01:39:44,154 --> 01:39:45,382
Hi.

1237
01:39:47,257 --> 01:39:51,159
Ma´am, this is Allison Jimeno.
She´s Will Jimeno´s wife.

1238
01:39:51,261 --> 01:39:53,354
l´m his sister.
We were told he was coming here.

1239
01:39:53,463 --> 01:39:56,830
We´re asking all the family members
to please wait in the cafeteria.

1240
01:39:56,933 --> 01:39:58,525
lt´s over there through the doors.

1241
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:03,503
I can´t go in there.

1242
01:40:03,607 --> 01:40:06,405
Come on.
We´ll find someplace else, honey.

1243
01:40:15,185 --> 01:40:16,345
Hand it over here, boss.

1244
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:17,917
Hey, John!

1245
01:40:18,255 --> 01:40:21,383
They´re coming!
You hang in there! Okay?

1246
01:40:24,094 --> 01:40:25,755
I love you, John!

1247
01:40:26,429 --> 01:40:28,192
l´m waiting for you!

1248
01:40:32,769 --> 01:40:34,532
Don´t give up, okay?

1249
01:40:37,941 --> 01:40:39,238
Will.

1250
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:41,207
Tell them

1251
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:45,870
l´m coming, too.

1252
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:49,318
You tell them.

1253
01:40:49,719 --> 01:40:51,186
lt´s great up here!

1254
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:53,890
lt´s just so great!

1255
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:22,118
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1256
01:41:23,353 --> 01:41:24,980
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1257
01:41:25,322 --> 01:41:27,654
They´re gone, kid. They´re gone.

1258
01:41:28,258 --> 01:41:29,555
You´re going home.

1259
01:41:41,838 --> 01:41:43,499
You done it, Will.

1260
01:41:46,009 --> 01:41:47,408
You done it.

1261
01:41:49,913 --> 01:41:51,574
Go to your family.

1262
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,397
Who´s there?

1263
01:42:15,105 --> 01:42:17,665
No, not yet.

1264
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,687
Can you hear me?

1265
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,188
Not yet.

1266
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,892
John?

1267
01:42:46,036 --> 01:42:48,504
John, can you hear me?

1268
01:42:48,605 --> 01:42:50,072
-John!
-Easy, Scott.

1269
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:51,299
Scotty?

1270
01:42:51,408 --> 01:42:54,002
-Down here.
-Coming to you. l´m good.

1271
01:42:55,045 --> 01:42:58,173
-l´m coming.
-lt´s tight.

1272
01:42:58,281 --> 01:43:01,079
I think I see him, Lou. I got him.

1273
01:43:01,317 --> 01:43:03,376
-ls he awake?
-Semi.

1274
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,981
John? John, can you hear me?

1275
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:12,083
John! l´m Scott, from ESU 5.
Man, l´m not gonna leave you.

1276
01:43:12,195 --> 01:43:15,028
l´m gonna do whatever I can
to get you out of here. All right?

1277
01:43:15,131 --> 01:43:16,689
-lt´s tight, Lou.
-All right.

1278
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,165
-Just send it back.
-All right.

1279
01:43:18,268 --> 01:43:20,566
Find a place to put debris.

1280
01:43:21,104 --> 01:43:23,368
Louie, bring it back.
I got an elevator shaft here.

1281
01:43:23,473 --> 01:43:24,770
You´re gonna be all right, John.

1282
01:43:24,874 --> 01:43:26,808
-We´re not leaving you.
-Bring the Sawall down.

1283
01:43:35,885 --> 01:43:38,149
Hang in there, John. Come on.
You´ll be all right.

1284
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,553
Stay with us, John. Come on.
We got you.

1285
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:51,392
<i>We´re transporting Jimeno to Bellevue.</i>
<i>Have a trauma team standing by.</i>

1286
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:56,666
Respiration´s 26, B.P. is <i>9</i>0 over 58.
Got him on 15 liters O2.

1287
01:43:57,006 --> 01:43:59,474
Room´s prepped.
Take him all the way down to the end.

1288
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:04,675
Hey, they brought him in the back.
Come on.

1289
01:44:09,552 --> 01:44:10,746
This way.

1290
01:44:13,256 --> 01:44:14,553
Over here.

1291
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:28,263
Oh, my God.

1292
01:44:29,405 --> 01:44:31,373
He´s breathing out rocks.

1293
01:44:32,609 --> 01:44:35,442
Will? Can you hear me?

1294
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:37,443
Hey, baby.

1295
01:44:37,847 --> 01:44:40,441
Oh, baby, are you okay?

1296
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,747
We´re taking him to the O.R. now.

1297
01:44:42,886 --> 01:44:45,377
They said your leg was broke.

1298
01:44:47,223 --> 01:44:48,850
Will, baby?

1299
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,887
They told me you were all right.

1300
01:44:59,202 --> 01:45:01,432
I want you to name her Olivia.

1301
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:07,375
No, I want Alyssa.

1302
01:45:08,311 --> 01:45:09,608
For you.

1303
01:45:12,015 --> 01:45:13,380
Olivia.

1304
01:45:13,716 --> 01:45:16,241
Ma´am, we´re gonna have to
take him up to O.R.

1305
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:18,616
lt´ll be better for him
if you come with us, ma´am.

1306
01:45:19,055 --> 01:45:20,022
Will.

1307
01:45:22,425 --> 01:45:23,983
He´ll be okay, right?

1308
01:45:24,594 --> 01:45:25,993
There are some complications,

1309
01:45:26,095 --> 01:45:28,120
-but we´ve given him good...
-Will?

1310
01:45:28,998 --> 01:45:32,195
l´m going to name her Olivia, okay?

1311
01:45:33,169 --> 01:45:34,466
Okay.

1312
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:42,439
John? You got two big slabs
on your chest.

1313
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:44,376
lt´s the only way we´re gonna
get you out of here, all right?

1314
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,641
I got the big one, you got the little one.

1315
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,719
Pull it off.

1316
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:56,048
All right. John. We got one more.

1317
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,093
One more, brother,
and we got your chest clear.

1318
01:45:58,194 --> 01:45:59,821
We got a good start.

1319
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:02,964
-Joe-Joe?
-Yeah?

1320
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,861
Tell Lieutenant
to get a paramedic down here.

1321
01:46:05,969 --> 01:46:08,733
-We got to get an lV in him now.
-All right.

1322
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,699
We´re gonna need a paramedic
down here now!

1323
01:46:13,009 --> 01:46:14,499
Come on, John. We´re almost there.

1324
01:46:14,611 --> 01:46:15,873
McLoughlin.

1325
01:46:17,313 --> 01:46:20,043
You´re in good hands, John.
You´re getting out of here.

1326
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:23,414
That´s it, John. That´s it.
Hang in there, brother.

1327
01:46:23,953 --> 01:46:26,717
That´s it. Hang in there, John.
Don´t give up.

1328
01:46:26,823 --> 01:46:29,758
Don´t give up. We didn´t give up.
Don´t you give up.

1329
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,823
John, can you hear me?

1330
01:46:33,196 --> 01:46:34,390
John, wake up.

1331
01:46:34,497 --> 01:46:38,797
That´s it, John, wake up. Stay with us.
Don´t go nowhere.

1332
01:46:43,473 --> 01:46:45,668
Come on, John. Come on, John.

1333
01:46:46,709 --> 01:46:51,442
Stay with us, John. Don´t give up.
Come on, brother. Hang in there.

1334
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:52,911
-John.
-Come on, John.

1335
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:56,218
Hang in there, brother.
Hang in there. Come on.

1336
01:46:56,586 --> 01:47:00,386
We´re almost home.
We´re almost home, man.

1337
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:01,457
Come on.

1338
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,387
Stay with us, brother.

1339
01:47:16,272 --> 01:47:17,762
I let you down.

1340
01:47:21,377 --> 01:47:24,244
All these years, l´ve been so careful.

1341
01:47:25,848 --> 01:47:27,372
Now I screw up.

1342
01:47:28,952 --> 01:47:30,579
l´m sorry.

1343
01:47:40,196 --> 01:47:43,063
Did I ever love you enough, honey?

1344
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:45,998
I mean,

1345
01:47:47,236 --> 01:47:51,570
did I love you good
like I was supposed to?

1346
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,810
What the hell happened?

1347
01:48:01,517 --> 01:48:03,246
<i>l think we had it, John.</i>

1348
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:08,054
lt was in the moments.

1349
01:48:11,728 --> 01:48:13,821
Happens to most people, I guess.

1350
01:48:14,364 --> 01:48:17,162
Me with the kids,
and you with the department.

1351
01:48:19,435 --> 01:48:21,403
Somewhere along the way

1352
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:26,208
I guess we kind of stopped looking
at each other.

1353
01:48:30,346 --> 01:48:32,143
Come home, honey.

1354
01:48:32,949 --> 01:48:34,576
The kids need you.

1355
01:48:37,387 --> 01:48:38,513
No.

1356
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,323
I need you.

1357
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,659
Donna.

1358
01:48:46,362 --> 01:48:47,590
I can´t.

1359
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:50,661
I can´t get out of here.

1360
01:48:51,367 --> 01:48:54,165
Honey, the kitchen´s
not even finished yet.

1361
01:48:55,538 --> 01:48:58,666
Okay. Would you get off the kitchen?

1362
01:49:00,009 --> 01:49:01,943
ls this necessary?

1363
01:49:02,612 --> 01:49:05,547
-l´m stuck.
-Then get unstuck.

1364
01:49:06,282 --> 01:49:08,182
Get off your ass, John.

1365
01:49:09,085 --> 01:49:11,815
Just get up and come home.

1366
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,022
Donna, I can´t. l...

1367
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:21,730
<i>You can do it.</i>

1368
01:49:24,267 --> 01:49:25,564
John?

1369
01:49:28,204 --> 01:49:30,866
What´s taking so long? Hey, you guys!

1370
01:50:00,103 --> 01:50:04,039
<i>One thing he said,</i>
<i>of all the images we´ve seen,</i>

1371
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,309
<i>it is a scene of New Yorkers calmly</i>

1372
01:50:08,244 --> 01:50:09,643
<i>evacuating...</i>

1373
01:50:09,745 --> 01:50:10,803
Great.

1374
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,948
lt´s not working. Don´t bother.

1375
01:50:17,253 --> 01:50:19,244
Waiting´s shit, isn´t it?

1376
01:50:20,456 --> 01:50:22,617
lf it´s gonna be bad,
you just want to know it. No bullshit.

1377
01:50:22,725 --> 01:50:24,056
That´s right.

1378
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,822
They´re digging my husband out.
They found him in the rubble.

1379
01:50:27,763 --> 01:50:29,162
That´s good.

1380
01:50:32,268 --> 01:50:34,498
My son´s down there. Lawrence.

1381
01:50:36,405 --> 01:50:40,034
He´s the elevator operator
in the South Tower. A good boy.

1382
01:50:43,913 --> 01:50:47,280
When I saw that building going down
like a pancake...

1383
01:50:53,422 --> 01:50:55,720
Damn thing is, I yelled at him.

1384
01:50:57,727 --> 01:50:59,854
Last time, l...

1385
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:04,395
I made dinner.

1386
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:10,100
He got held up at work.
Food went to waste.

1387
01:51:12,909 --> 01:51:14,376
And I yelled.

1388
01:51:17,079 --> 01:51:19,206
Now all I want to do is hold him.

1389
01:51:20,249 --> 01:51:21,546
I know.

1390
01:51:23,085 --> 01:51:24,382
I know.

1391
01:51:25,254 --> 01:51:26,551
I know.

1392
01:51:27,323 --> 01:51:29,120
Oh, come here. Come here.

1393
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,760
I know. I know, sweetie.

1394
01:51:32,028 --> 01:51:34,997
lt´s all right. lt´s all right.

1395
01:51:35,431 --> 01:51:36,728
Come here.

1396
01:51:41,437 --> 01:51:43,564
lt´s all right. You´re okay.

1397
01:51:53,249 --> 01:51:54,546
I know.

1398
01:51:57,086 --> 01:51:58,610
Thank you so...

1399
01:51:59,589 --> 01:52:01,386
Thank you so...

1400
01:53:10,926 --> 01:53:12,257
Thank you.

1401
01:53:13,095 --> 01:53:15,393
Thank you. Thank you.

1402
01:53:15,498 --> 01:53:17,056
lt´ll be all right.
You´re gonna be all right.

1403
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:18,326
Thank you.

1404
01:53:18,434 --> 01:53:20,402
-We got you, buddy.
-Hang in there, man.

1405
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,471
-Hang in there.
-Hang in there, John.

1406
01:53:22,571 --> 01:53:25,540
-Good job.
-We got you, man. We got you.

1407
01:53:25,741 --> 01:53:27,641
You´re going home, John.
You´re going home.

1408
01:53:27,743 --> 01:53:29,233
-Way to go, man.
-Thank you.

1409
01:53:29,345 --> 01:53:31,506
-Welcome home.
-God bless you, John.

1410
01:53:31,614 --> 01:53:32,774
Thank you.

1411
01:53:32,882 --> 01:53:35,180
Way to go. Way to go, guy.

1412
01:54:08,918 --> 01:54:10,010
John?

1413
01:54:10,786 --> 01:54:12,515
-Hi.
-Donna.

1414
01:54:12,621 --> 01:54:13,849
Hi, baby.

1415
01:54:15,591 --> 01:54:16,990
John.

1416
01:54:17,993 --> 01:54:20,962
You kept me

1417
01:54:22,231 --> 01:54:23,858
alive.

1418
01:55:44,346 --> 01:55:46,075
You guys come
all the way from Wisconsin?

1419
01:55:46,182 --> 01:55:48,548
Yeah, those bastards.
We had to do something.

1420
01:55:49,718 --> 01:55:50,946
You want a brat?

1421
01:55:51,053 --> 01:55:52,452
Finest brat you´ll get in the whole world.

1422
01:55:52,555 --> 01:55:54,352
That´s a guarantee you can take
to the bank, mister.

1423
01:55:54,457 --> 01:55:55,754
Yeah, sure.

1424
01:55:56,659 --> 01:55:58,286
What are you doing down here?

1425
01:56:00,996 --> 01:56:03,294
-Paramedic.
-Atta way.

1426
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:14,635
No, l´m not coming in today.

1427
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,877
I don´t know.

1428
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:25,882
They´re going to need some good men
out there to avenge this.

1429
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:30,488
We´ll see.

1430
01:56:36,232 --> 01:56:39,497
Jimeno just got out.
McLoughlin´s still in surgery.

1431
01:56:39,935 --> 01:56:41,300
We´re still missing 1 4.

1432
01:56:41,403 --> 01:56:43,530
Jesus. What do we do?

1433
01:56:45,241 --> 01:56:48,938
Thousands of people in there, Paddy.
Where the hell are they?

1434
01:58:25,841 --> 01:58:29,140
<i>9/1 1 showed us</i>
<i>what human beings are capable of.</i>

1435
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:32,277
<i>The evil, yeah, sure.</i>

1436
01:58:33,215 --> 01:58:36,776
<i>But it also brought out a goodness</i>
<i>we forgot could exist.</i>

1437
01:58:40,089 --> 01:58:42,421
<i>People taking care of each other</i>

1438
01:58:44,693 --> 01:58:46,092
<i>for no other reason</i>

1439
01:58:47,563 --> 01:58:49,690
<i>than it was the right thing to do.</i>

1440
01:58:50,432 --> 01:58:53,401
-That´s my son, JJ.
-JJ, l´m Tim.

1441
01:58:53,936 --> 01:58:57,463
<i>lt´s important for us</i>
<i>to talk about that good, to remember.</i>

1442
01:58:57,873 --> 01:58:59,465
lf she wasn´t here, I wouldn´t be here.

1443
01:58:59,575 --> 01:59:02,043
Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hi.

1444
01:59:03,345 --> 01:59:05,142
<i>´Cause I saw a lot of it that day.</i>

1445
01:59:05,447 --> 01:59:06,744
Olivia, you coming?

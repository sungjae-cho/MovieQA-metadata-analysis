1
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>Come on, come on, came on.</i>

2
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,079
Francis Kelly!

3
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,287
Here you go.
That's everything.

4
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,660
Yeah, that's my brother.

5
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,245
Hey, Frankie.

6
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,161
Frankie, see ya in a couple months.

7
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,578
Yeah, I'll pay your mom
a visit in the meantime.

8
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:53,836
- I'm a free motherfucker.
- Here he is.

9
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,533
What's up, man?

10
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,656
- What up, Frankie?
- What up, Sugar?

11
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:02,533
I'm a free motherfucker!
Oh, shit. You got my hat.

12
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:06,365
Yeah, Frankie's back, baby.
Frankie's back.

13
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,364
- Frankie's back. My man.
- What's up!

14
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:08,566
Come on, Frankie.

15
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,695
Come on, boy. You go.
Watch your head, hm.

16
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:23,243
Oh, shit.
Oh, Ray, man.

17
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,866
This is your place, bro?
Oh, man.

18
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:32,199
Yo, dude, this fucking girl tonight, bro,
this fucking pussy was like--

19
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,823
- Bro, what--
- Where's his brother?

20
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,190
Can somebody get that?

21
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:46,074
James, grab the phone!

22
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:01,152
Lewis's Auto.

23
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:04,655
Yeah, I'm James Kelly.

24
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,011
Yeah, well, I thought it was
your mandate or whatever...

25
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,197
to support small business with loans.

26
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,863
Yeah, no, I understand.

27
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,304
No, man, I don't have a degree.

28
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,567
And I don't really
see how that matters much.

29
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:32,988
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

30
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,153
All right, all right.
Thanks for your time, man.

31
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,770
Asshole.

32
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,728
Fuck.

33
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,817
Hey, Joe! I got this.

34
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:14,852
Emily.

35
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,027
James Kelly.

36
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,675
I thought you moved away after Katrina.

37
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,047
I did, but soon as I could
get work, I came back.

38
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,815
Oh, yeah?
What do you do?

39
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,232
I'm a dispatcher for the NOPD.

40
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:38,772
Really?

41
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:45,438
- What, so you're like a cop or something?
- No, I'm not a cop.

42
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,441
I'm a glorified operator.

43
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,768
That's cool.

44
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,147
You kind of disappeared.

45
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:07,602
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.
I went traveling.

46
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,731
I was traveling abroad
for a little bit, you know.

47
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,937
Really? 'Cause I thought maybe
you got abducted by aliens...

48
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:17,231
or started working for the CIA or,
I don't know, went to prison.

49
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:23,274
Actually, yes.
I used to be a secret agent for the CIA.

50
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,434
But on very top secret missions.

51
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:28,982
But that was a long time ago and
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

52
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,892
Come here for a second.

53
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,150
- You live nearby?
- Not far.

54
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,442
- Got a garage at your place?
- Sure.

55
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:44,149
Look, this...

56
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,817
this shop, it's, you know, too high priced.

57
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:54,100
If you want,
I could just fix your car at your place...

58
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,353
and you don't gotta pay me for my time.

59
00:08:55,431 --> 00:09:00,608
I'll pass along new parts at cost
and I'll save you a couple bucks.

60
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,142
That is very sweet of you.

61
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,058
Least I could do.

62
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,515
So this guy goes to prison

63
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:09,106
and they lock him down in a cell.

64
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:11,889
Two-man room.

65
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,961
He looks in and he sees there's
a big 350-pound black guy...

66
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,977
just sitting there mean-muggin' him.

67
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:25,557
Black guy says, "Say, man,

68
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:30,224
you wanna be the mama
or you wanna be the daddy?"

69
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,505
The guy says, "Excuse me?"

70
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,313
He said, "Did I stu... stu...
stutter, motherfucker?"

71
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:42,011
I say, 'You wanna to be the
mama or you wanna the daddy?

72
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:48,227
Guy says, "Well, I'll be the daddy."

73
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,518
He said, "Fine. You the daddy."

74
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,389
Come over here and
suck on mama's dick.

75
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:05,435
Come on, Jim. Come on, man.
It's been 10 years.

76
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,221
You can do better than that, no?

77
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,230
You got some fucking balls
showing up here, man.

78
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,604
What's the matter, Jimmy?
I came to see you.

79
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,599
You didn't come to see me.

80
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,936
Whatever happened to me
and you against the world, huh?

81
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,513
- You want to know what happened, Frankie?
- Yeah, what happened?

82
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,243
- You want to know what happened?
- Yeah, what happened?

83
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,473
Yeah?
I'll tell you what happened.

84
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,766
You fucking turned the world against me.

85
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,886
You still crying about that?

86
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,178
That's life, buddy.
Shit ain't fair.

87
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:51,720
Fuck!

88
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,103
Hey, all right, all right, all right!

89
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,633
Don't act crazy, come on.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry!

90
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,468
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

91
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,636
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

92
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:05,975
I'm sorry.

93
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,300
I'm sorry.

94
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,427
Ah, shit, Jimmy.

95
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,891
Shit, Frankie.

96
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,809
Let's go get a drink, huh?

97
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,976
Come on, let's go grab a drink.

98
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,096
I can't tonight.

99
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:40,015
Tomorrow.

100
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:56,472
- You're prompt.
- I like to keep my appointments.

101
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,883
Not what I recall.

102
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,091
What happened to your eye?

103
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,349
- Oh, it was just a--
- You know what? I--

104
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,799
All good, it's not my business.

105
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:13,966
So, I'm guessing you have tools?

106
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:18,005
Yeah, yeah. In my car.
You got the keys?

107
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,926
Yeah.

108
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,721
It's very sweet of you to do this.
Really.

109
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:34,763
I think I owe you.

110
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,215
It's a long time ago, James.

111
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,469
I'll be inside if you need me.

112
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,179
All right.

113
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,504
How's it going out there?

114
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,304
It looks like someone put
sugar in your gas tank.

115
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,997
- You're kidding.
- No.

116
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,589
Probably just some bored kids.
You park in bad neighborhoods?

117
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,089
I won't ever again.
Can you fix it?

118
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,762
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's fixable, it's just--

119
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:58,054
It was gummed up pretty bad, so
I'm gonna have to replace the fuel filter...

120
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,299
but we got a bunch of
those kicking around the shop...

121
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,571
and clean out your gas tank,
which will take me a bit of time.

122
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,386
But the worst part is
you're gonna need a new carburetor, so...

123
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,587
I'm gonna go back
and order one of those tonight.

124
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,635
Guess I'll see you tomorrow then.

125
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,339
Guess so.

126
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,092
All right, I'm gonna go lock up.
You have yourself a good night.

127
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,090
Okay, you, too.

128
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,444
Mr. Kelly, I'm afraid there's
been a misunderstanding.

129
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,216
This is not the type of loan
that's attractive to us right now.

130
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,215
Well, if you could just
take a look at what I got here.

131
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,378
You know, you might
find it a little interesting.

132
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,709
I've done the research and,
look, the area needs another auto shop.

133
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,008
All right?  Here look.
This is my location right here.

134
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,209
There's like 10,000 cars
that go around this circle.

135
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:19,344
It's a prime spot.
It makes perfect sense.

136
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:24,258
Here, look. This is it right here,
and it's just sitting there empty.

137
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,003
I'm not looking for that much cash.

138
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,942
<i>Just enough to cover
the rent for 7, 8 months</i>

139
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,295
and then I'll start turning a profit.

140
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:33,419
And my business plan,
it's good, all right?

141
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,793
You just gotta take a look at it,
but I promise you...

142
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:37,336
Frankly, Mr. Kelly

143
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,834
we don't make small
business loans anymore.

144
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:51,669
All right.

145
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,883
Well, what the hell do you guys do?

146
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:59,254
You know what? Never mind,
all right? I'm sorry.

147
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:06,547
It's just your Johnny-on-the-spot
with those overdraft fees.

148
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:17,456
Yo!

149
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,792
I can't believe this place
is still in business, man. Come here.

150
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,666
Yo, let me get another Jamison's.
Two.

151
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,340
Two, for me and my brother.

152
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,084
My brother, huh?
How you been, Jimmy?

153
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,038
It's James now, all right?
People don't call me Jimmy no more.

154
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,336
Okay, James.

155
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,084
You all grown up now?

156
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,585
Look, I know you're upset.

157
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,542
You got a right to be.

158
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,376
It's just, I figured all
this time, you know?

159
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:50,668
Yeah?
What did you figure, Frankie?

160
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:53,877
What did you figure, man?
You'd come back and what?

161
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:57,505
I went to jail, Frankie.

162
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,620
Bro, you got off easy with
16 months. I did 10 years.

163
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,042
Every day I was in there

164
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,999
every fucking day, Jimmy,
I thought about you, man.

165
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,497
I'm sorry, man.
I want to make amends.

166
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,543
- It's not so easy, Frankie.
- I know, I know.

167
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,587
I know.

168
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,504
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you,
bro, really.

169
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,454
I'm proud of you.
You're a fucking good-looking kid.

170
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,247
I mean, I don't know who Mom fucked,
but you lucked out.

171
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,188
You know how much
I bragged about you, man?

172
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:34,311
Like every fucking cat in D block knew about
you blowing up these al-Qaeda niggas, man.

173
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,333
Everybody, dude.
You know what kind of street cred I got...

174
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,705
for having a brother who knows
how to blow shit up?  Come on.

175
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,001
- The world forgets fast, Frankie.
- So we'll make 'em remember.

176
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,662
I got a solution.

177
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,939
You got a solution.
Frankie, I've changed, all right?

178
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,107
- Jimmy, I've changed.
- Yeah, you've changed.

179
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:56,375
Yeah, I've done a lot of soul searching.
Really, I'm like--

180
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,462
I'm like... I'm like Buddha and shit.

181
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,785
Believe me,
I've had time to think.  Okay?

182
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:08,712
A lot of suckers in there, man.
That ain't us.

183
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:12,121
Okay?  I'm gonna make things right.
We just got a bad hand.

184
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,328
Yeah, you think so?

185
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:17,493
Jimmy...

186
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,410
I know two guys, right?
They're good guys.

187
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,102
They looked out for me in the joint.
They really did.

188
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,918
Yeah, what about 'em?

189
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,206
We all want the same things.

190
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,248
To overcome the obstacles.

191
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,293
Frankie, I'm not doing nothing shady.

192
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,618
You call real estate shady?

193
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,126
- Real estate?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:47,482
What, you get yourself a fucking real
estate license when you were in the pen?

195
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,077
I ain't trying to be a fucking agent, bro.

196
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,443
I ain't a fucking agent. I'm a boss,
you know what I'm saying?

197
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:56,536
A boss. Legit.  Calling the shots,
cashing the checks.

198
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:59,244
- What, hollering, what?
- In that cheap suit?

199
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,960
Fuck you, bro. Fuck you, man.

200
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,750
Yeah, well, fuck you, bro.

201
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:08,207
Come on, man. I want to look out for you.
Like the old days.

202
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,621
Me and you against the world, remember?

203
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,417
Let's go flip some houses, bro.

204
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,660
I got the hook-up, man.
They're giving 'em away.

205
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:19,623
- We fix and flip, fix and flip.  It's easy.
- Where you getting the cash from?

206
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:22,246
Investor.
We got an investor.

207
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:27,453
He's gonna take a big piece at first,
but it'll be all right.

208
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:32,373
Come on. I want you to meet my boys.
They're outside.

209
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:38,039
- What, now?
- Somebody had to give me a ride.

210
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,074
You have some money on you?

211
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:48,666
Oh, shit. Yo, this is my brother Jim--
I mean James.

212
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,399
This is Ray.
This is Sugar.

213
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,162
Hey, man.
How's it going?

214
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:55,474
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, buddy?

215
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,916
Sugar.
Sugar, Ray.

216
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:00,494
Where's Leonard?

217
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,161
That shit's funny, though.

218
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:05,732
We heard a lot about you, man.

219
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,826
So, like, James has some questions
about the investor...

220
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,892
- how the deal's gonna go down, all that shit.
- As he should.

221
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:16,414
I don't know if Frankie's told you, but
I don't have any cash or nothing like that.

222
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,328
- Look, man, who does?
- No, we don't want your money, man.

223
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,157
I'm putting together a team
of people that I can trust.

224
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,658
We have a meeting tonight.
Give us a lift, I'll tell you more.

225
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:29,035
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

226
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:32,057
I thought you gave my bro a ride here.

227
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:34,432
Oh, yeah, we drove.
We got a car, but it's small.

228
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,907
I don't like small, man.
I don't like small at all.

229
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,202
- Unless it's pussy, though.
- Unless it's pussy.

230
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,746
Come on. Let's take a ride.

231
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,492
All right, come on.
Hop in.

232
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,996
So you did all the work
on this yourself, huh?

233
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:01,077
Yeah. Yeah, I did all the body work
over the last couple months.

234
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,779
- I just got her running a few weeks ago.
- Good with cars. It's good to know.

235
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:08,160
- Yeah, I'm not bad.
- This kid's the best, man.

236
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,788
He can fix 'em, he can build 'em,
he can race 'em.

237
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,195
He's too humble.

238
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,863
I also hear you did some time.

239
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,321
Yeah, Frankie told you about that?

240
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,865
- Yeah, Jimmy.
- Yeah, what can I say? I was stupid.

241
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,951
Hey, happens to the best of us.

242
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,079
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:30,408
Pull in right over there, Jimmy.

244
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:41,151
- Who works this late?
- Who asks so many questions?

245
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:44,662
Our investor owns the place.

246
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:47,995
We won't be long. 20 minutes, tops.

247
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:51,571
Hey, when we get back,

248
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,278
your ass better be right here,
you hear me?

249
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:00,951
- Frankie. Frankie.
- What? What?

250
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:02,535
I got a bad feeling about this.

251
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,404
Jimmy, come on, man,
the guy's got a red-eye to London.

252
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:08,825
If we don't do it now, we lose
our shot.  It's good. It's good.

253
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:43,118
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

254
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:22,987
- Oh, shit. Get in the car.
- What the fuck?

255
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:25,451
- Back in the fucking car!
- Get in the making car, come on.

256
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:28,156
Go, go, go-

257
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:32,279
When I say stay in the car,
you stay in the fucking car!

258
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,929
- Drive!
- Oh, shit!

259
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:36,944
Go!

260
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,788
<i>You blew the fucking guy
away for no reason, man.</i>

261
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,589
<i>What the fuck?</i>

262
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,484
Relax.
Relax, man.

263
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:44,444
- You shot that motherfucker for nothing.
- Shut the fuck up!

264
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,902
- This is fucked, bro.
- Be more like your brother, Frankie.

265
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:53,728
- Cool.
- Cool. All right. We're fucking cool, man.

266
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,563
You're complicit in this.

267
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:58,941
Welcome to the family.

268
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,279
Get rid of this car.

269
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,369
I don't think there's any way
he saw my plate.

270
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,412
Just get rid of it!

271
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:10,812
Fuck!

272
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,987
You understand me, Jimmy?

273
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,029
Look at me.
You understand me?

274
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,696
Yeah, we're good.

275
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:26,354
You kept your head.

276
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,691
Usually do.

277
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:36,071
Don't worry about the car, Jimmy.

278
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,737
You can always jack another one.

279
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,606
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,860
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

281
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:21,150
Fuck!

282
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,896
Fuck!

283
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,563
Yo, Jimmy,

284
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,601
Yo, Jimmy, come on.

285
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,399
- Fuck, Jimmy.
- Real estate, huh, motherfucker?

286
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,319
Yo, yo, man. Watch the
suit, man. Come on.

287
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:52,184
You didn't get rid of the fucking
car, man.  That's a problem.

288
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:55,894
How could you do this to me, Frankie?
I'm your fucking brother, man!

289
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:58,768
What?  It's not my fault, man.
It's not my fault.

290
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,894
You know I'm fucking this close
to putting it all behind me.

291
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,689
I'm fucking this close.
You're fucking screwing me again!

292
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,104
I didn't know they were
gonna do that shit. Come on.

293
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:09,400
The second I saw those two,
I knew they were trouble.

294
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:11,017
What the tuck's the matter with you?

295
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,626
- Open your fucking eyes!
- I talked to them.

296
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,806
- There's not gonna be any more problems.
- Oh, yeah? No more problems?

297
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,774
You're so fucking casual
about everything.

298
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:21,942
No, seriously.  You got
a fucking screw loose, man!

299
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,061
All right?

300
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:26,474
You're fucked, all right?

301
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:29,142
Jimmy, man. Come on, you can't go
anywhere right now.

302
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:29,848
Where you going?

303
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:32,020
- Yeah, no more problems?
- Come on, you can't leave.

304
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:34,520
Yeah, no more problems?
Fuck you, Frankie.

305
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:37,107
Yo, for real, man.
You can't do this.

306
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,354
- You can't do it.
- You're my brother, all right?

307
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,481
- You're supposed to look out for me.
- I am, I am.

308
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,770
You are? Fuck you.

309
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,980
- No, Jimmy, man.  Really, you can't.
- No?  Watch me.

310
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,812
- 'Cause I'm leaving.
- No, Jimmy. Jimmy, really.

311
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,143
For real.  Jimmy.

312
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,857
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
They can't know you're running.

313
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,191
They can't think you're gonna run on 'em.
Gimme that shit. Come on.

314
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:03,065
Hey, what up?
What up?

315
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,479
Taking a trip?

316
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:10,226
Oh, no, James loaned me some
shit 'cause I ain't got no shit.

317
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:13,305
You know, to where?

318
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,514
Aren't you supposed to get rid of that?

319
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,977
I was just about to do that.

320
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,480
Hey, Jimmy, why don't
you hand Sugar your keys.

321
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,972
He'll take care of it for you.

322
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,225
Yeah, you do that.

323
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:29,140
Come on, man.  You heard
him, give me the keys.

324
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:33,604
Fucking amateurs.

325
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,981
Sorry, Jimmy. It's a nice car.
I'm sorry.

326
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,684
You know,
I'm having the conversation.

327
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,763
Want to take this inside?

328
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,101
No, I'm good here.

329
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,308
It's your house.

330
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:56,730
Frankie says you need money.

331
00:29:58,136 --> 00:30:01,936
- Oh, yeah? Did he say that?
- You need money, right?

332
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:09,057
Tell him about the bank. Come on,
tell him about the bank.

333
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,520
What bank?

334
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:20,304
Yo, I'm not robbing no banks
with you guys, all right?

335
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,973
Not happening.

336
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:27,145
Take a look around, kid.
What do you see?

337
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,062
Homes being foreclosed.

338
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,430
People working two, three jobs just
to put food on the table...

339
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,349
and still drowning in debt.

340
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,436
Don't get me wrong.

341
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:42,059
This country was founded
on great ideals and principles.

342
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,803
But they've all been ruined...

343
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,678
by the banks.

344
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:51,019
Open your eyes, Jimmy.
It's the banks that are robbing you.

345
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:53,053
Word the fuck up, man!

346
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:59,391
- You know who my favorite president was?
- Who?

347
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:01,719
Thomas Jefferson.

348
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,141
Because he saw all
of this coming and tried to stop it.

349
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:08,094
He fought the banks.

350
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,806
JFK, too, and they killed him for it.

351
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:14,102
Fucked up, man. Fucked up.

352
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:19,012
The banking institution is more
dangerous than an army, he said.

353
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:25,091
He also said that every
generation needs a revolution, Jimmy.

354
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:31,101
The American Dream is just that...

355
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,844
just a fucking dream.

356
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:38,174
Deep. Shit, that's deep.

357
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:41,719
Frankie, go start the car
and tum on the AC.

358
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,092
It's too hot in this city.

359
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,680
It's nice out, bro.

360
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:59,926
Jimmy, man. Come on.
I'll be in touch.

361
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,933
Get some sleep, Jimmy.

362
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,308
But no sleepwalking.

363
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:13,389
Any problems you cause
will he very bad for your brother.

364
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:45,014
Aw, Frankie.

365
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,679
You fucking motherfucker.

366
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:53,965
You fucker.

367
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:06,012
You motherfucker.

368
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:42,717
Jimmy. Ah, Jimmy.

369
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:45,171
Come on, you done calling dinosaurs?

370
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,592
That's disgusting, man.

371
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:00,870
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

372
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,462
Sug.
What's up, Sug?

373
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:10,502
Oh, shit, look. They got all
this whip cream and shit.

374
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,337
Yo, House. Come here, man.

375
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:15,922
This is my brother, James.
He's driving and blowing shit up.

376
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:17,260
Don't fuck this up.

377
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:20,837
- You need to eat something, dude.
- What?

378
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,052
Nothing. Nothing.

379
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,546
That's like House's crew.
He's cool, he's cool.

380
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,964
I don't talk to them too much.
Yeah, they're cool.

381
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,962
- Fellas, what's up?
- Oh, shit. You remember Spoonie?

382
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,010
- From back in the day.
- We used to play ball together, man.

383
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:36,633
- Yo, Spoonie, from the Bywater..
- Boys, gather 'round.

384
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,215
What's up, man?
What's up?

385
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:46,002
War is a continuation of politics,
only by other means.

386
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,758
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

387
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,093
This is our bank.

388
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,465
This is our war.

389
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,377
And this is our plan of attack.

390
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,211
We need to create a staged distraction.

391
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,178
James will jack four cars
and blow 'em up all over

392
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,093
Central Business
District to draw out the cops.

393
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:30,504
As we enter,

394
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,130
Frankie will secure the guard
and disable the cameras.

395
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:35,756
Spoon will take out the hostages.

396
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,464
Sugar and I will grab the manager
and go for the vault.

397
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:44,462
Our window of opportunity is five minutes
after the vault unlocks automatically...

398
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:47,093
according to our source
back at the warehouse.

399
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:49,459
No risk he'll squeal.

400
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:55,666
Nevertheless, James will be
on police scanner in the van.

401
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:58,709
And, James, we'll need a
nondescript getaway van.

402
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,042
Weapons and ammo on you, House.

403
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,503
We all clear?

404
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:17,382
Yo, it's a good plan, man.

405
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,962
- It's a fucking stupid plan.
- Jimmy, come on, man.

406
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,425
We each break out with like
half a mil, man, come on.

407
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,091
Jimmy, I need this.
We both need this.

408
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:28,704
We get our life back on track.
Erase all those lost years.

409
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,045
I was on track, Frankie.
All right, now get lost.

410
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,615
Jimmy, come on, man.
Don't do this.  Don't do this!

411
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,707
- Frankie, get the fuck out of my way.
- We need this, man. You can't walk.

412
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:39,001
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Come on, man. Jimmy, please.

413
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,378
Look, you know what?
If you're gonna rob a bank, Frankie...

414
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:44,963
You fucking go in, you empty the tills,
then you run out, you fucking drive like fuck.

415
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:49,043
Nobody actually goes for the vault.
That's just in the fucking movies, bro.

416
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:54,375
Yeah, but we got the codes, bro.
We got the schedule to the time release.

417
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:57,625
- That's fucking huge.
- They fucking killed a guy for it!

418
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:02,246
- What the fuck doesn't register with you?
- I know that's bad, man. That's fucking bad.

419
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:03,914
- It is fucking bad!
- Yeah, but what can I do?

420
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,835
What can I do about it now, man?

421
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:08,964
They'll fucking kill you, bro.
They'll fucking kill you.

422
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,039
They'll kill me, man.
They'll even kill Emily.

423
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:17,044
How the fuck do they
even know about Emily?

424
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,542
What?

425
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:22,953
Yo, how the fuck do they
even know about Emily, huh?

426
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,456
- I don't know.
- Do they even fucking know about her?

427
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,585
- I may have said something about you guys.
- What the fuck did you say?

428
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,763
When I was in the joint,
I may have talked about you and Emily.

429
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:34,001
- Why the fuck are you talking about us?
- I was so happy for you.

430
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,249
Man, there's no love in there.
I was happy for you guys. I'm sorry.

431
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:40,456
- Fuck!
- Look, man, there's no way out, man.

432
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:44,858
This guy, Ray, he's like fucking...
he's like fucking Manson.

433
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:47,125
Why the fuck do you
buy into his shit, huh?

434
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:51,998
You don't know what it's like
being in there with the lifers. I fucking--

435
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:55,786
It's brutal, man.
These guys... he saved me. I owe him.

436
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:56,853
Yeah, you owe him?

437
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:59,172
Yeah, so what?
You just gonna be his little bitch now?

438
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:02,612
- What did you say?
- You gonna be his fucking little bitch now?

439
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:05,751
- Don't you fucking talking.
- Just a fucking little clown!

440
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,080
- Don't you fucking say that to me!
- A little fucking juggling clown.

441
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,945
You don't know what
I've making been through!

442
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:11,628
You don't know what I've been through!

443
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:12,981
- You don't know!
- No, I don't!

444
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:14,838
You don't fucking know,
man.  They fucked me...

445
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,790
Fucking took my swagger, Jimmy!
They took my swagger!

446
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:26,122
Fucking robbed me from me, man.
They making broke me, bro.

447
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:29,451
You don't know shit.
You don't know what I've been through.

448
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:31,707
You don't know what
I've fucking lived through.

449
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:33,286
These motherfuckers...

450
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:38,576
What happened, bro?
Tell me what happened.

451
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:45,038
What the fuck happened to you?
I want my fucking bro back, all right?

452
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,040
They fucked me, man.

453
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:57,579
They're fucked, Jimmy.
You don't know shit, man.

454
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,623
You don't know fucking shit, man!

455
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:04,125
They fucked me in the ass
with toothpaste, man!

456
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:09,038
They fucked me in the ass with toothpaste!
Bro, you don't know fucking shit!

457
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,311
- All right? They fucked me.
- They what?

458
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:14,035
This guy fucking saved me!

459
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:18,703
These guys fucking saved me.
I'm fucking be done, bro.

460
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:22,666
I swear to God, man.
I swear to God, listen to me.

461
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:26,699
They know we're only in it for a one
time deal.  They're cool with that. Okay?

462
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,366
Tuesday night, we bounce.
Okay?

463
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:33,080
We good, man. I promise you, Jimmy.
I promise you.

464
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,265
We don't have to do
anything like this again.

465
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,035
You won't have to
do anything like this.

466
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,408
Man, we don't have we're gonna...
We don't have to be like Mom!

467
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:43,079
We can have fucking options.

468
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,617
We can have fucking options!

469
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:49,333
I'm gonna get you your own shop!

470
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:52,075
You won't have to see me anymore.

471
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:56,249
You don't have to see me.

472
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,912
You just gotta trust me, Jimmy.
You gotta trust me, man.

473
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:11,953
It's not so easy, bro.

474
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:15,117
It's not so easy, Frankie.

475
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:22,332
Hey, I know it's stressful.

476
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:29,041
But what in life isn't?

477
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,991
Thought you could use a cold drink.

478
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:50,827
Hey, thanks.

479
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:08,951
I think it's gonna rain all week.

480
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,894
Hey, would you mind?
There's a ratchet over there on the table.

481
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,954
- Could you pass it to me?
- Ratchet?

482
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:17,705
Yeah, it might be in
the toolbox, actually.

483
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,705
I don't know what a ratchet looks like.

484
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,745
You know what actually?

485
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:33,117
You wanna come over here
for a second and give me a hand?

486
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:37,154
- Yeah, what do you need?
- If you could hold that right there.

487
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:40,204
- Okay.
- And just keep that good and tight.

488
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:42,496
- Here?
- Yeah. You got it?

489
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:44,532
Yeah, got it.

490
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:46,950
- Yeah, just like that.
- Okay.

491
00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:09,152
Right in here.
I'm gonna tighten this up.

492
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:15,267
- And there she goes.
- Got it?

493
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,489
- I got it. All right, thanks.
- You're welcome.

494
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:35,073
Even the rain's hot tonight.

495
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:35,823
I've heard some crazy stories
about you while you were away.

496
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:39,984
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

497
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,318
We went to school
with some bitter people.

498
00:43:47,231 --> 00:43:50,155
You mean stories like
I went to prison after Iraq?

499
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:53,399
Yeah.

500
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,365
So...

501
00:44:04,897 --> 00:44:06,023
So?

502
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,449
They said the same thing about Frankie.

503
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:14,817
Yeah, well, don't listen to 'em.

504
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:18,650
Who should I listen to?

505
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:26,865
Look, Frankie and I went traveling.

506
00:44:27,521 --> 00:44:29,398
He stayed on,
I came home.

507
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,864
That's it, end of story.

508
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:40,946
Okay.

509
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,652
So, what happened to your car?

510
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:55,775
I had to lend it to my brother.

511
00:44:56,062 --> 00:44:57,781
Frankie's back in town.

512
00:44:58,187 --> 00:45:01,066
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

513
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:05,190
Driving a car without a key.

514
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:15,146
You see, I went down to my work
this morning to grab a loner and...

515
00:45:16,145 --> 00:45:19,194
no one was around
and I couldn't find the keys and...

516
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:26,061
- I know, it looks a little bit shady.
- No, not at all.

517
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,237
I don't want to know.

518
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:15,647
Units, dispatch is available.
Do I come across clear?

519
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:31,108
Come here. Come on,
come on. Come on, come on.

520
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,650
- What are you doing, Frankie? I'm working.
- I know. I know, hey.

521
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:44,319
- I know what you're thinking.
- What are you doing with a fucking yellow--

522
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:48,977
Know why? 'Cause who would think
I stole a fucking yellow car?

523
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:51,120
- Who would steal a yellow car?
- Who would steal a yellow car?

524
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,944
Exactly.
Nobody. I'm smart.

525
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:58,939
And, if you're getting pussy and you
drive this car, you know she loves you.

526
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,936
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Frankie, I'm working, I can't.

527
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:05,523
Gotta make time, let's go.
Trust me, we gotta go.

528
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,726
All right, one second.

529
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:14,527
Hey, Burnell, cover for me.
I'll be one second.

530
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:15,976
Yeah, all right.

531
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,192
I mean, really, who steals a yellow car?

532
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,608
It goes with my green jacket.

533
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:25,732
And the brown.

534
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,643
Oh, so when I stole it,
I fucked the door up.

535
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:32,693
I'm like driving around having
to fucking hold the door.

536
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:36,180
It's a clown car, man.
This is embarrassing.

537
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:39,856
Let's just pull around the corner, we'll
jack something that's not yellow, okay?

538
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:41,775
It's called fly yellow.

539
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,392
I think the suspension
on this car's fucked.

540
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,062
Fuck, man. Everybody can't
be as good as you, bro.

541
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,021
Everybody can't take the fucking
hot rods all the fucking time.

542
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:16,690
It's easy for me to pop this shit.
Come on.

543
00:48:18,305 --> 00:48:19,477
All right.

544
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,555
What's up?

545
00:48:53,095 --> 00:48:54,597
Damn, whose funeral?

546
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:57,685
- Yours.
- Yo, what the fuck's your problem, man?

547
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,722
- You all right, Frankie?
- Yo, yo, Ray, man.

548
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:02,647
Shut the fuck up, Frankie.

549
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,428
- Like Montezuma's revenge of the mouth.
- What? I didn't say shit, man!

550
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:09,148
- Why you hitting me, man?
- Yeah, man.  What the fuck?

551
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:11,104
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

552
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,213
What the fuck was you doing
at the police station this morning?

553
00:49:13,303 --> 00:49:15,022
Yo, chill, man. Come on, man.

554
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:17,605
You think I don't know
about your little girlfriend?

555
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:19,934
You think she can't
be taken away from your life

556
00:49:20,094 --> 00:49:22,347
just as quickly as
she was brought back into it?

557
00:49:23,136 --> 00:49:25,138
So let's try this one more time.

558
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:28,998
Hold up, man!  I was dropping
her of! For work, that's it.

559
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,551
All right? I haven't said jack shit.
She doesn't know nothing. I swear to God.

560
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,930
- At the police station?
- Yeah, she just works there, that's it.

561
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:38,646
- She a cop, Frank?
- Oh, man. Nah, man, come on.

562
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,262
- She's not a cop.
- Yo, I didn't know that.

563
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,686
She's not a cop.

564
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:43,429
Is she a cop?

565
00:49:43,968 --> 00:49:44,890
Please listen to me.

566
00:49:44,968 --> 00:49:47,346
I promise you, she's not
a fucking cop, all right?

567
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,415
The fuck, man?
She ain't a cop. We cool, right?

568
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,353
- Jimmy, tell 'em.
- I promise you she's not a fucking cop.

569
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:57,096
Chill, man.
She ain't a cop. Fuck.

570
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,471
Fucking my hair all up and shit.

571
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,352
- You all right?
- Don't shoot my dick, man.

572
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,616
- You be alright, man, relax.
- Don't point that shit at my dick.

573
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,011
Come on, let's go.

574
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,346
- Come on, Jimmy.
- What the fuck, Frankie?

575
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,020
Hey, remember...

576
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:35,014
remember when you almost blew
your hand off that Fourth of July...

577
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:37,681
with that homemade
blockbuster you made?

578
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:42,100
Shit, Jimmy.
That was crazy.

579
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:46,060
Every car alarm
in the neighborhood went off.

580
00:50:46,633 --> 00:50:48,055
And you were just looking at me, right?

581
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:49,968
I remember you had
this look in your eye like...

582
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,142
you're like

583
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:56,976
like you discovered pussy or something.

584
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,226
I couldn't hear shit for a week.

585
00:51:06,341 --> 00:51:09,765
You're the one that put the sugar
in her gas tank, aren't you?

586
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:18,925
That was you.

587
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:20,486
Jimmy, come on.

588
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:23,045
You tried to set us up
so that I couldn't run.

589
00:51:24,757 --> 00:51:25,883
Jimmy.

590
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:32,305
- That was you.
- Come on, Jimmy. I wouldn't do that.

591
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,925
I swear, Jimmy.

592
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,264
I didn't know they were gonna do that.
I didn't know, man.

593
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:42,055
I know, it's not nice.
I know.

594
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:43,825
But it's smart though, right?

595
00:51:43,922 --> 00:51:48,348
They needed someone close to you
to get to that you cared about, right? So...

596
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:55,848
Anyway, look, hey,
it's a good thing, no?

597
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,054
I like that girl.
Nothing's gonna happen.

598
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,928
Some fucking brother I got.

599
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:12,046
You're a fucking piece of work, Frankie.
You know that?

600
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:17,515
I'm done eating.

601
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:21,089
I'm done.

602
00:52:28,129 --> 00:52:30,223
You remember when Dad went away?

603
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:35,848
Do you? You were young.

604
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:43,015
Do you remember how Mom fell apart?

605
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:47,841
- What the fuck?
- We had nothing!

606
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,760
No one to come to!

607
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:57,509
I remember that shit.

608
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:03,431
I remember I came home,
I found you locked out of the house...

609
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:06,006
'cause Mom had a fucking nigger over.

610
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,346
And you were filthy.

611
00:53:16,253 --> 00:53:19,552
And I cleaned you up.
I fed you.

612
00:53:22,877 --> 00:53:25,926
I stole everything for us, Jimmy.

613
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:32,381
Everything, man.
I stole everything for us.

614
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,627
All your gear,
your first set of tools.

615
00:53:39,002 --> 00:53:42,961
Yeah, I made mistakes,
I'm a piece of shit.

616
00:53:43,377 --> 00:53:45,880
What can I say?
I'm human.

617
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:49,088
But I always looked out
for my little brother...

618
00:53:49,335 --> 00:53:51,678
to the best of my abilities...

619
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:55,172
even if they were somewhat impaired.

620
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:02,428
It was always me
and you against the world.

621
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,261
Me and you...

622
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,382
against the world.

623
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,086
Me and you, Frankie.

624
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:20,090
It was me and you.

625
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,927
I'm gonna go take a piss.

626
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,425
Yo, Frankie.

627
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,005
Yeah?

628
00:54:48,624 --> 00:54:51,377
You ever wonder what life
would be like if...

629
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:55,628
if you never pulled the trigger
on that cop 10 years ago?

630
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,917
But I did, Jimmy.

631
00:55:05,957 --> 00:55:07,004
But I did.

632
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,091
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

633
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:49,006
I think we should check out
this new place in the Bywater.

634
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:51,591
I was just reading about it.
What do you think?

635
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:56,423
Something's wrong.

636
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:07,226
I just wanted to let you know
that your car is good to go.

637
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:15,975
Okay come on, what's wrong?

638
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,633
Look... this last week.

639
00:56:25,142 --> 00:56:28,142
You know, the time
that we've had...

640
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,016
it's been a mistake.

641
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:46,474
Yeah, of course, I was...

642
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,830
No, you are absolutely right.

643
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:54,933
It's stupid trying to recreate something
that never existed to begin with.

644
00:56:54,934 --> 00:56:55,634
Because it didn't.  It...

645
00:56:55,724 --> 00:56:58,323
- I'm agreeing with you.
- Emily, I...

646
00:56:58,324 --> 00:57:00,742
- How much do I owe you?
- Emily, listen to me...

647
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:04,074
No, no, no. This is about business. This
is about you fixing my car.  So let me...

648
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:06,890
Look, I don't want your
fucking money, alright?

649
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:11,223
I'm sorry, it's just...

650
00:57:12,473 --> 00:57:14,606
- I care about you and I...

651
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:16,918
- I can't explain things the way that makes sense.
-Obviously not.

652
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:19,804
You can't.  I understand
perfectly.  Thank you.

653
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:21,735
I'm leaving town.

654
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:25,473
When?

655
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:34,097
- Tomorrow.
-  You and your brother traveling again?

656
00:57:46,305 --> 00:57:50,489
- Well don't.  I don't.
- Okay so look, I'll put my name here.

657
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:55,138
You gotta understand that
if things were different that...

658
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,638
If I could just explain things to
you, I wish I can make things...

659
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:03,255
Okay, I don't want to do this.
Okay, please.  Spare me.

660
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,763
Go, James.

661
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:12,988
Look I just... I care
about you, you know?

662
00:58:13,113 --> 00:58:16,346
I get that.
You still go.

663
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:22,179
Right. So go.
Go!

664
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:24,596
Alright.  Alright.
I'll leave you alone.

665
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:31,052
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

666
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,382
- Yo, I'm going to light you up.
- You missed. You missed.

667
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:02,590
Ain't missing with this, bitch.

668
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:19,798
- Emily, I'm going for coffee? You want one?
- No, I'm already on my second.

669
01:01:21,256 --> 01:01:24,756
<i>An explosion in Greenpoint.
Send reinforcements.</i>

670
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:29,297
- Unit 31, could you please repeat?
- We got explosion at Greenpoint.

671
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:05,473
I need units to respond to alarms at

672
01:02:05,494 --> 01:02:08,744
St. Charles and Jackson and in the Quarter
at Ursulines and Chartres.

673
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:11,833
<i>We have an MVA with a tour bus</i>

674
01:02:11,868 --> 01:02:13,703
I'm sorry, unit 61, could
you please repeat?

675
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,403
Did you say, a tour bus and
three chained vehicles?

676
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:46,241
Copy that.  Another explosion
reported by city parks.  A car bomb.

677
01:02:46,899 --> 01:02:49,152
Looks like it's gonna
be a busy morning.

678
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:02,025
Looks like it's gonna rain.

679
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:00,485
Nobody fucking move!

680
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,177
Nobody fucking move. Or
I'll show you your fucking insides.

681
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:06,400
- Come on, get down!
- Down, motherfucker! Down!

682
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:07,984
No phone calls, bitch!

683
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:10,115
You! Down! Down!

684
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:12,527
Hands, ladies!
Show us your fucking hands?

685
01:04:12,604 --> 01:04:14,982
- Against the fucking wall!
- Let's go, ladies. Out the back.

686
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:16,614
Get the fuck down!

687
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,469
- Let's go! Move it, move it, move it!
- Give me your cell phones!

688
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:22,894
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.

689
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:27,106
- Everybody listen up!
- Take a deep breath and relax!

690
01:04:27,187 --> 01:04:30,441
We're here to rob the bank, not you.

691
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:34,829
In the five minutes we spend here, the
CEO of this bank will make more money...

692
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,781
off of all of you than we take from him.

693
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,570
Banks have become an invisible
threat to our democracy.

694
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:43,313
<i>So consider this...</i>

695
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:49,186
justice.
Don't be a hero!

696
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:52,986
Don't.  Look away.
Look away!

697
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,277
- The vault, now!
- Get the fuck up! Now!

698
01:05:01,352 --> 01:05:03,980
- I can't open the vault.
- Man, get outta here. Let's go.

699
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:06,859
Get down, get down. Get down,
motherfucker, get down!

700
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,062
Move your fat fucking ass! Go!

701
01:05:16,852 --> 01:05:19,070
Open that gate.
Get it open!

702
01:05:19,227 --> 01:05:21,755
Look, it's not gonna work.
Even if I give you the code...

703
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,354
this thing only opens
at predetermined times.

704
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:26,070
- Just enter the fucking code.
- It's not gonna work!

705
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:30,735
I'll only say it one more time.
Enter the code.

706
01:05:36,351 --> 01:05:37,898
Fuck you.

707
01:05:55,642 --> 01:05:58,065
Thanks a lot, man.
You've been a lot of help.

708
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:06,646
Nice.

709
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:09,018
<i>Bags.</i>

710
01:07:21,306 --> 01:07:24,480
Oh, shit! Fuck, man.
I think somebody saw me!

711
01:07:24,556 --> 01:07:26,058
Fuck! Shit!

712
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:28,299
What a fucking dumb ass!
Let's get the truck outta here!

713
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:29,641
What the fuck you looking at?

714
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:32,187
Just stop fucking twitching or I'm gonna
blow your-fucking head off. Look down!

715
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:35,191
- Yo, she's probably calling the fucking cops.
- Get your shit together!

716
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:38,468
- What are we gonna do? We gotta go!
- Calm down. What the fuck time is it?

717
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,813
- Shit.  How many minutes ago.
- About 2 minutes.

718
01:07:40,814 --> 01:07:42,048
- Where the fuck you going?
- Two fucking minutes!

719
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:43,634
Then we'd be out of here, my man.
- Where the fuck you going, man?

720
01:07:43,672 --> 01:07:44,598
Fuck!

721
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:47,089
Okay, and how many did you see?

722
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,478
<i>There was one inside
the bank and he had a mask,</i>

723
01:07:49,555 --> 01:07:51,228
<i>and I think he had a gun, too.</i>

724
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:54,250
David-four, possible
armed robbery in progress.

725
01:07:54,254 --> 01:07:57,228
4140 Canal Street, Mid-City.
Do you copy?

726
01:07:57,554 --> 01:07:59,397
<i>Roger, that.
We'll check it out.</i>

727
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:08,831
Hey, yo, time's up, man.
We gotta go.

728
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:11,958
We got 30 seconds, come on!
Help him. Hold his bag!

729
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,455
- Grab his bag, come on.
- Hurry up, though. Hurry up, come on.

730
01:08:14,512 --> 01:08:17,506
We gotta go, come on!
Man, that's a lot of fucking dough.

731
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:18,687
Yeah, baby!

732
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,459
Yo, cops are coming, man.
We gotta go!

733
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:32,726
Ah, man, this is not good.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

734
01:08:32,803 --> 01:08:33,770
Where is everybody?

735
01:08:33,928 --> 01:08:36,431
In the fucking vault!  They been there
forever!  Where the fuck you going?

736
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,856
Where you going?
Get back in the fucking van!

737
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:41,772
- Get back in the fucking van!
- Calm the fuck down, all right?

738
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:44,762
Fuck!

739
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,847
It's fucking crazy.
Gonna start killing!

740
01:08:51,052 --> 01:08:53,431
That's good. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

741
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:56,430
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!
- Yeah, we gotta go!

742
01:08:56,552 --> 01:09:00,056
We gotta go now! Come on!
Yo, leave it!

743
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:05,059
Yo, Spoonie.
Where the fuck is Spoonie?

744
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,932
Spoonie!

745
01:09:08,469 --> 01:09:10,812
Where the fuck is Spoonie, man?

746
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:13,789
Oh, shit!  Five-O, five-O!
Get the fuck away from the windows!

747
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:16,914
- Hey! What the fuck is that?
- That was just our fucking van!

748
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,059
- Yo, he's gone, bro!
- Jimmy!

749
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:05,054
Confirmed armed robbery in progress
at the Canal Street Savings Bank.

750
01:10:05,216 --> 01:10:08,060
Shots have been fired.
All available units respond.

751
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:11,013
Get the fuck down!

752
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:32,800
Motherfucker!

753
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:47,929
Fuck!

754
01:10:49,007 --> 01:10:50,008
You all right?

755
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:55,972
Frankie!
Are you hit?

756
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,884
Oh, shit. Jimmy.

757
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:04,849
Oh, shit!

758
01:11:11,797 --> 01:11:12,844
Oh, shit!

759
01:11:15,797 --> 01:11:16,923
Fuck!

760
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,008
All right, listen up!

761
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:22,425
We have to adapt
to a changing situation.

762
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:24,591
- New game plan.
- Game plan?

763
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:27,468
Spoonie ran off with his bitch-ass
with our motherfucking getaway truck!

764
01:11:27,672 --> 01:11:29,470
We still have the advantage, Sugar.

765
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:33,844
These are first response city cops!
They have handguns and shotguns.

766
01:11:34,255 --> 01:11:36,508
We have machine guns
and the high ground.

767
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:38,716
But we gotta move
before they improve their position.

768
01:11:38,838 --> 01:11:42,217
Ray, man, I'm fucking bleeding, man!
I'm fucking bleeding!

769
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:44,424
There is no other option, Frankie!

770
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,614
Now listen to me.
We need another getaway car.

771
01:11:48,713 --> 01:11:51,466
That's our only way out of here.
James!

772
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:54,754
You got to get to the side entrance
and jack us another car!

773
01:11:55,129 --> 01:11:57,599
- Hang in there, Frankie!
- Frankie, listen to me.

774
01:11:58,004 --> 01:12:00,507
- We're gonna get outta here.
- We need collateral!

775
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:03,678
Sugar, cover me. Go!

776
01:12:06,212 --> 01:12:08,931
- What's your name? What's your name?
- Katie.

777
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:11,164
All right, Katie.
You be cool, you live.

778
01:12:11,254 --> 01:12:13,097
You freak out on me, you die.

779
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,547
Got it? Let's go!

780
01:12:15,045 --> 01:12:16,262
Come on, James!

781
01:12:18,503 --> 01:12:20,222
Come on, James, now's our break!

782
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:22,590
- Get up, man.
- Frankie, we're gonna get out of here.

783
01:12:22,712 --> 01:12:23,883
Go with Sugar, okay?

784
01:12:25,836 --> 01:12:28,885
Get up, man, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man!

785
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:59,493
- Come on, Frankie, get up!
- I'm bleeding out, man.

786
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:01,007
We gotta go, man!

787
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:04,587
Fuck, dude.

788
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:27,971
Get in the car!
Go, go, go, go, go!

789
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:31,674
- Drive!
- Where's Frankie?

790
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:32,843
- Go, go, go, go!
- Where the fuck's Frankie?

791
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:36,543
Frankie's as good as dead, James.
Let's go! Let's get the fuck outta here!

792
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,841
What the fuck are you doing?
Go, go!

793
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,627
I'm not leaving without Frankie!

794
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:00,003
- Come on! Go, move!
- Shit!

795
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:01,960
I got you covered. Go!

796
01:14:27,915 --> 01:14:29,132
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

797
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:33,215
<i>Gunfire's been exchanged with at least
two suspects trying to escape the Bank.</i>

798
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,372
<i>Looks like some assailants
are still inside holding hostages.</i>

799
01:14:36,373 --> 01:14:38,877
<i>What we don't know is exactly how--</i>

800
01:14:53,748 --> 01:14:54,795
Frankie.

801
01:15:06,122 --> 01:15:07,749
I'm sorry.

802
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:17,966
What the fuck are you doing?

803
01:15:19,455 --> 01:15:21,253
I'm bleeding out.

804
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:22,874
I'm bleeding out.

805
01:15:29,205 --> 01:15:32,664
All right,
I'm gonna take a look, all right?

806
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:36,460
Okay?

807
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:45,667
Shit.

808
01:15:55,787 --> 01:15:57,915
All right, it's not that bad.

809
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:02,957
We gotta stop this bleeding though.

810
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:14,288
All right...

811
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:18,502
Let's get you fixed up
and get the fuck out of here.

812
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,667
All right?

813
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:26,587
I'm gonna go get some supplies.

814
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:29,172
I'll be right back.
We'll get you all fixed up, all right?

815
01:16:31,994 --> 01:16:33,996
All right, I'll book it.
Keep going!

816
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:35,959
Go! Go!

817
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:38,896
Sugar!

818
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:40,291
Motherfucker!

819
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,868
Yo! Hey, lady. Lady.
Come here, get up.

820
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:14,245
All right, I'm trying to get up.

821
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,912
- Get up. Don't worry.
- Shit!

822
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:18,457
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
hurt you, all right?  Come on.

823
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,502
Come on.
Come in here.

824
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:23,915
Get the fuck back!

825
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,161
Tell your guys to get the fuck back!

826
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,916
All right?
I got hostages in here!

827
01:17:28,992 --> 01:17:31,541
I'm gonna start throwing
bodies out the window!

828
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:34,995
<i>We're standing down.
Stand down!</i>

829
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:39,452
This is Captain Sullivan speaking.
Is everybody all right in there?

830
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:40,955
What do you think!

831
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:44,079
Do you need anything?
Do you need medical assistance?

832
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:48,042
No! Just get your fucking guys
the fuck away from this bank!

833
01:17:49,075 --> 01:17:51,453
I'm gonna start fucking
murdering people, all right?

834
01:17:51,575 --> 01:17:54,854
Okay, I'm here to help you.

835
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,293
Son, you tell me what you want.

836
01:17:57,366 --> 01:18:01,749
I just want... you know what?  I
want to talk to a real fucking negotiator,

837
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:03,871
all right, Captain Whatever
-the-fuck-your-name-is!

838
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:06,953
Okay, son. He's been contacted.
He's en route.

839
01:18:07,074 --> 01:18:08,792
<i>Negotiator's on the way.</i>

840
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:09,999
All right.

841
01:18:10,574 --> 01:18:13,327
Just stay the fuck off
from this fucking bank!

842
01:18:13,616 --> 01:18:14,868
Come on, ma'am.

843
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,993
All right, you did good.

844
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:21,495
You did good.
Thank you very much. You did good.

845
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:24,773
Yo, I need a first aid kit.
Where the fuck's the first aid kit here?

846
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:27,914
Somebody, where the fuck
is the first aid kit in here?

847
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:37,289
<i>Okay, Central,
I've got eyes on the suspect.</i>

848
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:40,000
He's on foot heading
north on Royal Street.

849
01:19:01,656 --> 01:19:02,682
What the...?

850
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,973
Ah, fuck!

851
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:21,039
Mother motherfucker!

852
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,862
- Okay, last one. All right.
- Holy...

853
01:19:24,863 --> 01:19:26,360
- Take a deep breath.
- Do it.

854
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:29,126
My God!

855
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:31,994
All right.
All right.

856
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,911
- All right, good as new.
- Oh, God.

857
01:19:52,046 --> 01:19:53,012
Come here.

858
01:19:53,987 --> 01:19:56,911
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Come here.

859
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,949
Oh shit. Oh, shit, Jimmy.

860
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:03,700
Oh, shit. Jimmy.
What are we gonna do?

861
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:05,780
What are we gonna do?

862
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:09,240
We're gonna wait for
the negotiator to show up.

863
01:20:11,986 --> 01:20:16,697
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.

864
01:20:18,903 --> 01:20:21,372
We can't shoot our way outta here, bro.

865
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:26,736
I'm not going back.
You hear me?

866
01:20:26,744 --> 01:20:29,663
- I'm not going back. Think of something.
- Yeah, all right. I know.

867
01:20:29,736 --> 01:20:31,238
- No, you gotta think of something.
- I know.

868
01:20:31,944 --> 01:20:34,447
- Come up with something.
- I know, all right?

869
01:20:36,027 --> 01:20:40,328
They're wolves in there, Jimmy.
They're wolves in there.

870
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,029
I can't go back.

871
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:49,696
All right.  You just got
to do what I say, okay?

872
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:52,994
Gotta do what I say.

873
01:20:58,693 --> 01:20:59,615
Fuck!

874
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:15,655
...invested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

875
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:22,530
Get back!  I got a hostage!
I'll kill her!  I'll kill her!

876
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:25,990
Step back! You! You!

877
01:21:27,484 --> 01:21:28,781
Back!

878
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:49,318
Freeze!

879
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:55,202
<i>Target down!</i>

880
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:06,193
All right!

881
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:08,576
All right!

882
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:13,528
You put down your guns,
I'll let y'all live!

883
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:22,068
All right,
I ain't going warn you no more!

884
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:23,570
This is it!

885
01:23:08,605 --> 01:23:10,027
Jimmy.

886
01:23:11,022 --> 01:23:12,774
Yeah, Frankie?

887
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,903
I'm just a thief.

888
01:23:19,021 --> 01:23:20,568
All my life...

889
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,528
nothing but a thief.

890
01:23:27,854 --> 01:23:30,528
And I stole from you.

891
01:23:36,771 --> 01:23:39,445
I stole from you, bro.

892
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:46,280
Look at me.

893
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,772
Do you forgive me, Jimmy?

894
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:02,023
You're my brother, Frankie.

895
01:24:08,436 --> 01:24:09,938
I love you.

896
01:24:19,936 --> 01:24:22,655
I love you, too, man.

897
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:27,028
I love you, too.

898
01:24:36,894 --> 01:24:37,985
Well, what the...

899
01:24:53,143 --> 01:24:54,440
You!

900
01:24:56,143 --> 01:24:57,395
You!

901
01:25:00,393 --> 01:25:01,484
Come here.

902
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:15,518
Come here.

903
01:25:25,559 --> 01:25:27,436
Jimmy, wake up.

904
01:25:28,517 --> 01:25:32,192
You gotta get up.
Get up.  Get up.

905
01:25:37,642 --> 01:25:39,019
Jimmy.

906
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:45,815
- I gotta do it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

907
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,734
I gotta do it, Jimmy.

908
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:58,939
Oh, shit, Frankie.

909
01:26:57,722 --> 01:26:58,940
Shit, Jimmy.

910
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:45,597
All right, easy, easy, easy.
We got you We got you.

911
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:48,803
Okay, just hang tight.
Hang tight.

912
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,162
Hang tight.
Let's get you undone here.

913
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,433
I'm gonna take care of you, sir.
All right.

914
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,624
Come in!
The hostage I was working on...

915
01:29:39,716 --> 01:29:43,095
<i>is not a hostage!
I repeat, he is not a hostage!</i>

916
01:29:44,591 --> 01:29:49,176
<i>He's headed north on Carondelet.
He's on foot. Do you copy?</i>

917
01:29:52,799 --> 01:29:54,551
Yeah, roger that.

918
01:30:08,549 --> 01:30:11,428
- Hey... Emily!
- I can't.

2
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,325
January 11th at 2:30 p. m...

3
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,703
Um, you'll do your statement
separately. This one's ours.

4
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,707
Following a verbal dispute
in Brooklyn Bridge Park,

5
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,462
Zachary Cowan, age 11,
and armed with a stick,

6
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,800
struck our son,
Ethan Longstreet, in the face.

7
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:58,429
In addition to the swelling
and bruising of Ethan's upper lip,

8
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,559
this act also resulted in
two broken incisors,

9
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:06,688
including nerve damage
to the right incisor.

10
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,439
"Armed"?

11
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,359
Armed. What...?
You don't like "armed"?

12
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,612
Um, Michael, what could we say?
"Carrying"? "Holding"?

13
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,906
Carrying a stick? All right?
Carrying, yeah.

14
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,242
Carrying a stick. Heh, heh.
Carrying.

15
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,912
It's ironic.

16
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,666
I always thought Brooklyn Bridge Park
was so safe compared to Hillside.

17
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,169
True. We always said, "Brooklyn
Bridge Park, fine. Hillside, no way."

18
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,754
Mm-hm.

19
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,632
It just goes to show you.
Thank you.

20
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,759
Hey, thank you so much
for coming.

21
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:42,223
It's so much better than getting caught
up in that adversarial mind-set.

22
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,559
Well, we thank you.
Really.

23
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,478
Well, I don't think there's any
reason for us to thank each other.

24
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,857
Luckily, some of us still have
a sense of community. Right?

25
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,443
Though the kids haven't got
that notion straight yet.

26
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,112
Right.
I mean our kid.

27
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,990
Right, our kid.

28
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:04,579
Thank you.

29
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,623
Those tulips are gorgeous.

30
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,209
Oh, it's the florist up by Henry.
You know the one? All the way up.

31
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,461
Oh, right.

32
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,796
Yeah. They fly the bulbs
right in from Holland.

33
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,465
Twenty dollars
for a whole bunch.

34
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:16,674
Is that a fact?

35
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,968
Yeah. Do you know it?
All the way up.

36
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,179
Right. Right.

37
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:25,183
Well... So, what about the
tooth with the damaged nerve?

38
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,393
Well, we don't know yet.

39
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,064
There's some question about the prognosis.
Apparently, uh...

40
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,025
Well, apparently the nerve
is not completely exposed.

41
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,028
Only part of it is exposed.
There's a part that's exposed

42
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,530
and then there's a part
that's still protected.

43
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,574
For now, they're not
gonna devitalize it.

44
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,409
They wanna give the tooth
a chance.

45
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,495
Yeah. We'd so love
to avoid a root canal.

46
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,788
Oh, of course.

47
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:50,333
There's an observation period
while they give the nerve a chance to heal.

48
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,668
He's gonna need caps.

49
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,212
You can't have implants till you're 18.
You can't.

50
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,382
Yeah, so, uh, they can only do
implants once they're done growing.

51
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,716
Naturally.

52
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,970
Well, we... We hope
it all turns out all right.

53
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,930
One can only hope.

54
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,765
Listen, um...

55
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:09,310
He didn't wanna tell
on Zachary.

56
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,229
No, he didn't wanna tell.

57
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:17,944
It was incredible to see this child
with no face left, no teeth.

58
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,280
He just wouldn't talk.
Mm, I can just imagine.

59
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,784
He didn't wanna tell on the kid.
His friends would say he's a snitch.

60
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,453
Let's face it, Penny,
it wasn't just a sense of honour.

61
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,623
Well, you could say that.
Honour requires a social context.

62
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,793
So how did you finally get
Zachary's name?

63
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,212
Well, because
we explained to Ethan

64
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,132
that protecting this child
was not gonna help him.

65
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,011
We told him if this kid thinks he can get
away with hitting, why should he stop?

66
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,847
We told him if we were this child's
parents, we would wanna know.

67
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,851
Of course.
Yeah. Excuse me one second.

68
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,310
- Yes, Walter.
<i>- Alan.</i>

69
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,604
Well, thanks
for getting back to me.

70
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,191
It's in this morning's Journal.
I'll read it to you.

71
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,445
"According to a study published
by British journal Lancet,"

72
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,532
two Australian researchers have
identified neurological side effects

73
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,744
of TW Pharma's
anti-hypertension medication Antril,

74
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,663
"including impaired hearing
and ataxia."

75
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,540
<i>How come nobody
told me about this?</i>

76
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,751
Who does your
press monitoring over there?

77
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,253
<i>This is gonna mean trouble.
You're in deep shit.</i>

78
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,505
<i>What do we do?
Do we move on this right away?</i>

79
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,507
No, no. My problem is the ASM.

80
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,343
You got an annual stockholders'
meeting in two weeks.

81
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,679
Did you schedule
a contingency for litigation?

82
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,973
<i>I'm not sure. I have to check.</i>

83
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,892
Walter. Walter.
Yeah?

84
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:34,395
Talk to PR. Find out if it was picked
up anywhere else and call me back.

85
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,564
<i>Right.</i>
Okay.

86
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,567
Sorry.
So you're, like, uh...

87
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,277
An attorney.

88
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,280
And yourself?
Housewares supply.

89
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,824
Penny's a writer.
She works part-time in a bookstore.

90
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,576
Mostly art books
and history books.

91
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:49,744
A writer?

92
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,414
Well, I cowrote a volume
on Sabaean civilization,

93
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,750
working with artefacts
that were retrieved

94
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,919
after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict.

95
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:01,506
But, um, right now I'm working on
a book about the Darfur tragedy.

96
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,674
Do you specialise in Africa?

97
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,260
I'm interested in
that part of the world, yes.

98
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,262
And do you have
any other children?

99
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,847
There's Courtney. She's 9.

100
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,308
She's very angry
with her father right now

101
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,353
because he got rid
of the hamster last night.

102
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,563
You got rid of the hamster?

103
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,983
Yeah. Heh. The thing was
making such a racket at night.

104
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,196
They sleep during the day.
It was driving Ethan crazy, so...

105
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:29,117
You know, he couldn't take the
racket that thing was making. Yeah.

106
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,538
I don't mind telling you, I've been wanting
to get rid of the thing for the longest time.

107
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,874
Finally I said, "That's it!"
Took it out, left it on the street.

108
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,292
You left it on the street?

109
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,336
I figured it was
a gutter-sewer animal,

110
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,714
but the thing was scared out
of its wits out there on the sidewalk.

111
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,675
They're not pets
and they're not wild.

112
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,927
You drop them in the forest,
still not happy.

113
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,304
I don't know where
you're supposed to put them.

114
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,181
So you just left him outside?

115
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,808
Yeah, he did.

116
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,686
He tried to convince Courtney
that the hamster ran away,

117
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,688
which of course,
she was not buying.

118
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,565
And this morning
the hamster was gone?

119
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,732
Gone.

120
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,861
What about you?
What do you do for a living?

121
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,321
Oh, I'm an investment broker.

122
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,241
Ah. Uh... Um...

123
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:13,578
Let me... I'm just gonna
ask this directly.

124
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,831
Uh, could Zachary
apologise to Ethan?

125
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,917
Sure. It would be good
if they talked.

126
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,044
No, he's got to apologise, Alan.

127
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,213
He has to actually say
he's sorry.

128
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,132
Yeah, probably.
Well, is he sorry?

129
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,134
He doesn't realise
how serious it was.

130
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,261
He's 11 years old.

131
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,096
Well, 11's not a baby.

132
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,098
Well, it's not an adult either.

133
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,851
We forgot to ask you guys,
you want some coffee or tea?

134
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:40,730
Is there any of that cobbler left,
Penny? She makes a mean cobbler.

135
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,815
- You got espresso?
- We do.

136
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,651
I wouldn't mind a cup.
Glass of water.

137
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,322
Yeah. I'll take an espresso too, babe.
And bring the cobbler. Come on in.

138
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,121
Please. Please.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

139
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:00,249
I didn't mean to rush
you out. Here. Here.

140
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,043
Thank you.
Yeah.

141
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,961
Yeah.
Thanks.

142
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,678
You gotta taste this cobbler.

143
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,139
Where's the cobbler?

144
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,689
She put the cobbler
in the fridge again.

145
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,901
I don't know what language I'm
supposed to speak to that woman in.

146
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,071
Nice couple.

147
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:31,906
Very.

148
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,450
They're nice, right?

149
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,661
Do you tell everybody
I'm a writer?

150
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,996
You are a writer.
You wrote a book.

151
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,544
Good cobbler is not easy
to make.

152
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,257
What do you sell?

153
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,928
Decorative hardware.
Door locks, handles, copper fittings and...

154
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,304
That's...
Thank you.

155
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,933
And kitchen equipment.
Pots and pans. Yeah.

156
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,726
Is that a good living?

157
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,188
You know, it's not like we had
any banner years or anything.

158
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,815
It was tough starting out.

159
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:08,818
As long as I'm out there every
morning with my sample case

160
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,528
and my catalogue,
it's a living.

161
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:14,573
Although the cast-iron roasting pans
do pick up around the holidays.

162
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,866
Yeah.

163
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,619
When you saw that
a hamster was terrified,

164
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,454
why didn't you bring it home?

165
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,915
Because I don't touch
those things.

166
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,959
You put it on the sidewalk.

167
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,253
It was in a cage,
so I flipped it on its side.

168
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,422
There's no way
I'm touching those things.

169
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,507
Sugar?
No sugar.

170
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,884
What kind of cobbler
did you make?

171
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,803
Apple and pear.

172
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,388
Apple and pear?

173
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,683
Yeah. It's, you know...
It's a little recipe of mine.

174
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,893
But it's a shame it's cold.

175
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,437
Apple and pear.

176
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,188
That's new to me.

177
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,734
Apple and pear is a classic.
Of course, there's a twist to it.

178
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,943
Oh, really?

179
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,572
You have to cut the pears thicker than
the apples because they cook faster.

180
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,198
Oh, right.

181
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,201
She's not telling you the real secret.
Heh, heh. Let them taste it.

182
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,621
Very good. Very good.
Mm.

183
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,374
Delicious.
Gingerbread crumbs.

184
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,293
Oh, my God.

185
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,338
Well, it's really just a
souped-up, old-school recipe.

186
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,839
His mother gave me the idea.

187
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:15,259
Gingerbread. Fantastic.

188
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:19,388
At least we get a new recipe
out of this, right? Heh-heh-heh.

189
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,516
I wish my son didn't have to
lose two teeth in the process.

190
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,101
Right. That's what I meant.

191
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,020
You have a novel way
of expressing it.

192
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,357
No, hey, I, uh... Excuse me.

193
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,858
Yeah, Walter.

194
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,739
No. No, no.
No letters to the editor.

195
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,993
You'll just fan the flames.

196
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,830
- Well, was it scheduled?
- No.

197
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,540
<i>We decided to let it go.</i>

198
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,543
What are these disorders anyway?
What is ataxia?

199
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,214
<i>It's lack of balance
and unsteady or jerky gait.</i>

200
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,717
In normal <i>doses?
In normal doses, rarely.</i>

201
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,845
How long have you known this?
Two years, two and a half years.

202
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,139
And in all that time,
you haven't recalled it?

203
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,474
<i>You're joking, right?</i>

204
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,518
What are we talking
about in revenues?

205
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,938
Oh. Oh, I see.

206
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,691
Okay.

207
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,445
Ahem. Al.

208
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,115
- We're all waiting for you.
- Yeah, right.

209
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,658
One second.

210
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,744
<i>- Dennis?
- Did you talk to him?</i>

211
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,414
They've known about the risks
for two and a half years.

212
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707
<i>- Jesus!</i>
- Yeah.

213
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,252
An internal report.

214
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,506
But the undesirable side effects
are not established.

215
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,758
No precautionary measures.

216
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,761
They didn't schedule a reserve.
Nothing in the annual report.

217
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,556
<i>I can't believe it.
What are the symptoms?</i>

218
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,642
Lack of balance, jerky gait.
The works.

219
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,936
Basically, you look like
you're drunk.

220
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:56,569
Roughly half a billion in revenues.

221
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,656
<i>You there?
Yeah. What'd you advise him to do?</i>

222
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,284
Well, deny.
Of course.

223
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:07,746
That dumb shit wanted us to write a letter to the editor.
No way we're writing a letter.

224
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,375
On the other hand, if we see
this is getting picked up,

225
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,419
we could do a press release,

226
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:17,756
like "somebody's spreading false rumours
two weeks out from the ASM" kind of thing.

227
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,426
<i>Want me to broach it with him?
No, he's</i> calling back.

228
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,636
<i>We'll talk and then work
on a press release.</i>

229
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,138
Okay.

230
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,268
I've been so busy,
I hardly had time for lunch.

231
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:32,855
Oh, help yourself.
Help yourself. Here.

232
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,441
Here.
Thanks.

233
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,277
No, no.
Go on. Go on.

234
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,905
I know I have no manners.

235
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,448
Where were we?

236
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,657
We were saying

237
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,077
it would have been so much nicer
if we'd met some other way.

238
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,287
This cobbler, right.

239
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,164
- So your mother, huh?
- His mother.

240
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,249
It's my mother's recipe.
Pen made it.

241
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,835
Your mother doesn't use
apples and pears.

242
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,128
No.

243
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,589
She's about to have
an operation. Poor thing.

244
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,799
- Oh, really? What for?
- Her knee.

245
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,845
She's gonna get a polyethylene
and metallic prosthesis.

246
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,807
And she's all worried about what's gonna
be left of it after the cremation.

247
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,601
Michael, don't be mean.

248
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,937
She doesn't wanna
be buried next to my father.

249
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,105
She wants to be cremated
and put upstate

250
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,233
next to her mother
who's all alone.

251
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,362
Couple of urns jabbering away
on the shores of Lake Sebago.

252
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:28,452
Um, we're very touched by
how generous you're being.

253
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,288
We realise how you're trying
to smooth things out here

254
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,791
instead of making them worse.

255
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,668
Please. It's the least we can do.

256
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,378
Yeah.

257
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:41,966
No, come on. I mean, so many
parents just take their kid's side,

258
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,468
acting like children themselves.

259
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,679
If Ethan had broken
two of Zachary's teeth,

260
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,515
Alan and I might have had
more of a knee-jerk reaction.

261
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,767
I'm not sure we would
see the big picture.

262
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,310
Sure you would.

263
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,604
She's right. I'm not so sure.
You would.

264
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:59,066
Because we all know this could have
happened the other way around.

265
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,610
What does Zachary say
about this?

266
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,572
How...? How...?
How is he experiencing it?

267
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,658
Oh, he doesn't talk much.
A little overwhelmed, I guess

268
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,119
But he realises that
he disfigured his schoolmate?

269
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:14,582
No. No, he doesn't realise
that he disfigured his schoolmate.

270
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,417
Why do you say that?

271
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,210
Of course Zachary realises.

272
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,130
He realises that this violent
behaviour is unacceptable,

273
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,215
not that he disfigured
his schoolmate.

274
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,843
You don't like the word,
but the word is appropriate.

275
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,095
My son did not disfigure
your son.

276
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,847
Your son disfigured our son.

277
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,683
Come back after school.
Look at his mouth, his teeth.

278
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,101
Momentarily disfigured.

279
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,604
His mouth will be fine
when the swelling goes down.

280
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,024
As for the teeth, we'd be willing
to chip in for the best dental care.

281
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,233
We've got insurance.

282
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,569
What we want
is for the boys to patch it up,

283
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,863
make sure nothing like this
happens again.

284
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,323
Let's set up a meeting.

285
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,825
Yeah, exactly.
Should we be there?

286
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,578
They don't need coaching.
Let them work it out like men.

287
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,580
Like men.
Alan, don't be ridiculous.

288
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,082
On the other hand,
maybe we don't need to be there.

289
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,335
Maybe it's better
if we weren't there, right?

290
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,463
The issue is not whether we're
there or whether we're not there.

291
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,798
The issue is, do they
wanna talk about this?

292
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,300
Do they wanna work this out?

293
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,926
Ethan does.
Does Zachary?

294
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,096
- We won't give him a choice.
- It has to come from him.

295
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,431
Zachary acts like a thug.

296
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,142
We're not gonna wait around
for him to see the light.

297
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,897
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive
context because he's forced to,

298
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:23,067
I just don't see anything positive
coming out of that.

299
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,527
Mrs. Longstreet,
our son is a maniac.

300
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,948
If you hope he'll suddenly and spontaneously
get all apologetic, you're dreaming.

301
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,202
Look, I'm sorry. I really do
have to get back to the office.

302
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,121
Nancy, you'll stay.
You'll let me know what was decided.

303
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,790
I'm no use to anyone anyway.

304
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,584
Women always think you need
the man, you need the father.

305
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,169
Like it would do any good.

306
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,838
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay either.

307
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,384
My husband has never been much of an
"I'll push the stroller" type daddy.

308
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,719
Well, it's too bad.
It goes by so fast.

309
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,888
Michael, you loved
taking care of the kids.

310
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,058
He had a ball pushing that stroller.
Yeah, sure.

311
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,977
So, what did we decide? Hm?

312
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,231
Could you come over to our place
at about 7:30 with Ethan?

313
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,692
Seven-thirty all right?

314
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,777
Well, if you want my opinion...

315
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,320
Yes, please.

316
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,197
I think Zachary
should come over here.

317
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,407
Yeah, I agree.

318
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,367
The victim shouldn't make the trip.

319
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,785
Yeah, that's right.
Okay.

320
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,787
Well, I can't be
anywhere at 7:30.

321
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,039
Who needs you?
You're useless, right? Heh.

322
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,293
Seriously, I think it's important
for his father to come.

323
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,504
Not tonight. Hello.

324
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,048
Tomorrow?
Hello? I'm sorry.

325
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,217
Can you hear me now?

326
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,556
There's not a word
in the annual report.

327
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:39,184
But the risk wasn't officially
established. There's no proof.

328
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,895
- Okay.
- Yeah, have him call me back.

329
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,355
Tomorrow?

330
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,691
Tomorrow I'm in Washington.

331
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,735
You have business in Washington?

332
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,944
The Pentagon.

333
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,530
Look, the main thing
is to get the kids to talk.

334
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,575
So I'll come over to your place
at 7:30 with Zachary

335
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,994
and we'll just let them
talk it through.

336
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,204
What?
You don't seem convinced.

337
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,458
If Zachary hasn't acquired
any accountability skills,

338
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,419
they'll just glare at each other,
and it'll be a disaster.

339
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,547
Accountability skills?
What are you talking about?

340
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:13,135
I'm sure your son is not a maniac.
Zachary is not a maniac.

341
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,804
Yes, he is.
Alan, don't be an idiot.

342
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,931
Why are you saying that?
He's a maniac.

343
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,600
How does he explain
what he did?

344
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,603
He won't talk about it.
He should. He should talk about it.

345
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,271
That's a lot of "shoulds."

346
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,608
He should come here. He should talk about it.
He should feel sorry.

347
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,902
I'm sure you're much more
evolved than we are.

348
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,988
We're trying to get up to speed.
In the meantime, indulge us.

349
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,531
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

350
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,367
Come on.
What happened here?

351
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,328
This isn't what we're all about.

352
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,371
I was talking about Zachary,
about him.

353
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,082
Got that. Right.
Alan.

354
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,753
You want some more coffee?
Some real coffee?

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,671
Coffee.

356
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,591
Thank you.

357
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,593
Coffee. All right.

358
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,638
It's okay, Pen.
I'll get it.

359
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,637
I see you're an art enthusiast.

360
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,556
Yes.

361
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,184
Bacon.

362
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,520
Yeah, it's Bacon.

363
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:06,540
Mm. Cruelty and splendour.

364
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,876
Chaos. Balance.

365
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,590
Is Zachary interested in art?

366
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,593
Not as much as he should be.
Your children are?

367
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,929
Well, we try to make up for what's
lacking in the school curriculum.

368
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,723
Right. Mm-hm.

369
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,517
We try to take them
to concerts and to galleries.

370
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:30,814
We really believe that culture can
be such a powerful force for peace.

371
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,734
You're so right.
Ls cobbler a cake or a pie?

372
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,235
Here's an important question.

373
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,947
I was in the kitchen. I was thinking,
"Why should pizza be a pie?"

374
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,783
Oh, here, here. Don't leave
this miserable little piece.

375
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,410
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Here.

376
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,621
Go on, you have that.

377
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,541
Cobbler's a cake. No crust on the bottom.
It can't be a pie.

378
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,336
- You're a gourmet chef.
- I like to cook.

379
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,048
It's something you have to do
out of love or not at all.

380
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,594
The way I see it, if there's no
crust on the bottom, it's not a pie.

381
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,263
So how about you guys?
You have other kids?

382
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,682
I have another son
by a former marriage.

383
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,476
Ah.

384
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:12,397
You know, I was wondering,
and I know this is not important,

385
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,025
but do you know
what they were arguing about?

386
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,860
Because Ethan won't say a word.

387
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,279
Ethan wouldn't let Zachary
be a part of his gang.

388
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,532
- Ethan has a gang?
- And he called him a snitch.

389
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,326
Did you know that Ethan
had a gang?

390
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:28,038
Heh. No. But I'm thrilled
to hear it. Ha, ha.

391
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,582
Why are you thrilled?
Because I had one.

392
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,334
I was the leader.
So was I.

393
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,294
What does the leader
of a gang do?

394
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,047
You know, you got five
or six guys who like you,

395
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,967
are willing to sacrifice
themselves for you.

396
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,470
Like in Ivanhoe.
Exactly. Like in Ivanhoe.

397
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,305
Who even knows
about Ivanhoe any more?

398
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,308
It's another role model,
like Spider-Man or whoever.

399
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,644
Apparently, you know more
about this than we do.

400
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:54,147
I guess Zachary wasn't
quite as silent as you first said.

401
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,526
So why did he call him
a snitch?

402
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,946
Forget it.
Silly question, right?

403
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,614
What's the point?
We don't care.

404
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,283
We're not going to get into
these children's quarrels.

405
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,035
- It's none of our business.
- Right.

406
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,538
What is our business
is this unfortunate incident.

407
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,456
And violence is our business.

408
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,585
When I was the leader, I beat
up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight,

409
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,629
and he was bigger than me.

410
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,507
What does that have to do
with anything, Michael?

411
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:21,842
No, nothing.

412
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,428
This isn't a fair fight.
These boys weren't fighting.

413
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,556
Right. I was just
remembering something.

414
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,683
It's not very different.

415
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,810
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, there's a difference.

416
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,146
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?

417
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,440
Well, me and Jimmy Leach
agreed to fight.

418
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,400
- Did you mess him up?
- A little.

419
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,402
Enough about Jimmy Leach.

420
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:44,781
Um, look, do you mind
if I talk to Zachary?

421
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,116
Of course not.

422
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,577
I would never do it
without your permission.

423
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,954
No, talk to him.
That's completely fine with us.

424
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,664
And good luck with that.

425
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,666
Stop it, Alan.

426
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,293
Why do you say that?

427
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,128
Mrs. Longstreet...
Penelope.

428
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,922
I think we'll do better
on a first-name basis. Don't you?

429
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,843
Right. Penelope, you're acting
on the desire to educate...

430
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,637
I don't have to talk to him
if you don't want me to.

431
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,307
Go. Lecture him, talk to him.
Do whatever you want.

432
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:13,769
I don't understand how you
feel so uninvolved here.

433
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,271
- Oh, Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

434
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,940
Penelope,
I'm very involved here.

435
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,777
My son injured another child.
Deliberately.

436
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,904
See, that's the kind of thing
that irks me.

437
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,280
We know deliberately.

438
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,866
- That makes the difference.
- Between what and what?

439
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,659
We're talking about
one thing here.

440
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,661
Our kid picked up a stick,
hit your kid.

441
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,455
That's why we're here.
Fruitless.

442
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,583
Right. She's right, guys.
This kind of talk is fruitless.

443
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,669
So why do you feel you need
to slip in the word "deliberately"?

444
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,338
What lesson are you
teaching me?

445
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,174
All right, this...
This is getting silly.

446
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,760
My husband is all stressed out
over work stuff.

447
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,138
I'll come back tonight with Zachary,
and we'll let them work it out.

448
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,474
I'm not stressed out in the least.
Well, I am.

449
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,311
There's no reason to be stressed out.
Yes. There is.

450
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,021
Yeah?

451
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,568
Well, no comment. No comment.

452
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,572
No comment.

453
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,283
<i>Well, what if I say that
we were awaiting confirmation?</i>

454
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,703
What? If you recall it,
you're admitting liability.

455
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,039
<i>Yeah, but that embolism thing
is weighing on me.</i>

456
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:20,919
Recalling Antril would be
admitting your liability.

457
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:25,215
At Christmastime, in the school
play, what did Zachary play?

458
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,676
Zachary played, um...
Ebenezer Scrooge.

459
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,887
Accounting irregularities.
Ebenezer Scrooge. That's right.

460
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,681
In handcuffs
two weeks from now...

461
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,600
Michael, do you remember
when he played Scrooge?

462
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,227
Sure. Yeah, sure.

463
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,604
Yeah, he was wonderful.

464
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,481
He had that nightcap on.
He was funny.

465
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,401
Talk about the victims
after the stockholders' meeting.

466
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,777
What did Ethan play?

467
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,654
He played one of the kids.

468
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,490
- One of the Cratchits.
- The Cratchit kids. Right.

469
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:54,870
We can't recall the drug because three
guys can't walk a straight line.

470
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,079
<i>Right.</i>

471
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,373
So for the time being,
don't make a move.

472
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,417
<i>All right, all right.
I won't say anything.</i>

473
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,753
All right.
Okay, call you right back.

474
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,303
<i>Hello, Alan?</i>

475
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,639
They're in panic mode.
They got the media breathing down their necks.

476
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,349
All right.

477
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,895
I want a press release
that doesn't sound defensive at all.

478
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,647
Just the opposite.
Go for the jugular.

479
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:26,359
"TW Pharma is a target."

480
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,737
Attempt at manipulation
of the stock price

481
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,323
two weeks before
the stockholders' meeting.

482
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,575
And where does this study
come from anyway?

483
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:37,579
"How does this suddenly drop out of a
clear blue sky?" Et cetera, et cetera.

484
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,456
Not one word about
the health issue.

485
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:43,376
Who's behind the study? Who?

486
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,713
<i>Got it.
Fine.</i>

487
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,466
Pharmaceutical companies
are the worst, right?

488
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,302
Profit, profit, profit. Heh.

489
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,555
Nobody said you should listen
to my conversation.

490
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,183
Well, nobody said you
should have it under my nose.

491
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,977
Oh, wrong. I'm totally
forced to have it here.

492
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,854
Against my will, believe me.

493
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:06,983
Yeah. They just peddle the shit, right?
No one's responsible.

494
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,237
In any therapeutic advance, there
are benefits and there are risks.

495
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,822
Yeah, sure, I know. Still...

496
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,909
you got some funny line of work.

497
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,621
What does that mean?
Michael, it's none of our business.

498
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,581
Just funny line of work.

499
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,668
- What about you? What do you do?
- I got a normal job.

500
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,169
What's a normal job?

501
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,255
I told you, I sell pots and pans.

502
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,631
And door handles.

503
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,592
And ﬂush mechanisms
and a lot of other stuff.

504
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,720
"Flush mechanisms."
I like that. That's interesting.

505
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,347
Alan.

506
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,642
I find that interesting.
Flush toilets are interesting.

507
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:41,810
Why not?

508
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,645
How many different kinds
do you have?

509
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,146
There's two basic kinds.

510
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:47,607
You got your push button
and your handle-operated.

511
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,025
Yeah, right.

512
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,319
Depends where your water line is.
I see.

513
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,530
Either comes from the side
or from the bottom.

514
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,824
Right.
One of my managers is an expert.

515
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,575
I could introduce you if you want.

516
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,744
You'll have to hump it out
to Jamaica, Queens, though.

517
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,163
You seem like you know
your business pretty well.

518
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,125
Are you planning on sanctioning
Zachary in any way?

519
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:08,712
You two can have your plumbing
discussion some other time.

520
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,673
I don't feel well.
What's the matter? Are you all right?

521
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,800
You do look pale, honey.

522
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,802
You're all white, yeah.

523
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,975
I'm nauseous.
Some Regian.

524
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,228
We got some Regian, right?
No. No, no. I'll be fine.

525
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,148
A Coke.
What you need is a Coke.

526
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,540
It's not cold.

527
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,585
- Mr. Cowan.
- It's not cold.

528
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,878
Thank you.

529
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,380
Are you sure?
Little sips.

530
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,257
The Coke wasn't in the fridge.
Eh...

531
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,968
All right. Have him call me back.
Tell him right away.

532
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,596
Okay, Mr. Cowan.
Okay.

533
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,807
Is Coke good for that?
It's more for diarrhoea, isn't it?

534
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,726
No, not only.

535
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,020
Better?
Mm.

536
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,400
I think so.

537
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,861
Mrs. Longstreet.

538
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:19,324
If we decide to reprimand
our child,

539
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,911
we'll do it in our own way
and on our own terms.

540
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,372
Absolutely.
What, absolutely?

541
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,415
They're free to do as they see fit.

542
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,751
I don't agree.
You don't agree about what?

543
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,461
They're not free.
Is that right?

544
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,672
Go on. Sorry. Yeah?

545
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,176
<i>- Great.
- We're writing the statement.</i>

546
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,053
Yeah, but don't forget.

547
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,014
Nothing's been proven here.
Nothing's certain.

548
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,642
Don't fuck this up.
If we don't get this right,

549
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,645
Walter will be out on his ass
in two weeks, and so will we.

550
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,272
Enough, Alan! Enough
with the cell phone already!

551
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,982
The here and now, goddamn it.

552
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,945
<i>Call me</i> back <i>and read it to me
I'll call you back.</i>

553
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,364
What's wrong with you,
screaming at me like that?

554
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,990
Dennis heard every word.
Good.

555
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:04,285
I am sick of that fucking cell phone,
every minute of every day.

556
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,622
Listen, Nancy. You should be thanking
me for agreeing to come here.

557
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,624
Really?
Oh, God.

558
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,584
L-m gonna throw up. NO, you.re not

559
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,628
I am.
You wanna use the bathroom?

560
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,672
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

561
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,757
She's right.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

562
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,092
I feel dizzy.

563
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,095
Stare at a point in space.
Stare at a point in space, Doodle.

564
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,431
Hey, you can see
part of the el from here. Cool.

565
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,767
Get away from me. Leave me alone.
Shouldn't she go to the bathroom?

566
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,603
Go to the bathroom
if you have to throw up.

567
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,771
Give her some Regian.

568
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,357
It can't be the cobbler?
No. I made it yesterday.

569
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,818
Don't touch me!
Take it easy, Doodle.

570
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,946
Yeah, come on. Don't get all
bent out of shape over nothing.

571
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,615
My husband feels that anything
to do with the house,

572
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,452
the school, the backyard,
is my domain.

573
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,662
- I do not.
- You do so.

574
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:51,374
And I can understand why.
It's all so excruciatingly boring.

575
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,001
It's excruciating.

576
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,004
If it's so excruciating, why have
children in the first place?

577
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,882
Maybe Zachary's picking up
on that lack of interest.

578
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:03,011
What lack of interest?
You just said yourself.

579
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,140
Go get a bucket.
Go get a bucket!

580
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,775
Stupid bitch.

581
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,611
You should have gone
to the bathroom.

582
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,945
This is ridiculous.

583
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:22,989
What? Your suit took a hit

584
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,824
Couldn't be the cobbler,
that I know.

585
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,202
It's not the cobbler.
This is just nerves.

586
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,871
Do you wanna clean up
in the bathroom or...?

587
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,459
My Kokoschka.

588
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,545
Here.

589
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,423
Give her some Regian.

590
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,258
She can't keep anything down.

591
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,636
Where's the bathroom?

592
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,847
I'll show you.

593
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,227
Ugh.

594
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:56,272
This is nerves. Just nerves.

595
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,744
Thank you.

596
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,957
It's like I always say, you can't get
over something while you're under it.

597
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,335
With me, it's the back of my neck.
I get all blocked up back there.

598
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,753
- All right.
Mm-hm.

599
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,172
What do we do
with the Kokoschka?

600
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:24,509
We can clean it.
Maybe Lysol.

601
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,261
The problem
is gonna be drying it.

602
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,221
Maybe plain water
and some cologne.

603
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,430
Cologne?

604
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,016
I got some of that
Kronos stuff I never use.

605
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,310
The paper will warp.

606
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:38,147
Then we'll blow-dry it and put some books
on top of it after to flatten it out.

607
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,067
Or maybe iron it,
like dollar bills.

608
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,694
Oh, God.

609
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,154
I'll buy you another one.
There is no other one.

610
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,865
It's been out of print for years.
I'm so sorry.

611
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,618
We can save it.
Pen, let me do this.

612
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,496
It's a reprint from the catalogue
of the 1957 show in London.

613
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:56,583
Get the blow-dryer and the cologne
in the bathroom cabinet.

614
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,128
Her husband's in the bathroom.
He's not on the can.

615
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:03,923
Look, I got most of it off.
There's just a little left on the <i>Dolgans.</i>

616
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,643
Excuse me.

617
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,372
Ugh.

618
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,710
Are you feeling better?

619
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,919
Yeah.

620
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,588
What, should I spray or...?

621
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,006
Where's the blow-dryer?

622
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,258
He's drying his pants.

623
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,927
We'll wait. We should put
the Kronos on there last.

624
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,137
Okay.

625
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:52,930
Can I use the bathroom too?

626
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,433
Yes. Of course.
Of course.

627
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,650
I don't know what to say.

628
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,778
I am so sorry.

629
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,288
Bring the blow-dryer
when you're done.

630
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,456
So sorry.

631
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,000
God.

632
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,920
Ugh.
Unbelievable.

633
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,215
Un-fucking-believable.

634
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,760
Her cobbler's horrible.

635
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,138
You stuffed your face.
Well...

636
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:38,643
look at my day.
I gotta get some food in me sometime.

637
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,489
Oh, God.

638
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,701
Freaking nightmare.

639
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,287
He better watch it.
He's got me right on the edge.

640
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,665
She's horrible.
Hm. Less.

641
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,084
She's so fake.

642
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,877
She doesn't bother me as much.

643
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,505
They're both horrible.
Why do you take their side all the time?

644
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:09,924
Sorry.

645
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,759
I don't. What's that
supposed to mean?

646
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:14,554
What the hell
are we doing here?

647
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:18,933
I hope you're kidding.
Why do you argue with her?

648
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,144
We'd have been out of here
a long time ago

649
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,730
if you didn't bicker
over every word.

650
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:27,191
Would you rather I was
a sheep like her husband?

651
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,318
Do you think
it was the cobbler?

652
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,696
Of course it was.

653
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,616
A little warm Coke
and "bang."

654
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,245
Oh, fuck.

655
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,913
You're always mitigating.

656
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,665
You're trying to reconcile
everything.

657
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,584
I am not.
You are.

658
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,544
You had a gang
and you were the leader.

659
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,838
They can do whatever
they want with their son.

660
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,340
Well, their son is a threat
to homeland security.

661
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,676
Kid like that,
when he's a menace to society,

662
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,178
it's everybody's business.

663
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,514
And I can't believe that
she barfed all over my books.

664
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,184
When you know that
you're gonna toss your cookies,

665
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,436
you take some precautions.

666
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,731
<i>Aw. The Foujita.</i>

667
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:08,483
Now it's disgusting.

668
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,277
I was right on the edge
with that toilet-flushing shit.

669
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:12,862
Heh, heh.
You were incredible.

670
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,656
I held my own, right?
Incredible.

671
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,825
Jamaica, Queens.
Now that was genius.

672
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,286
Little piece of shit.
What does he call her again?

673
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,498
Doodle. Heh-heh-heh.
Yeah, right. Doodle.

674
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:27,126
Doodle.
Yeah, I call her Doodle.

675
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,920
Oh, I'm...

676
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,380
I'm sorry. We didn't...
We didn't mean anything.

677
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:36,260
You know, it's... It's, uh... it's so easy
to make fun of other people's pet names.

678
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,514
Michael, what do we call each other?
I'm sure it's worse, right?

679
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,432
You wanted the blow-dryer.

680
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,683
Thank you.
Thanks.

681
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:46,103
We call each other "Darjeeling."
Like the tea.

682
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:51,275
It's a lot more embarrassing
if you ask me.

683
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,986
How is she feeling?
Is she feeling better?

684
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,404
Yeah, better.

685
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,533
Yeah, I... I...
I reacted badly.

686
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,869
I'm ashamed. I really am.
Here.

687
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:08,417
You know, I made a big deal about the
catalogue, and I... I don't even know why.

688
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,088
You get so absurdly attached
to these things

689
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,674
and you don't even know why.
Pull it taut though.

690
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,843
But hold onto the other side.
I got it.

691
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,387
You gotta pull it because
there's wrinkles on that.

692
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,848
The corners are wet.
I'll get the corners.

693
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,226
It's gonna tear.
He's right. It's gonna tear.

694
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,061
Okay. Well, here...
It's dry enough.

695
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,940
Okay. Put cologne on those,
and I'll finish this one.

696
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,237
So where does "Doodle" come from?
Sorry.

697
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,614
Yankee Doodle
or Cheez Doodle or...?

698
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:42,076
It's from a song from <i>Guys and Dolls</i>
that goes "Doodle-oodle-oodle-oo."

699
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,828
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know that one.

700
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,331
♪ I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your pretty neck I do ♪

701
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,834
♪ Doodle-oodle-00-do
Doodle-oodle-00-do ♪ ♪

702
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,880
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.
Ours is from our honeymoon in India.

703
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,716
We called each other "Darjeeling"
instead of "darling."

704
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,384
It's so stupid.

705
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,387
Maybe I should
check on her, huh?

706
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,015
Yeah. Yeah, you do that,
Darjeeling.

707
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,392
Oh, Nancy. Hey.

708
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,604
Well, I was worried about you.
Are you feeling better?

709
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,523
Yeah. Better. I think so.

710
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,277
If you're not sure, stay
away from the coffee table.

711
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:22,283
I left a towel in the bathtub.
I didn't know where to put it.

712
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,201
Perfect.

713
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,163
You cleaned up.

714
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,040
I am so sorry.

715
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,791
Everything's fine. All is well.

716
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,171
I'm sorry. I wasn't there for you.
I was so focused on the Kokoschka.

717
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,423
That's all right.
No. I...

718
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,010
- I behaved poorly.
- Please.

719
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:52,980
In the bathroom, I was thinking.

720
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,690
Yes?

721
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,359
Yeah, maybe we...

722
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,569
Maybe we glossed over the, uh...

723
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,404
The, uh...

724
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,281
Well, I mean...

725
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,617
What? What is it?

726
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:09,538
Well, name-calling
is a kind of abuse.

727
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,791
Sure.
It depends.

728
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,417
Right. It depends.

729
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,711
Zachary has never been
a violent child.

730
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,923
He must have had his reasons.
Like getting called a snitch.

731
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,759
Excuse me.

732
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,387
Yeah, Walter.

733
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:28,516
<i>Alan, CNN has invited
me for a panel discussion.</i>

734
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,186
Well, as long as there
are no victims on the panel.

735
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,690
No victims. I don't want you
sitting down with victims.

736
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,316
Deny, deny, deny...

737
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,402
If we have to,
we'll sue the Journal.

738
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,531
Well, we'll e-mail you the draft
of the press release.

739
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,659
Walter, I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

740
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:49,370
Call me a snitch,
it gets a rise out of me.

741
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,080
- Unless it's true.
- What?

742
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,332
You know, if the shoe fits.

743
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,210
You think my son is a snitch?
Come on. I'm joking around.

744
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,087
So is yours anyway.

745
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,881
What do you mean, so is ours?
He snitched on Zachary.

746
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,884
We coaxed it out of him.
We're getting completely off point.

747
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,345
Maybe you coaxed,
but he did snitch on him.

748
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,264
- Nancy.
- "Nancy" what?

749
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:11,809
You think my son is a snitch?
I don't think anything.

750
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,520
Well, if you don't think anything,
don't say anything.

751
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,731
- Don't make insinuations.
- Nancy,

752
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,899
there's no reason
to lose our cool here.

753
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,570
Michael and I have gone out of our way
to be fair-minded and conciliating.

754
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,780
Not so fair-minded.

755
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:27,742
Oh, really?
Superficially fair-minded.

756
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,410
Doodle, I have to go.

757
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:32,371
So go. Coward.

758
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,625
Nancy, right now I'm in danger of
losing my most important client.

759
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,962
This "caring parent" crap and the
bickering that goes along with it...

760
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,423
Yeah, well, my son lost
two teeth. Two incisors.

761
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,925
We got that, right.
One of them permanently.

762
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,763
He'll get new teeth. Better ones.
No one chewed his ear off.

763
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,433
It was a mistake not to consider
the source of the problem.

764
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,601
There is no source.

765
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,353
There's an 11-year-old kid
who hits people with a stick!

766
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,522
Armed with a stick.
We took that word out.

767
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,357
Took it out because
we asked you to.

768
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,068
We took it out
without argument.

769
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,403
A word which deliberately
establishes intent

770
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,572
without any hint
of a misunderstanding,

771
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,199
which excludes childhood.

772
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,534
I don't think I can
stand this tone any more.

773
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:14,330
We're not quite on the same page,
you and I, right from the start.

774
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,915
Mr. Cowan,

775
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:19,794
it is incredibly frustrating
to be continually upbraided

776
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,713
for something that we, ourselves,
admitted was a mistake.

777
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,299
The word "armed" wasn't right.
We took it out.

778
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,052
Though, strictly speaking,
it certainly applies.

779
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,554
Zachary was verbally abused
and he reacted.

780
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,765
Now, if I'm attacked,
I defend myself,

781
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,559
especially when I'm all alone
against a whole gang.

782
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:38,813
Well, you certainly perked up since
you tossed your cookies. Heh, heh.

783
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,606
Do you realise how crude that is?

784
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,317
Look, we're all decent people,
all four of us.

785
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,112
I don't know how we got
carried away, losing our tempers.

786
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,115
This is totally unnecessary.
Michael, stop it. Stop mitigating.

787
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,576
We're only superficially fair-minded.
Why should we be fair-minded at all?

788
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,787
No. No, I'm not gonna be led
down that path.

789
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:55,955
What path?

790
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,165
The path these two
little shits led us down.

791
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,543
Pen doesn't see things that way.
"Penelope."

792
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,504
Sorry.
So Ethan's a shit now.

793
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,631
That really takes the cake.

794
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,384
Look, that's it.
I really have to leave now.

795
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,177
Yeah. So do I.

796
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,972
Go. Go. I give up.

797
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,019
<i>- Hello.
- It's me, Mikey.</i>

798
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,438
<i>Oh, hi, Ma.
Is this a bad time?</i>

799
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,275
No. No, we got some
friends over, but go ahead.

800
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,111
<i>The surgeon told me to stop taking
my medication before the operation.</i>

801
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,323
Yes. Yes, you just do
whatever the doctors tell you to do.

802
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,616
Yes.

803
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,702
<i>The surgeon told me
to stop all of them,</i>

804
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,539
<i>but Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.</i>

805
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,541
<i>The what?
The Antril.</i>

806
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,877
<i>Should I stop taking the Antril too?</i>

807
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,964
Antril? You're... You're...
You're... You're taking Antril?

808
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,342
Wait, hold on a second, Ma.
Antril?

809
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,344
That crap of yours is Antril?

810
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,806
My mother's taking it.
Thousands of people take it.

811
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,225
Mom. You gotta stop
taking that one right away.

812
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,227
You hear me? Right now.
<i>Why?</i>

813
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,523
You just do what I tell you. All right?
I'm gonna explain later.

814
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,568
<i>No. Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.</i>

815
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,780
Mom, you tell Dr. Perlstein
that I said you can't take it.

816
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,949
<i>I won't touch it, Michael</i>

817
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,534
Good.

818
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,829
<i>Why red?
So they can see me.</i>

819
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,206
So who can see you?

820
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,041
<i>The cars. They all drive like crazy.</i>

821
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:26,503
Mom, that's ridiculous. Okay.
Mom. Mom. Bup-bup-bup.

822
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,548
Mom. I have to call you back.
I told you we have company.

823
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay. I love you
<i>I</i> hope so.

824
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,928
Bye-bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

825
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:38,474
She got red crutches
in case she gets hit by a truck,

826
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,935
because she wanders out
in the street at night.

827
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,354
They're giving her Antril
for her blood pressure.

828
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,941
If she's taking it and she looks
normal, I'll take her deposition.

829
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,692
Didn't I have a scarf?

830
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:51,153
You know,
I don't like that attitude of yours.

831
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,489
If my mother shows
even the slightest symptom,

832
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,991
my name will be on the top
of a class-action suit.

833
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,410
- We'll have one anyway.
- Well, I should hope so.

834
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,956
Doing the right thing is just futile.
Honesty is just stupidity.

835
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,333
It just weakens you.
You let your guard down.

836
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,711
Let's go, Nancy. That's enough
sermons and lectures for one day.

837
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,381
Yeah, go ahead.
But let me tell you this:

838
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:14,134
Now that I know you two,
I'm not surprised what's-his-name...

839
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,137
Zachary may have
some behavioural issues.

840
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,474
- When you killed that hamster...
- Killed?

841
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,351
Killed.
I killed the hamster?

842
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,312
Yes. You do everything you can
to make us feel guilty.

843
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,773
You stake out the moral
high ground as your own,

844
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,234
but you, yourself,
are a murderer.

845
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,444
I definitely did
not kill that hamster.

846
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,654
Worse.
Worse!

847
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:37,783
You left it out there, trembling
with fear in a hostile environment.

848
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,120
That poor critter was probably
eaten by a dog or a rat.

849
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:43,622
She's right.
What do you mean, "she's right"?

850
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,957
I mean, come on. Michael.

851
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,793
It's horrible what must have
happened to that poor animal.

852
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,628
I thought the
hamster would be happy.

853
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,047
I thought he'd go running around
happy as a clam.

854
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,425
Well, he didn't.
And you just left him there.

855
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,802
Because I can't touch
those things, okay?

856
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,763
I can't touch anything of that family.
Penny, you know that.

857
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,726
He's afraid of rodents.
Yes. I have a fear of rodents.

858
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:07,771
And a fear of reptiles. Anything down close
to the ground. That's it. All right?

859
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:11,317
What about you? How come you
didn't go downstairs and get it?

860
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,068
Because I didn't know.

861
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,612
Michael said this morning
that the hamster ran away.

862
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,449
So I went right out the door,
I went right down the block.

863
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,743
I mean, I went to the basement!

864
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,829
Penelope. It is completely
unfair that all of a sudden

865
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:27,416
I'm in the hot seat about this hamster
that you had to tell them about.

866
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,377
That is a family issue that
doesn't concern anybody but us.

867
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:32,504
It's got nothing to do
with this situation.

868
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,424
I can't believe I'm being called
a murderer in my own house.

869
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,218
What does your house
have to do with tea in China'?

870
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,137
It's my house. I opened the door.

871
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:43,057
The door is wide open
in a spirit of reconciliation

872
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,934
to a couple people who should
be a little more grateful.

873
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,729
Keep right on stroking
your own ego. It's beautiful.

874
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,399
So you have no remorse?
No. I have no remorse.

875
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,027
That animal was disgusting,
and I'm glad it's gone.

876
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:57,363
Michael, that's ridiculous.
What's ridiculous?

877
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,490
What, have you
lost your mind now too?

878
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:03,160
Their son beats the shit out of Ethan,
and you're in my face over a hamster?

879
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,579
What you did was wrong.
You can't deny that.

880
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,539
I don't give a shit
about the hamster!

881
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,625
You're gonna when
your daughter gets home!

882
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:13,212
Bring her on. I'm not gonna be told
how to act by some 9-year-old brat.

883
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:16,340
I agree with him there
100 percent.

884
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:18,675
And see? It's pathetic.

885
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,428
Watch it, Penelope. Watch it.

886
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:24,765
I've kept my shirt on till now,
but you are pushing me over the line.

887
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,517
And Ethan?
What about Ethan?

888
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,519
Well, is he sad too?

889
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,188
Ethan's got other things
on his plate if you ask me.

890
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,190
Ethan wasn't attached
to Nibbles.

891
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:34,441
Nibbles!

892
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,985
What the hell kind of
pussy-ass name is that anyway?

893
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:40,864
So if you feel no remorse,
why should our son?

894
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:44,910
You know what? All this consultation
and consideration shit,

895
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:46,370
I'm sick to death of it.

896
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,455
We were nice to you.
We bought tulips.

897
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:51,792
My wife dressed me up as a liberal,
but the fact of the matter is

898
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,753
I got no patience
for this touchy-feely bullshit.

899
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,340
I am a short-tempered
son of a bitch, okay?!

900
00:45:58,507 --> 00:45:59,800
We all are.

901
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:01,760
No, I'm sorry. We are not.

902
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,054
We are not all
short-tempered sons of bitches.

903
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,432
- Not you, of course.
- No, not me. Thank God.

904
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:09,184
No, not you, Darjeeling.
Not you.

905
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:11,562
You're so evolved.
You never go off half-cocked.

906
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,272
Why are you being
so aggressive?

907
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,648
I'm not, I'm being honest.

908
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,608
No, you are.
You're being aggressive.

909
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:20,112
Know what? You put this little bash
together, and I let you recruit me...

910
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:21,905
You let me recruit you?
Yes.

911
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,576
That is so disgusting.
No, it's not.

912
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:28,662
You're an advocate for civilized
behaviour. That's fine with me.

913
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,248
I'm an advocate for
civilized behaviour, you bet I am.

914
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,083
At least somebody around here is.

915
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,878
But you think it's better to be
a tempered son of a bitch?

916
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,297
Nobody said that.
Nobody criticised you for that.

917
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,299
You did.
We did not.

918
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:42,885
What was I supposed to do?
Was I supposed to sue you?

919
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,845
Was I supposed to
never speak to you?

920
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:47,097
Tear you apart through
the insurance company?

921
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:48,515
- Stop it, Penny.
- Stop what?

922
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,517
You're blowing this out
of proportion!

923
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,270
Well, I don't care.

924
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,814
You do everything you can
to escape the pettiness

925
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,985
and you just end up humiliated
and completely alone.

926
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,695
Yes. Walter.

927
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,156
<i>It's out everywhere.</i>

928
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,825
Well, let them prove it.
Yeah, right.

929
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:09,828
<i>Let them prove it.
Without some kind of response...</i>

930
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,455
No way.

931
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:14,249
From where I sit, the best thing
for us to do is nothing.

932
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,460
We're born alone and we
die alone, that's it.

933
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:18,795
Who wants a little Scotch?

934
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:23,842
Walter, I'm in a meeting right now.
I'll call you when I get back.

935
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,304
Damn it. I'm living with
this totally negative person.

936
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,640
- Who's negative?
- Me.

937
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,560
This was the worst possible idea.
We should've never had this meeting.

938
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,146
- I told you so. Yeah.
- You told me so?

939
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,357
You told me we should've
never had this?

940
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:41,109
I didn't think it was a good idea.
It was a good idea.

941
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:43,362
Oh, come on. Who wants a little?

942
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:45,822
You told me you didn't think
this was a good idea?

943
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,741
As I recall.
As you recall.

944
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:51,119
Maybe just a little sip.
Don't you have to go?

945
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:54,206
At this point of the game,
I might as well have a little drink.

946
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:58,293
You look me in the eye and you
tell me that we didn't both agree on this.

947
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,255
Oh, God. Calm down, Penelope.
This is going nowhere.

948
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,174
And who said not to touch
the cobbler this morning, huh?

949
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:07,094
Who said we should leave some
for the Cowans? Who said that?

950
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:08,720
That was very nice of you.

951
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,722
What does that
have to do with anything?

952
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,641
What do you mean?

953
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:16,478
Guests are guests.
You're lying. You're lying.

954
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:17,729
He's lying.

955
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,066
You know, my wife actually
had to drag me here today.

956
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:24,111
When you grow up with a certain
John Wayne idea of manhood,

957
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:28,031
the impulse in this kind of situation
is not to talk it through.

958
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,576
I thought the role model
was Ivanhoe.

959
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,661
Same basic concept.

960
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,329
Another aspect.

961
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,290
Another aspect. Really?

962
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,792
How much are you gonna
humiliate yourself, Michael?

963
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,169
I can see I dragged him here
for nothing.

964
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,380
What did you expect, Doodle?

965
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,173
That is a ridiculous nickname.

966
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,843
Some revelation
about universal values?

967
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,720
This Scotch is unbelievable.

968
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,140
Right? You see that?
Eighteen years old, single malt,

969
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:55,976
from a place in Scotland
still grows their own barley.

970
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:59,021
What about the tulips, huh?
Who got them?

971
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,774
All I said was, "it's too bad we didn't
get any of those tulips this week."

972
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:05,277
I didn't say anything about
going to Henry Street.

973
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:08,822
Don't get all bent out of shape
over this. Penelope, it's not worth it.

974
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,242
He got the tulips.
Him and only him.

975
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,454
What, we don't get a drink, huh?

976
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:19,541
Penelope and I would like
a drink too.

977
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:34,931
It's pretty funny
when you think about it.

978
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,559
A devotee of Ivanhoe
and John Wayne,

979
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,020
but he's scared to pick up
an itty-bitty mouse.

980
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:41,938
Stop it with the hamster.

981
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,315
- Stop.
- She's right.

982
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:44,608
It's laughable.

983
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:47,694
And hers?
I don't think that'll be necessary.

984
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,655
Pour me a drink, Michael.
No.

985
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,947
- Michael.
- No.

986
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,616
What is wrong with you, Michael?

987
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,372
Fine. Fine.

988
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:01,333
Drink. Drink.
What does it matter?

989
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,879
Is drinking bad for you or something?
No, it's great for me.

990
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,678
Now I don't know.

991
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,724
Mr. Cowan?

992
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,559
"Alan."

993
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:25,482
Alan. You see, you and I
didn't exactly hit it off,

994
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:29,152
but I live with a man who has
decided, once and for all,

995
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,364
that life is synonymous
with mediocrity.

996
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:34,783
You know, it's very hard
to live with a man

997
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,077
who's walled himself
inside that idea,

998
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:41,123
who doesn't wanna change anything, who
doesn't get excited about anything.

999
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,584
What are you telling him this for?
He could care less.

1000
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,586
We have to believe.

1001
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,715
We have to believe
in some possible correction.

1002
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,509
He's the last guy on earth
you should be telling this to.

1003
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:55,262
I'll talk to anybody
I damn well please.

1004
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,141
Who the fuck is that now?

1005
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,858
- Hi, Ma.
<i>- Mikey,</i> it's me again.

1006
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,443
<i>I forgot to ask how Ethan is.</i>

1007
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,738
He's fine. He got his teeth
knocked out, but he's fine.

1008
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,531
<i>Is he in pain?
Yeah, he's in</i> pain.

1009
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:16,450
It hurts, but it'll pass.

1010
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:19,786
Ma, I told you we have company.
I gotta call you back, remember?

1011
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:22,581
<i>Okay, Mikey.
Yeah. Bye.</i>

1012
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,542
He's still in pain?
No.

1013
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,627
Then why do you worry
your mother?

1014
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:30,172
He has to worry her.
He can't help himself.

1015
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:33,550
All right, Penelope. That's enough.
What is this drama-queen bullshit?

1016
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,554
Penelope, nobody cares
about anything outside himself.

1017
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:40,807
Sure, we'd all like to believe
in some possible correction,

1018
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:43,018
one we could author ourselves,

1019
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:46,354
completely free
of selfish consideration.

1020
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,315
Like your writing this book
on Darfur.

1021
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:50,817
No. Which I think is great.

1022
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,278
You know.
I understand how you might say,

1023
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:55,989
"Okay, I'll pick a massacre.
History's full of them.

1024
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:57,407
I'm gonna write a book."

1025
00:51:57,574 --> 00:51:59,618
Everybody has to
save himself somehow.

1026
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:02,120
I'm not writing this book
to save myself.

1027
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,165
You haven't read it.
You don't even know what's in it.

1028
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:07,250
Whatever.

1029
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:11,046
My God, that odour of Kronos
is killing me.

1030
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:14,007
Fucking reeks.
Well, you didn't exactly skimp.

1031
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:15,467
I am so sorry.

1032
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,261
No, it was my fault.
I sprayed like a madwoman.

1033
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,430
I don't know. Why...?

1034
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:23,767
Why can't things be easier,
you know?

1035
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:29,064
Why...? Why does everything
have to be so exhausting?

1036
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:30,732
You think too much.

1037
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:33,860
Women think too much.
There's an original response.

1038
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:36,196
I don't know what that means,
to think too much.

1039
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,865
You know, I don't know
how you can just go on living

1040
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,993
with absolutely
no moral sense of the world.

1041
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,538
- Look at me, I'm living.
- Oh, Michael, shut up.

1042
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,458
Your miserable complicity
just disgusts me.

1043
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,544
What happened
to your sense of humour?

1044
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,504
I don't have one
and I don't want one.

1045
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:57,092
If you ask me, the couple is the worst
ordeal God has ever inflicted on us.

1046
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,387
Marvellous.
The couple and the family.

1047
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,390
No one's forcing you to air
this out in front of us, Michael.

1048
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:06,893
And I might add, it's a little indecent.
That doesn't bother him.

1049
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,396
You agree with me, don't you?

1050
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:12,732
Now, look,
this is all beside the point.

1051
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,402
Alan. Say something.

1052
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,445
He has a right to his ideas.

1053
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,322
Doesn't mean
he has to advertise them.

1054
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:21,199
Yeah, right. Maybe.

1055
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:23,201
We don't care
about their marriage.

1056
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,204
We're here about the kids.
We don't care about their marriage.

1057
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,706
Yeah, except...
Except what?

1058
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:29,416
- It's related.
- It's related.

1059
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,334
Of course it's related.

1060
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,170
Ethan getting teeth busted out
is related to our marriage?

1061
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,548
Of course it is.
Sorry, I don't follow you.

1062
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:40,218
Look, take a step back
and look at the situation we're in.

1063
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:43,597
Children suck the life out of you
and leave you old and empty.

1064
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,640
That's the law of nature.

1065
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:48,643
You see these young couples
laughing all the way to the altar.

1066
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,022
You think, "They don't know.
Poor fuckers have no idea."

1067
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:55,483
They're happy. Nobody tells you
about this stuff in the beginning.

1068
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,818
I got this army buddy.

1069
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:59,279
He's gonna have a kid
with his new girlfriend.

1070
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:03,491
I said to him, "A kid? At our age?
What, are you stupid?"

1071
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,535
You got maybe
10, 15 good years left

1072
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,704
before you get cancer
or have a stroke,

1073
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,123
"and you're gonna saddle
yourself with a kid?"

1074
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,626
That's not really what you think.
Yes, it is.

1075
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,920
Of course it is. I think even worse.
Yep.

1076
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,838
You're debasing yourself,
Michael.

1077
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,299
Ha! Is that right?
Heh, heh.

1078
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:23,845
Stop crying, Penelope.
It only makes it worse.

1079
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,347
Here.

1080
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,432
Oh, of course.
Of course.

1081
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,268
It's excellent, isn't it?
It's excellent.

1082
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:32,187
Could I interest you
in a cigar?

1083
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:34,814
- No cigars in the house.
- Too bad.

1084
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,150
Were you gonna
smoke a cigar now, Alan?

1085
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,737
I do what I want, Nancy.
If I wanna smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar.

1086
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:43,615
I won't smoke it because
I don't wanna upset Penelope,

1087
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:47,243
who's already on edge,
to put it mildly.

1088
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:51,247
Oh, quit sniffling like that.
She's right.

1089
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:54,668
You know, when women cry,
men are pushed to a breaking point.

1090
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:59,381
Although, unfortunately, I must say, Michael's
point of view is completely justified.

1091
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:03,093
Yeah, can <i>I</i> read <i>it</i> to you?

1092
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,594
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

1093
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,099
Yeah, put "New York"
and a specific time of day.

1094
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,685
<i>It's unbearable.
What time of day?</i>

1095
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,397
The time you send it.
It has to be hot off the press.

1096
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:19,943
Not "questions." "Deplores."
"Questions" is wishy-washy.

1097
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,320
I live with this night and day.

1098
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:23,530
One second.

1099
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,657
Our lives are chopped
up by the cell phone.

1100
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,158
Nancy, this is very important.

1101
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:29,828
- It's always more important.
- Go ahead.

1102
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:32,872
What's happening somewhere
else is always more important.

1103
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,084
No. No, not "strategy." "Scheme."

1104
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:40,588
"A scheme surfacing two weeks from the
company's posting," et cetera, et cetera.

1105
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,007
In the street. Heh, heh.

1106
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:45,051
The dinner table. Everywhere.

1107
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:48,638
Mm. And "study" in quotes.

1108
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,765
Put the word "study" in quotes.

1109
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:53,351
I don't even protest any more.
Ha, ha.

1110
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:56,062
Unconditional surrender.

1111
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,565
I feel like I'm gonna vomit again.

1112
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:01,317
Where's that bucket?
How am I supposed to know?

1113
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:10,243
- Well, then just quote me.
- "This is a barefaced attempt"...

1114
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,162
Can you stand
over the bucket, please?

1115
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,039
Pen.
What?

1116
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:17,083
I mean, we're already set up
to handle this now.

1117
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,628
"... According to TW Pharma
attorney Alan Cowan."

1118
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:23,381
<i>Okay, I'll make these corrections
and put it out there.</i>

1119
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,926
AP, Reuters, newspapers,
trade journals.

1120
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,803
You know, the whole shebang.

1121
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,808
What's wrong?
She's gonna throw up again.

1122
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,477
You're so caring. It's touching.

1123
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,729
Well, I'm worried.
I didn't get that.

1124
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:41,274
My mistake.
Oh, come on, Nancy, will you?

1125
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,485
You and I don't have
to do this.

1126
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,780
Their marriage is going downhill.
We don't have to try to compete.

1127
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,866
What gives you the right to say
our marriage is going downhill?

1128
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,826
What gives you the right?

1129
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,872
<i>Yeah. Walter.
Ls the press release ready?</i>

1130
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,626
Yeah, I just had it read back to me.
They'll send it over to you.

1131
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:01,544
<i>Did you say this is
an attempt to...?</i>

1132
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,838
Manipulation.
Manipulation of the stock price.

1133
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:07,133
Listen, Walter, I'll call you
back in a minute. Yeah.

1134
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,011
I didn't say it. Steven did.
"Michael."

1135
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,390
I will not let you judge our family.
Michael. Sorry.

1136
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,184
Don't judge our son either.

1137
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:19,437
That's different.
Your son brutalized our son.

1138
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,481
They're young. They're kids.

1139
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:24,943
Kids roughhouse in the playground.
Always have, always will.

1140
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,986
It's a rule of nature.
No, it isn't.

1141
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:28,196
Sure it is.

1142
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:31,741
It takes a little education to
substitute the rule of law for violence.

1143
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:35,995
The origin of law, as you of
course know, is brute force.

1144
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:38,915
Maybe if you're a caveman,
but not in this world.

1145
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,458
Tell me about this world.

1146
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:43,378
You're boring. This whole
conversation is boring.

1147
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:47,298
Penelope, I believe in
the god of carnage,

1148
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:50,426
the god whose rule's been
unchallenged since time immemorial.

1149
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,428
You're interested in Africa, right?

1150
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:56,307
What's the matter?
Don't worry about me.

1151
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,434
Nancy.
I'm just fine.

1152
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,186
All right.

1153
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,772
See, I just got back from
the Congo.

1154
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,441
They got kids there
trained to kill at the age of 8.

1155
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:08,778
In the course of their childhood,
they might kill hundreds of people.

1156
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:13,575
They kill with a machete,
a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper.

1157
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:17,078
So obviously, when my kid
busts some other kid's tooth,

1158
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:20,498
even two teeth with a bamboo
switch by the sandbox,

1159
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,710
I'm not quite as shocked
and indignant as you are.

1160
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:25,003
Well, you should be.

1161
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,796
Thumper.

1162
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:30,341
What they call a grenade launcher.
That's what I called it.

1163
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,469
You all right?
I'm just fine.

1164
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,556
What's wrong with her?
What's the matter?

1165
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:38,725
Bile. It's nothing.

1166
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,394
Don't you tell me about Africa.

1167
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,813
I know all about
suffering in Africa.

1168
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,356
I don't doubt it.

1169
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,692
That's all I've been
thinking about for months.

1170
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:50,486
Don't get her started
on this, please.

1171
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,908
You know, I'm actually
starting to like you.

1172
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,201
Shut up.

1173
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,703
Talk about commitment
to world peace and stability.

1174
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,955
Shut the fuck up, Michael.

1175
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,249
Are you sure about that?

1176
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,585
Very sure. This will
do me some good.

1177
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,462
We live in New York.

1178
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,797
We don't live in Kinshasa.

1179
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,466
We live in New York City,

1180
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,802
and with the customs
of Western society.

1181
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,847
So, what happens
at the Brooklyn Bridge playground,

1182
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:20,183
that has to do
with Western values,

1183
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:25,104
to which, whether you like it or
not, I happen to subscribe to.

1184
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,774
Beating your husband must be
one of those customs then.

1185
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:29,317
I'm warning you, Michael!

1186
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:33,071
She was all over you
like a bad rash.

1187
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:35,365
If I were you,
it would melt my heart.

1188
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:38,034
He's making fun of you.
Do you believe it?

1189
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:40,411
Heh. I could care less.
No, really.

1190
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,997
Morally, you're supposed
to overcome your impulses,

1191
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:46,042
but there are times
you don't wanna overcome them.

1192
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:49,712
I mean, who wants to say a Hail Mary
when you're having sex?

1193
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,547
Can you buy this
Scotch around here?

1194
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,299
No, this one,
not very likely. No.

1195
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,511
Thumper. Ha-ha-ha.

1196
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:58,763
Heh. Thumper. Really.

1197
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,307
- Yeah, Thumper.
- That's what it's called.

1198
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:05,561
Why don't you just say
"grenade launcher"?

1199
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:06,938
Because that's a term.

1200
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:10,984
It's just like they say "Kalash"
and not "Kalashnikov" or "AK-47."

1201
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,653
Who is "they"?
That's enough, Nancy. That's enough.

1202
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,615
Hotshot firebrands like my husband,
you gotta understand,

1203
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:21,160
it's hard for them to get excited
about what happens down the block.

1204
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,539
Exactly.
I don't see why.

1205
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:27,959
I don't see why.
We're all citizens of the world.

1206
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:31,963
I don't see why we can't have
some sense of community.

1207
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,801
Ugh. Penelope. Enough with
the highfalutin claptrap.

1208
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,387
I'm gonna kill him.

1209
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:40,888
Yeah.

1210
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,016
<i>There's a problem with "barefaced. "</i>

1211
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,560
Well, take out "barefaced."
She's right.

1212
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:48,313
It's unbearable after a while.

1213
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,815
A brazen attempt to...
Manipulate the stock price.

1214
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:52,442
There you go.

1215
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:54,777
Did he sign off on the rest?
Yeah.

1216
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:57,947
Mm? That's fine. Good.

1217
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:01,326
What were we talking
about? Thumpers?

1218
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,286
We were saying

1219
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:06,205
that, despite what
my husband thinks,

1220
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,334
whether it happens here
or on the other side of the world,

1221
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,087
we all have to be
collectively concerned.

1222
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:16,758
"Collectively concerned."

1223
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,927
Nancy, it's absurd to drink
in your condition.

1224
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,722
What condition?
I'm perfect.

1225
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:25,141
Now, that's an
interesting idea.

1226
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,186
Yeah.

1227
01:01:29,062 --> 01:01:32,523
No. No interviews
before we get this release out

1228
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,362
Mr. Cowan, can you please put an end
to this nerve-racking conversation?

1229
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,741
Just remind him the
stockholders won't give a shit.

1230
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:45,828
The stockholders won't... Nancy.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1231
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:48,414
<i>Hello! What's going on?
There.</i>

1232
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,708
Shit!

1233
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,295
Ha. Way to go! Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, my God.

1234
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,429
The blow-dryer. The blow-dryer.

1235
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:06,474
You should be put in
a home, dear.

1236
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:11,229
I got everything in there.

1237
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,648
It was brand-new.
I spent hours setting this up.

1238
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:15,233
I can't believe you did that.

1239
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,485
That was a really
irresponsible thing to do.

1240
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:19,570
I got everything in there.

1241
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,406
My whole life was in there.

1242
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,951
His whole life.

1243
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:26,244
Here.

1244
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:31,332
I wanna get the SIM card and the battery out.
How do you do that?

1245
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:36,087
I just got it. I don't know.
Let me see. Let me see.

1246
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:37,630
It's stuck.

1247
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,259
They think it's funny.
They think it's funny!

1248
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:47,932
Penelope.
Penelope. This is not funny.

1249
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,978
My husband has spent
the entire afternoon drying things.

1250
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,772
No, no. This way.

1251
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,905
Forget it. It's over.

1252
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,907
You gotta wait.
Forget it. It's over.

1253
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,580
You wanna use the phone?

1254
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:16,502
I must say...

1255
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,549
What must you say, Michael?

1256
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,802
No. I don't even know
what to say.

1257
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,306
I'd say it feels better
like this.

1258
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:32,226
I'd say it feels better like this.
Wouldn't you?

1259
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,397
Men get so attached
to their toys.

1260
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,483
It diminishes them.

1261
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,359
They lose their credibility.

1262
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,195
Oh, God. Ha-ha-ha.

1263
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,822
I dated this guy once,

1264
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,158
and then I saw him
carrying this bag,

1265
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,785
this rectangular bag
with a shoulder strap.

1266
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:52,830
It's a man's bag
with a shoulder strap.

1267
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,582
It was over.

1268
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:57,460
A bag with a shoulder strap,
that's the worst.

1269
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:00,338
But the cell phone
always at his fingertips,

1270
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,840
that's the worst too.

1271
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,968
Men should have
both hands free.

1272
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:08,596
They should have
both hands free.

1273
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:11,807
I've got a John Wayne idea
of manhood too.

1274
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,809
What was it he had? A Colt .45.

1275
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,978
Something that empties a room.

1276
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,481
Any man that doesn't give off
those loner vibes

1277
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:22,944
just doesn't come off
as having any substance.

1278
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:27,698
Oh. So, Michael, Michael.
I guess you're happy now, huh?

1279
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:31,369
Our little touchy-feely, whatever you
said, is coming apart at the seams.

1280
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:33,371
But, hey, you know what?

1281
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:37,833
This almost feels good,
in my opinion.

1282
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,296
In my opinion, some people can
handle their liquor better than others.

1283
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:44,924
I'm as normal as can be.
Yeah, right.

1284
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:49,011
Yeah. I'm beginning to see things
with a pleasant serenity.

1285
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:52,890
Heh. That's good.
A pleasant serenity.

1286
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:56,227
I don't know why you're wasting
yourself out in the open, Darjeeling.

1287
01:04:56,394 --> 01:04:57,603
Shut the hell up.

1288
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,480
Here. Alan.

1289
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,316
- Relax.
- No cigars in the house.

1290
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,068
You got your Hoyo de Monterro.

1291
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:06,404
You got your Partagas D,
number 4.

1292
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:08,447
You got your Hoyo Coronacion.

1293
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:09,907
Where did you get these?

1294
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:12,326
Heh. You don't wanna know.
Seriously.

1295
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:14,453
The Spanish connection.

1296
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,039
My cookware guy is going out
with a flight attendant.

1297
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,917
She brings home, like,
two boxes a week.

1298
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,170
You can't smoke in a house
with an asthmatic child.

1299
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,715
And why are you telling him
your whole life story?

1300
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,466
- Who has asthma?
- Our son.

1301
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:29,468
We had a goddamn hamster,
didn't we?

1302
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:32,263
Oh, that's true.
Pets aren't good when you're asthmatic.

1303
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,640
No. Not good at all.

1304
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:37,560
Even goldfish aren't
necessarily recommended.

1305
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:40,271
Do I have to listen to this crap?

1306
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:45,443
I guess I'm the only one that doesn't see
things with a pleasant serenity. Heh.

1307
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,528
The truth is...

1308
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,280
I've never been so unhappy.

1309
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,282
This is the unhappiest day
of my life.

1310
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:53,409
You're an unhappy drunk.

1311
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,536
Michael,

1312
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:59,707
every word out of your
mouth just slays me.

1313
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,459
I don't get drunk.

1314
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:05,630
I had a couple of sips of your
shitty 18-year-old single malt

1315
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:09,675
that you trot out like it's
the 18th Wonder of the World.

1316
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:11,510
I don't get drunk.

1317
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,638
I wish I could.
Believe me, I wish I could.

1318
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:19,226
I wish I could just drown every
last sorrow in a good, stiff drink.

1319
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:24,315
My husband is unhappy too. Aw.

1320
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:28,110
Look at him all hunched over like he
was left on the side of the road.

1321
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:32,448
I think this is the unhappiest day
of his life too.

1322
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:35,242
It is.
I'm sorry, Doodle.

1323
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,672
Hello.

1324
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,509
- Hello.
<i>- Mikey.</i>

1325
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:55,262
Mom. I told you we have company.
You remember?

1326
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:58,599
<i>Why do you want me
to stop taking my Antril?</i>

1327
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:01,102
Because it's medication
that can kill you.

1328
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,728
<i>It's poison.
It is not.</i>

1329
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:04,563
Now, Mom, Mom.

1330
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,358
There's someone here
who can explain.

1331
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:10,277
Here. Tell her.
Tell her what?

1332
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:13,781
Tell her what you know about
that poisonous shit of yours.

1333
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:18,119
What can he tell her?
He doesn't know anything.

1334
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:20,913
Hello, ma'am.

1335
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,541
<i>How are you?
I'm all right for now.</i>

1336
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,876
<i>Mm-hm.
They want to take me off my Antril.</i>

1337
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:28,379
<i>Oh.
My operation is a week away.</i>

1338
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:30,214
Yeah. Are you in pain?

1339
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:31,966
<i>I can't be on my feet, doctor.</i>

1340
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:35,469
Yeah. Well, the operation
will fix that.

1341
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,851
Oh, the other leg too, huh?
Are you an orthopaedist?

1342
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,270
No, I'm not an orthopaedist.

1343
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,772
She keeps calling me "doctor."

1344
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:49,066
Heh. Doctor. What a laugh.

1345
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,068
Hang up.
Hello.

1346
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:53,154
<i>Yeah.
What about my Antril?</i>

1347
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,116
Well, do you have
any balance issues?

1348
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:58,409
<i>No...</i>

1349
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:00,828
Uh-huh. Yeah.
<i>Will it kill me?</i>

1350
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:05,374
No, of course not. Not at all.
It can't kill you.

1351
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,209
Don't listen to what people say.

1352
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,880
Still, yeah, it might be a good idea
not to take it for a while.

1353
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,173
<i>For how long?</i>

1354
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,633
Just until this operation
is behind you.

1355
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,469
<i>They're gonna ruin me.</i>

1356
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:19,597
<i>If you could see me, you'd be
surprised how well-preserved I am</i>

1357
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:23,225
Yeah, sounds like
you're in excellent shape.

1358
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,102
All right. You got that, Ma'?

1359
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:27,480
You stop taking that medication.

1360
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,398
Just do as you're told!
Okay, okay.

1361
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:32,651
All right? I love you.
Love you too.

1362
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,280
I can't take her any more.

1363
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:37,823
The shit I put up with.

1364
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:41,076
All right.
Should we wrap this up?

1365
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:44,121
Should I come back here tonight
with Zachary? Let's decide.

1366
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,707
This is getting to be, like,
who cares?

1367
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:49,084
That is what we're here for
after all.

1368
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:52,838
Now I'm gonna be sick.
Where's that bucket?

1369
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:55,633
That's enough.

1370
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,135
That's enough. That's enough.
Oh, pfft!

1371
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:01,472
I'd say both sides
share the blame.

1372
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:02,890
So...

1373
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:06,477
There you are.
Both sides share the blame.

1374
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:10,064
Are you serious?
Excuse me?

1375
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:11,774
That's what you really think?

1376
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:14,401
It's what I think, yes.

1377
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,947
My son, Ethan, who had to take
two codeine at 3 in the morning,

1378
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:21,992
he shares the blame?
He's not necessarily innocent.

1379
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,495
Get out of my house.
You get the fuck out.

1380
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,747
Get the fuck out of my house!

1381
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:30,167
My bag! My bag! My..

1382
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,002
- Alan.
- What is going on here?

1383
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,587
They've totally lost it.

1384
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:36,298
Alan! Do something.

1385
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,260
"Alan, do something."
Shut your mouth.

1386
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:43,806
She broke my makeup mirror
and my perfume.

1387
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:45,516
Stand up for me.

1388
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:48,853
Why don't you stand up for me?

1389
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:51,438
Let's go, Nancy.

1390
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:54,775
It's not like I'm strangling her.
What did I do to you?

1391
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:56,944
The blame is not shared.

1392
01:09:57,111 --> 01:10:00,656
The victim and the criminal
are not the same.

1393
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,032
The criminal?

1394
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,243
Give it a fucking rest, Penelope.

1395
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,704
Enough with
this politically correct bullshit!

1396
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,999
Which I believe in.
That you believe. You believe.

1397
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:13,085
This crush you got
on these Sudan sambos

1398
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:15,087
is spilling over
into everything now!

1399
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,463
I'm horrified.

1400
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,550
How could you be
so openly despicable?

1401
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:24,138
Because I feel like it.
I feel like being openly despicable.

1402
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:26,724
One day you will understand
the sheer horror

1403
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:29,351
of what's happening
in that part of the world

1404
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:33,439
and you will be ashamed of your
contemptibly nihilistic attitude.

1405
01:10:33,606 --> 01:10:37,818
Yes, Darjeeling,
you're so wonderful.

1406
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,945
You're the best
and the brightest.

1407
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:43,073
Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

1408
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,909
Let's get out of here, Alan.

1409
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,870
These people are monsters.

1410
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:50,581
Stop it, Nancy.
No, no. No.

1411
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:55,336
I wanna drink some more.
I wanna get drunk off my ass.

1412
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:59,423
This bitch throws my bag against
the ceiling, nobody lifts a finger.

1413
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,509
I wanna be blind drunk.
You're drunk enough.

1414
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:05,846
How can you let her
call our son a criminal?

1415
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:10,851
We come over here to work things
out with them, and they insult us,

1416
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:15,272
they browbeat us, they lecture us about
being good citizens of the planet.

1417
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,652
I am glad our son
kicked the shit out of your son,

1418
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:23,238
and I wipe my ass
with your human rights!

1419
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,949
Wow. Heh-heh-heh.

1420
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,453
Get a couple of drinks in her and,
bam, her true self comes out.

1421
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:33,290
What happened to that gracious,
demure woman with the soft eyes?

1422
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,876
I told you. I told you!

1423
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:38,128
What did you tell him?
That she's a fake.

1424
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,589
That woman is totally fake.
I'm sorry.

1425
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,634
When did you say that?
When you were drying your pants.

1426
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,804
You'd known her 15 minutes,
and you already knew she was fake?

1427
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:49,723
Yeah. Well, I pick up
on these things pretty quickly.

1428
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,558
- She does.
- I got a nose for them.

1429
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,852
Fake. What does that mean?
I, uh...

1430
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,604
I don't wanna listen to this.

1431
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:57,982
Why do you put me
through this, Alan?

1432
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,817
Relax, Nancy.

1433
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:02,820
She's a phoney. She doesn't
care any more than you do.

1434
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:06,198
It's true. That's true.
It's true. He said it's true.

1435
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,367
They don't give a shit.

1436
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:12,121
It's so obvious right from the beginning.
They don't give a shit.

1437
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,415
She doesn't give a shit either.
It's true.

1438
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:16,166
Like you do?
Well...

1439
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,960
No, let him talk, honey.

1440
01:12:18,127 --> 01:12:20,921
Explain to me, Michael,
exactly how you care.

1441
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,673
What does that mean anyway?

1442
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,634
You're more credible when
you're being openly despicable.

1443
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,013
Truth is, nobody here cares,
except maybe Penelope.

1444
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,806
One must acknowledge
her integrity.

1445
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,225
I don't need your acknowledgement.

1446
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,394
I don't need your acknowledgement!

1447
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,730
But I do care. I really do care.

1448
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,525
Yes, Doodle,
we care in a hysterical way.

1449
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,862
Not like heroic figures
of a social movement.

1450
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:49,158
I saw your friend Jane Fonda
on TV the other day.

1451
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:52,703
Made me wanna run out
and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.

1452
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,414
Heh-heh-heh.
- My friend Jane Fonda?

1453
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:58,208
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1454
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:03,505
You're the same breed, the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

1455
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,257
Those are not
the women we like.

1456
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:09,344
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

1457
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,388
The gatekeepers of the world,

1458
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:14,725
the ones who wanna show off
how perceptive they are?

1459
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:16,685
Huge turnoff.

1460
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:20,731
Even poor Michael,
your own husband, is turned off.

1461
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:22,191
Don't you speak for me.

1462
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:25,819
We don't give a shit
what women you like.

1463
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,280
Where do you get off
just spouting these opinions?

1464
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,700
You are the one man whose opinion
we don't give a shit about!

1465
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:34,411
She's screaming.
Heh, heh.

1466
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,372
Quartermaster on a slave ship.

1467
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,333
She doesn't scream?

1468
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,127
She didn't just scream
that your little asshole

1469
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:44,296
was right to beat up ours?

1470
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,547
He was right.

1471
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:49,426
At least our kid
isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot.

1472
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:53,347
Yours is a fucking snitch!

1473
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:55,641
Let's go, Alan.

1474
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:58,227
Why are we still in this house?

1475
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,437
Exactly.

1476
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,898
Here.

1477
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:06,819
This is what I think
of your stupid tulips!

1478
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,780
Your hideous flowers.

1479
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,952
This is the worst day
of my life too.

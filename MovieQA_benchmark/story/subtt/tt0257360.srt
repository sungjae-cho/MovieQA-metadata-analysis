1
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,395
Well, for my part,
I would just like to say...

2
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,199
that as the new guy
taking over for you...

3
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,191
I hope
I can fill your shoes...

4
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,998
because from the looks
of the people here...

5
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,756
and what they think about you,
they seem awfully big.

6
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,874
As most of you know,
I just moved here recently...

7
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,394
from Des Moines
with my wife Patty here...

8
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,596
and Kimberly our 14-month-old...

9
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,990
and you all have made us
feel so welcome.

10
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,992
Warren, I want you to feel
just as welcome...

11
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,072
to drop by the office
to visit any time you want.

12
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,197
As we've been discussing
the last couple of weeks...

13
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,477
I might have some questions
about our various products...

14
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,155
like the universal life policy
we're launching next month.

15
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,390
And...

16
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,278
Anyway, here's to you, Warren.

17
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,876
Warren...

18
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,192
how do you feel about these
young punks taking our jobs?

19
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,034
Seems like
some kind of conspiracy to me.

20
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,918
I've known Warren here...

21
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,390
probably longer than
most of you have been alive.

22
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,516
Warren and I go way back...

23
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,989
way back...

24
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,469
to the horse and buggy days
at Woodmen.

25
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,596
But that's ancient history.

26
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,275
Anyway, I know something
about retirement...

27
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,797
and what I want to say
to you out loud, Warren...

28
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,872
so all these
young hotshots can hear...

29
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,589
is that all those gifts
over there...

30
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,955
don't mean a Goddamn thing.

31
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,794
And this dinner doesn't mean
a Goddamn thing.

32
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,111
And the Social Security
and pension...

33
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,918
don't mean a Goddamn thing.

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,438
None of these superficialities
mean a Goddamn thing.

35
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,875
What means something...

36
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,350
what really means something,
Warren...

37
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,874
is the knowledge
that you devoted your life...

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,599
to something meaningful...

39
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,990
to being productive
and working for a fine company...

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,311
Hell, one of the top-rated
insurance carriers...

41
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,039
in the nation...

42
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,193
to raising a fine family,
to building a fine home...

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,989
to being respected
by your community...

44
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,596
to having wonderful,
lasting friendships.

45
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,193
At the end of his career...

46
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,673
if a man can look back and say,
"I did it. I did my job"...

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,117
then he can retire in glory
and enjoy riches...

48
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,998
far beyond the monetary kind.

49
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,119
So, all of you
young people here...

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,433
take a good look
at a very rich man.

51
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,109
I love you, buddy.

52
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,472
I'll be right back.

53
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,233
Good evening.

54
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,232
- Vodka gimlet, please.
- Coming right up.

55
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,919
Hello?

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,389
Hi, honey.

57
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,754
Yeah, we just got in.

58
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,592
We just walked in the door.

59
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,591
Yeah, he is.
Just a minute.

60
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,070
Warren. Get on the phone.
It's Jeannie.

61
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,918
Jeannie? How you doing?

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,993
It went just fine, yeah.
Nice event.

63
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,394
I know, but don't give it
another thought.

64
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,040
You've got bigger fish to fry.

65
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,390
I know, but we'll see you
out there real soon anyway.

66
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,710
What?

67
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,870
Did I get the robe?

68
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,758
Yes. That was quite an item.

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,717
You sure went overboard.

70
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,154
From you and Randall.
I see.

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,118
Well, thank you both.

72
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,510
It's sure going to
come in handy now.

73
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,114
You betcha.

74
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,715
OK.

75
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,030
Yeah. Bye, now.

76
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,111
Did you thank Randall?

77
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,839
- I did.
- What'd he say?

78
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,031
I just told Jeannie.

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,951
You didn't thank him
personally?

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,951
- No.
- Why not?

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,679
He didn't come to the phone.

82
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,318
Why not?

83
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,198
I don't know.
He didn't come to the phone.

84
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,590
You should have asked for him.
You should make an effort.

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,717
He'll be your son-in-law,
and you hardly know him.

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,711
I know him well enough.

87
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,870
I wish you'd try to be
more positive.

88
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,394
She's lucky to have him.

89
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,198
Yeah.

90
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,831
My father didn't think
so much of you at first.

91
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,349
Yeah.

92
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,795
Where to, mister?

93
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,996
Looks like you need a ride.

94
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,229
Yeah.

95
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,271
Surprise!

96
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,750
I thought it'd be fun to have
breakfast in here today...

97
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,796
see what it'll be like.

98
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,913
Fine.

99
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,917
Isn't this fun?

100
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,118
Well... sort of
gives us a rough idea.

101
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,436
We're going to have a lot
of good times in here.

102
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,829
Yeah.

103
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,268
Here's to a whole new chapter.

104
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,316
...Angela Lansbury
for Childreach...

105
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,789
and we need people
who want to help.

106
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,031
Throughout the world in
many of the poorest countries...

107
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,715
there is a organization
called Childreach...

108
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,438
that is making
a profound difference...

109
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,512
in the lives of children
just like these.

110
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,989
For just $22 a month...

111
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,718
just 72 cents a day...

112
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,792
you can become
a Childreach sponsor...

113
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,518
and not only personally
touch the life...

114
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,272
of a needy boy or girl
overseas...

115
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,035
but also help the child's family
and community.

116
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,157
Think of it...
just $22 a month...

117
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,869
and a little girl like this
will never feel the agony...

118
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,394
of dysentery from dirty water.

119
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,552
A child like this will
be able to go to school...

120
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,995
to learn and grow.

121
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,991
I'm so glad you've watched...

122
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,550
but now that you have,
what are you going to do?

123
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,994
No, pity and guilt won't help.

124
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,911
The answer is Childreach...

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,788
for a needy child, family,
and community overseas.

126
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,958
I'm glad that you're glad.

127
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,631
Right.

128
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,030
No, no,
you're buttering me up now.

129
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,236
I can't take
all the credit for that.

130
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,950
No. No.
I did use a calculator.

131
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,310
That's my motto.

132
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,392
All righty. Bye-bye.

133
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,789
Hey! There he is!

134
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,711
What do you say, partner?

135
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,633
Pretty good.
How are you doing?

136
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,711
Not too shabby.

137
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,030
I see you're all moved in.

138
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,394
Oh, yeah.

139
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,835
What brings you by
this neck of the woods?

140
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,117
I was just driving by.
I thought I'd pop up...

141
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,509
and see what kind of trouble
you've been getting into.

142
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,273
You know, keeping busy.

143
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,113
I wanted to make sure
you didn't have any questions...

144
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,318
about those pre-teen mortality
risk models I was working on.

145
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,153
They seem pretty
straightforward at first...

146
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,357
No, no. I've got a pretty good
handle on things.

147
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,238
You did a super job
of handing everything over.

148
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,151
Just super.
Smooth sailing all the way.

149
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,392
I have been concerned
about some of those items...

150
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,517
that I walked you through
slipping through the cracks.

151
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,354
It's been nagging at me.

152
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,552
Nope.

153
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,837
A business degree from Drake
ought to be worth something.

154
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,353
Yeah.

155
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,637
Oh, boy. If anything bubbles
to the surface, Warren...

156
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,029
I'll give you a holler.
You can bet on that.

157
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,109
OK.

158
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,950
I got to get
to a meeting out west.

159
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,110
You want to take
the elevator down with me?

160
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,873
OK. Sure.

161
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,509
Great. Great to see you.
Looking good!

162
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,398
- Thank you.
- You been working out?

163
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,711
Hi.

164
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,677
How'd it go at the office?

165
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,797
Oh, fine.
Good thing I stopped by.

166
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,872
He needed my help
with a couple of loose ends.

167
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,554
That's wonderful.

168
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,479
Dear Ndugu...

169
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,558
My name
is Warren R. Schmidt...

170
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,996
and I'm your new foster father.

171
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,232
Let's see.
Personal information.

172
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,958
All right.

173
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,635
I live in Omaha, Nebraska.

174
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,799
My older brother Harry
lives in Roanoke, Virginia...

175
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,314
with his wife Estelle.

176
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,995
Harry lost a leg
two years ago to diabetes.

177
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,550
I am 66 years old
and recently retired...

178
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,871
as Assistant Vice President
and Actuary...

179
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,758
at Woodmen of the World
Insurance Company.

180
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,912
Goddamn it if they didn't
replace me with some kid who...

181
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,151
So maybe he's got a little
theory under his belt...

182
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,708
and can plug a few numbers
into a computer...

183
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,076
but I could tell right off
he doesn't know a damn thing...

184
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,628
about genuine
real world risk assessment...

185
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,676
or managing a department
for that matter...

186
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,637
little cocky bastard!

187
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,032
Anyway...

188
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,671
sixty-six must sound pretty old
to a young fellow like yourself.

189
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,753
The truth is,
it sounds pretty old to me, too.

190
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,752
Because when
I look in the mirror...

191
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,717
and see the wrinkles
around my eyes...

192
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,756
and the sagging skin
on my neck...

193
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,389
and the hair in my ears
and the veins on my ankles...

194
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,835
I can't believe it's really me.

195
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,233
When I was a kid...

196
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,675
I used to think
that maybe I was special...

197
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,548
that somehow Destiny would
tap me to be a great man...

198
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,074
not like Henry Ford
or Walt Disney...

199
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,116
or somebody like that...

200
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,875
but somebody, you know,
semi-important.

201
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,077
I got a degree in
Business and Statistics...

202
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,469
and was planning to start
my own business some day...

203
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,790
build it up
into a big corporation...

204
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,711
Watch it go public,
you know...

205
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,836
maybe make the Fortune 500.

206
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,595
I was gonna be one of those guys
you read about.

207
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,395
But somehow...

208
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,677
it just didn't work out
that way.

209
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,355
Remember, I had
a top-notch job at Woodmen...

210
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,431
and a family to support.

211
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,557
I couldn't exactly
put their security at risk.

212
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,278
Helen... that's my wife...

213
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,476
she wouldn't have allowed it.

214
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,758
But what about my family,
you might ask.

215
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,991
What about my wife and daughter?

216
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,878
Don't they give me all
the pride and satisfaction...

217
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,155
I could ever want?

218
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,558
Helen and I
have been married 42 years.

219
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,517
Lately, every night...

220
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,309
I find myself
asking the same question...

221
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,155
Who is this old woman
who lives in my house?

222
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,870
Why is it that every thing
she does irritates me?

223
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,713
Like the way she gets the keys
out of her purse...

224
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,836
long before we reach the car...

225
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,038
and how she throws money away
on her ridiculous collections.

226
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,790
And tossing out
perfectly good food...

227
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,111
just because
the expiration date has passed.

228
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,633
And her obsession...

229
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,951
her obsession
with trying new restaurants.

230
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,315
Seafood buffet.
Let's go there Sunday.

231
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,789
And the way she cuts me off
when I try to speak.

232
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,917
And she seats the people
who came in behind us.

233
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,719
- The thing that happened...
- I wouldn't mind it...

234
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,476
I hate the way she sits
and the way she smells.

235
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,516
For years now...

236
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,115
she has insisted that I sit
when I urinate.

237
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,998
My promise to lift the seat
and wipe the rim...

238
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,878
and put the seat back down
wasn't good enough for her.

239
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,359
No!

240
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,476
But then there's Jeannie.

241
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,269
She's our only.
I'll bet she'd like you.

242
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,874
She gets a big kick
out of different languages...

243
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,871
and cultures and so forth.

244
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,872
She used to get by
pretty good in German.

245
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,793
She'll always be my little girl.

246
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,757
She lives out in Denver...

247
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,832
so we don't get
to see her much anymore.

248
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,435
We stay in touch by phone
every couple of weeks...

249
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,353
and she comes out
for the holidays sometimes...

250
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,193
but not as often as we'd like.

251
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,953
She has a position of
some responsibility out there...

252
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,871
with a high-tech
computer outfit...

253
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,428
so it's very hard for her
to break away.

254
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,354
Recently, she got engaged...

255
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,468
so I suppose we'll be seeing
even less of her now.

256
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,037
The fellow's name
is Randall Hertzel.

257
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,908
He's got a sales job
of some sort.

258
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,389
Maybe Jeannie is
a little past her prime...

259
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,519
but she could have done
a heck of a lot better.

260
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,795
This guy's not up to snuff,
if you ask me...

261
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,711
not for my little girl.

262
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,158
I'll close now
and get this in the mail.

263
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,515
Here I am
rambling on and on...

264
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,717
and you probably want
to cash that cheque...

265
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,631
and get yourself
something to eat.

266
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,233
So, take it easy...

267
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,630
and best of luck
with all your endeavours.

268
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,918
Yours very truly,
Warren Schmidt.

269
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,154
Honey?

270
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,433
I'm going out to mail a letter.
Do you need anything?

271
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,159
No. Don't dilly-dally.

272
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,555
And I have been doing
some research reading on this.

273
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,279
I actually looked
at a couple pieces of video...

274
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,158
and it just amazes me.
The Liberals in the media...

275
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,312
continue to look for
a dark lining here...

276
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,437
in a silver cloud.
Have you noticed...

277
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,431
What can I get for you?

278
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,594
I'll have a Blizzard
with vanilla ice cream.

279
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,511
What would you like in it?

280
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,398
I'll have some...

281
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,270
Reese's Pieces
and some Cookie Dough.

282
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,670
- What size?
- Medium.

283
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,035
Medium? OK.

284
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,149
Helen?

285
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,832
Helen!

286
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,439
What's the matter?

287
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,318
Honey? Helen?

288
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,110
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

289
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,875
Honey. Oh, Helen.

290
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,511
Oh, my God!

291
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,311
Before we go any further,
Warren...

292
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,868
I want to go over
some of the expenses with you.

293
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,791
We itemize all of our charges...

294
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,632
and break them down
into different categories.

295
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,915
Our professional services,
our embalming...

296
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,831
and other preparation
of the body...

297
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,559
those figures would total up
to about $1,550.

298
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,598
Then for the use of facilities
equipment and staff...

299
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,272
for the visitation
and the funeral service...

300
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,873
In addition to that,
we have some other expenses...

301
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,838
out at the cemetery of charges
totalling about 1,500.

302
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,353
In addition to that,
we also have the casket.

303
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,715
These total up to about 2,700.

304
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,119
Finally, for the use
of our automobile...

305
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,953
and a total of services,
that'll be about $430.

306
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,917
Do you have any questions
about that?

307
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,918
What if I drive myself?

308
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,558
I want to tell you about anger.

309
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,471
Anger's OK.

310
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,757
God can handle it
if we're angry at him.

311
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,717
And I'll tell you why.

312
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,233
Nine years ago...

313
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,910
You OK, honey?

314
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,189
No man dieth to himself...

315
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,952
for if we live...

316
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,917
we live unto the Lord...

317
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,037
and if we die,
we die unto the Lord.

318
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,910
We'll miss Helen so much.
She was the greatest woman.

319
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,151
Just the sweetest, warmest,
most wonderful woman.

320
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,355
I know, I know.

321
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,953
We're praying for you, Warren.

322
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,315
If there's anything you need,
call us, OK?

323
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,914
OK. OK.

324
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,389
- Really, now. All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,638
I can't believe it, Warren.
I still can't believe it.

326
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,278
I know, Ray, I know.

327
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,999
She was just...

328
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,638
She was too young.

329
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,030
She was just so...

330
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,076
I know, Ray.

331
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,835
Thank you.
You're a good friend, Ray.

332
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,439
Take care of yourself, Warren.

333
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,159
You, too, Ray.
Thanks for everything.

334
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,073
- You bet.
- We'll see you real soon.

335
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,039
Nice of people
to bring all this food.

336
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,397
All these cold cuts...

337
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,358
There's going to be
a lot of leftovers.

338
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,679
Oh, Dad.

339
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,198
I know, Jeannie.

340
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,559
She was a very special lady.

341
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,190
I, for one,
am really gonna miss her.

342
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,157
I miss her already.

343
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,151
I know we all do.

344
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,352
Let's drink to her.

345
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,071
Here's to Helen.

346
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,276
They broke the mould.

347
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,191
They broke the mould.

348
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,390
Helen... we love you.

349
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,072
We miss you.

350
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,593
We always will.

351
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,718
How you doing?
You doing OK?

352
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,435
Fine.

353
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,351
You sure?

354
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,953
Yeah.

355
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,031
It must be really tough.

356
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,870
I remember when my aunt died.

357
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,270
It was so unreal.
It was the Fourth of July.

358
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,238
I'll never forget it.

359
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,958
So, listen, Warren...

360
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,350
I know now is not the time
to talk about it...

361
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,749
but if before we leave
you take a few minutes...

362
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,195
to get your mind off
all of this craziness...

363
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,158
there's something real important
I want to talk to you about.

364
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,959
What's that?

365
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,395
It's an investment opportunity.

366
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,754
It's really exciting...

367
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,594
and I want to get you in
on the ground floor.

368
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,750
It's not a pyramid scheme.

369
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,717
A lot of people think
it's a pyramid scheme...

370
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,313
but it's not.

371
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,277
It's almost guaranteed
you can double your money...

372
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,590
maybe even triple it
in the first year alone.

373
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,989
The thing is, Warren...

374
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,036
I'm not going to be
selling waterbeds forever.

375
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,553
I got plans.

376
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,949
We haven't had much chance
to talk about it...

377
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,600
but I got a pretty good
business head on me...

378
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,159
and I've been going to
a lot of seminars...

379
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,878
and listening to a lot of tapes.

380
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,712
- Mayonnaise or mustard?
- I like both.

381
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,995
And don't toast the bread
too much.

382
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,116
I don't like my bread
very toasted.

383
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,954
And I'll have
some barbecue potato chips.

384
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,076
Not the plain ones,
those are your mother's.

385
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,957
The barbecue ones are mine.

386
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,112
You and Randall
can take those plain ones.

387
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,715
They'll just go to waste.
I won't eat them.

388
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,234
Maybe you can eat them
on the plane.

389
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,594
Fine.

390
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,629
It's so good to see you.

391
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,235
I wish you didn't have
to get back so soon.

392
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,471
Can't you take a few days more?

393
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,516
Couldn't you talk to them
at work?

394
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,636
They'd understand.

395
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,628
Heck...

396
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,359
who's gonna take care of me?

397
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,958
Here's your sandwich.

398
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,032
Wonderful. Just wonderful.

399
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,715
Dad, you have to get used to
taking care of yourself now.

400
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,438
I know, I know.

401
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,715
You might have to hire a maid.

402
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,554
A maid?
No. I'll be all right.

403
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,915
I don't need the extra expense.

404
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,118
At least for a few weeks
while you're dealing with this.

405
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,670
That's why I'm asking you
to stay and help me out.

406
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,796
Dad, I told you.

407
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,552
I wish I could,
but I can't.

408
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,551
I've got too much going on.

409
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,995
Even if
I could get more time off...

410
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,957
I've got the wedding.

411
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,474
That's a full-time job
all its own.

412
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,711
Now that you mention it,
honey...

413
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,079
I think you should
consider postponing it.

414
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,797
Postpone the wedding?

415
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,314
We can't do that.
It's all set.

416
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,359
I'm just saying you might want
to take this opportunity...

417
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,238
to rethink things, that's all.

418
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,470
But everyone's invited
and RSVP'd.

419
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,835
They'd understand.

420
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,911
Out of respect for your mother.

421
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,560
She would have approved.

422
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,235
Mom wouldn't want us
to change anything.

423
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,470
The thing is, Jeannie...

424
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,996
your mother and I spoke
a number of times...

425
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,275
very seriously
about you and Randall.

426
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,591
And what did she say?

427
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,671
Just that she loved you...

428
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,591
and she wanted you
to be very happy...

429
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,071
and maybe this thing
with Randall...

430
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,628
She just wanted to be sure...

431
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,518
you weren't
going to have any regrets.

432
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,549
So you might want to keep
your options open.

433
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,111
But she helped us pick the date.

434
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,875
And I was on the phone with her
almost every day...

435
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,635
planning it and ordering things.

436
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,836
I don't know what
you're talking about.

437
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,275
Mom wouldn't want us
to change it at all.

438
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,397
All right!
Have it your way.

439
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,277
You know best,
you and your mother.

440
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,997
Good sandwich.

441
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,634
Dad?

442
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,154
Why did you get
such a cheap casket?

443
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,553
What?

444
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,677
I could tell
you got the cheapest casket.

445
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,318
Everybody could.

446
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,473
That is not true.

447
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,993
I specifically
did not choose...

448
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,991
as you say,
the cheapest casket.

449
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,752
There was
one less expensive...

450
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,910
which they showed me,
and I refused it.

451
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,992
You mean a pine box?

452
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,993
I don't remember what it was.

453
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,231
She waited on you
hand and foot.

454
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,630
Couldn't you have splurged
on her just once?

455
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,711
What are you talking about?

456
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,756
What about the Winnebago
out there?

457
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,195
That's an expensive vehicle.

458
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,271
I didn't want to get it,
but I did.

459
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
That was completely
your mother's idea.

460
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,833
She had to pay for half of it.

461
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,674
She had to sell some of
her stock to pay for it.

462
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,478
That was her decision.

463
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,516
I was willing to go
as far as the Mini Winni...

464
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,750
but she had
to have the Adventurer.

465
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,273
She wanted the whole shebang.

466
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,750
What was I supposed to do?
It was her money.

467
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,752
No, you can't call me
to task on that one.

468
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,195
No, sir.

469
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,633
Jeannie!

470
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,199
In here, Randall.

471
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,033
- Where?
- In here!

472
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,599
There you are.

473
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,875
30-minute warning.
You better get packed.

474
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,719
Randall, did you tell Dad
about that book?

475
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,028
That's right, I forgot.

476
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,951
Warren,
have you ever read...

477
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,678
"When Bad Things Happen
to Good People"?

478
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,955
- No.
- It's really amazing.

479
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,598
It really helped me out
when my aunt died.

480
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,829
You should read it.

481
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,194
When me and Jeannie
get back to Denver...

482
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,713
I'll send you my copy.

483
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,553
The workbook, too.
I did most of the exercises...

484
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,552
but you can write
your answers in next to mine.

485
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,234
Final boarding call
for Midwest Express...

486
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,278
Flight 420
to Denver, Colorado.

487
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,158
So long, Randall.

488
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,037
You'll be in our prayers.

489
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,951
And I'll call you
about that thing.

490
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,155
Thank you.

491
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,878
Well, Jeannie...

492
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,558
Take care of yourself, Dad.

493
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,995
That's a good one.

494
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,071
It's gonna be
a really great shot.

495
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,469
Yeah, very cool.

496
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,869
I got the plane
in the background, too.

497
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,314
- Bye, Dad.
- So long, Jeannie.

498
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,799
See you in a few weeks, OK?

499
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,359
OK.

500
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,351
Bye, Warren.
You take care.

501
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,389
Dear Ndugu...

502
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,716
I hope you're sitting down...

503
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,918
because I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

504
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,236
Since I last wrote to you...

505
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,357
my wife Helen,
your foster mother...

506
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,831
passed away very suddenly
from a blood clot in her brain.

507
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,194
The services were lovely
and very well attended.

508
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,192
Jeannie came in from Denver
with her friend...

509
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,751
and folks drove up from as far
away as Des Moines and Wichita.

510
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,752
It was a very moving tribute
any way you look at it.

511
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,070
I wish you could've been there.

512
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,678
But now that
all the excitement is over...

513
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,432
and the smoke has cleared...

514
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,910
it's just me and my thoughts...

515
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,072
knocking around
in this big old house.

516
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,634
I believe I mentioned
in my previous letter...

517
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,948
that I was an actuary...

518
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,713
at Woodmen of the World
Insurance Company.

519
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,716
If I'm given a man's age,
race, profession...

520
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,518
place of residence...

521
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,034
marital status,
and medical history...

522
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,271
I can calculate
with great probability...

523
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,750
how long that man will live.

524
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,230
In my own case,
now that my wife has died...

525
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,996
there is a 73°/° chance
I will die within 9 years...

526
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,719
provided that I do not remarry.

527
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,591
All I know is...

528
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,674
I've got to make the best of
whatever time I have left.

529
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,196
Life is short, Ndugu...

530
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,716
and I can't afford to waste
another minute.

531
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,517
There's nothing like a hot bath
when you're happy.

532
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,068
As long as you're
with the right person.

533
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,877
I love you so much.

534
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,111
I love you, too.

535
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,991
I love being able to say that.

536
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,829
Now, I don't want to kid you.

537
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,391
Adjusting to life without Helen
has been quite a challenge.

538
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,198
But I think
you'd be proud of me.

539
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,193
Yep, this house
is under new management...

540
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,191
but you'd never know
the difference.

541
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,159
Sure, sometimes
I can be a tad forgetful...

542
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,356
and miss a meal or two...

543
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,318
but I guess that's hardly
worth mentioning...

544
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,277
to someone in your situation.

545
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,315
Helen wouldn't want me
sitting around...

546
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,153
wallowing in self-pity...
no, siree, Bob.

547
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,028
She'd tell me to shape up
or ship out.

548
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,634
So I try to get out
as much as I can...

549
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,712
try to stay active,
stick to my routine.

550
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,713
That's very important in
the face of big changes in life.

551
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,394
Sure, I'm not quite
the cook Helen was...

552
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,268
but I remember a trick or two
from my bachelor days.

553
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,278
It's a lot of work
keeping a household together...

554
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,749
and I suppose eventually
I'll sell the place...

555
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,038
and move to a little condo...
less upkeep and so forth.

556
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,556
But for now,
I'm getting by just fine.

557
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,198
It occurred to me
that in my last letter...

558
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,796
I might have misspoken and
used some negative language...

559
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,950
in reference to my late wife.

560
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,472
But you have to understand...

561
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,189
I was under a lot of pressure
following my retirement.

562
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,671
I'm not going
to lie to you, Ndugu.

563
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,752
It's been a rough few weeks.

564
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,833
And I've been pretty,
you know...

565
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,912
broken up from time to time.

566
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,948
I miss her.

567
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,110
I miss my Helen.

568
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,194
I guess I just didn't know
how lucky I was...

569
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,717
to have a wife like Helen
until she was gone.

570
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,758
Remember that, young man.

571
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,150
You've got to appreciate
what you have...

572
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,629
while you still have it.

573
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,830
Jesus, you scared me.
What are you doing here?

574
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,434
I thought you might
want these back.

575
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,158
Jesus.

576
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,431
That was so long ago, Warren.

577
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,999
It's 25, 30 years.

578
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,116
I mean... Jesus.

579
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,317
I never thought...
She kept these?

580
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,753
I can't believe she kept these.

581
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,400
God!

582
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,074
Stop! Stop hitting me!

583
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,230
Let's talk about this.

584
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,151
You were my friend.

585
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,435
It was all a big mistake.

586
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,432
You went up to Frisco
and things started up...

587
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,590
and we just got out of hand,
that's all.

588
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,671
I'm sorry!

589
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,873
You have reached
Moondog Electronics.

590
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,678
If you know
your party's extension...

591
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,591
Shipping and receiving,
this is Jeannie.

592
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,433
Jeannie?
It's Dad. How are you?

593
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,910
I'm totally swamped, Dad.
What's up?

594
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,230
I have a big surprise for you.

595
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,709
- Guess what?
- What?

596
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,028
I'm on the road.

597
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,156
I'm on my way out to see you.

598
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,630
Right now I'm just outside
Grand Island.

599
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,757
Dad, what are you talking about?

600
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,434
Jeannie...

601
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,035
I've been thinking about things
and how much you mean to me...

602
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,634
and how little time
you and I have spent together...

603
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,188
these last few years
and all of a sudden...

604
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,193
I realized what the heck
am I doing in Omaha...

605
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,874
when you're out there
and I could be with you?

606
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,190
We should be together.

607
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,955
Wait. You're coming now?

608
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,555
If I drive straight through,
I'll be there for supper.

609
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,119
Gosh, I don't think so, Dad.

610
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,792
This is not a good idea.

611
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,677
Sure, it is.

612
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,035
Don't tell me you couldn't use
a little extra help...

613
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,872
with all those
wedding arrangements.

614
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,632
I'll take the burden off.

615
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,757
The thing is, Dad,
Roberta and I and Jill...

616
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,115
we've pretty much got
everything under control.

617
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,158
Use the bubble wrap.
It's too big.

618
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,153
It's such a nice offer,
but let's stick to the plan.

619
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,835
Get here a day or two before
the wedding, like we said.

620
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,835
I assume you won't object to me
sending any more cheques.

621
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,390
Jesus, Dad,
I do not have time for this.

622
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,358
Call me when you get home. OK?

623
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,318
Fine. Bye, Jeannie.

624
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,549
Bye, Dad.

625
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,753
Dear Ndugu, how are you?

626
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,114
I'm fine.

627
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,154
A week or so ago...

628
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,231
I decided to take
a little road trip...

629
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,029
on my way to Jeannie's wedding
out in Denver.

630
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,588
Jeannie begged me
to come out early...

631
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,318
and help her
with the arrangements...

632
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,153
but I told her
I needed some time to myself.

633
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,031
I've decided
to visit some places...

634
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,793
I haven't been to
in a long time.

635
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,030
So much has happened
in my life...

636
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,475
that I can't seem to remember.

637
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,588
Whole sections of my life
that are just gone.

638
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,438
So, you might say
I've been trying...

639
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,478
to clear a few cobwebs
from my memory.

640
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,997
My first stop was none other
than Holdrege, Nebraska.

641
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,753
I thought it'd be enlightening
to visit the house...

642
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,628
where I was born
67 years ago next April.

643
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,915
We moved away from Holdrege...

644
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,116
when I was not much older
than you...

645
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,633
and I've often wondered...

646
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,154
what our old house
would be like today.

647
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,391
Funny, I never forgot
the address...

648
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,436
12 Locust Avenue.

649
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,230
Yes, sir.
12 Locust Avenue.

650
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,352
Can I help you, sir?

651
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,831
No, thanks.
I'm just looking around.

652
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,912
I used to live here.

653
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,991
Here in the store?

654
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,437
Yep. My childhood home
was right on this spot.

655
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,474
In fact...

656
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,790
the bedroom would have been
right about here.

657
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,876
The living room over here,
and the dining...

658
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,999
Well, that was a long time ago.

659
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,832
Before you were born.

660
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,198
Warren! Warren!

661
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,671
Hey, Mom!

662
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,355
Mommy loves you, Warren.
Yes, she does.

663
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,717
Happy birthday, Warren!

664
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,470
You're not gonna believe this...

665
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,068
but we used to have a tyre swing
right out front here.

666
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,953
An awful lot had changed
since my day...

667
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,510
but it was still good
to be home again.

668
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,158
Very good, indeed.

669
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,272
Next stop... Lawrence, Kansas...

670
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,239
where I paid a visit
to my old alma mater, K.U.

671
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,675
I hadn't been there
in years and years...

672
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,196
and now seemed like
the perfect time to stop by.

673
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,315
I even managed to hook up
with some kids...

674
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,439
at my old fraternity,
Beta Sigma Epsilon.

675
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,670
Hence, the company motto...

676
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,593
"As a Woodman clears the way."

677
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,592
Well, Ndugu,
I highly recommend...

678
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,638
that you pledge a fraternity
when you go to college.

679
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,188
After that little walk
down memory lane...

680
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,078
it was tourist time
for yours truly.

681
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,276
I made my way back to Nebraska
and stopped in...

682
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,239
at the Custer County
Historical Museum in Broken Bow

683
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,551
to see their fine collection
of arrowheads.

684
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,998
Later that same day...

685
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,877
I happened
to meet a real Indian...

686
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,552
or Native American...

687
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,790
as they like
to be called nowadays.

688
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,553
We had a nice chat about
the history of the area...

689
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,074
and he really opened my eyes.

690
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,515
Those people got a raw deal...

691
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,637
just a raw deal.

692
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,948
Next stop...

693
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,838
Buffalo Bill Cody's house
in North Platte.

694
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,388
What a remarkable man.

695
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,994
You can read about him
in the enclosed pamphlet.

696
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,432
I pull the Adventurer over
whenever I feel like...

697
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,239
stretching my legs,
taking in a local sight...

698
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,198
or browsing for antiques.

699
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,875
The other day, for example,
at an antique store in Cozad...

700
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,919
I came across a fine collection
of rare Hummels.

701
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,755
I guess I never really
appreciated...

702
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,434
how exquisitely crafted
they are.

703
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,036
Each one comes with its own
certificate of authenticity.

704
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,193
Helen loved Hummels.

705
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,638
Ahoy there.

706
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,279
Yes?

707
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,710
I said "ahoy."

708
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,951
Well, "ahoy" yourself.

709
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,315
John Rusk,
Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

710
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,992
Warren Schmidt, Omaha.

711
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,513
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

712
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,398
but I couldn't help noticing
you got a new Adventurer.

713
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,789
- That's right.
- 35-footer?

714
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,869
That's right.

715
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,872
What a beauty.
Man, oh, man.

716
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,918
I'm pretty happy with it.

717
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,155
Permission to step aboard,
Captain?

718
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,071
How's that?

719
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,993
Can I take a look inside?

720
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,469
Oh! Sure, help yourself.

721
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,596
Thank you.

722
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,194
Oh, yeah, jeez.

723
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,999
Look at all this room.

724
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,595
These pop-outs
really make a difference.

725
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,908
Yep.

726
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,996
You keep a mighty
clean galley, mister.

727
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,196
I've only been
on the road a week.

728
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,589
You're kidding.
This is your maiden voyage?

729
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,999
Yeah.

730
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,389
- And you're travelling solo?
- That's right.

731
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,198
Holy Christ,
come over for dinner.

732
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,999
We gotta celebrate.
My Vicki's one heck of a cook.

733
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,196
If you're free, of course.

734
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,034
I'll have to check my schedule.

735
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,554
Ahoy there.

736
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,269
Ahoy!

737
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,397
Get yourself up here.

738
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,074
I'm Vicki Rusk.

739
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,388
Warren Schmidt.

740
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,675
John was so excited to meet you.

741
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,877
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

742
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,908
Smells delish.

743
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,072
- I hope you like beef stew.
- Yeah.

744
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,477
There he is!

745
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,395
How are you?

746
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,277
Good, good.
Can I take your jacket?

747
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,874
Sure. Yep.

748
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,350
There we go.

749
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,199
- Is something burning?
- Huh?

750
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,113
No, no, no.
I just lit a couple of matches.

751
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,353
Shall we adjourn
to the living room?

752
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,829
- You're almost done?
- Just about.

753
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,751
Warren brought us beer.

754
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,115
Thank you, Warren.

755
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,838
Here, have a seat.

756
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,353
All right.

757
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,839
Right there.
Take that one there.

758
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,914
So...

759
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,434
What do you do
back in Eau Claire?

760
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,910
My brother and I
have a little shoe store.

761
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,753
It's a Famous Footwear.

762
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,628
And, well,
people will always need shoes.

763
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,999
Vicki, here,
she's an occupational therapist.

764
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,230
So that's our day job,
you might say.

765
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,197
How about yourself?

766
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,912
I was in the insurance game,
but I'm retired now.

767
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,278
OK, boys, dinner is served.

768
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,591
This is a couple
we met in Kansas.

769
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,989
Remember I was telling you about
the guy with the wooden leg?

770
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,479
But we loved them.

771
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,949
We spent a whole weekend
with them out in Kansas.

772
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,634
This is Roger and Denise
and their daughters.

773
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,358
Denise is your oldest?

774
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,874
She's the middle one.
They live out in Delaware.

775
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,555
And these little cuties
are Katie and Sloan.

776
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,834
A girl named "Sloan."

777
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,751
I never heard that one before.

778
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,798
Neither had we.

779
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,797
Do you have any pictures
of your daughter with you?

780
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,678
No. Not on me.

781
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,079
I don't, no.

782
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,673
Nothing in your wallet?

783
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,352
Well...

784
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,477
I might have one
of George Washington.

785
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,517
Or Abraham Lincoln.

786
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,555
Who?

787
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,192
Hey, easy.

788
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,635
We're a little low
on truth serum.

789
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,720
If I go get another six-pack,
will you guys be OK?

790
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,153
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah.

791
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,752
Abraham Lincoln.

792
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,637
Back in a flash.

793
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,359
- Not bad, huh?
- I like that.

794
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,476
"Who?"

795
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,314
Here's the little cart
we got them for Christmas.

796
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,470
- Is that cute?
- That's darling.

797
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,834
Those adorable little dresses.

798
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,638
And these are
their christening dresses.

799
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,750
That's quite a family
you got there.

800
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,637
You and John are very lucky.

801
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,598
I know. We really are.

802
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,238
Yep.

803
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,075
Warren...

804
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,674
would you mind
if I made an observation?

805
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,633
Sure.

806
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,109
Well...

807
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,430
you put a pretty good face
on things...

808
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,114
considering everything
you've been through lately.

809
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,192
I know I've just met you...

810
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,159
but I have good instincts
about people...

811
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,356
and the feeling
that I get from you...

812
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,000
is that despite
your good attitude...

813
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,913
and your positive outlook...

814
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,351
I think inside
you're a sad man.

815
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,431
Well...

816
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,071
it does take quite an adjustment
when you lose a spouse.

817
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,594
It's something more than that.

818
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,275
I see something more
than grief and loss in you...

819
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,510
something deeper.

820
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,192
Like what?

821
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,159
I just met you, but...

822
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,949
my guess is anger.

823
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:44,798
Anger and, I don't know,
maybe fear...

824
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,189
Ioneliness...

825
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,159
Well...

826
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,674
I am kind of lonely.

827
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,433
See, there, I knew it.

828
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,789
Can I tell you something?

829
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,189
I'm listening.

830
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,912
I've only known you
for an hour or so...

831
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,798
and yet...

832
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,110
I feel like
you understand me...

833
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,512
better than my wife Helen
ever did...

834
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,388
even after
42 years of marriage.

835
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,234
Forty-two years.

836
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,512
Maybe if I'd met someone
like you earlier...

837
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,474
Oh, you sad man.

838
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,757
You sad, sad man.

839
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,589
You sad man.

840
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,108
Get off me!
Are you insane?

841
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,237
God, what is wrong with you?

842
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,959
I don't know what kind
of ideas you got...

843
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,314
but you better go right now!

844
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,038
- I'm sorry.
- No, no! Go!

845
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,714
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care about sorry!

846
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,678
- I didn't mean to...
- Go!

847
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,910
Can I have my jacket?

848
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,479
Christ!

849
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,789
Go!

850
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,233
Ray? It's Warren.

851
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,554
I know we separated
on a bit of a sour note...

852
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,349
but I just thought
I should call and tell you...

853
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,591
that I've been doing
some thinking...

854
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,148
and some soul-searching...

855
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,835
and, well...

856
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,198
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm willing...

857
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,714
to talk about this
because of all the things...

858
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,598
If you are satisfied with
your message, press one.

859
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,432
To listen to your message,
press two.

860
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,590
To erase and re-record,
press three.

861
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,671
To continue recording
where you...

862
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,273
Message erased.

863
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,113
At the tone, please
re-record your message.

864
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,316
At the end of your message,
press one.

865
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,839
Helen?

866
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,399
What did you really
think of me?

867
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,914
Deep in your heart.

868
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,559
Was I really the man
you wanted to be with?

869
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,800
Was I?

870
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,874
Or were you disappointed
and too nice to show it?

871
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,190
I forgive you for Ray.

872
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,191
I forgive you.

873
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,475
That was a long time ago...

874
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:41,874
and I know I wasn't always
the king of kings.

875
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,633
I let you down.

876
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,195
I'm sorry, Helen.

877
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,637
Can you forgive me?

878
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,030
Can you forgive me?

879
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,079
And so, Ndugu...

880
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,948
I must say it's been
a very rewarding trip.

881
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,712
And this morning...

882
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,155
I awoke from my night
in the wilderness...

883
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,993
completely transformed.

884
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,672
I'm like a new man.

885
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,355
For the first time in years,
I feel clear.

886
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,351
I know what I want...

887
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,431
I know what I've got to do...

888
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,671
and nothing's going
to stop me ever again.

889
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,751
Meanwhile, along with
the usual cheque...

890
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,751
I'm enclosing
a little something extra...

891
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,593
to spend as you please.

892
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,037
Yours very truly,
Warren Schmidt.

893
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,913
Warren,
how grand to see you again.

894
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,831
I hope I'm not intruding.

895
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,638
Not at all.
I was happy to get your call...

896
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,109
and learn that
you were finally in town.

897
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,316
I'll bet that trip did you
a lot of good...

898
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,789
after all you've been through.

899
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,356
I sent you a card.
Did you get my card?

900
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:55,514
Oh, yes.
Lovely card. Thank you.

901
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,431
But I want to say it to you
in person.

902
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,954
I am so sorry about Helen.

903
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,473
I only met her that once...

904
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,552
but we talked often on the phone
after the engagement.

905
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,200
She was a fine, fine woman.

906
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,317
A fine, fine human being.

907
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,675
Thank you.

908
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,990
What can I get you to drink?

909
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,399
I'll bet you could use
a cocktail.

910
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,234
No, I'm fine. I'll wait
till the kids get here.

911
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,153
I am having a Manhattan.

912
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:28,189
What the heck?
Make it two.

913
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,508
OK.

914
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,156
That's better.

915
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,157
This last week
has been so stressful.

916
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,395
The only way
that Helen is lucky...

917
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,358
and I do mean the only way...
is that she didn't have to...

918
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,032
go through this week
with Jeannie and me.

919
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,792
The florist, the dress...

920
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,155
the relatives,
the travel arrangements...

921
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,470
the motels, the bridesmaids...

922
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,551
the groomsmen, the gowns.

923
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,359
And do you realize
how many people...

924
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,556
still have not RSVP'd?

925
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,428
Warren,
it simply does not stop.

926
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,670
By the way...

927
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,274
we do still need that cheque
for the church.

928
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,918
Did Jeannie mention it to you?

929
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,638
Because we've needed it
for some time now...

930
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,188
and actually,
it's been a bit of a problem.

931
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,952
Roberta.

932
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,708
Roberta?

933
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,869
What?

934
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,952
I can't make
this Goddamn thing work.

935
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,235
Somebody really screwed it up.

936
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,799
Would you excuse me?

937
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,957
What is your fucking problem?

938
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,473
Don't you see
I have enough to deal with?

939
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,630
That's why I offered
to come over and help.

940
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,073
I am trying to help.

941
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,958
This is no help.
Look at it.

942
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,268
What do you expect me
to do now?

943
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,397
I will fix it.
Tell me how you want it.

944
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,833
I'm not a mind reader.

945
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,559
Forget it.
I'll do it myself.

946
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,471
Like I have to do
everything else around here.

947
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,393
- Just get out.
- I'm not a mind reader!

948
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,313
Do you understand English?
Get out!

949
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,270
I'm sorry.

950
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,032
You met Larry last time.

951
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,633
Just briefly, yeah.

952
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,314
He's like a little boy.

953
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,914
Ever since our divorce,
he thinks the only way...

954
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,355
he can get my attention
is by causing a fuss.

955
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,431
I understand it, I do.

956
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,069
I feel sorry for him.

957
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,357
My first husband
was exactly the same way.

958
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,874
He turned out to be
a real asshole.

959
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:10,510
Now, Randall, he knows how
to treat a woman.

960
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,070
Honestly, don't you think
he's something special?

961
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,310
Well...

962
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,791
I know Jeannie seems to be
very taken with him.

963
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,759
That always helps,
doesn't it?

964
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,195
When I had my hysterectomy...

965
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,716
that boy did not leave my side
for one minute.

966
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,109
Not one minute.

967
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,633
People used to raise
their eyebrows...

968
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,597
because I breast-fed him
until he was almost five...

969
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,672
and I say, well,
just look at the results.

970
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,194
I raised a sensitive,
devoted boy...

971
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,397
who has turned into
a sensitive, devoted man.

972
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,074
And he's also
quite easy on the eye...

973
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,196
if I do say so myself.

974
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,919
Don't you agree?

975
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,073
Look who's here.

976
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,474
Dad. How's it hanging?

977
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,991
Fine. Fine.

978
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,799
You're finally here.
I'm stoked.

979
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,871
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

980
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,399
God, how was your trip?
I was a little worried.

981
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,993
Just great, yeah.

982
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,799
But I did run into
a lot of traffic...

983
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,598
getting into town
this afternoon.

984
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,990
Ended up veering off
the 25 onto 70.

985
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,196
That wasn't any better.

986
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,195
I guess it must've been
construction or an accident.

987
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,191
That's Denver for you.

988
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,998
You won't catch me
driving on the interstate.

989
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,595
Next time, get off 25 at Speer
and take a left.

990
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,797
That turns into First, which
leads you directly to Gaylord.

991
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,189
That's good to know.

992
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,191
Randall, bring that
into the kitchen.

993
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,556
Jeannie, I need to talk to you
about something.

994
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,551
Sure, Dad.

995
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,789
Can it wait?

996
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,199
It's very important.

997
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,998
I need some time alone
with you.

998
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,311
Definitely.
Maybe after dinner.

999
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,636
Say, Randall...

1000
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,549
How'd that investment situation
work out for you?

1001
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,676
You never called me.

1002
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,110
Don't bring that up.

1003
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,838
You mean that pyramid scheme?

1004
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,399
No, it wasn't.

1005
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,040
All I know is
I lost 800 bucks.

1006
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,475
If you'd stuck with it
a little longer...

1007
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,709
you'd have seen results.

1008
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,153
You bailed out too soon.

1009
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,878
Can we change the subject?

1010
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,757
You didn't find enough
quality reps of your own...

1011
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,637
and you screwed
the whole thing up for me.

1012
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,994
You didn't take the time...

1013
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,548
to understand how
the power system works.

1014
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,837
Principle, ownership, wealth...

1015
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,349
As father of the groom,
I'd like to welcome our guest.

1016
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,032
Larry, we know who you are...

1017
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,394
and you'll have
plenty of chances...

1018
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,471
to make toasts tomorrow
and the next day...

1019
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,710
Will you let me finish, please?

1020
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,916
Can't we just enjoy our food?

1021
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,036
OK, enjoy your food...

1022
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,917
but I have something
I want to say.

1023
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:03,478
I wanted to acknowledge
that we're gathered together...

1024
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,314
around this table as a family
for the very first time.

1025
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,834
And on behalf of
Saundra and myself...

1026
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,876
I wanted to welcome Warren...

1027
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,918
who has journeyed
a very long way...

1028
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,831
to be with us here tonight.

1029
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,558
And, Warren...

1030
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,714
we really, really love
Jeannie very, very much.

1031
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,234
I also want to say
how proud I am...

1032
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,437
Larry, you're
embarrassing yourself.

1033
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,988
You're embarrassing me.
You're embarrassing Saundra.

1034
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,959
- No, he's not.
- Saundra, please.

1035
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,598
Anyway, I'm done.

1036
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,716
You're interrupting me,
and I'm already done.

1037
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,511
Why do you have to spoil
a perfectly enjoyable evening?

1038
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,033
Why do you always do this?

1039
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,236
Why do you have to be
so negative?

1040
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,548
I'm not negative.

1041
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,358
You're just trying to grab
all the attention.

1042
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,715
"I'm not negative."
That's not negative?

1043
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,715
All I was doing was welcoming
somebody into the family.

1044
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,995
Larry, we've
been welcomed by you.

1045
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,433
Thank you so much.

1046
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,672
Now drink your fucking milk
and shut the fuck up.

1047
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,910
- Get some rest.
- OK, you, too.

1048
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,355
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

1049
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,112
- Warren.
- Larry.

1050
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,679
Get a good night's sleep.

1051
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,988
Saundra, nice to meet you.

1052
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,991
- Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

1053
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,433
Good night.

1054
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,276
Jeannie?
I still want to talk to you.

1055
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,634
Yeah, right.

1056
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,233
Well, can it wait?

1057
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,675
Because we got
a really big day tomorrow.

1058
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,352
No, it can't.

1059
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,911
Take your time.
I'll get the car started.

1060
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,274
Good night, War.

1061
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,032
Good night.

1062
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,036
What's up?

1063
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,950
You're making a big mistake.
Don't marry this guy.

1064
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,473
Don't do it.

1065
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,755
What are you talking about?

1066
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,114
The other night...

1067
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,589
I had a dream,
and it was very real.

1068
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,398
Your mother was there,
and you were there...

1069
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,913
and your Aunt Estelle.

1070
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,231
And there was a...
it wasn't really a spaceship...

1071
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,437
it was more like a blimp
or an orb.

1072
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,795
And then a bunch of
weird creatures came out...

1073
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,678
and tried to take you away,
and know what?

1074
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,639
They all looked like Randall.
Do you understand?

1075
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,517
I was jumping up
trying to save you.

1076
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,909
Dad, it's OK.

1077
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,230
You're just
wigging out a little...

1078
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,959
and Mom is not here
to calm you down.

1079
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,076
No. This isn't like that.

1080
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,469
I am begging you.
Don't marry Randall.

1081
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,630
This guy is not up to snuff.

1082
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,199
He's not in your league.

1083
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,918
I can't let this happen.

1084
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,797
I will not allow it.

1085
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,950
Look at these people!

1086
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:53,712
Suddenly, you're taking
an interest in what I do?

1087
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,157
You have an opinion
about my life now?

1088
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,354
You listen to me.

1089
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,436
I am getting married
the day after tomorrow...

1090
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,988
and you are
coming to my wedding.

1091
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,153
You will sit there
and enjoy it and support me...

1092
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,756
or you can turn around
right now and go back to Omaha.

1093
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,158
You come right back here!

1094
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,231
I'm talking to you, young lady!

1095
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:20,152
Good morning,
Mr. Sleepy head...

1096
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,875
Warren, what is the matter?

1097
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,238
I'm fine.
I'm just a little stiff.

1098
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,313
My neck. I'm OK.

1099
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,436
Did you fall out of bed?

1100
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,318
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no.

1101
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,313
I think I'm better off
on a hard surface.

1102
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,277
I don't know.
It seems pretty weird...

1103
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,158
for this to be happening
today of all days.

1104
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,834
I'm sorry, Jeannie.

1105
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,117
I'm sure I'll rally
in a couple of hours.

1106
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,918
The Advil's kicking in
pretty good.

1107
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,390
We've been really stressed out
the last two weeks.

1108
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,596
While you were
out on your little trip...

1109
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,240
we've been barely
holding this thing together...

1110
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,959
and so for you
to just crap out on us...

1111
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,998
I think it's the bed.

1112
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,355
No way.

1113
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,512
That's an Aquarest Z9000.
It's top of the line.

1114
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,238
It's definitely not the bed.

1115
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,199
I don't know. I think
I need something firmer.

1116
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,477
All right, fine.
Let's just deal with this.

1117
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,358
Dad, where's that receipt
that I gave you?

1118
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,998
Receipt?

1119
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,152
For the programs at the printers
you were picking up?

1120
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,595
- It's over there.
- Where?

1121
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,910
On the chair
in my jacket pocket.

1122
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,470
Fine. Randall,
you have to pick them up.

1123
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,993
I don't think so.

1124
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,559
I gotta get Brian and Dave
at the airport...

1125
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,677
Do you think that I can?
I can't do everything.

1126
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,354
I cannot do everything!

1127
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,953
I know.

1128
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,156
- Jeannie...
- Get off of me!

1129
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,189
Well...

1130
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,871
I'll do it.

1131
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,598
Thanks for everything, Dad!

1132
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,240
- Jeannie...
- Fuck you!

1133
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,871
By golly.

1134
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,789
Anybody hungry?

1135
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,871
I could eat a horse.

1136
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,996
How about
some chicken noodle soup?

1137
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,308
Wonderful.

1138
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,156
Anything for me in the bedpan?

1139
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,952
Yes.

1140
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,109
Jeannie told us about your
little panic attack last night.

1141
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,077
And I don't blame you.

1142
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,549
It's a perfectly
natural reaction.

1143
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,949
In the beginning,
I had my own reservations.

1144
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,110
As the veteran
of two failed marriages...

1145
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,952
I have learned a lot
about what works...

1146
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,837
and does not work
between two people...

1147
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,708
and I can tell you
these kids are in good shape.

1148
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,075
They have
a very healthy relationship...

1149
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:27,755
spiritually, emotionally,
and physically.

1150
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,558
And, well...

1151
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,792
you know how famously
they get along as friends...

1152
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,758
but did you know
that their sex life...

1153
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,195
is positively white hot?

1154
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,877
The main reason both my
marriages failed was sexual.

1155
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,554
I am an extremely sexual person.

1156
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,200
I can't help it.
That's just how I'm wired.

1157
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,111
Even when I was a little girl.

1158
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,909
I had my first orgasm
when I was six in ballet class.

1159
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,754
Anyway, the point is
that I have always been...

1160
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,673
very easily aroused
and very orgasmic.

1161
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,797
Jeannie and I have a lot
in common that way.

1162
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,395
Clifford and Larry
were nice guys...

1163
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,631
but they just could not
keep up with me.

1164
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,153
Anyway...

1165
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,390
I don't want to betray
Jeannie's confidence...

1166
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,711
but let me assure you
that whatever problems...

1167
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,916
those two kids may run into
along the way...

1168
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,116
they will always
be able to count on...

1169
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,556
what happens between the sheets
to keep them together.

1170
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,119
More soup?

1171
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,478
No. I think I'm fine now.

1172
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,032
How we doing?

1173
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,391
Just dandy.

1174
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,835
Couple more Advil
ought to do it.

1175
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,639
You look like you need
something stronger.

1176
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,789
Give me a second.

1177
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,359
OK.

1178
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:11,200
I have these left over
from my hysterectomy.

1179
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,669
They've expired,
but I think it's OK.

1180
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,876
What is it?

1181
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,190
Percodan. I guarantee you,
within half an hour...

1182
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,838
you'll be on Cloud Nine.

1183
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,872
Okey-smokes.
So, following the procession...

1184
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,390
I'll have the bride and groom
accompany me.

1185
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:30,392
I'd like the best man
and the maiden of honour.

1186
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,596
To follow closely,
all right?

1187
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:37,231
But don't forget to leave
the bride and groom space.

1188
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,914
They need room
to manoeuvre in here.

1189
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,594
And the father of the bride
Mr. Schmidt...

1190
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,353
will have a seat
in the front row right there.

1191
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,557
All right?

1192
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,198
Mr. Schmidt?

1193
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,998
Mr. Schmidt?

1194
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,835
Want to take your seat
in the front row, please?

1195
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,629
If I could be permitted
a personal note...

1196
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,757
I learned about love
from my parents.

1197
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,277
Two extraordinary people
who were married 62 years.

1198
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:13,399
And they're right here
in this room tonight.

1199
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,357
I can feel them.

1200
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,796
Hello, Mom. Hi, Pop.

1201
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,872
I miss you, and I love you.

1202
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,112
And I know every time
I look at Randall and Jeannie...

1203
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:32,671
I think, Randall's hands
and mine are a lot alike...

1204
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,036
and Jeannie's hands are...

1205
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,076
You seem to have come around
pretty good, Warren.

1206
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,069
That stuff you gave me... wow.

1207
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,675
You gotta write the name
of that down for me.

1208
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,591
It really does the trick.

1209
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,910
I know what'll really get you
out of the woods.

1210
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,309
As soon as we get home,
I'll fire up the hot tub...

1211
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,517
and you're gonna take
a long soak before bed.

1212
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,397
You'll sleep like a baby.

1213
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,152
Tomorrow,
you'll be good as new.

1214
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,391
How does it feel?

1215
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,199
This is incredible.

1216
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,350
I had no idea.

1217
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,830
It's... it's indescribable.

1218
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,559
Didn't I tell you?

1219
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,552
Mind if I join you?

1220
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,398
That's better.

1221
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,596
What a night.

1222
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,036
I was very moved.

1223
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:13,032
I've been so stressed
these last few weeks...

1224
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,872
that I lost sight of the fact...

1225
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,110
that my little boy
is getting married.

1226
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,430
So's your little girl.

1227
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,273
You think about it
from the day they're born...

1228
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,873
and now it's here.

1229
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,632
It's a miracle.

1230
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:30,748
Just think, after tomorrow,
we'll all be one big family.

1231
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,515
And I insist that you
consider this your second home.

1232
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,272
I'll set a place for you
at the table...

1233
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,396
for Thanksgiving
and for Christmas.

1234
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,074
We don't give traditional gifts
at Christmas.

1235
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,799
We make them.
We're a very creative family.

1236
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,475
It can be a painting
or a poem or a song.

1237
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,232
Whatever inspires you.

1238
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,912
And it goes without saying...

1239
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,719
you'll come to our time-share
in Breckenridge.

1240
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,759
Just you and me while the kids
are out on the slopes.

1241
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,914
Here we are,
a divorcee and a widower.

1242
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,719
Sounds like
a perfect match to me.

1243
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,432
What's the matter?

1244
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,876
I have to go to bed now.

1245
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:26,033
Just like that?
We were having such a nice talk.

1246
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,556
I'm all tuckered out.

1247
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,518
Thank you, Roberta.
Good night.

1248
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:59,958
Longer than there've been
fishes in the ocean

1249
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:04,556
Higher than any bird ever flew

1250
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,153
Longer than

1251
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,550
There've been stars
up in the heavens

1252
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:15,272
I've been in love with you

1253
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,593
Stronger than
any mountain cathedral

1254
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,629
Truer than any tree ever grew

1255
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:30,714
Deeper than any forest primeval

1256
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,920
I'll be in love with you

1257
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,393
I'll be in love with you

1258
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,839
Let us pray.

1259
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,679
Dear Heavenly Father...

1260
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,990
our hearts are filled
with great happiness...

1261
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,548
for the union
of Randall and Jeannie...

1262
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,677
"Love is patient. Love is kind.

1263
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:12,275
"Love is not envious or boastful
or arrogant or rude.

1264
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,635
"It does not insist
on its own way."

1265
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,235
And I shall love you
every day of my life.

1266
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,393
And when I say every day,
I mean every day.

1267
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:27,235
And when I say day,
I mean all 24 hours...

1268
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,357
all 1,440 minutes...

1269
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,000
all 86,400 seconds.

1270
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:37,437
Well, a man shall leave
his mother

1271
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,513
And a woman leave her home

1272
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,149
They shall travel far...

1273
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,072
Do you,
Randall Mead Hertzel...

1274
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:55,039
take Jean Boardwine Schmidt
as your lawful wedded wife?

1275
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,633
I do.

1276
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,234
And do you,
Jean Boardwine Schmidt...

1277
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,074
take Randall Mead Hertzel to be
your lawful wedded husband?

1278
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,879
I do.

1279
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,552
Yeah.

1280
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,993
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1281
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,358
I could tell there was something
different in his voice...

1282
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,954
and, remember, Randy,
you called me up?

1283
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:37,070
And he says, "Dennis,
I met this girl last night...

1284
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,914
"and this might sound a little
weird coming from me..."

1285
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,670
"But this is one chick...

1286
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,796
"I might actually
want to see again."

1287
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:55,789
And then he told me
a bunch of other stuff...

1288
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:01,000
which I'm not at liberty
to go into right now.

1289
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:06,114
But what was in his voice
two years ago...

1290
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,760
was confirmed here today.

1291
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,593
I mean...

1292
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,591
You guys are a great couple.

1293
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,353
You know, and...

1294
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,159
you both really helped me
through that thing...

1295
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,435
a couple of months ago,
and I'll never forget it.

1296
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,229
I love you guys.

1297
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,833
I love you guys.

1298
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:32,233
Randall and Jeannie forever!

1299
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,719
Hoist 'em! Let's go!

1300
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,356
They want a little smooch.

1301
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,953
Give us a little smooch here!

1302
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,996
Come on! A little smooch!

1303
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,719
Come on!
These people paid good money!

1304
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,158
There's children here.

1305
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,596
Now I'd like to turn things
over to the...

1306
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,511
Do you want us all to leave?

1307
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,794
I'd like
to turn things over...

1308
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,711
to the proud
father of the bride...

1309
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,791
Mr. Warren Schmidt.

1310
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,830
I didn't get
much sleep last night...

1311
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,790
so forgive me
if I'm a little foggy.

1312
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,633
But you know...

1313
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,154
today is a special day.

1314
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:04,678
We're here to mark a crossroads
in the lives of two people.

1315
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:08,639
A crossroads
where they come together...

1316
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,518
and now walk along a new road.

1317
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,717
It's not the same road
that they were on before.

1318
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,314
It's a new road.

1319
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,553
A road that...

1320
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,836
As many of you know,
I lost my wife recently.

1321
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,352
And Jeannie lost her mother.

1322
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,309
Helen and I were married
42 years.

1323
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,757
She died very suddenly.

1324
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,718
I know we all wish
she could be with us today...

1325
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:56,030
and I think
it would be appropriate...

1326
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,476
to acknowledge
just how pleased she was...

1327
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,950
that Jeannie had found someone
to share her life with.

1328
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,235
A companion.

1329
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:07,799
A partner.

1330
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,035
I recall the day when
Jeannie first told us...

1331
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,759
she had been proposed to.

1332
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,035
We hadn't yet met
this Randall fellow...

1333
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:23,194
so we were understandably
a little suspicious.

1334
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,511
Later, she brought him
home for Christmas...

1335
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:29,273
so we could get a look at him.

1336
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,318
I remember
there was a big snowstorm...

1337
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,518
and Randall here helped me
shovel off the front walk.

1338
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,953
He pitched right in.

1339
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:54,832
But that brings me
to what I really want to say.

1340
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,275
What I want to say...

1341
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,591
What I really want to say is...

1342
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:16,789
Thank you, to you, Randall...

1343
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,394
for taking such good care
of my daughter...

1344
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:24,838
especially recently
with our loss.

1345
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:28,230
Ever since I arrived here
a couple of days ago...

1346
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:32,518
I have so enjoyed getting
to know Jeannie's new family.

1347
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:38,470
Roberta, thank you
for your generosity...

1348
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,676
for opening your home.

1349
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:44,036
Your talent
in the kitchen is...

1350
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:48,318
Larry, your wonderful eloquence.

1351
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,679
Saundra, your skill with
handicrafts is truly remarkable.

1352
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,231
That item you showed me
was so very artistic.

1353
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,108
Duncan, I haven't gotten
to know you very well...

1354
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:05,192
but I could tell from
our brief conversations...

1355
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,272
that you are
a very thoughtful young man.

1356
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:13,474
Everybody else...

1357
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,676
terrific people.

1358
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,716
Terrific.

1359
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,677
And in conclusion...

1360
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,991
I just want to say
on this special day...

1361
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:26,277
this very special day...

1362
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:30,956
that I am very...

1363
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,632
pleased.

1364
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,638
Dear Ndugu...

1365
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,073
you'll be glad to know...

1366
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:13,436
that Jeannie's wedding
came off without a hitch.

1367
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,230
She and Randall are on their way
to sunny Orlando...

1368
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,470
on my nickel, of course.

1369
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,950
As for me,
I'm headed back to Omaha.

1370
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,235
I'm driving straight through
this time...

1371
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,470
and I've made only one stop...

1372
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,472
the impressive new arch
over the interstate...

1373
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,869
at Carney, Nebraska...

1374
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,428
an arch that commemorates...

1375
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,637
the courage and determination
of the pioneers...

1376
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,554
who crossed the state
on their way west.

1377
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,948
You've really got to see it
to believe it...

1378
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,350
and it kind of got me thinking.

1379
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,635
Looking at all that history...

1380
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,995
and reflecting
on the achievements...

1381
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,756
of people long ago put things
into perspective.

1382
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,958
My trip to Denver
is so insignificant...

1383
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,510
compared to the journeys
that others have taken...

1384
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,273
the bravery
that they've shown...

1385
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,079
the hardships they've endured.

1386
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,593
I know we're all pretty small
in the big scheme of things...

1387
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,989
and I suppose
the most you can hope for...

1388
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,514
is to make
some kind of difference.

1389
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,559
But what kind of difference
have I made?

1390
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:34,599
What in the world
is better because of me?

1391
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:37,194
When I was out in Denver...

1392
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,998
I tried to do
the right thing...

1393
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:42,914
tried to convince Jeannie
she was making a big mistake...

1394
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,956
but I failed.

1395
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,836
Now she's married
to that nincompoop...

1396
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,150
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

1397
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,038
I am weak...

1398
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,997
and I am a failure.

1399
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,074
There's just
no getting around it.

1400
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:12,395
Relatively soon, I will die.

1401
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:16,553
Maybe in 20 years,
maybe tomorrow.

1402
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,437
It doesn't matter.

1403
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,748
Once I am dead, and everyone
who knew me dies, too...

1404
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,912
it will be as though
I never even existed.

1405
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,759
What difference has my life
made to anyone?

1406
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,035
None that I can think of.

1407
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,033
None at all.

1408
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,868
Hope things are fine with you.

1409
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:47,796
Yours truly, Warren Schmidt.

1410
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,755
"Dear Mr. Warren Schmidt...

1411
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,559

1417

medical attention...

1419

but he's better now.

1420

"Ndugu is only 6 years old
and cannot read or write...

1427
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,792
"but he has made for you
a painting."

1428
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,598
"He hopes that
you will like his painting.

"Yours sincerely,

1
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:39,938
<i>...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.</i>

2
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,041
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,644
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,157
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:55,991
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,362
I'm drifting.

7
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:03,000
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:06,237
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,607
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,407
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:13,505
Is what it is.

12
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,985
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,082
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,751
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,590
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,299
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:40,402
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

18
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:42,772
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,659
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

20
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,059
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,531
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:12,162
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,731
Mom.

24
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,505
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,806
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,613
I'm curious.

27
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,015
What comes next?

28
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:40,328
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,097
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,467
He said they had

31
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,706
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:56,482 --> 00:03:00,543
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,951
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:07,383
<i>His name was...</i>

35
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,092
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,627
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:23,368
<i>He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish</i>

38
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,705
<i>and they had a son.</i>

39
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:32,742
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.</i>

40
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,251
<i>When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.</i>

41
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:44,560
<i>And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.</i>

42
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:52,232
<i>For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.</i>

43
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,740
<i>One day,</i>

44
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,009
<i>a letter came.</i>

45
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,981
<i>And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,</i>

46
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,178
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

47
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,657
<i>And their son came home.</i>

48
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,632
<i>They buried him in the family plot,</i>

49
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:30,639
<i>where he would be with them
when their time came.</i>

50
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:35,737
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

51
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,210
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

52
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:47,453
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

53
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,886
<i>Papa said
there were people everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,889
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

55
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,514
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:18,882
I made it that way

57
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,354
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,823
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,163
<i>Home to farm,</i>

60
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,460
<i>work,</i>

61
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,730
<i>have children.</i>

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,508
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

63
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,375
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,582
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,425
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:07,199
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

67
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:15,975
<i>Some say he died of a broken heart.</i>

68
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,009
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

69
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,312
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,980
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,317
Sure.

72
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,797
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,997
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:52,343
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

75
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,349
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,622
There's a diary.

77
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,851
This?

78
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,497
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,298
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,304
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

81
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,265
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,777
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,607
Okay.

84
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,720
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,187
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,021
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,324
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:50,964
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,472
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,006
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

91
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,972
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button. "

92
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:04,440
<i>And I was born under
unusual circumstances.</i>

93
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,647
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

94
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:12,221
<i>and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.</i>

95
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,020
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,925
We won the war!

97
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:34,640
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:47,948
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:49,355
Thomas,

100
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,027
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,289
What?

102
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:58,094
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:04,399
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:05,770
Thomas.

105
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,871
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,407
Yeah.

107
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,774
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

108
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,789
<i>And for that, I am forever grateful.</i>

109
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,798
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,343
Thomas!

111
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,678
Thomas.

112
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,848
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,815
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:27,078
What do you have there?

115
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:27,076
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,547
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,914
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,885
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,389
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,860
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,533
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,970
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:59,572
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,951
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:13,821
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,455
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,862
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,865
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,195
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:25,827
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:27,963
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:30,633
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:32,005
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,308
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,438
You're so bad.

136
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,016
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,625
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,221
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,857
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,458
Poor baby.

141
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:00,634
I'll go.

142
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:04,968
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,079
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,115
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,309
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:18,451
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

147
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,421
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,584
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,491
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

150
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,153
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,199
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,495
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,333
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,105
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,578
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,148
Mercy.

157
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,217
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:54,189
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

159
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:02,157
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:06,099
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:09,502
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,200
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,308
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,382
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:23,077
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

166
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:26,313
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:33,722
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,890
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:43,103
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:47,801
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,538
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:51,635
He's dying?

173
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:54,978
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,786
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:03,257
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:07,261
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:14,894
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:18,199
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,831
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,706
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:24,891
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:25,971
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,642
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:37,786
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:40,884
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

186
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,423
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

187
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:48,226
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,430
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

189
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,235
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

190
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,240
He's known as...

191
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,813
Benjamin.

192
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,781
Benjamin.

193
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,622
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

194
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:10,781
I had 10 children.

195
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:14,224
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

196
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,059
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

197
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:23,529
Look, he's prematurely old.

198
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,564
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

199
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,034
Join the club.

200
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,614
He's smiling!

201
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,050
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

202
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,199
Are you right out of your mind?

203
00:16:58,504 --> 00:17:01,871
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

204
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,202
but this ain't yours to keep.

205
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,573
It may not even be humankind.

206
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,120
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

207
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,686
Please.

208
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,602
You never know what's coming for you.

209
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,987
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

210
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,218
Is any of this true?

211
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:59,695
You have such a lovely voice.

212
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:04,929
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

213
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:09,765
That clock just kept going,

214
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:14,972
year after year after year.

215
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:21,183
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

216
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,753
Same old crap every day.

217
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,419
<i>I thought I was like everyone else there.</i>

218
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,586
<i>An old man in the twilight of his life.</i>

219
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,026
Could you make him stop that?

220
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,091
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

221
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,034
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

222
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:43,668
Queenie!

223
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,049
Hey, boy.

224
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,725
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

225
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,355
<i>What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?</i>

226
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,533
Go get him!

227
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:18,334
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

228
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,804
Stay put, child.

229
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,113
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

230
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,542
<i>She was my mother.</i>

231
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,810
Mama.

232
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,645
Mama.

233
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:35,220
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

234
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,685
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

235
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,961
But we're all going the same way.

236
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,996
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

237
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,572
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

238
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,004
Mama? How much longer I got?

239
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:00,811
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

240
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,976
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

241
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,789
<i>Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.</i>

242
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,160
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

243
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,798
<i>I would listen to the house breathing.</i>

244
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,064
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

245
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,737
<i>I felt safe.</i>

246
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,193
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

247
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,202
<i>Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,</i>

248
00:20:57,304 --> 00:21:01,365
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.</i>

249
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:08,203
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,</i>

250
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,942
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

251
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,195
All right, baby, come on.

252
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:28,131
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

253
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:32,534
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

254
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,474
<i>No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

255
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:39,738
Molasses.

256
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,074
Molasses.

257
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:43,873
Molasses.

258
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,376
I learned to read when I was five.

259
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,888
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

260
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,686
He brung home every play
for me to read.

261
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,660
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

262
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,195
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

263
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,701
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

264
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,503
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

265
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:15,873
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

266
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:19,484
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. "

267
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,919
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

268
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:26,450
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

269
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,187
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

270
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:34,521
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,928
You never know what's coming for you.

272
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:43,232
<i>On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.</i>

273
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:48,409
Benjamin!

274
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,314
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

275
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,259
What can I do for you, sister?

276
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:20,566
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

277
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:28,408
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

278
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:30,611
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

279
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
Out, damnable affliction!

280
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:35,384
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

281
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:36,652
Hallelujah!

282
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,227
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

283
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:43,027
And what's this old man's irrediction?

284
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:46,167
He's got the Devil on his back,

285
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:49,534
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

286
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:54,275
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

287
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,208
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

288
00:23:58,114 --> 00:23:59,843
How old are you?

289
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,440
Seven. But I look a lot older.

290
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,009
God bless you.

291
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,088
He's seven.

292
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:13,828
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

293
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:15,624
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

294
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:16,720
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,629
We are all children in the eyes of God!

296
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,031
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

297
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:23,002
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

298
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:25,130
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

299
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,566
It's all right.

300
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,705
In the name of God's glory...

301
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,013
Rise up!

302
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,881
Come on.

303
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,483
Come on. Walk.

304
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,021
Come on, son. Come on.

305
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:43,853
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:47,325
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

307
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:52,229
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

308
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,130
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

309
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:57,204
- Hallelujah!
- ... and divine inspiration alone!

310
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:58,465
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

311
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,870
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

312
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,202
- Yes.
- Come on.

313
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:04,971
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:09,077
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:12,711
Rise up like Lazarus.

316
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,947
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:16,988
Hallelujah!

318
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,354
Yes.

319
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,022
Come on.

320
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,119
Say hallelujah.

321
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,596
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

322
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,528
Walk.

323
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,395
Walk on. Yes.

324
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:35,298
That's right, Benjamin.

325
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,640
<i>Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.</i>

326
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,772
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

327
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,914
Glory in the highest!

328
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:50,182
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:51,415
- No!
- No!

330
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,225
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

331
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:58,855
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

332
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,559
<i>So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.</i>

333
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:05,695
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

334
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:10,342
<i>And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.</i>

335
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,579
<i>You always knew
when someone left us.</i>

336
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:17,171
<i>There was a silence in the house.</i>

337
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:33,527
<i>It was a wonderful place to grow up.</i>

338
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:38,092
<i>I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

339
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:42,900
<i>Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,</i>

340
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:46,338
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

341
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:54,708
<i>For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.</i>

342
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:58,052
I've been married five times.

343
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:02,287
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

344
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,451
Oh, goodness gracious.

345
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,028
We escaped across the river.

346
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:08,496
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

347
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,794
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,734
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

349
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:16,068
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

350
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:19,200
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

351
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,403
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

352
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,378
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

353
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:28,350
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

354
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,962
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

355
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:52,303
You just fooling everybody.

356
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:55,902
<i>What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:57,378
<i>What's Madjembe?</i>

358
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:58,778
Worms.

359
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:01,446
I don't think I have worms.

360
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,643
This is just how I am.

361
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:06,621
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

362
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:09,055
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

363
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,286
I found the medication
under your pillow.

364
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:14,558
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

365
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:17,395
Who said that? Come on, little man.

366
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,363
Hello, children.

367
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,104
Hold, please.

368
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:40,085
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

369
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,482
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

370
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:46,817
Look.

371
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:50,531
What's it like living in a cage?

372
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,100
It stinks.

373
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:54,999
But the monkeys.

374
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,830
They do some tricks there.

375
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:00,770
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

376
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:03,340
She is orangutan.

377
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,306
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

378
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,509
in my cage, with my teeth.

379
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,520
So then what'd you do?

380
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:27,466
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

381
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
You were all alone?

382
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,368
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

383
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:34,909
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

384
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:39,777
But I'll tell you a little secret.

385
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:43,180
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

386
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:46,276
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

387
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,016
But they're scared shitless.

388
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,858
I think about the river I grew up on.

389
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,233
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

390
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,870
Come, I have an appointment.

391
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,835
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

392
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,276
Always ready. Always ready.

393
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,175
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

394
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,278
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,356
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

396
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,187
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

397
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,791
Hey! Hey!

398
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,612
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

399
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:02,390
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

400
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:05,389
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

401
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:11,662
<i>It had been the best day of my life.</i>

402
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,301
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

403
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:16,932
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

404
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,944
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

405
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,514
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

406
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,106
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

407
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,948
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

408
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,983
Was there just company?

409
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,958
It was just Dorothy leaving.

410
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,563
Go on, Caroline.

411
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,758
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit. "

412
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,103
<i>It was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

413
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,173
<i>I met the person
who changed my life forever.</i>

414
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,312
Well, Benjamin.

415
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,054
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

416
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,084
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

417
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,459
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

418
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,929
What elixir have you been drinking?

419
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:18,399
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

420
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,170
That was really something.

421
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,139
Come on over here, you.

422
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,074
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

423
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,844
This is Mr...

424
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:34,644
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

425
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,379
Benjamin's fine.

426
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,353
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

427
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,452
Good people, supper is served.

428
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,658
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

429
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,259
Amen.

430
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,595
- Amen!
- Amen!

431
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,865
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

432
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:58,998
Why do you say that?

433
00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:02,236
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

434
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,870
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

435
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,142
I love birds that can't fly.

436
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,241
They are so delicious.

437
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,888
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

438
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:16,152
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

439
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,193
I had a miracle happen.

440
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:21,323
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

441
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:27,332
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

442
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,961
Thanks. Thank you.

443
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:31,438
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

444
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:35,400
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

445
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:37,775
but he didn't live long,

446
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,347
'cause he didn't breathe right.

447
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:48,212
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

448
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:51,918
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

449
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:54,989
"You can see that it is 5:00,

450
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:59,056
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so. "

451
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,998
Isn't that something?

452
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,935
Again, read it again.

453
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:05,336
Oh, read it again, please.

454
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,739
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

455
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,510
I promise.

456
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,312
"Old Man Kangaroo. "

457
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,281
Are you sleeping?

458
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,313
Who's that?

459
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:24,983
It's me, Daisy.

460
00:34:26,028 --> 00:34:27,494
Oh, hi!

461
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,585
'Kay, come on.

462
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:42,470
Where are we going?

463
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:46,442
Come on. Under here.

464
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,423
Here, you light it.

465
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,618
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

466
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,991
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

467
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:16,041
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

468
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,575
Okay.

469
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:21,010
I saw my mama kissing another man.

470
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:23,473
Her face was red from it.

471
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,242
Your turn.

472
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:32,855
I'm not as old as I look.

473
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,517
I thought so.

474
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:38,930
You don't seem like an old person.

475
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,760
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

476
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:45,128
Are you sick?

477
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:48,868
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

478
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:53,139
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

479
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,905
You're odd.

480
00:35:57,683 --> 00:36:00,550
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

481
00:36:03,722 --> 00:36:05,883
- May I?
- Okay.

482
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:15,566
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:19,103
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

484
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:20,967
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:23,166
You are not to be playing together.

486
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,799
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,071
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

488
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:31,138
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

489
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,653
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:54,996
You are a different child.

491
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:56,865
A man-child.

492
00:36:56,974 --> 00:37:01,434
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

493
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:09,913
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,618
Come here.

495
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,022
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:24,957
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:28,863
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:44,745
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,991
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

500
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:57,328
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

501
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:14,679
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

502
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,273
"... blue eyes. "

503
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,311
Mom?

504
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:24,188
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:27,895
Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:31,161
Want me to go on?

507
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:35,160
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,570
<i>When that baby came,
things were different.</i>

509
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:42,007
<i>Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay</i>

510
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,911
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

511
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,977
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

512
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:53,718
<i>A lot of folks been through
that old house.</i>

513
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,921
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

514
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,289
Going?

515
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,319
Where?

516
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,988
I haven't figured that out yet,

517
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:06,566
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

518
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:09,432
What about your friend, the tall lady?

519
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:10,936
We are not friends anymore.

520
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,304
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

521
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,173
Well, goodbye.

522
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:39,227
<i>Spent a lot of time by myself that year.</i>

523
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,829
Hello?

524
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:45,367
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:48,305
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

526
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:51,434
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:51,545 --> 00:39:54,878
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:57,974
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:01,020
She won't be a bother much longer.

530
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:04,818
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:06,119
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:09,354
<i>As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.</i>

533
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,591
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

534
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,397
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

535
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:17,834
<i>It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least</i>

536
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,463
<i>make the greatest impression on us.</i>

537
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:23,405
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

538
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:27,309
<i>And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

539
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:30,974
<i>Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

540
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:35,050
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

541
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:43,054
It's not about how well you play.

542
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:46,629
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

543
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:48,063
Try this.

544
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:07,647
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

545
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,718
<i>There were many changes.</i>

546
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:20,889
<i>Some you could see,
some you couldn't.</i>

547
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,866
<i>Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,</i>

548
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:27,371
<i>along with other things.</i>

549
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:31,403
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

550
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:35,139
Darling, the pain.

551
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,771
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

552
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:42,980
<i>Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,</i>

553
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:46,080
<i>a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...</i>

554
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,022
Not doing too good?

555
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:52,157
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

556
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm gonna ride it out.

557
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:57,532
There.
That should make things much easier.

558
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:04,168
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

559
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,766
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

560
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:09,846
Couldn't go without him.

561
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:13,043
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,412
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

563
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,419
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

564
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:18,749
Sure.

565
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,964
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws... "

566
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:42,875
<i>...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.</i>

567
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:44,913
<i>These were hard times.</i>

568
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,647
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

569
00:42:52,588 --> 00:42:55,989
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

570
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:04,796
My fourth hand didn't show up.

571
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:10,494
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

572
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,137
What's the matter?

573
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:16,973
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

574
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,637
He never pays.

575
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:22,413
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

576
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,885
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

577
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:29,354
I think.

578
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:35,762
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:39,322
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,467
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

581
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:47,837
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:49,274
<i>I would do anything.</i>

583
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,810
Yes, Captain!

584
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:53,210
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:55,644
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:56,485 --> 00:44:00,945
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.</i>

587
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,956
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

588
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,861
<i>He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.</i>

589
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,626
Get moving, then.

590
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,056
Come here.

591
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:19,230
Can you still get it up?

592
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:22,599
I do every morning.

593
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:26,678
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

594
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:28,611
I guess.

595
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:33,846
When was the last time
you had a woman?

596
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,290
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,851
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,125
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:48,061
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

600
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:51,432
and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:59,169
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

602
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:01,875
Never?

603
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:03,741
No.

604
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:10,482
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

605
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,093
What did your father do?

606
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:25,227
I never met my father.

607
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:27,272
You lucky bastard.

608
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:30,802
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

609
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:36,846
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

610
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:39,616
this little, fat bastard.

611
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:41,413
"Tug Irish," they called him.

612
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,887
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

613
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:49,488
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat. "

614
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:51,563
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:45:51,964 --> 00:45:54,626
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

616
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:57,031
Absolutely! Damn right!

617
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:02,399
So you know
what my father says to me?

618
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:07,678
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

619
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:10,509
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

620
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:12,477
So I tell him.

621
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:16,315
"Well, if you're asking,

622
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,614
"I want to be an artist. "

623
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:23,092
He laughs.

624
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:28,588
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

625
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:31,327
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do. "

626
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:34,666
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

627
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,870
A tattoo artist!

628
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:44,110
I put on every one of these myself.

629
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:50,451
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

630
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,747
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

631
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:57,426
That one.

632
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:02,392
Don't let anyone tell you different.

633
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,093
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

634
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:08,295
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

635
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:11,203
But you're a tugboat captain.

636
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:13,537
Captain Mike?

637
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:16,373
We're ready for you and your friend.

638
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:21,140
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

639
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,048
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

640
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:26,155
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

641
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:29,416
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:32,552
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

643
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:36,761
How are you tonight, grandpa?

644
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,561
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

645
00:47:45,308 --> 00:47:48,970
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

646
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:51,340
Again.

647
00:47:52,648 --> 00:47:54,980
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

648
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:57,211
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

649
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:01,016
<i>It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.</i>

650
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:03,488
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

651
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:05,787
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

652
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:25,140
It's nasty out.

653
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,515
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

654
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,548
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

655
00:48:41,896 --> 00:48:44,364
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

656
00:48:45,032 --> 00:48:47,125
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

657
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:50,529
It's a pleasure to know you.

658
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:55,304
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

659
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:56,774
All right.

660
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,343
Evening, Mr. Button.

661
00:49:04,919 --> 00:49:06,853
What'll it be, sir?

662
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:10,614
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

663
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:13,091
With whiskey, not brandy.

664
00:49:13,194 --> 00:49:14,684
You don't drink, do you?

665
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,389
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

666
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,556
I've never been to a brothel, either.

667
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,430
Well, it's an experience.

668
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:25,663
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

669
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:28,172
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

670
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:35,042
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

671
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:38,010
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

672
00:49:38,118 --> 00:49:39,676
What kind of disease?

673
00:49:39,786 --> 00:49:41,515
I was born old.

674
00:49:43,056 --> 00:49:44,751
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

675
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:47,383
There's nothing wrong with old age.

676
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:59,295
My wife passed away many years ago.

677
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,537
I'm so, so sorry.

678
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:05,874
She died in childbirth.

679
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,906
- To children.
- To mothers.

680
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:19,019
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

681
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:23,254
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

682
00:50:25,464 --> 00:50:27,830
Our biggest competition
is B.F. Goodrich

683
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,662
and his infernal zippers.

684
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:32,566
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

685
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:34,696
One for the road, Benjamin?

686
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:37,640
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

687
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:41,379
So, what line of work do you do?

688
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,249
I'm a tugboat man.

689
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:53,481
I enjoyed talking to you.

690
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:56,085
I enjoyed drinking with you.

691
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:01,096
Benjamin?

692
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,635
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

693
00:51:04,736 --> 00:51:08,137
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

694
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,436
Good night, Benjamin.

695
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:12,540
Drive on.

696
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:19,547
Where have you been?

697
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:24,645
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

698
00:51:27,425 --> 00:51:29,620
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

699
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:33,721
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.</i>

700
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:38,999
<i>One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.</i>

701
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:41,264
<i>She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.</i>

702
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:43,066
Benjamin! Come on!

703
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,805
Okay.

704
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,634
<i>I loved those weekends
when she'd come</i>

705
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:50,542
<i>and spend the night
with her grandmother.</i>

706
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:01,090
Daisy. Daisy.

707
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,419
You want to see something?

708
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:10,362
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

709
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:17,270
Come on.

710
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:22,203
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

711
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,905
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

712
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,384
Is he okay?

713
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:40,928
Captain?

714
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:44,055
Captain Mike?

715
00:52:47,803 --> 00:52:50,499
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

716
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:53,972
Do you know what day it is?

717
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:55,338
Sunday?

718
00:52:55,444 --> 00:52:57,571
Do you know what that means?

719
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:01,313
Means I was very drunk last night.

720
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,180
Well, you're drunk every night.

721
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:08,918
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

722
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:10,749
I want to show her the river.

723
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:14,158
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

724
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,457
I could lose my license.

725
00:53:27,275 --> 00:53:28,742
What are you waiting for?

726
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:02,033
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

727
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,604
She's flying now, huh?

728
00:54:06,146 --> 00:54:07,773
Ahoy, sailor!

729
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,684
I wish we could go with them.

730
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:22,958
Did you say something, Mom?

731
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:32,704
It's getting really bad.

732
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,503
Can you hear me, Mom?

733
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:41,807
Time just seeped out of me.

734
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:50,385
"Things were changing quickly. "

735
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,586
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

736
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,098
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

737
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:02,497
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

738
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:06,504
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

739
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:09,439
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

740
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,442
It's an awful responsibility.

741
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:15,104
<i>I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.</i>

742
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:20,809
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

743
00:55:21,286 --> 00:55:24,653
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

744
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:32,219
<i>And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.</i>

745
00:55:33,965 --> 00:55:36,763
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

746
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:49,278
<i>She taught me how to play the piano.</i>

747
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,643
- Amen.
- Amen.

748
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:53,912
<i>And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.</i>

749
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,922
Let's go.

750
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,892
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

751
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,291
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

752
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,854
<i>Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.</i>

753
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,269
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,</i>

754
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,204
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

755
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:19,640
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

756
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:24,203
<i>I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.</i>

757
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,044
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

758
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,620
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

759
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:38,060
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

760
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:42,493
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

761
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,395
Be safe, hear?

762
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,182
Benjamin!

763
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,916
- Where you going?
- To sea.

764
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,384
I'll send you a postcard.

765
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,163
From everywhere.

766
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,859
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

767
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:34,246
Can you imagine?

768
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:42,750
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

769
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,294
Every place he worked.

770
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,689
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

771
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,360
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

772
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,903
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

773
00:58:01,943 --> 00:58:04,173
<i>Captain Mike had contracted
for three years</i>

774
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,577
<i>with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.</i>

775
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:10,550
<i>The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

776
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:13,552
<i>We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

777
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:17,055
<i>We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.</i>

778
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:20,491
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

779
00:58:20,594 --> 00:58:22,994
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

780
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:25,327
<i>who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,</i>

781
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:28,493
<i>once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.</i>

782
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:32,163
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

783
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:34,400
<i>There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.</i>

784
00:58:34,508 --> 00:58:36,339
All hands lost at sea.

785
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:38,674
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

786
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:42,914
<i>And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.</i>

787
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:46,180
<i>Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.</i>

788
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:49,736
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:51,183
I wrote him constantly.

790
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:57,820
<i>I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City</i>

791
00:58:58,398 --> 00:59:01,060
<i>for the School of American Ballet.</i>

792
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,566
Please stay.

793
00:59:02,669 --> 00:59:04,796
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:59:06,773 --> 00:59:08,035
You can stay.

795
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:13,603
<i>But I was relegated to the corps.</i>

796
00:59:13,947 --> 00:59:16,313
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

797
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,144
Benjamin!

798
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:25,257
How is it when you showed up

799
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:29,226
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

800
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:33,527
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

801
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:36,428
or you sprouted?

802
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:39,100
What's your secret?

803
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,097
Well, Captain,

804
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:45,706
you do drink a lot.

805
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:54,782
<i>We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

806
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,651
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
00:59:57,756 --> 01:00:01,214
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

808
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,657
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

809
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:10,129
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

810
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,062
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

811
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:18,540
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

812
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:22,207
This is no ordinary bird.

813
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:24,973
This is a frickin' miracle.

814
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:32,054
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

815
01:00:32,723 --> 01:00:34,918
and you know what they saw?

816
01:00:35,426 --> 01:00:38,224
Their wingtips are doing that.

817
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:46,100
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

818
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:50,630
Infinity.

819
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:52,072
Infinity!

820
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,481
<i>Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,</i>

821
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:02,610
<i>the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.</i>

822
01:01:03,554 --> 01:01:05,920
<i>They were drunk every single night.</i>

823
01:01:06,023 --> 01:01:07,547
Three, please.

824
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:09,249
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

825
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,623
Thank you very much. Good evening.

826
01:01:11,728 --> 01:01:14,424
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

827
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:17,830
<i>She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.</i>

828
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:20,732
<i>But she was pretty as any picture to me.</i>

829
01:01:22,038 --> 01:01:24,063
What are you looking at?

830
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:28,834
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

831
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:30,310
never to go to bed sober.

832
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:32,813
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

833
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,975
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

834
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,987
<i>He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

835
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:40,716
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

836
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:43,691
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

837
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:45,818
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

838
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,359
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

839
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,064
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

840
01:02:01,477 --> 01:02:03,638
<i>They were long days there.</i>

841
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:13,121
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

842
01:02:15,324 --> 01:02:18,885
<i>One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.</i>

843
01:02:20,329 --> 01:02:21,853
I'm sorry.

844
01:02:23,732 --> 01:02:25,461
I couldn't sleep.

845
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,837
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

846
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,581
Oh, no. Thank you.

847
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,980
Milk? Honey?

848
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,559
A bit of honey, please.

849
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,857
I hope you like flies in your honey.

850
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:30,623
Oh, perhaps not.

851
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:49,711
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

852
01:03:50,717 --> 01:03:51,911
Steep?

853
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:53,343
Soak.

854
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,283
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

855
01:03:57,391 --> 01:04:00,622
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

856
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,820
Well, quite right.

857
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:14,137
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

858
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,970
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

859
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:19,203
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

860
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:22,712
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

861
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:35,824
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

862
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:39,125
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

863
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:42,533
Something's been keeping me up.

864
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:44,963
My father, in his 80s,

865
01:04:45,071 --> 01:04:48,336
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

866
01:04:48,974 --> 01:04:52,101
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

867
01:04:52,877 --> 01:04:55,641
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

868
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:58,680
- Did he?
- Did he what?

869
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:00,444
Die in his sleep?

870
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:04,747
He died sitting in his favorite chair

871
01:05:04,856 --> 01:05:07,484
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

872
01:05:07,592 --> 01:05:10,060
He must have known something.

873
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:20,863
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

874
01:05:20,972 --> 01:05:24,305
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

875
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:27,867
but it never seemed to work out.

876
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:31,042
Have you been in the Far East?

877
01:05:31,149 --> 01:05:33,344
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

878
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:35,885
I mean, outside of harbors.

879
01:05:35,987 --> 01:05:37,647
And where is it that you're from?

880
01:05:37,755 --> 01:05:40,246
New Orleans. Louisiana.

881
01:05:41,759 --> 01:05:44,057
I didn't know there was another.

882
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:51,391
<i>And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

883
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:55,904
<i>And we talked till just before the dawn.</i>

884
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,407
I'm just a lush, myself.

885
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:03,446
<i>And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.</i>

886
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:12,185
<i>But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.</i>

887
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:21,429
<i>A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.</i>

888
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,201
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

889
01:06:28,638 --> 01:06:30,731
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

890
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,606
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

891
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,747
<i>There's something peaceful,
even comforting</i>

892
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:44,081
<i>knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds</i>

893
01:06:44,187 --> 01:06:46,417
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

894
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:52,460
<i>Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night</i>

895
01:06:52,995 --> 01:06:55,156
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

896
01:06:57,767 --> 01:07:00,565
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

897
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,194
Beg pardon?

898
01:07:02,305 --> 01:07:06,104
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

899
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,233
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

900
01:07:08,343 --> 01:07:11,870
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

901
01:07:17,652 --> 01:07:19,085
Good night.

902
01:07:21,423 --> 01:07:22,720
Murmansk.

903
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,420
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love. "

904
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:29,724
Mom?

905
01:07:33,568 --> 01:07:36,093
That was over 60 years ago.

906
01:07:37,405 --> 01:07:38,429
Did you love him, Mother?

907
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,304
What does a girl know about love?

908
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:16,103
Well...

909
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:22,378
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

910
01:08:24,652 --> 01:08:27,712
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

911
01:08:27,821 --> 01:08:30,847
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

912
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:35,917
but the caviar and the vodka

913
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:40,592
are sublime and plentiful.

914
01:08:44,404 --> 01:08:45,666
So.

915
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:52,274
Savor it.

916
01:08:54,414 --> 01:08:56,382
And don't eat it all at once,

917
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:59,576
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

918
01:09:01,254 --> 01:09:05,588
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

919
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:23,305
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

920
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:26,136
Not on Sundays.

921
01:09:28,347 --> 01:09:30,076
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

922
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:31,809
No, ma'am.

923
01:09:37,656 --> 01:09:39,317
When I was 19,

924
01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:46,594
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

925
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:48,998
Really?

926
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:52,660
But the current that day
was so strong that,

927
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:55,865
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

928
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:59,069
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

929
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:03,878
And when I was two miles from Calais,

930
01:10:05,016 --> 01:10:06,745
<i>it started to rain.</i>

931
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:09,385
That's it! Steady on!

932
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,548
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

933
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:15,591
I stopped.

934
01:10:16,994 --> 01:10:18,586
<i>I just stopped.</i>

935
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:24,065
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

936
01:10:24,802 --> 01:10:26,667
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

937
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:31,268
But I never did.

938
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:36,942
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

939
01:10:41,085 --> 01:10:43,110
Your hands are so coarse.

940
01:10:53,463 --> 01:10:56,023
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

941
01:11:02,806 --> 01:11:05,297
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

942
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:14,445
<i>It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.</i>

943
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:17,418
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

944
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:29,956
I think you make me feel younger.

945
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:32,590
You make me feel years younger, too.

946
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,293
I wish I was.

947
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,431
So many things I'd change.

948
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,472
I'd undo all my mistakes.

949
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:42,271
What mistakes?

950
01:11:45,614 --> 01:11:47,775
I kept waiting, you know?

951
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:52,911
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

952
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:55,918
Do something.

953
01:11:57,493 --> 01:12:00,724
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

954
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:02,663
Wasted time.

955
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:11,371
If we're going to have an affair,

956
01:12:12,107 --> 01:12:14,940
you're never to look at me
during the day.

957
01:12:15,577 --> 01:12:18,511
And we're always to part before sunrise.

958
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,808
And we will never say "I love you. "

959
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:25,248
Those are the rules.

960
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:30,016
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

961
01:12:30,124 --> 01:12:32,058
Oh, you! You're frozen.

962
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,357
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

963
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:11,827
<i>She was the first woman
that ever loved me.</i>

964
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:16,029
You want me to skip some?

965
01:13:16,136 --> 01:13:21,904
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

966
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:28,047
"I couldn't wait to see her again. "

967
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,259
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

968
01:13:43,863 --> 01:13:46,160
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

969
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:51,466
<i>But each time seemed new
and different.</i>

970
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:54,304
Come here.

971
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,179
Elizabeth.

972
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:05,949
Good night.

973
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:10,281
<i>Until one night.</i>

974
01:14:47,558 --> 01:14:53,155
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

975
01:14:53,264 --> 01:14:56,358
<i>a date which will live in infamy...</i>

976
01:14:56,467 --> 01:15:00,597
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

977
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,097
possibly beyond.

978
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:07,069
There's been a change of plan, lads.

979
01:15:07,278 --> 01:15:09,872
As you may or may not know,

980
01:15:09,981 --> 01:15:12,575
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

981
01:15:13,017 --> 01:15:16,474
Frank D. RooseveIt's asked
each of us to do our part.

982
01:15:16,987 --> 01:15:21,083
<i>The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.</i>

983
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:24,790
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

984
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:30,664
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

985
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:34,965
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

986
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:41,234
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

987
01:15:41,345 --> 01:15:43,336
My wife's doing poorly.

988
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:46,177
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

989
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,718
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

990
01:15:57,361 --> 01:15:59,124
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

991
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:03,289
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

992
01:16:03,399 --> 01:16:05,765
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

993
01:16:05,868 --> 01:16:08,496
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

994
01:16:08,604 --> 01:16:13,007
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

995
01:16:13,109 --> 01:16:15,077
What the hell?

996
01:16:15,177 --> 01:16:19,511
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

997
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:24,682
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

998
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,323
<i>She had left a note.</i>

999
01:16:34,697 --> 01:16:37,427
<i>She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you. "</i>

1000
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,792
<i>And that was it.</i>

1001
01:16:43,038 --> 01:16:46,097
<i>It wasn't the war any of us expected.</i>

1002
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,836
<i>We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.</i>

1003
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,414
<i>If there was a war, we didn't see it.</i>

1004
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:59,377
<i>There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1005
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:01,682
<i>But most of all, he loved America.</i>

1006
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:04,691
There is no other country in the world.

1007
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:05,885
When you spell America...

1008
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:10,158
<i>His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1009
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:13,359
<i>His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.</i>

1010
01:17:13,468 --> 01:17:17,996
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1011
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:21,701
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1012
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,769
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1013
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:45,365
Hey. I've been watching you.

1014
01:17:46,533 --> 01:17:48,330
You seem trustworthy.

1015
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:52,230
If something happens to me,

1016
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,870
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1017
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:03,507
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1018
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:08,684
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1019
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,290
All hands on deck!

1020
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:44,083
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1021
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:48,259
All stop!

1022
01:18:50,997 --> 01:18:52,988
Pleasant, man that light.

1023
01:19:00,872 --> 01:19:05,036
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1024
01:19:07,445 --> 01:19:09,709
<i>We were first to arrive at the scene.</i>

1025
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:13,375
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1026
01:19:18,523 --> 01:19:20,423
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1027
01:19:34,372 --> 01:19:35,771
Fellas!

1028
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:46,807
Sub!

1029
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:54,420
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1030
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,458
Battle stations!

1031
01:20:08,339 --> 01:20:09,328
Thank you, Chief.

1032
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:12,734
What?

1033
01:20:25,723 --> 01:20:27,519
Is that the last one?

1034
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,365
Captain!

1035
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,648
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1036
01:22:09,924 --> 01:22:11,755
Give me your other hand.

1037
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:18,155
You'll be all right, Captain.

1038
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:22,531
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1039
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:27,097
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1040
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,774
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1041
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,210
But when it comes to the end,

1042
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:42,149
you have to let go.

1043
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:50,390
Captain?

1044
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:14,550
<i>Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.</i>

1045
01:23:16,856 --> 01:23:20,087
<i>I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.</i>

1046
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,257
<i>John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.</i>

1047
01:23:25,764 --> 01:23:28,460
<i>I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.</i>

1048
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:32,361
<i>I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,</i>

1049
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:37,135
<i>and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.</i>

1050
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:44,071
<i>I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,</i>

1051
01:23:44,183 --> 01:23:46,743
<i>all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen</i>

1052
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:49,787
<i>or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.</i>

1053
01:23:50,856 --> 01:23:52,653
This don't get fixed.

1054
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,820
<i>Out here, death didn't seem natural.</i>

1055
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:18,009
<i>I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.</i>

1056
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:21,142
<i>Before or since.</i>

1057
01:24:27,173 --> 01:24:33,408
<i>And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,</i>

1058
01:24:33,513 --> 01:24:34,614
<i>I came home.</i>

1059
01:24:35,515 --> 01:24:38,109
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1060
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:39,582
I'm coming!

1061
01:24:40,486 --> 01:24:44,115
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1062
01:24:44,223 --> 01:24:45,713
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1063
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:57,501
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1064
01:24:58,403 --> 01:25:00,337
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1065
01:25:00,439 --> 01:25:03,704
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1066
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:05,470
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1067
01:25:05,577 --> 01:25:06,737
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1068
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:09,006
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1069
01:25:09,114 --> 01:25:13,016
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1070
01:25:13,118 --> 01:25:15,382
Younger than the springtime.

1071
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:19,116
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1072
01:25:19,224 --> 01:25:22,853
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1073
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:24,826
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1074
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:27,455
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1075
01:25:27,566 --> 01:25:31,297
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely. "

1076
01:25:31,403 --> 01:25:33,894
Remember what I told you?

1077
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:35,632
"You never know
what's coming for you"?

1078
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:37,641
That's right. Sit down.

1079
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:43,139
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1080
01:25:45,249 --> 01:25:49,481
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1081
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:53,752
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1082
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:57,988
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1083
01:25:58,095 --> 01:26:01,587
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1084
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:07,936
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1085
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:11,496
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1086
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:15,872
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1087
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,447
They all just about new.

1088
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:21,450
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1089
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:24,281
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1090
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:27,515
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1091
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:29,489
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1092
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:34,254
Benjamin.

1093
01:26:34,364 --> 01:26:37,492
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1094
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,627
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1095
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,639
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1096
01:26:48,778 --> 01:26:51,372
<i>It's a funny thing about coming home.</i>

1097
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:55,814
<i>Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.</i>

1098
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:02,422
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1099
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:07,460
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1100
01:27:13,335 --> 01:27:16,771
<i>You realize what's changed is you.</i>

1101
01:27:19,441 --> 01:27:23,468
<i>And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...</i>

1102
01:27:23,879 --> 01:27:25,210
Thank you.

1103
01:27:47,302 --> 01:27:48,360
Hey.

1104
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,808
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1105
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:04,176
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1106
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:09,890
Oh, my God!

1107
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:15,094
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1108
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:20,065
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

1109
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,897
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1110
01:28:23,004 --> 01:28:24,403
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1111
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:28,498
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1112
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:32,340
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1113
01:28:32,446 --> 01:28:36,314
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1114
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:39,881
You stopped writing.

1115
01:28:41,988 --> 01:28:47,085
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1116
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:50,590
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen. "

1117
01:28:50,697 --> 01:28:52,028
Beautiful.

1118
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:56,031
"The most beautiful. "

1119
01:28:57,837 --> 01:28:59,566
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1120
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:02,733
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1121
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:07,438
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1122
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:09,515
No, no, what do they call it?

1123
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:11,015
Kismet.

1124
01:29:11,117 --> 01:29:13,017
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1125
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:14,108
I don't believe I...

1126
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:17,087
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1127
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:20,523
but I like to think of it as fate.

1128
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:26,994
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1129
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:30,694
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1130
01:29:30,803 --> 01:29:32,930
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1131
01:29:33,038 --> 01:29:34,801
if I stand on my bed.

1132
01:29:34,907 --> 01:29:36,898
What about you?
Where have you been?

1133
01:29:37,009 --> 01:29:40,604
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1134
01:29:40,713 --> 01:29:44,877
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1135
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:47,748
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1136
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:53,018
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1137
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:58,654
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1138
01:29:59,164 --> 01:30:00,825
It ran its course.

1139
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:04,226
Hey, do you remember this?

1140
01:30:15,146 --> 01:30:17,842
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1141
01:30:17,949 --> 01:30:20,042
"at 5:00 in the afternoon. "

1142
01:30:21,886 --> 01:30:24,081
Would you like to have dinner?

1143
01:30:31,596 --> 01:30:34,497
<i>Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?</i>

1144
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,693
<i>Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.</i>

1145
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,967
<i>You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.</i>

1146
01:30:46,077 --> 01:30:48,875
<i>And he just...
He just put it right into the production.</i>

1147
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:52,471
<i>I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?</i>

1148
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:55,813
<i>You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.</i>

1149
01:30:55,919 --> 01:30:59,548
<i>There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract. "</i>

1150
01:30:59,656 --> 01:31:00,987
<i>No, he's not the only one, though.</i>

1151
01:31:01,091 --> 01:31:04,993
<i>There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...</i>

1152
01:31:05,095 --> 01:31:07,586
<i>Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.</i>

1153
01:31:07,697 --> 01:31:09,756
<i>She's just torn up all those conventions,</i>

1154
01:31:09,866 --> 01:31:11,834
<i>you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.</i>

1155
01:31:11,935 --> 01:31:15,132
<i>It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.</i>

1156
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:17,934
<i>As she told me
about this big new world,</i>

1157
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,532
<i>names that didn't mean a thing to me,</i>

1158
01:31:20,644 --> 01:31:22,703
<i>I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.</i>

1159
01:31:22,813 --> 01:31:25,043
<i>It's new and it's modern
and it's American.</i>

1160
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:28,311
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1161
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:30,545
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1162
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,156
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1163
01:31:35,257 --> 01:31:36,781
I'm old enough.

1164
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:42,653
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1165
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:48,035
In New York, we stay up all night,

1166
01:31:49,305 --> 01:31:52,103
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1167
01:31:54,443 --> 01:31:56,741
There's always something to do.

1168
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:16,523
I have to go back tomorrow.

1169
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,826
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1170
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,802
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1171
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:31,436
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1172
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,113
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1173
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,309
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1174
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:40,945
The words are like making love.

1175
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:30,095
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1176
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:39,072
Sex is a part of it.

1177
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:46,384
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1178
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:51,615
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1179
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:01,923
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1180
01:34:03,035 --> 01:34:05,469
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1181
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:07,165
You're a desirable woman.

1182
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:11,004
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1183
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:13,169
Let's go back to the house.

1184
01:34:14,146 --> 01:34:16,546
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1185
01:34:19,518 --> 01:34:22,715
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1186
01:34:22,822 --> 01:34:28,158
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

1187
01:34:29,095 --> 01:34:32,155
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1188
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:34,955
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1189
01:34:35,066 --> 01:34:37,398
You should be with your friends.

1190
01:34:38,403 --> 01:34:40,894
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1191
01:34:41,006 --> 01:34:43,600
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1192
01:34:57,155 --> 01:34:59,282
We could go hear some music.

1193
01:35:01,559 --> 01:35:04,255
<i>Our lives are defined by opportunities.</i>

1194
01:35:05,096 --> 01:35:07,087
<i>Even the ones we miss.</i>

1195
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:11,595
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1196
01:35:11,703 --> 01:35:13,864
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1197
01:35:13,972 --> 01:35:18,567
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1198
01:35:18,676 --> 01:35:22,737
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1199
01:35:24,682 --> 01:35:25,740
"Things were becoming different... "

1200
01:35:25,849 --> 01:35:27,009
<i>...for me.</i>

1201
01:35:27,117 --> 01:35:30,712
<i>My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.</i>

1202
01:35:30,821 --> 01:35:34,587
<i>My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.</i>

1203
01:35:34,692 --> 01:35:37,320
<i>I could walk further and faster.</i>

1204
01:35:37,428 --> 01:35:43,196
<i>While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.</i>

1205
01:35:46,236 --> 01:35:47,464
Come in.

1206
01:35:48,872 --> 01:35:50,169
Benjamin.

1207
01:35:51,175 --> 01:35:54,372
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1208
01:35:55,079 --> 01:35:58,640
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1209
01:36:00,317 --> 01:36:01,545
Welcome home, my friend.

1210
01:36:04,253 --> 01:36:07,347
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1211
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:08,685
Creature of habit.

1212
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,884
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1213
01:36:10,993 --> 01:36:12,722
Not for a long time.

1214
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,423
Interesting times, though.

1215
01:36:16,532 --> 01:36:20,969
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1216
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,061
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1217
01:36:23,172 --> 01:36:25,663
We were operating around the clock.

1218
01:36:30,246 --> 01:36:31,611
Damn shame.

1219
01:36:32,749 --> 01:36:35,684
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1220
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:39,752
You know,

1221
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:45,357
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1222
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:48,293
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1223
01:36:49,698 --> 01:36:52,758
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1224
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:58,262
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1225
01:36:58,373 --> 01:37:00,364
I'd enjoy your company.

1226
01:37:00,475 --> 01:37:02,966
I'll certainly do what I can.

1227
01:37:06,281 --> 01:37:09,182
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1228
01:37:12,788 --> 01:37:17,418
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1229
01:37:18,093 --> 01:37:22,689
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1230
01:37:22,798 --> 01:37:25,198
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1231
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:30,328
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1232
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:35,307
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1233
01:37:36,043 --> 01:37:38,637
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1234
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,182
That's very, very interesting.

1235
01:37:48,656 --> 01:37:51,250
You sure have done well for yourself.

1236
01:37:52,193 --> 01:37:56,254
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1237
01:37:58,799 --> 01:38:01,791
Benjamin? You're my son.

1238
01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:11,971
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1239
01:38:14,148 --> 01:38:17,514
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1240
01:38:19,419 --> 01:38:23,116
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1241
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:26,819
I thought you were a monster.

1242
01:38:30,396 --> 01:38:33,661
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1243
01:38:40,106 --> 01:38:42,540
I should never have abandoned you.

1244
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:48,010
My mother?

1245
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:52,317
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1246
01:38:52,418 --> 01:38:55,854
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

1247
01:38:55,955 --> 01:38:58,947
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1248
01:39:00,626 --> 01:39:03,254
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1249
01:39:05,097 --> 01:39:07,793
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1250
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:10,995
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1251
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:14,504
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1252
01:39:17,776 --> 01:39:19,437
She's from Dublin.

1253
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:24,515
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1254
01:39:24,616 --> 01:39:26,140
in New Orleans.

1255
01:39:28,287 --> 01:39:31,120
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1256
01:39:31,957 --> 01:39:34,084
just so I could look at her.

1257
01:39:40,465 --> 01:39:44,196
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1258
01:39:44,969 --> 01:39:47,199
The day I married your mother.

1259
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:51,067
Why didn't you just tell me?

1260
01:39:51,943 --> 01:39:54,776
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1261
01:39:56,314 --> 01:39:58,748
- I have to go.
- Where?

1262
01:39:59,817 --> 01:40:01,182
Home.

1263
01:40:01,886 --> 01:40:03,217
And what does he think, anyway?

1264
01:40:03,321 --> 01:40:04,618
He thinks he can just show up

1265
01:40:04,722 --> 01:40:06,587
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1266
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:09,285
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1267
01:40:09,393 --> 01:40:12,294
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1268
01:40:12,396 --> 01:40:15,797
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1269
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,960
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1270
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:20,901
Eighteen ratty dollars

1271
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:22,700
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1272
01:40:24,075 --> 01:40:25,269
Good night, baby.

1273
01:40:38,555 --> 01:40:42,889
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1274
01:40:44,694 --> 01:40:46,719
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1275
01:40:51,735 --> 01:40:55,569
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1276
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,436
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1277
01:41:03,013 --> 01:41:04,674
But you know what?

1278
01:41:05,448 --> 01:41:08,383
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1279
01:41:14,156 --> 01:41:15,680
Storm's coming.

1280
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:45,849
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1281
01:41:45,954 --> 01:41:47,012
Thank you.

1282
01:42:02,904 --> 01:42:04,132
Wake up.

1283
01:42:06,674 --> 01:42:08,539
Let's get you dressed.

1284
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:37,597
Now that's something.

1285
01:42:40,908 --> 01:42:42,239
Thank you.

1286
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:46,360
<i>You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.</i>

1287
01:43:46,472 --> 01:43:48,872
<i>You can swear and curse the Fates.</i>

1288
01:43:50,476 --> 01:43:52,671
<i>But when it comes to the end,</i>

1289
01:43:53,913 --> 01:43:55,642
<i>you have to let go.</i>

1290
01:44:17,635 --> 01:44:20,229
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1291
01:44:22,106 --> 01:44:24,904
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

1292
01:44:26,377 --> 01:44:28,004
You're my mother.

1293
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,078
My baby.

1294
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:39,816
<i>Now, I'd never seen New York.</i>

1295
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:11,377
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1296
01:46:12,448 --> 01:46:17,784
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1297
01:46:18,187 --> 01:46:21,452
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1298
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,155
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1299
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:26,249
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1300
01:46:27,562 --> 01:46:31,328
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1301
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:34,891
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1302
01:46:35,003 --> 01:46:40,873
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1303
01:46:42,243 --> 01:46:46,373
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1304
01:46:47,015 --> 01:46:51,816
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1305
01:46:53,855 --> 01:46:56,653
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1306
01:47:01,997 --> 01:47:04,022
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1307
01:47:04,132 --> 01:47:07,397
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1308
01:47:07,502 --> 01:47:08,764
I thought you might enjoy.

1309
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:11,360
I made a reservation, just in case.

1310
01:47:11,472 --> 01:47:14,464
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1311
01:47:14,575 --> 01:47:18,375
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1312
01:47:24,852 --> 01:47:26,945
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1313
01:47:27,054 --> 01:47:28,351
She's divine.

1314
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:30,820
You were breathtaking.

1315
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:37,758
Sweetie.

1316
01:47:38,932 --> 01:47:41,799
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1317
01:47:42,803 --> 01:47:44,828
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1318
01:47:44,938 --> 01:47:48,169
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1319
01:47:48,275 --> 01:47:51,733
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1320
01:47:59,452 --> 01:48:02,615
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1321
01:48:02,722 --> 01:48:04,622
Or something like that?

1322
01:48:05,792 --> 01:48:07,555
Something like that.

1323
01:48:07,894 --> 01:48:09,418
Hey, excuse me.

1324
01:48:31,784 --> 01:48:33,012
Come on.

1325
01:48:54,372 --> 01:48:55,430
Hey!

1326
01:48:56,408 --> 01:48:58,899
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1327
01:48:59,945 --> 01:49:01,469
Lord, Benjamin.

1328
01:49:04,082 --> 01:49:07,950
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1329
01:49:08,053 --> 01:49:10,021
Now, this is my life.

1330
01:49:10,122 --> 01:49:12,556
Babe! You going downtown?

1331
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:20,623
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1332
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:22,990
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1333
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:26,001
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1334
01:49:27,104 --> 01:49:28,537
I should've called.

1335
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,437
I thought I'd come here

1336
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:34,272
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1337
01:49:35,779 --> 01:49:40,239
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1338
01:49:42,052 --> 01:49:43,417
Seems nice.

1339
01:49:44,788 --> 01:49:46,380
Do you love him?

1340
01:49:49,527 --> 01:49:50,892
I think so.

1341
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:54,691
I'm happy for you.

1342
01:49:56,634 --> 01:49:58,727
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1343
01:50:01,372 --> 01:50:02,464
Okay.

1344
01:50:04,508 --> 01:50:06,237
I enjoyed the show!

1345
01:50:13,883 --> 01:50:18,377
He came to tell me his father had died.

1346
01:50:19,889 --> 01:50:26,055
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1347
01:50:28,631 --> 01:50:29,996
What did you do next?

1348
01:50:30,099 --> 01:50:37,028
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1349
01:50:39,142 --> 01:50:43,238
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1350
01:50:45,148 --> 01:50:47,082
For five years, I...

1351
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:51,615
I danced everywhere.

1352
01:50:53,088 --> 01:50:56,580
London, Vienna, Prague.

1353
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:59,057
I've never seen these.

1354
01:51:02,397 --> 01:51:03,455
Mom.

1355
01:51:04,766 --> 01:51:07,462
You never talked about your dancing.

1356
01:51:07,569 --> 01:51:09,560
Well, I was the only American

1357
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:14,608
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1358
01:51:16,478 --> 01:51:18,469
<i>It was glorious.</i>

1359
01:51:22,951 --> 01:51:26,648
<i>But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.</i>

1360
01:51:29,825 --> 01:51:33,386
<i>And I'd find myself saying...</i>

1361
01:51:33,495 --> 01:51:35,292
Good night, Benjamin.

1362
01:51:37,298 --> 01:51:40,927
- "Good night, Daisy. "
- He said that?

1363
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,264
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1364
01:51:45,139 --> 01:51:47,903
<i>"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something. "</i>

1365
01:51:57,385 --> 01:52:00,354
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1366
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:10,424
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1367
01:52:13,334 --> 01:52:14,665
Thank you.

1368
01:52:40,994 --> 01:52:42,894
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1369
01:52:42,996 --> 01:52:45,794
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1370
01:52:53,273 --> 01:52:57,676
<i>Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.</i>

1371
01:52:58,244 --> 01:53:02,738
<i>Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.</i>

1372
01:53:05,585 --> 01:53:08,644
<i>A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.</i>

1373
01:53:09,988 --> 01:53:13,754
<i>But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.</i>

1374
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:16,020
<i>When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.</i>

1375
01:53:16,128 --> 01:53:19,120
<i>So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.</i>

1376
01:53:20,632 --> 01:53:22,429
<i>While the woman was on the phone,</i>

1377
01:53:22,534 --> 01:53:26,698
<i>Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.</i>

1378
01:53:26,805 --> 01:53:29,569
<i>And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,</i>

1379
01:53:29,675 --> 01:53:31,973
<i>had gone outside to get a taxi.</i>

1380
01:53:36,515 --> 01:53:38,813
<i>Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,</i>

1381
01:53:38,917 --> 01:53:41,613
<i>and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.</i>

1382
01:53:42,521 --> 01:53:45,251
<i>And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.</i>

1383
01:53:48,794 --> 01:53:51,291
<i>And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare</i>

1384
01:53:51,396 --> 01:53:53,364
<i>and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,</i>

1385
01:53:53,464 --> 01:53:55,159
<i>he picked up the lady
who was going shopping</i>

1386
01:53:55,266 --> 01:53:57,962
<i>and had missed getting the earlier cab.</i>

1387
01:53:58,936 --> 01:54:01,336
<i>The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,</i>

1388
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:04,237
<i>who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did</i>

1389
01:54:04,342 --> 01:54:06,833
<i>because he forgot to set his alarm.</i>

1390
01:54:07,645 --> 01:54:10,910
<i>While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,</i>

1391
01:54:11,015 --> 01:54:14,451
<i>Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.</i>

1392
01:54:14,986 --> 01:54:16,283
<i>And while Daisy was showering,</i>

1393
01:54:16,387 --> 01:54:20,016
<i>the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package</i>

1394
01:54:20,124 --> 01:54:21,216
<i>which hadn't been wrapped yet,</i>

1395
01:54:21,325 --> 01:54:23,122
<i>because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it</i>

1396
01:54:23,227 --> 01:54:26,822
<i>had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.</i>

1397
01:54:27,498 --> 01:54:30,695
<i>When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,</i>

1398
01:54:30,802 --> 01:54:32,429
<i>was blocked by a delivery truck.</i>

1399
01:54:32,537 --> 01:54:35,266
<i>All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.</i>

1400
01:54:36,773 --> 01:54:40,140
<i>The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move</i>

1401
01:54:40,243 --> 01:54:42,336
<i>while Daisy, the last to be dressed,</i>

1402
01:54:42,446 --> 01:54:45,973
<i>waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.</i>

1403
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:49,351
<i>While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,</i>

1404
01:54:49,453 --> 01:54:53,355
<i>Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.</i>

1405
01:54:53,457 --> 01:54:56,824
<i>And if only one thing
had happened differently,</i>

1406
01:54:56,927 --> 01:54:59,020
<i>if that shoelace hadn't broken</i>

1407
01:54:59,129 --> 01:55:01,620
<i>or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier</i>

1408
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:03,596
<i>or that package
had been wrapped and ready</i>

1409
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,430
<i>because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,</i>

1410
01:55:06,536 --> 01:55:10,199
<i>or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier</i>

1411
01:55:10,307 --> 01:55:13,470
<i>or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee</i>

1412
01:55:13,577 --> 01:55:17,570
<i>or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,</i>

1413
01:55:18,148 --> 01:55:20,809
<i>Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street</i>

1414
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:23,350
<i>and the taxi would have driven by.</i>

1415
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:36,159
<i>But, life being what it is,</i>

1416
01:55:36,265 --> 01:55:39,257
<i>a series of intersecting lives
and incidents</i>

1417
01:55:39,368 --> 01:55:41,131
<i>out of anyone's control,</i>

1418
01:55:42,004 --> 01:55:44,700
<i>that taxi did not go by,</i>

1419
01:55:44,807 --> 01:55:47,640
<i>and that driver was
momentarily distracted.</i>

1420
01:55:48,644 --> 01:55:49,611
<i>Daisy!</i>

1421
01:55:49,845 --> 01:55:51,073
<i>And that taxi hit Daisy.</i>

1422
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:52,875
Daisy! Help!

1423
01:55:56,051 --> 01:55:58,019
<i>And her leg was crushed.</i>

1424
01:56:05,426 --> 01:56:06,586
Daisy?

1425
01:56:10,899 --> 01:56:13,424
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1426
01:56:14,502 --> 01:56:18,563
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1427
01:56:20,141 --> 01:56:22,132
You'd do the same for me.

1428
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:25,272
My God.

1429
01:56:27,415 --> 01:56:30,873
Look at you. You're perfect.

1430
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:38,215
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1431
01:56:44,666 --> 01:56:46,964
<i>Her leg had been broken in five places.</i>

1432
01:56:47,068 --> 01:56:50,161
<i>And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.</i>

1433
01:56:51,738 --> 01:56:53,603
<i>But she'd never dance.</i>

1434
01:56:55,242 --> 01:56:57,676
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1435
01:56:57,778 --> 01:57:00,542
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1436
01:57:00,647 --> 01:57:02,808
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1437
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:06,385
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1438
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:11,821
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1439
01:57:11,925 --> 01:57:15,656
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1440
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:19,165
You might change your mind.

1441
01:57:19,266 --> 01:57:22,201
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1442
01:57:24,237 --> 01:57:27,468
Just stay out of my life.

1443
01:57:50,329 --> 01:57:53,560
<i>I was awfully cruel.</i>

1444
01:57:54,667 --> 01:58:00,071
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1445
01:58:02,775 --> 01:58:04,140
"I didn't leave right away.

1446
01:58:06,779 --> 01:58:10,078
<i>"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her. "</i>

1447
01:58:13,686 --> 01:58:15,517
I never knew that.

1448
01:58:18,923 --> 01:58:22,984
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1449
01:58:26,698 --> 01:58:31,761
I taught myself to walk again.

1450
01:58:34,839 --> 01:58:37,364
I took the train to Lourdes.

1451
01:58:38,743 --> 01:58:44,306
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1452
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:46,407
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1453
01:58:46,518 --> 01:58:48,713
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1454
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:07,804
All right, he says, "I went back home. "
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1455
01:59:08,038 --> 01:59:11,735
"I listened to the sound of the house. "
I read that already.

1456
01:59:12,676 --> 01:59:13,734
He...

1457
01:59:14,712 --> 01:59:17,977
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1458
01:59:19,116 --> 01:59:21,880
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1459
01:59:22,586 --> 01:59:25,987
<i>I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.</i>

1460
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,167
<i>I can't lie.</i>

1461
01:59:37,267 --> 01:59:40,065
<i>I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.</i>

1462
01:59:48,411 --> 01:59:49,935
<i>Or maybe three.</i>

1463
02:00:26,482 --> 02:00:30,714
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1464
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:36,182
Mama.

1465
02:00:41,096 --> 02:00:43,564
<i>And in the spring of 1962,</i>

1466
02:00:47,435 --> 02:00:48,925
<i>she came back.</i>

1467
02:01:08,323 --> 02:01:11,952
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1468
02:01:13,962 --> 02:01:18,864
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1469
02:01:18,966 --> 02:01:21,526
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1470
02:01:21,635 --> 02:01:25,366
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1471
02:01:25,472 --> 02:01:27,906
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1472
02:01:29,076 --> 02:01:31,135
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1473
02:01:31,245 --> 02:01:33,770
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1474
02:01:34,748 --> 02:01:36,375
Y'all have fun.

1475
02:01:39,153 --> 02:01:43,487
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1476
02:02:13,686 --> 02:02:15,984
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1477
02:02:53,759 --> 02:02:56,159
<i>I asked her to come away with me.</i>

1478
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:01,490
<i>We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.</i>

1479
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:47,242
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1480
02:03:47,345 --> 02:03:51,645
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1481
02:03:51,749 --> 02:03:53,512
And you were so old.

1482
02:03:54,218 --> 02:03:57,119
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1483
02:03:57,221 --> 02:04:00,349
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1484
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:07,997
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1485
02:04:08,099 --> 02:04:09,691
I bet you can't.

1486
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:15,060
Barely a line or a crease.

1487
02:04:15,505 --> 02:04:18,633
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1488
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:24,041
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1489
02:04:29,753 --> 02:04:32,051
What's it like growing younger?

1490
02:04:34,524 --> 02:04:39,120
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1491
02:04:44,167 --> 02:04:47,933
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1492
02:04:48,038 --> 02:04:52,498
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1493
02:04:53,843 --> 02:04:56,676
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1494
02:05:04,153 --> 02:05:05,211
What?

1495
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:15,219
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1496
02:05:17,633 --> 02:05:19,624
And what a shame that is.

1497
02:05:22,638 --> 02:05:24,265
Some things last.

1498
02:05:26,575 --> 02:05:30,773
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1499
02:05:47,195 --> 02:05:48,253
Mom?

1500
02:05:50,565 --> 02:05:54,558
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1501
02:05:57,738 --> 02:06:02,437
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1502
02:06:22,463 --> 02:06:23,555
Mama?

1503
02:06:30,770 --> 02:06:31,998
Queenie?

1504
02:06:35,175 --> 02:06:36,472
Hello?

1505
02:06:36,943 --> 02:06:40,538
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1506
02:06:40,647 --> 02:06:45,812
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1507
02:07:14,513 --> 02:07:17,914
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1508
02:07:18,017 --> 02:07:19,814
Our deepest condolences.

1509
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:27,982
<i>We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.</i>

1510
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,458
<i>And so we might have memories
of our own,</i>

1511
02:07:38,571 --> 02:07:40,505
<i>we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.</i>

1512
02:07:40,606 --> 02:07:43,200
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1513
02:07:43,809 --> 02:07:46,744
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1514
02:07:46,845 --> 02:07:49,712
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1515
02:07:49,815 --> 02:07:51,806
They come with the house.

1516
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,320
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1517
02:07:58,856 --> 02:08:01,051
<i>We bought ourselves a duplex.</i>

1518
02:08:03,127 --> 02:08:05,152
I loved that house.

1519
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:09,567
It smelled like firewood.

1520
02:08:10,702 --> 02:08:13,899
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1521
02:08:14,539 --> 02:08:17,372
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life. "

1522
02:08:17,475 --> 02:08:20,000
<i>We didn't have a stick of furniture.</i>

1523
02:08:20,812 --> 02:08:23,542
<i>We would have picnics
in the living room.</i>

1524
02:08:27,051 --> 02:08:31,010
<i>We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.</i>

1525
02:08:32,457 --> 02:08:34,425
<i>We vowed never to fall into routine,</i>

1526
02:08:34,525 --> 02:08:37,392
<i>to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.</i>

1527
02:08:37,495 --> 02:08:39,520
<i>We lived on that mattress.</i>

1528
02:09:15,265 --> 02:09:18,723
<i>Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.</i>

1529
02:09:20,337 --> 02:09:23,067
<i>We lived four blocks from a public pool.</i>

1530
02:10:01,477 --> 02:10:04,241
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1531
02:10:04,347 --> 02:10:08,443
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1532
02:10:09,885 --> 02:10:13,581
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1533
02:10:15,423 --> 02:10:17,914
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1534
02:10:18,026 --> 02:10:21,120
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1535
02:10:21,229 --> 02:10:23,459
I just don't like getting old.

1536
02:10:25,033 --> 02:10:27,524
They put too much chlorine in here.

1537
02:11:08,809 --> 02:11:12,677
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1538
02:11:17,050 --> 02:11:20,076
<i>And I think right there and then</i>

1539
02:11:20,187 --> 02:11:24,180
<i>she realized
none of us is perfect forever.</i>

1540
02:11:28,162 --> 02:11:29,754
<i>She found peace.</i>

1541
02:11:31,665 --> 02:11:34,566
<i>She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.</i>

1542
02:11:34,668 --> 02:11:37,762
<i>And tendu.</i>

1543
02:11:37,871 --> 02:11:42,933
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1544
02:11:44,644 --> 02:11:47,078
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1545
02:12:12,572 --> 02:12:15,166
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1546
02:12:17,009 --> 02:12:19,375
Dancing's all about the line.

1547
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:23,546
The line of your body.

1548
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:29,250
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1549
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:41,099
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1550
02:12:41,199 --> 02:12:42,689
I'm 43.

1551
02:12:44,903 --> 02:12:47,428
We are almost the same age.

1552
02:12:50,742 --> 02:12:54,906
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1553
02:12:56,114 --> 02:12:57,206
Wait.

1554
02:12:58,583 --> 02:13:01,211
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1555
02:13:12,096 --> 02:13:13,563
I'm pregnant.

1556
02:13:31,282 --> 02:13:34,911
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1557
02:13:49,934 --> 02:13:51,902
But I think it's a girl.

1558
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:00,801
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1559
02:14:00,910 --> 02:14:02,002
Okay.

1560
02:14:09,352 --> 02:14:10,648
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1561
02:14:10,683 --> 02:14:11,944
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1562
02:14:12,055 --> 02:14:14,455
Then I will love it all the more.

1563
02:14:16,492 --> 02:14:21,429
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1564
02:14:22,098 --> 02:14:25,397
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1565
02:14:25,501 --> 02:14:28,334
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1566
02:14:29,839 --> 02:14:31,864
I am gonna make this work.

1567
02:14:34,544 --> 02:14:37,445
I want this, and I want it with you.

1568
02:14:37,546 --> 02:14:40,947
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1569
02:14:41,049 --> 02:14:44,246
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1570
02:14:44,353 --> 02:14:46,412
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1571
02:14:46,521 --> 02:14:48,079
Here you go.

1572
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:51,626
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1573
02:14:51,727 --> 02:14:54,525
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1574
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:57,190
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1575
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:03,397
I have to go pee.

1576
02:15:17,486 --> 02:15:19,716
<i>The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel</i>

1577
02:15:19,821 --> 02:15:21,550
<i>arrived here today in Calais...</i>

1578
02:15:21,657 --> 02:15:24,124
<i>- Keep it.
- ... having made the swim in 34 hours,</i>

1579
02:15:24,225 --> 02:15:26,420
<i>22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1580
02:15:26,527 --> 02:15:31,362
<i>The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,</i>

1581
02:15:31,465 --> 02:15:33,228
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1582
02:15:33,334 --> 02:15:36,861
<i>Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?</i>

1583
02:15:36,971 --> 02:15:38,529
<i>I suppose...</i>

1584
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:41,669
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

1585
02:15:45,713 --> 02:15:46,873
<i>- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.</i>

1586
02:15:46,981 --> 02:15:47,948
<i>- You ready?
- Thank you very much.</i>

1587
02:15:48,049 --> 02:15:49,983
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

1588
02:15:50,084 --> 02:15:52,052
<i>- Yeah.
- You're very kind.</i>

1589
02:15:59,293 --> 02:16:03,161
<i>In the spring, on a day like any other...</i>

1590
02:16:03,931 --> 02:16:05,899
I'll be back in an hour!

1591
02:16:10,937 --> 02:16:12,097
Honey?

1592
02:16:14,207 --> 02:16:16,198
Go and call an ambulance!

1593
02:16:19,145 --> 02:16:20,806
The baby's coming.

1594
02:16:21,648 --> 02:16:22,672
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1595
02:16:22,782 --> 02:16:25,216
- The baby's coming!
-2714 Napoleon.

1596
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:35,121
There you go. Keep breathing.

1597
02:16:36,062 --> 02:16:38,428
Deep breaths. Push.

1598
02:16:48,341 --> 02:16:49,740
There we go.

1599
02:17:06,158 --> 02:17:09,491
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1600
02:17:16,435 --> 02:17:17,595
Honey?

1601
02:17:19,571 --> 02:17:23,166
<i>She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.</i>

1602
02:17:39,390 --> 02:17:41,290
Did you count the toes?

1603
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:47,120
She's perfect.

1604
02:17:47,565 --> 02:17:50,830
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline. "

1605
02:17:54,572 --> 02:17:56,699
This Benjamin was my father?

1606
02:17:58,242 --> 02:18:00,369
And this is how you tell me?

1607
02:18:05,983 --> 02:18:07,314
Excuse me.

1608
02:18:17,829 --> 02:18:20,558
<i>...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,</i>

1609
02:18:20,664 --> 02:18:23,189
<i>possibly even up to a Category 5.</i>

1610
02:18:29,973 --> 02:18:33,636
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1611
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:39,212
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,</i>

1612
02:18:39,316 --> 02:18:41,113
<i>but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,</i>

1613
02:18:41,218 --> 02:18:44,915
<i>incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.</i>

1614
02:18:51,795 --> 02:18:56,630
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy. "

1615
02:19:05,307 --> 02:19:08,401
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1616
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,343
What are you talking about?

1617
02:19:13,449 --> 02:19:16,714
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1618
02:19:16,819 --> 02:19:19,652
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1619
02:19:19,755 --> 02:19:22,485
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1620
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:27,926
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1621
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:29,998
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1622
02:19:30,099 --> 02:19:34,092
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1623
02:19:42,778 --> 02:19:47,681
<i>It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.</i>

1624
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:50,280
<i>The house was filled with children.</i>

1625
02:19:50,385 --> 02:19:52,319
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1626
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:56,049
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1627
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:32,482
<i>I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,</i>

1628
02:20:32,593 --> 02:20:35,288
<i>I sold Button's Buttons,</i>

1629
02:20:35,395 --> 02:20:39,923
<i>I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.</i>

1630
02:20:42,202 --> 02:20:45,399
<i>And so that you
and your mother might have a life,</i>

1631
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:50,542
<i>I left,
before you could ever remember me.</i>

1632
02:21:40,259 --> 02:21:42,352
"I left with just the clothes on my back. "

1633
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:48,459
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1634
02:21:49,935 --> 02:21:52,165
I don't really know.

1635
02:22:03,448 --> 02:22:08,385
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

1636
02:22:11,189 --> 02:22:14,022
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night. "

1637
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:20,859
They're all for me.

1638
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:26,860
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school. "

1639
02:22:31,409 --> 02:22:37,245
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano. "

1640
02:22:40,718 --> 02:22:43,653
1981, 13.

1641
02:22:43,755 --> 02:22:47,054
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1642
02:22:48,392 --> 02:22:52,021
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1643
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:59,298
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that. "

1644
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:09,335
I guess he went to India.

1645
02:23:09,446 --> 02:23:11,880
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1646
02:23:11,982 --> 02:23:13,779
<i>- "or, in my case, too early... "
- ... or, in my case, too early,</i>

1647
02:23:15,052 --> 02:23:17,020
<i>to be whoever you want to be.</i>

1648
02:23:21,091 --> 02:23:23,753
<i>There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.</i>

1649
02:23:26,663 --> 02:23:31,123
<i>You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.</i>

1650
02:23:33,703 --> 02:23:37,195
<i>We can make the best or the worst of it.</i>

1651
02:23:37,306 --> 02:23:39,604
<i>And I hope you make the best of it.</i>

1652
02:23:42,712 --> 02:23:45,408
<i>I hope you see things that startle you.</i>

1653
02:23:47,583 --> 02:23:51,075
<i>I hope you feel things
you never felt before.</i>

1654
02:23:53,556 --> 02:23:57,048
<i>I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.</i>

1655
02:23:58,227 --> 02:24:00,923
<i>I hope you live a life you're proud of.</i>

1656
02:24:03,933 --> 02:24:08,961
<i>And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength</i>

1657
02:24:09,071 --> 02:24:12,268
<i>- to start all over again.
- "... start all over again. "</i>

1658
02:24:13,843 --> 02:24:17,539
He had been gone a long time.

1659
02:24:19,347 --> 02:24:21,440
I'll see you next Thursday.

1660
02:24:24,419 --> 02:24:27,786
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1661
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:47,631
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1662
02:24:50,579 --> 02:24:52,103
Can I help you?

1663
02:24:53,715 --> 02:24:56,115
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1664
02:25:06,493 --> 02:25:08,358
Why did you come back?

1665
02:25:09,964 --> 02:25:11,226
Mom?

1666
02:25:12,299 --> 02:25:13,357
Mom?

1667
02:25:14,602 --> 02:25:16,092
You ready yet?

1668
02:25:19,106 --> 02:25:20,198
Mom, what's wrong?

1669
02:25:20,307 --> 02:25:23,868
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1670
02:25:23,978 --> 02:25:26,674
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1671
02:25:27,948 --> 02:25:30,678
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1672
02:25:30,784 --> 02:25:33,480
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1673
02:25:35,956 --> 02:25:37,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

1674
02:25:39,126 --> 02:25:40,991
Hey.

1675
02:25:42,997 --> 02:25:47,831
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1676
02:25:47,934 --> 02:25:52,871
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1677
02:25:52,972 --> 02:25:55,372
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1678
02:26:03,516 --> 02:26:06,508
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1679
02:26:06,619 --> 02:26:08,416
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1680
02:26:08,521 --> 02:26:09,647
Bye.

1681
02:26:10,390 --> 02:26:12,153
I'm just locking up.

1682
02:26:16,929 --> 02:26:17,987
Wow.

1683
02:26:20,533 --> 02:26:23,400
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1684
02:26:25,004 --> 02:26:27,472
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1685
02:26:27,573 --> 02:26:29,473
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1686
02:26:29,575 --> 02:26:31,565
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1687
02:26:32,778 --> 02:26:37,112
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1688
02:26:37,316 --> 02:26:41,548
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1689
02:26:42,454 --> 02:26:46,390
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1690
02:26:46,792 --> 02:26:50,694
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1691
02:26:53,865 --> 02:26:56,561
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1692
02:27:01,273 --> 02:27:05,175
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1693
02:27:07,279 --> 02:27:08,803
You were right.

1694
02:27:10,582 --> 02:27:13,949
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1695
02:27:14,052 --> 02:27:15,814
I'm not that strong.

1696
02:27:20,024 --> 02:27:22,049
So, where are you staying?

1697
02:27:24,729 --> 02:27:25,718
What are you gonna do?

1698
02:27:25,830 --> 02:27:29,630
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1699
02:27:29,734 --> 02:27:33,261
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1700
02:27:33,371 --> 02:27:34,531
But...

1701
02:27:41,045 --> 02:27:42,672
They're waiting.

1702
02:28:24,821 --> 02:28:28,086
I remember that. That was him?

1703
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,920
The hurricane has changed directions.

1704
02:28:32,028 --> 02:28:33,859
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1705
02:28:33,963 --> 02:28:35,692
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1706
02:28:35,799 --> 02:28:37,027
to move people, but it's up to you.

1707
02:28:37,133 --> 02:28:38,998
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1708
02:28:39,102 --> 02:28:41,730
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1709
02:28:43,772 --> 02:28:48,106
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1710
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:50,542
"there was a knock at the door. "

1711
02:28:54,183 --> 02:28:55,411
Come in.

1712
02:29:09,731 --> 02:29:11,392
Are you all right?

1713
02:29:14,503 --> 02:29:18,599
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1714
02:29:27,649 --> 02:29:29,138
Nothing lasts.

1715
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:34,952
I have never stopped loving you.

1716
02:29:40,962 --> 02:29:43,658
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1717
02:29:54,308 --> 02:29:56,503
Some things you never forget.

1718
02:30:16,796 --> 02:30:17,854
<i>...so few people even know</i>

1719
02:30:17,964 --> 02:30:19,659
<i>that you were ever in jail
in the first place.</i>

1720
02:30:19,766 --> 02:30:21,961
<i>I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,</i>

1721
02:30:22,068 --> 02:30:24,628
<i>because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award</i>

1722
02:30:24,738 --> 02:30:26,797
<i>like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do</i>

1723
02:30:26,907 --> 02:30:29,569
<i>is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict</i>

1724
02:30:29,676 --> 02:30:32,167
<i>which I think is, again, so unfair.</i>

1725
02:30:44,958 --> 02:30:46,755
Good night, Benjamin.

1726
02:30:48,295 --> 02:30:49,956
Good night, Daisy.

1727
02:30:53,166 --> 02:30:57,397
<i>And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.</i>

1728
02:31:00,139 --> 02:31:02,437
That's the last thing he wrote.

1729
02:31:03,609 --> 02:31:08,171
Sometime after your father passed,

1730
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:11,113
there was a call.

1731
02:31:14,186 --> 02:31:15,346
Hello.

1732
02:31:16,455 --> 02:31:17,945
Yes, speaking.

1733
02:31:21,293 --> 02:31:23,784
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1734
02:31:33,639 --> 02:31:35,504
It's the corner house.

1735
02:31:57,695 --> 02:31:59,060
Come on in.

1736
02:32:04,669 --> 02:32:06,694
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1737
02:32:06,804 --> 02:32:10,501
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1738
02:32:10,608 --> 02:32:13,236
He was living in a condemned building.

1739
02:32:15,046 --> 02:32:17,344
The police found this with him.

1740
02:32:17,448 --> 02:32:20,383
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1741
02:32:21,586 --> 02:32:24,214
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1742
02:32:24,322 --> 02:32:28,348
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1743
02:32:28,458 --> 02:32:32,019
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1744
02:32:32,129 --> 02:32:35,963
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1745
02:33:05,429 --> 02:33:06,691
Benjamin?

1746
02:33:10,567 --> 02:33:12,363
You play beautifully.

1747
02:33:15,871 --> 02:33:17,702
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1748
02:33:17,807 --> 02:33:19,468
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1749
02:33:19,575 --> 02:33:21,202
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1750
02:33:21,310 --> 02:33:23,744
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1751
02:33:25,548 --> 02:33:27,277
Do you remember me?

1752
02:33:30,453 --> 02:33:31,784
I'm Daisy.

1753
02:33:34,390 --> 02:33:35,857
I'm Benjamin.

1754
02:33:41,564 --> 02:33:44,226
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1755
02:33:45,935 --> 02:33:51,305
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1756
02:33:55,177 --> 02:33:56,666
Do I know you?

1757
02:34:01,649 --> 02:34:03,276
<i>- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,</i>

1758
02:34:03,384 --> 02:34:07,343
<i>I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.</i>

1759
02:34:07,455 --> 02:34:10,083
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1760
02:34:10,191 --> 02:34:12,523
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1761
02:34:12,627 --> 02:34:15,357
You're all fucking liars!

1762
02:34:15,463 --> 02:34:18,388
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1763
02:34:19,701 --> 02:34:23,330
Now, why don't we see

1764
02:34:23,438 --> 02:34:26,805
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1765
02:34:26,975 --> 02:34:30,138
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1766
02:34:30,245 --> 02:34:32,145
Well, like what, sugar?

1767
02:34:33,414 --> 02:34:37,407
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1768
02:34:38,887 --> 02:34:41,286
and I can't remember what it was.

1769
02:34:44,091 --> 02:34:45,422
It's okay.

1770
02:34:47,528 --> 02:34:48,995
It's okay to forget things.

1771
02:34:49,229 --> 02:34:54,792
<i>Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.</i>

1772
02:34:55,135 --> 02:34:56,796
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1773
02:34:56,904 --> 02:34:58,599
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1774
02:34:58,705 --> 02:35:00,935
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1775
02:35:01,041 --> 02:35:02,804
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1776
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:04,639
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1777
02:35:04,745 --> 02:35:06,736
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1778
02:35:06,847 --> 02:35:10,214
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1779
02:35:10,317 --> 02:35:14,048
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1780
02:35:15,055 --> 02:35:18,024
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1781
02:35:21,595 --> 02:35:23,187
Somebody go up there.

1782
02:35:29,802 --> 02:35:32,771
<i>He was five when I moved in.</i>

1783
02:35:32,872 --> 02:35:37,332
<i>Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.</i>

1784
02:35:43,349 --> 02:35:47,285
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1785
02:35:47,386 --> 02:35:49,820
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1786
02:35:49,922 --> 02:35:53,380
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs. "

1787
02:35:54,627 --> 02:35:55,924
<i>The days passed.</i>

1788
02:35:56,028 --> 02:36:00,260
<i>And I watched as he forgot how to walk</i>

1789
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:07,938
<i>- and how to talk.
- What's my name?</i>

1790
02:36:08,407 --> 02:36:09,737
I'm Daisy.

1791
02:36:10,909 --> 02:36:12,672
Can you say "Daisy"?

1792
02:36:14,246 --> 02:36:19,513
<i>In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.</i>

1793
02:36:26,358 --> 02:36:30,124
<i>And in the spring of 2003,</i>

1794
02:36:34,499 --> 02:36:36,160
<i>he looked at me</i>

1795
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:43,733
<i>and I knew that he knew who I was.</i>

1796
02:36:47,279 --> 02:36:53,081
<i>And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.</i>

1797
02:37:25,649 --> 02:37:29,813
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1798
02:37:34,325 --> 02:37:38,090
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1799
02:37:45,134 --> 02:37:47,159
Good night, Benjamin.

1800
02:38:09,559 --> 02:38:11,925
<i>We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.</i>

1801
02:38:12,028 --> 02:38:14,258
<i>It occurred in the Ninth Ward.</i>

1802
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:20,133
<i>Some people are born to sit by a river.</i>

1803
02:38:21,671 --> 02:38:23,604
<i>Some get struck by lightning.</i>

1804
02:38:25,507 --> 02:38:27,600
<i>Some have an ear for music.</i>

1805
02:38:29,211 --> 02:38:30,838
<i>Some are artists.</i>

1806
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:33,511
<i>Some swim.</i>

1807
02:38:34,950 --> 02:38:36,577
<i>Some know buttons.</i>

1808
02:38:38,387 --> 02:38:39,752
<i>Some know Shakespeare.</i>

1809
02:38:40,922 --> 02:38:42,685
<i>Some are mothers.</i>

1810
02:38:44,659 --> 02:38:47,685
<i>And some people dance.</i>

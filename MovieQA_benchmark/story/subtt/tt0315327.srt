to congratulate our very own Evan Baxter,

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,500
who has just been elected
Buffalo's representative to Congress.

4
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,900
And, now, we have a surprise for Evan.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
No, you don't.
We do.

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,500
Oh, no. I really didn't expect this.

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Here's a look back at his run for office.

Guys, Dad's very proud of his new car.

Hey, I am proud of my new car.
Look, I'm a politician now.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,100
I'm in the public eye, and as you know,
when you are in the public eye,

We're off on a new adventure!

It's just we're going to miss our friends.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
You'll make new friends, better friends.

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,500
Yeah, richer friends.

I am the boss of you.

something for our fishermen up there.

EVAN: Baxter family,
this is what's called a scenic vista.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,000
And I don't think the big man himself
could do a better job. Pretty cool, huh?

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,900
Hey, Dad, an iguana can stay underwater
for 28 minutes.

Sure.

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Okay, it's between your maple
and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,200
That is nice! Which is best?

to that "save the rainforest" stuff,

you can't beat the Brazilian cherry.

That's right. You going with the cherry?
Cheery cherry!

No. He might have lice, fleas,
maggots or something.

91

If we give him water,
he's just going to come back.

92

Come on, Dad, why can't we keep him?
I mean, we've got a new house.

Okay, Ryan, this is why we can't keep him.

They are stinky. They are smelly.
They get hair all over the place.

so much fun tonight,

He asked if we could all pray together.

he prayed for?

Yeah. What did you pray for?

116
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,400
I prayed we would become closer
as a family.

to happen. I will make that happen.

00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Must have the wrong address.

176
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Yup. The wrong address.

177
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
WOMAN: Congressman Baxter.
Good morning.
Good morning.

178
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
MAN 1: Good morning,
Congressman Baxter.
Hello.

179
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,500
MAN 2: Good morning,
Congressman Baxter.
Good morning.

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Oh, this is so cool.

181
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Uh-huh.

182
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah. This'll work.

183
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,600
There he is! The head honcho.
The big kahuna.

184
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,600
Rita, I think I have to do the dance.

185
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,900
Do the dance.

186
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,300
(GRUNTING)

187
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,800
That's enough of the dance.

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

189
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,700
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

190
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,000
Do you smell anthrax?

191
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,000
Congressman!
Hey, Marty!

192
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Nice sound to that.
I like it.

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Here they are!

194
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
(ALL CHEERING)

195
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
All right.

196
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,600
You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

197
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,400
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

198
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,600
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.
How many stars on the flag in 1818?

199
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
15.

200
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

201
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,800
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

202
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,500
served sans pastry of any kind.

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Very impressive. A little freaky,
but I like this kid.

204
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,900
(LAUGHING) I love you.

205
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Hmm?

206
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,900
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
Not going to happen.

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

209
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
EUGENE: He was actually right.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm doing a background check on that kid.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

212
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,100
BOTH: "Change the world!"

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,900
Okay, Evan, who do you know?
What do you mean?

214
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

216
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,200
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

217
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,500
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

218
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

219
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,300
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

220
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
You and Congressman Long
having a barbecue.

221
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,800
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

222
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
RITA: Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

223
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,300
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

224
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
The Congressman would like for you

225
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

226
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,400
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,100
The Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act.

228
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,400
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.
Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?

229
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,600
I just did.

230
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,500
Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
I am the legislative...

232
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

233
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

234
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,500
Play nice. Play nice.

235
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

236
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

237
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,500
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

238
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,900
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

240
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

241
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,900
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

242
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,300
This is day one.

243
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,600
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

244
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Oh, and another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

245
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,300
Well, I can't do it today.

246
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
I promised my kids...
Eugene.

247
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,500
Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.

248
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,600
If Congressman Long wants to
pass it this quarter,

249
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,800
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

250
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm personally going with whatever
Congressman Baxter decides,

251
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,500
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

252
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,900
Either him or Kareem.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,100
Can I tase him?

254
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,200
Gene! Heel!

255
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,700
It'd probably be you.

256
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,500
Come on, Evan, this is it!
This is why we came here!

257
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,500

packed up so that we can...

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Wow, that's huge. He must be proud.

690
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,200
So, I have come up with a little
construction project for us this weekend.

691
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,400
The whole weekend?

692
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,900
The whole weekend. Yes!

693
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,800
And maybe a couple weekends after that.

694
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,100
I can do this. Help!

695
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,300
(GRUNTING)

696
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,300
How do I stand up with a piece of wood?
Here we go.

697
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,800
(JUST LIKE NOAH'S ARK PLAYING)

698
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,500
Oh, man. Okay, that's good.

00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600

00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,800
Mother! Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!

701
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,500
EVAN: Keep it straight.

702
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
(GRUNTING)

703
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,600
Hey, Dad, he's back!

704
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,400
Ryan, no, don't do...

705
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Ow!

706
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Leverage it up! Leverage. Okay.

707
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,000
Just put some leverage.
You got to put some body weight.

708
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Ready? One, two, three. Come on.

709
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,700

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
Oh, I'm an idiot.

713
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,300
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman.
Why do you have raw beef hands?"

714
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,400
"Well, I'm building an ark."

715
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,800
(GROANING)

716
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,200
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
I got a boo-boo!

717
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,900
You ever hear of Home Depot?
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!

(GROANING)

722
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,100
All right. So our little Marlboro Man
moment didn't work out so well.

723
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,100
It's a disaster. I don't know
how to build something like this.

724
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,800
That's easy. Just don't.

725
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,600
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

726
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Wow.

727
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
(PHONE RINGING)

728
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,100
Hello.

729
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,300
Yes, Marty. Your fearless leader is right here.

730
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,600
Hey, Marty, what's up?

731
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,700
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.

732
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
I might need security. Thank you.

733
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,200
Can I help you?

734
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,600
Rita, it's me.

735
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Why do you sound like Evan Baxter,
but look like a Bee Gee?

736
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,100
Okay. All right.

737
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,500
Okay, that's great. It's longer.

738
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,400
Oh, my God. It is you.

739
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,100
Evan, what happened?

740
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,300
Did you fall in a mine shaft?

741
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
No.

742
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Did you just come out of a coma?

743
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
No.

744
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,900
Were you attacked by a werewolf?

745
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,200
No, I wasn't.

746
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,200
Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

747
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,800
You look like a bum in a suit.

748
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,000
You need Super cuts and a shave.

749
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,400
(EXCLAIMING)

750
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,600
Right! Yeah. But I can't. It doesn't work.

751
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,300
What do you mean, it doesn't work?

752
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,700
It doesn't work!

753
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,500
What? Are you shooting up Rogaine?

754
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,000
Rita, if Evan shows up... I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be with you in just one...

755
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,800
Evan?
Take it in. Take it in.

756
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,600
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

757
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,800
I am going through adult puberty!

758
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,300
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

759
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,500
What was so important?

760
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,300
What is so important?

761
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,100
I've got a letter of intent here
about Congressman Long's bill.

762
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,200
You remember that, don't you?

763
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,400
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

764
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,700
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

765
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,600
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

766
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,000
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

767
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,000
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

768
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,600
You have no idea.

769
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Evan, what is going on?

770
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm...

771
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Building something.

772
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,400
MARTY: You're building something?

773
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,200
Well, I hope it's a barber shop.

774
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,200
Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

775
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,400
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.
Just cover for me. Just help me out!

776
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
(DOOR CLOSING)

777
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Come on, Evan, be reasonable.
You got to get rid of that beard.

778
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,600
I need your face back. I need you back.

779
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,300
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

780
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm building a boat.
You're building a boat?

781
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,200
Look, you got to cover for me.
I don't want anybody to see...

782
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,500
Congressman! There you are!

783
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Congressman Long, I, I, I, I...

784
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Stop stammering, son.
We all play hooky from time to time.

785
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,500
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

786
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,900
(LAUGHING)

787
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,000
Very good.

788
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

789
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,000
No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

790
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,900
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

791
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,100
It's a wife thing, sir.

792
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,900
Just trying to spice up the love life.

793
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,300
She's a big Loggins and Messina fan.

794
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,700
Keeping it fresh. Keeping it real.

795
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,400
Would you excuse us for a moment?

796
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,900
The Congressman and I are going to
have a little chat.

797
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,000
Come on.

798
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,300
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

799
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,000
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

800
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,100
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

801
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
No, sir.

802
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,500
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsor ship of a bill,

803
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,900
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

804
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,300
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

805
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,200
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

806
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,400
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

807
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,600
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

808
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,600
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

809
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,800
You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?

810
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,900
No, sir.

811
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
Top of the food chain.

812
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,800
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

813
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,400
It chooses to run with a pack.

814
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,600
And do you know why?

815
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
No.

816
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,200
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

817
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,000
that it is stronger as part of a group.

818
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

819
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,900
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

820
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,700
Ouch, that hurts.

821
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,000
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

822
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,500
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

823
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,700
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

824
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,900
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

825
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,700
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

826
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,900
Now, you have to come to a decision.

827
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,200
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

828
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,400
I am a pack man, sir.

829
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,600
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

830
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,800
I want your full support and nothing else.

831
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,000
Yes, sir.

832
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,200
Those fish are on you like bait on a hook.

833
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,800
Birds follow you.

834
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,400
Fish follow you.

835
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,300
Let's see if we can get
some congressmen to follow you.

836
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,400
Let's get this bill passed,
shall we, Congressman?

837
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,600
Yes, sir.

838
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,400
Hey, fleabag, out of the way.

839
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Hey, Dad, I think there are more
animals than yesterday.

840
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,700
Well, let's not keep
our audience waiting, shall we?

841
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,400

842

(SNORTING)

843
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,100
Up, up. Push it up. Push it.
We got it. We got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

844
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,600
Come on. Just let it go, just let it go.

845
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,500
Dad, we can do this,
but we're gonna need some help.

846
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,800
I know. We just need something
to lift those beams.

847
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,900
(SIGHING)

848
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,600
Like that?

849
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,300
RYAN: Holy moly!

850
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,300
(RYAN CHUCKLING)

851
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,000
RYAN: This is so totally awesome!

852
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
JORDAN: This is perfect.

853
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,100
DYLAN: Dad, there's a note.

854
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,000
Let me see that.

855
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,200
How does it work?

856
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,700
RYAN: Dad, this is really weird.

857
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,000
Repeat after me, "We are hamsters!"

858
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,700
BOTH: We are hamsters!

859
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,600
And you're still sucking up.

1203
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,700
So, why are you here?

1204
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,900
Long locked us out.

1205
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
He can't do that.

1206
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,300
I mean, I've been suspended,
but I'm still a congressman.

1207
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,500
Rita, tell him what you know.

1208
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,600
Tell me what?

1209
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,500
I smelled a rat the second we got that office.

1210
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,600
You don't get an office
like that for nothing.

1211
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,900
So I had the stalker here do some research.

1212
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,100
Okay, Eugene, talk.

1213
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,300
Prestige Crest used to be federal lands,

1214
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,300
but what's interesting is
how it got into private hands.

1215
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,700
Congressman Long got the approval
to build a dam

1216
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,700
and then passed out the surrounding lands
to a group of private investors.

1217
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,100
Now, the locals fought this thing for years.

1218
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,400
They said Long and his developer buddies
were cutting corners,

1219
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,800
like skipping important
building code checkpoints.

1220
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,900
And with the land use bill, he's gonna do
the same thing with the national parks.

1221
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,700
So, you stand by and shake your pom-poms
while Long and his buddies get rich.

1222
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,900
What can we do? I'm suspended.

1223
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,400
Go back to the Hill and show them
that you can and will fight this bill.

1224
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,500
You guys, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I have to get back to the ark.

1225
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,200
The ark? All right. Okay.

1226
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,200
God told you to build an ark?
Yes.

1227
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,300
But did he tell you to make your friends
believe in you and follow you here

1228
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,500
so you can make us look stupid?
'Cause I go to church every Sunday.

1229
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,000
Okay, every other Sunday.

1230
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,500
I've been to church!
And that does not sound like God to me.

1231
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,000
Rita, I know that this
doesn't make any sense.

1232
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,700
I just want you to trust me.
You just have to have faith.

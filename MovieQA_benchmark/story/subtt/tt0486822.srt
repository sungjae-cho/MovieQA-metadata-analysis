1
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,708
<i>- You think he sees us?</i>
<i>- No, he can't see us.</i>

2
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,512
<i>But trust me, he can feel us watching.</i>

3
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,656
Pop? Oh, that's a big one, Pop.
That's a big one here.

4
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,391
Okay.

5
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,093
He showed up.

6
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,798
Ten-two. Come on, kid, you can do it.

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,134
He's circling that little alcove
right there.

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,265
This is all you, Kale. That's it.

9
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,340
Try to put it right in front of him.
Right in front of him.

10
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,106
See, you're talking to me,
and you're messing me up, Dad.

11
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,976
Okay. Don't spook him.

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,243
- Come on. There.
- There we go.

13
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,339
Oh, that was perfect.

14
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,249
Oh, he's taking it.
Look, he's following it.

15
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,116
Easy. Easy.

16
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,152
Dead drift. Dead drift.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,249
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- Easy. Easy. Come on, baby, take it.

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,987
- Take it, baby.
- Bite, bite, bite!

19
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,791
- He bit, he bit!
- Okay, easy.

20
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,194
- That's it. Tip up. Tip up.
- Okay, okay.

21
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,357
Do I let go? Do I let the line go?

22
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,265
No, don't panic. Just let him take it.
If he wants to take it, let him take it.

23
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,836
- Tip up. That's it.
- He got it. He's biting.

24
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,530
I know. No, he's got it, baby. Come on.

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,836
Okay, reel him in slow. Nice and slow.
Hold him.

26
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,101
All right. All right.

27
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,113
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's all right.

28
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,243
It's okay. You did everything you could.

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,783
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

30
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,547
You did everything you could.
Sometimes they just get away.

31
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,316
Come on, let's take a break.
Come on, it's all right.

32
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,359
If I can't catch a fish,
I don't know what I'm doing out here.

33
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,394
- Beats working, right?
- What?

34
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,293
Hold that. I said, it beats working.

35
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,959
You're a writer. You work from home.
You ain't got it that tough, come on.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,502
- Here you go. You got it?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,840
You know what?

38
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,436
I really appreciate you bailing
on your friends

39
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,176
to spend some time with your old man.

40
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,212
It's not like you forced me
to be here, Pop.

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,913
- No, I know, but I appreciate it.
- I appreciate it.

42
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,616
Anything you want to talk about?
Anything...

43
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,352
- What? What?
- No, it's just...

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,724
- Is this that moment? This is that...
- Never mind.

45
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,853
- No, no, this is that father-son...
- No, never...

46
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,330
- No, I'm in.
- Forget I said it.

47
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,459
I got something. Here's something.
You got a keen eye for this.

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,435
- You're not gonna tell Mom?
- No, I won't say anything.

49
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,439
No? All right. I'm having a kid.

50
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,168
Yeah. You know,
your little boy's growing up.

51
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,039
I got a girl pregnant,
and now I gotta go visit her.

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,805
She lives in Reno.
I don't know how I'm gonna get there.

53
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,505
I'll probably have to take Mom's car.

54
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,105
But we're gonna live together.
We're gonna move into a trailer park.

55
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,684
Yeah, her name's Shirley.
She's real great.

56
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,117
- Yeah? She cute?
- Of course.

57
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,351
Yeah. Good. That's all that counts.
Smart-ass. Let's fish.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,892
I'm gonna catch one before you.

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,897
Yeah, but I don't mess with you
while you're fishing. That's the deal.

60
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,771
No, Ma, we drained the entire...

61
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,864
Literally every fish that was swimming
in the river is now in the trunk right now.

62
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,710
- You're kidding.
<i>- No, I'm not kidding.</i>

63
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,006
Yeah, are you sure you two aren't
stopping off and buying a fish,

64
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,478
like you did last time?

65
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,571
What?

66
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,617
Are we gonna stop off and buy fish,
like the last time?

67
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,050
No, no. Ma, come on.
We know you're too savvy for that.

68
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,746
Oh, come on, look at this guy.

69
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,413
Oh, come on! Jackass!

70
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,048
<i>- Hey.</i>
- No, no, no. No, not you, Mom.

71
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,490
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the phone.

72
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,118
Hey, babe,
you should have seen him today.

73
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,424
<i>We got enough fish for a week.</i>

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,499
<i>- How long do you think you'll be?</i>
- I don't know. About an hour?

75
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,568
Forty-five...

76
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,692
Kale!

77
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,372
Kale!

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,316
Oh, God.

79
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,317
Oh, God.

80
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,482
Kale, are you okay?

81
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,446
Dad.

82
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,284
Kale!

83
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,296
Dad?

84
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,399
Move it!

85
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,911
Yeah, keep dreaming, perv.

86
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,780
Ronnie!

87
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,204
<i>Senor</i> Brecht?

88
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,903
Kale.

89
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,646
So, Kale,

90
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,045
think you can stay conscious
long enough to tell us

91
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,917
your plans for the three wondrous

92
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,751
summer months ahead?

93
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,852
Do you want me to stand up?

94
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,757
Summer months.

95
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,586
I don't know what you just said.
I didn't read that far in the book.

96
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,962
Did you do the homework or not?

97
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,766
I guess not.

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,328
You guess not?

99
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
I don't know who you think you are,

100
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,003
or who you think you're dealing with.

101
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,910
You can't give me
a straight answer, fine.

102
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,079
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fail you

103
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,851
right now.

104
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,819
What would your father think?

105
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,693
No, Kale! No, no, no!

106
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,466
Okay, Mr. Brecht.

107
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,272
You're six months shy of 18.

108
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,371
That means the Assault Two charge
you've pled guilty to carries a maximum

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,277
of one year in juvie.

110
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,577
With these priors, you're up to three.

111
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,048
Losing a parent isn't easy,

112
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,890
which is why I'm sentencing you
to three months house arrest.

113
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,222
Mr. Brecht, I just cut you a break.

114
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,264
Don't test me.

115
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,064
Okay, you're all set to go nowhere.

116
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,629
Now, green means you're good,
you're in the safe zone,

117
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,904
which covers about
a 100-foot radius from this guy.

118
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,104
You unplug it,
the police come immediately.

119
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,237
He's like a modem.

120
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,009
He gets a constant GPS signal
from Mr. Bracelet

121
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,609
that goes through your phone line
to the monitoring systems downtown.

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,210
So they know where you are,
where you've been

123
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,812
and what you're thinking, 25/7.

124
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,949
- What if he accidentally goes beyond...
- Red light flashes.

125
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,994
You got 10 seconds
to get your butt back to green, or else.

126
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,892
Or else what?
The execution squad shows up?

127
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,056
And they don't bring blindfolds.

128
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,599
It's tamper-proof and waterproof.

129
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,363
So don't try to stick your foot in a bucket
of water and hop across the line.

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,461
It won't work, and you'll look stupid.

131
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,871
Now, here's the instructions.
Here's my card.

132
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,999
Thank you.

133
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,875
Are you all set up to pay
the incarceration fee, Mrs. Brecht?

134
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,580
- No.
- $12. Every day.

135
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,978
I accept all major credit cards.

136
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,212
Great.

137
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,048
My wallet's right over here.

138
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,021
Officer.

139
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,258
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Brecht.
- Thank you, really.

140
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,934
Gutierrez?

141
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,034
Your Spanish teacher,

142
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,129
he's my cousin.

143
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,803
Oh, one more thing. Listen up.

144
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,937
House arrest might sound like a breeze,

145
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,811
but I've seen many a folk get a bit loopy
after too long.

146
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,782
Some after just a day or two.

147
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,446
So find constructive things to do
to keep yourself busy.

148
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,648
Boom! Nice shot.

149
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,988
Okay, get my left flank.
There's two more at the entrance.

150
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,585
Let me jump on the M60.
Cobra's at 3 o'clock.

151
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,664
- Just get your position and hold it.
<i>- Do it now, man!</i>

152
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,734
Just get your position and hold it.
Go down to the bottom entrance.

153
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,564
Okay, here we go.
Here it comes, here it comes.

154
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,035
- Just watch. Here it goes.
<i>- Shoot, now!</i>

155
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,867
- Fired.
<i>- Come on!</i>

156
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,737
Boom! Boom! Got it.
Okay, we got that. We got that.

157
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,403
Now, follow me. Off the ledge.
There's a secret entrance at the bottom.

158
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,107
Hello?

159
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,945
You gotta be kidding me. Hello?

160
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,999
<i>Alan stops by</i> Cheaters <i>to discuss</i>
<i>what's been eating at his conscience.</i>

161
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,366
<i>Well, your camera busted in</i>
<i>on the situation that I guess I was in.</i>

162
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,631
Uh-oh.

163
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,041
Here she comes.

164
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,734
<i>Hey! Where you going?</i>

165
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,901
Caught you, bro.

166
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,945
<i>Here. Come around here.</i>

167
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,105
<i>What the... is going on?</i>

168
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,738
<i>- Alan?</i>
- Come on.

169
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,077
Man up, Alan.

170
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,175
<i>- Open the... door.</i>
<i>- Alan?</i>

171
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,413
<i>- What the...</i>
<i>- What the hell you doing?</i>

172
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,546
<i>What the...</i>

173
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,089
<i>Explain what you're doing</i>
<i>with Valerie's cousin?</i>

174
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,659
<i>How the hell... How the...</i>

175
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,896
<i>... Saint Tropez all the way to Cannes.</i>

176
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,338
<i>It was so beautiful. There's nothing</i>
<i>like it, especially from the air.</i>

177
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,337
<i>Parasail with us through the skies</i>
<i>over endless blue water.</i>

178
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,677
<i>Then shop Cabo's maze of streets,</i>
<i>alleyway stores and curios.</i>

179
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,742
<i>Then we'll get adventurous</i>
<i>with the best in water sports.</i>

180
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,516
<i>And, of course, the good stuff,</i>
chicas calientes.

181
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,488
<i>On</i> Bikini Destinations,
<i>Cabo San Lucas.</i>

182
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,257
<i>Police in Madison...</i>

183
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,195
- More trash TV?
- No, it's news.

184
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,994
<i>... 15 miles west of Springdale</i>

<i>Family members reported Williams</i>

188

<i>after repeated calls to her cell phone</i>
<i>went unanswered for three days.</i>

189
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,844
You canceled my Xbox.

190
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,412
iTunes, too.

191
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,345
You know what else I'm canceling?

192
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,008
Maid service.

193
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,816
Look, Kale, I'm sorry you're a felon,
but this is not a vacation.

194
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,484
I have two open houses today.

195
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,529
I want you to clean up this room
and clean up the kitchen.

196
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,528
I'll do that.
Let me just check my schedule.

197
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,190
<i>If you have any information</i>
<i>on the whereabouts</i>

198
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,429
<i>of Patricia Williams,</i>
<i>a special hotline number</i>

199
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,028
<i>has been set up at 1-800...</i>

200
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,507
Isn't that a little overdramatic?

201
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,769
You don't think
I'm just gonna plug it back in?

202
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,105
Dramatic?

203
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,876
What are you gonna do now?

204
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,886
Are you crazy?

205
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,818
- Ma...
- That's dramatic.

206
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,853
Clean up your room.

207
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,263
Ronnie, you have no idea
how much this thing itches.

208
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,664
Plus, my mother transformed.
She's a dictator now,

209
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,236
like the warden from <i>Shawshank.</i>
And she took my Xbox.

210
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,000
And my iTunes are gone, right?
And I can't go anywhere.

211
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,735
I'm losing it. I'm losing my mind.
Just give me any information,

212
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,242
anything at all.
What's going on out there?

213
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,940
<i>You gotta see these Oahu chicks.</i>
<i>The natives are ferocious.</i>

214
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,140
<i>This girl down by the pool,</i>

215
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,878
<i>she just taught me how</i>
<i>to say "Lauhala-lana."</i>

216
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,647
- What does that mean?
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

217
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,484
<i>- I think it's a Hawaiian mating call.</i>
- You're lying.

218
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,553
Who's that with you? Is that...

219
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,719
<i>Do you work here?</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?</i>

220
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,195
No, no, don't do it. Ronnie. Ronnie.

221
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,357
- Ronnie! Ronnie!
<i>- I've gotta go, bye.</i>

222
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,039
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

223
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,611
Oh, yeah, there we go. Yeah.

224
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,119
Mary asked if I'd cover the hostess
stand a couple nights this week.

225
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,320
So, I could be kind of late.

226
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,336
Do you want to talk about anything?

227
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,339
I got nothing.

228
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,742
- I'm dropping this off in the garage.
- Oh, careful. Careful.

229
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,472
It's a priceless family heirloom.
I don't have time to explain it.

230
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,277
Put it downstairs.

231
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,682
Get the boxes out first.

232
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,069
Ashley, sweetie,
could you please come upstairs?

233
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,181
- Be nice to your mom today, okay?
- I am being very nice.

234
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,308
And we've got more stuff in the car,
so, you know, join in.

235
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,415
Yeah, I'm coming!

236
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,515
God.

237
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,019
Yeah?

238
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,298
Oh! Oh, shit.

239
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,804
No!

240
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,698
It's dog shit.

241
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,646
What a retard!

242
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,482
You little bastards.

243
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,415
Bet you think that's real funny, huh?

244
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,488
What are you gonna do?
Kill us, like you killed your teacher?

245
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,820
Not before I shove this shit and my foot
back up your asses.

246
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,325
Oh, crap!

247
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,560
Dude, you said
he couldn't leave his house.

248
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,066
He can't!

249
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,332
Oh, shit.

250
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,636
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

251
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,039
Turn green! Turn green!

252
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,440
Okay, here we are, back at home.
I'm good.

253
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,907
Turn green. Come on.

254
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,177
Come on! Turn green, I'm in!

255
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,415
Turn green. Come on.

256
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,982
Yes!

257
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,351
Yes! Yes!

258
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,759
Hey, are you okay?

259
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,830
No, it's fine.

260
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,136
I'm fine. It just... It turned. I'm green.

261
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,273
No, no, no. Sir? Listen.
Officer, listen to me.

262
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,440
I wasn't trying to go anywhere.
I wasn't trying to leave.

263
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,042
There's a bag of shit on my stairs.
Two kids just...

264
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,849
Honestly, they put a bag of shit
on my stairs and they lit it on fire.

265
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,652
- Get down on the ground.
- There's a bag of shit on my...

266
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,659
Get down on the ground!

267
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,757
Get your hands behind your head.

268
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,664
Somebody comes
and shits on my house?

269
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,702
- Face down, face down.
- This is bullshit.

270
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,131
Now give me your other hand.

271
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,889
<i>Kale, calm down. The officers were</i>
<i>probably in the neighborhood already.</i>

272
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,084
Yeah, but the cop that came,
that cop is my teacher's cousin.

273
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,025
They're related.
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

274
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,394
- Is there no other cops that can...
<i>- He didn't haul you away, right?</i>

275
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,057
- No. No, he didn't. He...
<i>- Because first times happen.</i>

276
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,635
- Right.
<i>- The officers knew that.</i>

277
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,930
<i>Even your teacher's cousin.</i>

278
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,235
<i>But next time you will be back</i>
<i>in front of a judge, all right?</i>

279
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,899
Thank you.

280
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,338
Little harder, Chad.

281
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,025
Hi, pup.

282
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,930
Come here.

283
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,495
- You and me, both.
- Frankie! Frankie!

284
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,663
- Where is he? Where is he?
- No, no, no.

285
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,999
Frankie! Where are you?

286
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,908
Frankie!

287
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,679
- Mom?
- What'd you get?

288
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,519
Just a couple things.

289
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,991
You want to try them on for me?

290
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,995
- Maybe later.
- Well, the pool's almost ready.

291
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,406
<i>Aloha, Senor</i> Kale.

292
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,006
Ronald! What's going on, bro?

293
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,975
- Nothing.
- How you doing?

294
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,778
- Oh, great. Have you been showering?
- Of course. Come on.

295
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,045
- What is that?
- Macadamia nuts.

296
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,950
That's all you got me?
Some stupid nuts?

297
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,852
Hey, I got something to show you
that is most definitely...

298
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,118
No, no. I got something to show you.
I got something to show you.

299
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,784
This is reality without the TV.

300
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,883
There's a world
right outside my window.

301
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,929
- Look, look. Here we go.
- I have Maui chicks, man.

302
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,157
There it is. Mrs. Pilch.

303
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,824
And the Pilch dog.

304
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,932
- Exciting.
- No, no, no, wait, it's not done.

305
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,401
Look, and then she...
Look what she does.

306
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,099
She says bye to Linda,
the maid they have at the house,

307
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,607
who has a titty tat, you know.

308
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,542
And then every Thursday at 4:00,
she goes to the country club

309
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,672
and plays tennis
with Betty Big-Bangs over there.

310
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,512
Okay, and then the ladies leave.

311
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,314
Here we go. Cue Mr. Pilch,
coming back from work.

312
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,820
- Fascinating.
- Here we go, here we go.

313
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,914
Get up. Get up and look at this.
What do you think that's about, huh?

314
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,721
He comes in. Here, take this.
Take this. Take it.

315
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,730
Put that down. Look.
Look at the top, second story.

316
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,490
- Who's there?
- Damn!

317
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,568
Right? You see what I'm saying?
Here, come on.

318
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,695
- Ronnie, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

319
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,767
Oh, my God, you've made
the Tower of Twinkie.

320
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,741
Is that in the <i>Stalker's Handbook</i>
somewhere?

321
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,370
No, listen. That's not what I am, okay?
I'm not a stalker.

322
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,848
These are just simple observations.
Natural side effects of chronic boredom.

323
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,475
Find your passion, Kale.

324
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,918
This is Robert Turner.

325
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,120
And...

326
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,657
He does that about twice a day.
Other than that, I don't really see him.

327
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,353
Here's the little shitbagger sleeper cell
I was telling you about, remember?

328
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,294
- Oh, the ding-dong ditch?
- Yeah, that's them.

329
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,525
So what's the plan
for the counterattack?

330
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,124
I don't know.
I'm keeping my options open.

331
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,500
- The runt is mine.
- Here, come on.

332
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,706
- What was that?
- Here, come on.

333
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,637
Last stop on the tour.

334
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,610
Here, come here. Come here.

335
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,410
Oh, my God.

336
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,725
There is a God.

337
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,894
Yeah.

338
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,304
Who is she?

339
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,239
I don't know.

340
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,142
What's stopping you?

341
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,641
Come on.

342
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,142
Shit. Oh, God.

343
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:57,980
Can I help you?

344
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,557
No, no, no. I'm fine, I got it. I got it.

345
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,184
I'm real close.
It's just the bush has grown a little bit.

346
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,162
Don't worry about it.
I do this all the time.

347
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,891
Yeah, I can tell.

348
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,860
I got these two.

349
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,928
A little embarrassing,
I can't get my own mail.

350
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,905
I think any pride you had left
was gone a while ago.

351
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,167
Oh, you mean when the cops came.

352
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,266
No, no, no.
That was a screw-up on their end.

353
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,710
That wasn't me.
Wrong guy, wrong house, wrong...

354
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,744
Wrong. Just wrong.
I'm Kale, by the way.

355
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,479
So, how's your move going?

356
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,389
- Still going.
- Yeah?

357
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,118
I'd help. I'm just a little
spatially challenged at the moment.

358
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,786
Yeah, you kinda got that whole
Martha Stewart thing going on.

359
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,295
Yeah, kinda. Except I don't get, like,

360
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,592
a 48-hour allowance for office visits.

361
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,691
I'm not very good
at decorating pastries, either.

362
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,201
It's not one of my strong suits.

363
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,930
So, where'd you say you moved from?

364
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,131
- I'm from the city.
- The city?

365
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,435
And now, forcefully relocated.

366
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,004
Ashley?

367
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,375
Can you come in here, please?

368
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,910
My mom.

369
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,243
Yeah, I've been washing dishes
by hand.

370
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,185
She's really polite
and always says "please,"

371
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,917
but she has that tone, did you notice?

372
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,856
Yeah, I know the tone.

373
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,194
I'm Ashley, by the way.

374
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,891
Noticed that, too.

375
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,001
<i>Japan's earning season will</i>
<i>go into full swing this week, so...</i>

376
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,236
<i>... weeks ago.</i>

377
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,812
<i>A valet parking attendant says</i>
<i>an unidentified person</i>

378
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,781
<i>picked up Williams sometime</i>
<i>between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.</i>

379
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,149
<i>That individual was driving</i>

380
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,948

381
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,457

382
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,526

385
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,881
Started without me, huh?

386
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,278
Nice.

387
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,549
What are you stopping for?

388
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,190
No.

389
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,304
You can't see me. It's too dark in here.

390
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,751
All right, you've done it.
You've pushed me right over the edge.

391
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,381
Just look at me when I talk to you!
Now, listen...

392
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,859
You've let me down, Ashley!

393
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,976
A Mustang.

394
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,776
- Oh, Jesus.
- Jesus.

395
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,715
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me. I'm sorry.

396
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,013
That's fine. It's fine.
I didn't hear you. You're like a ninja.

397
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,678
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

398
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,517
What are you doing?

399
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,321
Just staring out the window.
Staring at the wind. You know,

400
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,823
getting creative.

401
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,726
Well, I just wanted to say good night.

402
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,196
- Well, good night. I love you.
- Okay.

403
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,494
- I love you.
- Okay. Sleep good.

404
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,501
Jesus, Ma.

405
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,180
Hey.

406
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,120
What are you doing?

407
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,324
What are you doing?

408
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,095
Looking at my garden? Is that it?

409
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,403
You looking at my beautiful garden?

410
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,432
Well, I caught you now.

411
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,674
I got you.

412
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,612
Yeah, you're not gonna
dig in my garden anymore.

413
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,988
Nothing about missing bunnies,
but listen to this.

414
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,562
Now the cops are saying
that the circumstances surrounding

415
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,221
the girl's disappearance are similar

416
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,858
to several murder-kidnappings
in Austin three years ago.

417
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,863
All redheads.

418
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,768
They didn't catch the guy,

419
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,637
but they found seven chicks' bodies
in a house

420
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,371
a year after the alleged killer
abandoned the property.

421
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,975
No leads, no way of IDing
whoever lived there,

422
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,516
'cause he used a fake name,
and probably a PO box,

423
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,143
'cause no mail was ever delivered
to the house.

424
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,380
Hello.

425
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,720
Oh, here, check this. They got pictures.

426
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:48,814
- Wow, that is sick.
- Hello.

427
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,292
- Yo, you gotta see this. Check this...
- Movement.

428
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,523
- We're going swimming.
- Okay.

429
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,024
What do we have?

430
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,827
Well, better late than never, right?

431
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,871
Here we go. Here we go.

432
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,209
I really, really like your neighborhood.

433
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,543
- Well, that's new.
- We like new.

434
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,558
It's so warm, baby.

435
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,988
Okay, that's it. Cleansing breath. Can I?

436
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,099
- Yeah.
- Okay.

437
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,102
There we go.

438
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:38,166
Okay, girl, you concentrate now.
This is for the gold.

439
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,970
Oh, God!

440
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,481
You're a jackass.
You are a genuine jackass.

441
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
Seriously,
there's no way she heard that.

442
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,152
I promise you, she heard it.
My deaf aunt in Omaha heard.

443
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,620
Oh, no!

444
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,256
- What?
- She just saw me. She saw me.

445
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,391
- What?
- Yeah, she saw me.

446
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,594
- She was looking up at me when...
- No.

447
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,692
- No, no.
- Yeah, she saw me.

448
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,135
There's no way she... See? She's...

449
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,604
Okay, maybe she did.

450
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,900
Really?

451
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,636
Well, are her swims always that short?

452
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:16,907
No, she usually takes her time with it.
That's what I'm telling you.

453
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,312
Oh, God. And now she's gone.

454
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,251
- No!
- No!

455
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,621
It's nothing. It's not her.

456
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,194
Well, listen, it could be her.

457
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,354
- It's not, so...
- Okay, we'll check. We'll check.

458
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,696
Well, no, no, I'm saying, if it's not her,
then you can let them go away.

459
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,670
It's her at the door. It's her at the door.

460
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,830
- No! No, no, no.
- Just look, look.

461
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,604
- Shit! Don't, don't...
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop it. Okay.

462
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,907
- Wait, wait, I got it.
- Oh, my God, we are so busted.

463
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,414
- No, no, no! Wait! Don't answer it!
- I have to.

464
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,577
She knows I'm here.
I got the thing on my foot.

465
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,714
Hi.

466
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,622
What took you so long?

467
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,663
What... We were...
We were upstairs playing.

468
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,266
- Video games!
- Yeah. Video games.

469
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,064
This is my friend, Ronnie. Ronald.

470
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,464
- Say hi, Ronald.
- Hi, Ronald.

471
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,332
You're so stupid.

472
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,905
So, what brings you here?
To my house?

473
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,437
- I got locked out.
- Oh, that sucks.

474
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,039
It's a tragedy.

475
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,778
So, you gotta call someone?

476
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,383
No, I'd rather stay stranded,
if you don't mind.

477
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,560
Video games, huh? I like to play.

478
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,391
Is this your room?

479
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,403
Just so you know,
it's a little messy, okay?

480
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,972
- A little?
- Yeah.

481
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,039
Anything interesting out here?

482
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,306
The...

483
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:58,907
Okay.

484
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,185
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

485
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,917
Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale?

486
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,087
Actually, he is.

487
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,261
You see, he's got this neighbor,

488
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,798
who I guess, by definition,
would also be your neighbor.

489
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,924
Who may, in point of fact,

490
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,399
- be a cold-blooded killer...
- Right.

491
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,561
...from Texas.
- Right. Well, he's from Austin.

492
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,400
- Yeah.
- Is that so?

493
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,770
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...
- Exhibit A. Robert Turner.

494
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,267
Yeah.

495
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,368
Yeah, I've seen him. So?

496
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,844
- So?
- So...

497
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,314
Well, so, the missing girl's
from Madison?

498
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,509
On the news.

499
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,450
You think he has something
to do with that?

500
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,044
He drives a car
just like the one she was

501
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,383
- last seen in.
- Which is a '60s-era Mustang.

502
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,479
A '60s-era Mustang.

503
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,582
- Same color. Yeah.
- And it's the same color.

504
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,456
Gee, that really narrows it down.

505
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,725
Well, you know,
the news said that car was dented.

506
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,323
- Yeah, and his front fender's dented.
- Yeah.

507
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,832
- Right?
- It's cohesive.

508
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,467
- It matches. The whole story.
- Yeah.

509
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,767
It fits.

510
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,474
Okay.

511
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,980
I am seeing the Mustang.

512
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,043
But no bashed-in fender.

513
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,418
What? Yeah, no, it's there. It's there.

514
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,048
If I could just... It should be there.

515
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,855
That's weird.
How'd he get it fixed so fast?

516
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,230
Maybe 'cause it was never there
in the first place.

517
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:30,030
However, he is clearly a pack rat.

518
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,871
He plays volleyball.

519
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,313
- He collects skulls!
- What? Here, let me see.

520
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,520
That's a longhorn skull.

521
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:44,982
You know what state's famous
for longhorns.

522
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,579
- Texas.
- And what state's the killer from?

523
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,953
Texas.

524
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,793
Fine. Where's the coffee and donuts?

525
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,833
You can't have a stakeout
without coffee and donuts.

526
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,671
That's everything I could find.

527
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,235
Got most of it off of my uncle.
He's a type-A sociopath.

528
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,744
How long has Turner lived there?

529
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,837
I don't know. A few years.

530
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,974
Hey, check this out.

531
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,175
The victims they found in Texas
were preserved,

532
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,311
delaying their decomposition.

533
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,218
This guy was so sick.

534
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,755
They say their bodies were twisted
and jammed into the basement walls.

535
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,493
This girl died from blunt trauma,
most likely blows to the head and face.

536
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,261
Gnarly. I'm hungry.

537
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,931
Let's order pizza.

538
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,035
He's been gone a while.

539
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,297
Here.

540
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,102
How'd you get my phone?

541
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,040
That's a big violation of privacy,
you know.

542
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,841
This is... I could turn you in for this.

543
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,479
What did you do?
I know you did something.

544
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,916
Every time he calls you,

545
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,813
that's what you'll hear.

546
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,019
Okay. That's a nice choice.

547
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,120
Cute.

548
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,362
It's a little scary, though, right?

549
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,163
It could use a little color. Do you mind?

550
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,207
No. Go for it, Picasso.

551
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,238
So, why'd your parents drag you
to the 'burbs, anyway?

552
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,575
Well, I guess my mom wanted
to keep my dad on a shorter leash.

553
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,385
City life had its temptations.

554
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:35,324
But my mom pretty much cries
just as much as she always did,

555
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,054
and my dad doesn't care
more than ever.

556
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,157
What'd they think,
the extra bathroom would help?

557
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,426
Maybe a two-car garage.

558
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,593
"You know what, honey?
Infidelity, forget about it.

559
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,261
"Look at the storage space!"

560
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,100
Something like that.

561
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,571
So, what are your issues, Kale?

562
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,206
What makes you think I have issues?

563
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,943
Gee, I don't know.

564
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,419
Look, there he is.

565
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,090
It's another car.

566
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,938
Who said chivalry's dead?

567
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,634
I didn't.

568
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,902
- There's a club girl for you.
- How can you tell?

569
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,507
The bright green bracelet
is from The Place.

570
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,347
The red one is from The Komodo Club,
and yellow is from Razors.

571
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,114
Jesus. You must have a great ID, huh?

572
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,049
I don't need one.

573
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,116
I love her shoes.

574
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,990
You gotta be joking.

575
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:49,297
Is that what you're looking at? Shoes.

576
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,634
Of course.

577
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,005
He's going in.

578
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,174
He's gonna get her all liquored up.

579
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,102
This feels wrong.

580
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,708
Oh, he's going for it.

581
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,409
Okay.

582
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,950
Here he goes. Here he goes.

583
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,449
Denied.

584
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,687
Look at the look on his face.

585
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,963
A little music to set the mood.

586
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,163
- What do you think they're listening to?
- I don't know.

587
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,141
You know what? I got an idea.
Here, take this.

588
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,542
- No.
- No?

589
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,150
No. Stop, stop.

590
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,020
- No.
- Yeah.

591
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,023
- You're kidding me.
- I think we got a match.

592
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,422
Oh, God.

593
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,463
It does match.

594
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,458
Only in Disturbia.

595
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,791
Where else are you gonna get
this kind of entertainment?

596
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,168
- Thank God you moved here, right?
- Yeah.

597
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,316
Wait a minute.

598
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,811
Wait, did you see that?
Wait, zoom in a little.

599
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,997
Oh, my God.

600
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,541
Did you see that? The price tag.

601
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,017
She won't be returning that dress.

602
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,054
Oh, there you go.
Now you should bust your move.

603
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,296
Who's the redhead?

604
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,337
- She's cute.
- Don't you have something to do?

605
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,805
Don't you have something to do?

606
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,375
- No.
- Your...

607
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:18,207
Yeah. My dad likes this song,
by the way.

608
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,654
Hi, Mom.

609
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,720
- Here we go.
- No, I'm fine.

610
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,666
I'm at Barnes & Noble.

611
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,362
No, that's okay, I'll walk.

612
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,733
Shift's over. Gotta go.

613
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,705
Walk me?

614
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,137
Sure.

615
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,141
Give this to your mom.

616
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,885
Thank you for an interesting night
and day.

617
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,729
I guess this is as far as you go.

618
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,657
I guess so.

619
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,229
So, same shift tomorrow?

620
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,475
I'll get back to you.

621
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

622
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,473
Somebody, anybody.

623
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:02,347
Somebody, anybody.

624
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,987
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

625
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,894
Hello, boys.

626
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,096
Family fun night.

627
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,274
Okay. I see what's going on.

628
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,640
Oh, Jesus. You guys are screwed now.

629
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,183
"We're just watching cartoons."

630
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:38,653
"Oh, okay, sweetie. I understand.
You guys are growing boys."

631
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,324
Come on, Mom.

632
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:49,498
Bastards. Wow, they are horny as shit.

633
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,231
Help! Help!

634
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,737
Shit, come on.

635
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,409
Oh, shit.

636
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,721
Okay. Oh, God.

637
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,762
- Ronnie.
<i>- How far did you get?</i>

638
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,237
Ronnie, listen to me. Okay.
Turner just saw me.

639
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,432
<i>- What?</i>
- Yeah.

640
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,737
And the redhead
who was at his house, okay?

641
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:41,970
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- He chased her around the house,

642
00:49:42,078 --> 00:49:44,273
and it got dark, he turned the lights out.

643
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,748
I mean, I don't know what I saw. I saw...
Well, what if he killed her? I mean...

644
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:51,150
<i>Slow down, slow down. Talk to me.</i>
<i>What is happening?</i>

645
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,723
- Just stay on the phone.
<i>- Kale?</i>

646
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,986
Okay, just stay on the phone.

647
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,424
<i>Are you seeing something?</i>

648
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,137
<i>Kale, what is happening?</i>

649
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,133
<i>Talk to me, man.</i>

650
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,011
It's the redhead.
She's leaving the house.

651
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,681
<i>You are seriously losing it,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

652
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,445
<i>You gotta stop this, all right, Kale?</i>

653
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,848
<i>Kale?</i>

654
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,692
- No!
- No, no, no! Whoa.

655
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:11,767
Whoa. Just take it easy.

656
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:14,394
Easy. Slow down.

657
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,504
I'm Robert Turner. I'm your neighbor.
I just live behind you...

658
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,905
Yeah, I know who you are!
What are you doing in my house?

659
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,069
- Well, I...
- Morning, honey!

660
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,537
I think I startled him.

661
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:29,347
I ran into Robert at the grocery store.
I had a flat tire when I came out.

662
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,247
We tried to change it,
but that adaptor thingamajiggy...

663
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,720
Yeah, my dad put those bolts on.

664
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:36,087
Well, it did not work.
Instead it stripped it.

665
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:37,716
- My fault.
- No.

666
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,922
You saved my life.

667
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,856
We had it towed to Frank's.

668
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,901
Oh, yeah?
Thank God you were there, huh?

669
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,197
- To tow it to Frank's.
- Just glad I could help.

670
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,034
Kale, would it kill you
to use a bread knife?

671
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,505
It's a knife. What's the difference?

672
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,873
Well, the difference?
About 60 bucks at Bed Bath.

673
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,813
Hey, you know, those things...

674
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,144
I've always been curious
about those things.

675
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,414
- Do you mind if I just take a look?
- Yeah, I mind.

676
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,054
- So what'd you do?
- How do you like your coffee?

677
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,251
I popped my Spanish teacher.

678
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,400
Shoot, I think I left the milk in the car.
I'll be right back.

679
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,214
So, when you say that you

680
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:40,148
- popped your teacher...
- Yeah, I punched him in the face.

681
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,624
Listen,

682
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,252
I get it.

683
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,759
I went to school.

684
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,327
There are plenty of teachers
I wanted to just kill.

685
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,542
Kale, would you grab the sugar, please?

686
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,411
Here it is.

687
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,076
Can I pour you some milk?

688
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,319
On the way back here, your mom was
saying how much she likes eating out.

689
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,618
Was she?

690
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,056
I thought maybe we could do dinner
and a movie sometime...

691
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,653
- That's not gonna happen.
- I would like that. It'd be good.

692
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,790
For me. For me it's not gonna happen.

693
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,891
But I'm sure my mother would love
to go, huh, Ma?

694
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,766
- You'd love that.
- Why don't we sit down?

695
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,737
Nice meeting you, Kale.

696
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:38,174
- He is something.
- Yes, he really is something.

697
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,774
And so is your place.

698
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,284
That's creepy.

699
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,547
I said it, I told you.
The guy's a freak show, right?

700
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,555
Did he genuinely mean
it was nice meeting you,

701
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,922
or was he sending you
some kind of sinister message?

702
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,253
- Are you playing with me?
- A little.

703
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,592
- Did you even notice my hair?
- Yeah, no, it's nice.

704
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,567
It's real nice. Okay, there's the Mustang.

705
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,604
Then there's the longhorn skull
in his garage.

706
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,071
And then there was the club girl.

707
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,074
Who looked freaked out, okay?
She looked freaked out.

708
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,144
She was running around half-naked
in his living room.

709
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,973
Then he challenges me.
He stares at me.

710
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,378
He shows up in my kitchen,
hits on my mother.

711
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,040
- I mean...
- Can you blame him?

712
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,674
Your mom's hot.

713
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,244
My mom's hot. Can you be serious?

714
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:20,913
Did you consider whatever look
that girl had

715
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,151
might have been something else?

716
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:27,121
Maybe she likes being
chased around half-naked.

717
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,330
And that's it?
That's what you're leaving me with?

718
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,902
I'm going to a party.

719
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:35,698
- Whose?
- Mine.

720
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,866
Yours?

721
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,603
You're having a...
I didn't mean to say it like that.

722
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,938
I just didn't know you knew anyone.

723
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,535
I met this girl today, Minnie Tyco.

724
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:46,046
Minnie... Yes, "Skinny Psycho."
Yeah, I had Spanish with her.

725
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,173
She's a lot of fun.

726
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,582
I told her my parents were going out
of town, and one thing led to another.

727
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,416
She called somebody,
and then they called somebody,

728
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,082
- and now, everybody's coming.
- Yeah, no, I got it, I got it.

729
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,921
So now you got the whole jock
and bimbo population showing up?

730
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,892
Well, that'll be fun.

731
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,796
So you're really going through with this?

732
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:07,927
Yes.

733
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,531
All right, well, that'll be fun.

734
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,940
I just didn't think
you would conform so fast but...

735
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,914
Try to keep those
in your drawers tonight, will you?

736
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,064
Wait, what was that?
Oh, you think I'm watching you.

737
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:49,175
Well, I'm not. I'm not watching.
I'm minding my own business.

738
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,987
Hey, how are you?

739
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,965
All right, that's it. That's it!

740
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,398
Oh, my God.

741
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:12,418
- You don't like Minnie Riperton?
- Fire!

742
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:15,588
I hit him, you guys! Go, you guys!
Go, go, go, go!

743
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,689
I got you now, Greenwood!

744
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,429
- Oh, my God! Go!
- You better not be listed!

745
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,534
Big tactical error, my friend. Huge!

746
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,878
What the...

747
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,349
What are you doing here? Huh?

748
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:41,650
Oh! No! Wait.

749
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,555
What's wrong?
You don't like my music?

750
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,727
- Oh, my God.
- What?

751
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,868
Oh, shit. Hold on.

752
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,097
Back off, or I will throw this
where you can't follow.

753
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,369
Okay, just relax, okay?
That's 60 gigs of my life.

754
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:02,842
Even better.

755
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,245
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

756
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,646
I'm trying to enjoy my party.

757
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,615
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Oh, no, wait.

758
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:12,279
That's wrong.
According to you, I'm trying to conform.

759
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,788
- Well, you could have fooled me.
- What does that mean?

760
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,121
I'm saying, if you're trying
to enjoy your party, enjoy your party.

761
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:20,354
Don't keep looking up at me, trying
to get a rise out of me. It's unnecessary.

762
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,397
So, you were watching me.

763
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:25,163
But for how long? Just tonight?

764
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,733
A week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?

765
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,635
What have you been
keeping tabs on, Kale?

766
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,977
What else have you seen?

767
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,305
- What else have I seen?
- Yeah. What else?

768
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,946
I've seen a lot.

769
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,116
I mean, not like that. Not... I mean...

770
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,853
For instance, I've seen that you're

771
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,757
maybe one of, I don't know,
three people in the world

772
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,231
that likes pizza-flavored chips.

773
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,032
You're also the only person
I've ever seen that spends more time

774
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,300
on the roof of her house
than in her actual house.

775
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:07,171
And what are you doing?
You're reading.

776
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:11,372
Books. You know, not <i>US Weekly,</i>
or <i>Seventeen</i> or, you know...

777
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,175
But you're reading substantial books.

778
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,447
You also do this...

779
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:21,887
You do this thing where,
it's like an OCD thing, but it's not. It's...

780
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,926
Whenever you're leaving your room,
you grab the doorknob, and you turn,

781
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,326
you're getting ready to leave,
but you don't, you stop,

782
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,799
and you back up, and you turn
to the mirror, and you stare at yourself.

783
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,496
But it's not like a, you know,
"I'm so hot," type of stare.

784
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,936
You know, it's more like,

785
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,436
"Who am I, really?"

786
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:45,604
And to ask yourself that, I mean, that's...

787
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,280
That's so cool.

788
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,516
Also, you look out the window
all the time, like I do,

789
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,685
only you're looking at the world,
you know.

790
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,460
Trying to figure it out.
Trying to understand the world.

791
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:07,366
Trying to figure out why it's not in order,
like your books.

792
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,541
I'm only looking at you.

793
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,848
That's either the creepiest

794
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,228
or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

795
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,947
Remember the other night?
When we talked about my issues?

796
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,788
- You said you didn't have issues.
- Did I?

797
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,218
That was bullshit. I got a million issues.

798
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,327
For a guy who killed his teacher?

799
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,140
I didn't kill my teacher.

800
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,677
What?

801
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:41,458
- Holy shit.
- What?

802
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,032
What's in the bag?

803
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,072
- Oh, my God.
- What?

804
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,404
- What'd you see?
- Red smears.

805
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:02,277
- Blood?
- What should we do?

806
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,182
<i>I can't believe you want me</i>
<i>to break into this guy's car.</i>

807
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,450
We need to see what's in the blue bag.

808
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,492
So, get in the car and get
the garage door opener, all right?

809
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,993
<i>Are you sure I'm still in the clear?</i>

810
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:14,392
Ashley, where's Turner now?

811
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,466
He's shovel shopping.

812
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,403
Visual coming your way.

813
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,843
<i>Are you sure I'm clear?</i>

814
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,775
Yeah, you're golden, man.
He's still in the store.

815
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,711
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

816
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,854
- Well, that's pretty cool.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

817
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,899
Ashley's got, like, a live feed going here.

818
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,141
<i>This is a lot harder than it looks</i>
<i>on the Internet.</i>

819
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:06,113
You're doing great, man.
You're doing great.

820
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,098
Ashley!

821
01:03:27,536 --> 01:03:30,562
- Hi!
- Hi, Skinny Minnie.

822
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,505
Where did you hear that name?

823
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:40,079
- Hello? Ashley? Hello. Ashley.
<i>- Son of a bitch. I'm in.</i>

824
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,013
There you go!
Nice. All right, start looking around.

825
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,312
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Look under the seat, too.

826
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,319
In side compartments, glove box,
the whole nine.

827
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,719
<i>- It's not here, dawg.</i>
- Nothing? All right.

828
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,292
All right, keep looking. Hold on.

829
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,555
- Yes.
- Kale, I lost Turner.

830
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,631
I ran into Skinny Psycho.

831
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,131
You lost...
When is the last time you saw him?

832
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,202
I don't know. About five minutes ago.
His car's gone.

833
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,634
All right, hold on.

834
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,568
- Okay. Ronnie.
<i>- Yo, yo, here, I found his opener!</i>

835
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,107
Okay, listen to me. Pop it open
and give me the code, okay?

836
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,175
Pop it open
and give me the code right now.

837
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:08,243
<i>No, no, but it looks like</i>

838
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,470
<i>I can just open the garage right now.</i>

839
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,239
No, Ronnie, don't do that.
Don't do that, Ronnie.

840
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,679
Just give me the code, okay?

841
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,444
<i>- Why do you sound so agitated?</i>
- Okay, listen.

842
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,382
Ashley just lost Turner,
who's coming home right now.

843
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,046
That's why I'm agitated.
I need you to read me the code. Okay?

844
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,090
- So, pop it open and give it to me.
<i>- What? Oh, no, no, no.</i>

845
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,624
<i>Operation Stupid is officially over.</i>

846
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,557
No! Ronald, no! Listen to me.

847
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,720
Stop right there, turn around
and give me the code.

848
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,390
Pop it open and give me the code!
You're right there!

849
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,332
Pop it open and go.
Pop it open and give it to me, Ronald.

850
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,428
<i>I can't get this... I can't...</i>
<i>It's not opening, okay?</i>

851
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,530
Okay, keep trying. Hold on. Hello?

852
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,040
Kale, you've gotta get Ronnie
out of there. Now!

853
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,166
Yeah, I know, I know. He's got the code.

854
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,244
He's giving it to me right now.

855
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,643
Well, tell him to hurry. Shit!

856
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,343
Okay, okay, okay.

857
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,541
Hello? Ronald, go.

858
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,550
<i>Are you ready? It's one down.</i>

859
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:51,685
Miss Carlson.

860
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,745
Kale.

861
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,289
<i>Three up, four up. No, no, no.</i>
<i>Sorry, I screwed that.</i>

862
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,486
Okay. Up?

863
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:00,823
<i>Four down.</i>

864
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,988
Kale?

865
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:05,923
Hi.

866
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,496
I'm Robert Turner.

867
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,165
I live behind you.

868
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,904
Oh, yeah.

869
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,609
Would you mind?

870
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,579
It's just a little rude.

871
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:32,725
What are you doing?

872
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:37,561
Well, I'm officially welcoming you
to the neighborhood.

873
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:43,336
I know that you've been following me.

874
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,304
Don't. No, don't.

875
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,609
Don't deny it.

876
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:54,839
I'm not upset. And, quite frankly,
I don't even want to know why.

877
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,588
I just would like you to know that

878
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,719
I'm a little on the shy side.

879
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:09,353
So, short of all this sneaking around

880
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,728
in some kind of hip, new-aged way

881
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:17,533
of coming on to a somewhat older man,

882
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,278
I really feel obliged to tell you

883
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,610
that I rather enjoy my privacy.

884
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:35,346
You see, the world is...
It's in a heightened state of paranoia.

885
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,452
And I tend to think that someone
as intelligent

886
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:44,329
and attractive as you

887
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:49,698
doesn't need to be wasting her time
stoking the fire.

888
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,462
I...

889
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,243
So, now you know.

890
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,711
You're not the only one who's watching.

891
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:15,297
So, feel free to pass that along
if you'd like.

892
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,228
Cool?

893
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,062
Are we cool?

894
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,833
Cool. Cool.

895
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:26,632
Cool.

896
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:38,084
All right. That's it. Give me the phone.
I'm calling the cops.

897
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,485
Wait. He didn't do anything.

898
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,256
All he said was that he liked his privacy.

899
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,792
But think about that.
Why does he want his privacy?

900
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,156
I mean, he's hiding something.
We know that.

901
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,388
- Yeah, definitely.
- Right?

902
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,430
And he knows that we know that.
He knows that.

903
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:53,468
And regardless of if he had a bad day
or a good... It doesn't matter.

904
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,196
He scared the hell out of you.
That's a grown man.

905
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:58,432
Look, Kale, he freaked me out,
but he's right.

906
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,803
We're the ones spying.

907
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,343
Oh, man,
she's got that Stockholm thing.

908
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:05,675
You know, where the hostage
falls for the hostage taker.

909
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,147
- Where do you get this stuff?
- I read a lot.

910
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,378
Okay. I got a...
How is that a nice or charming guy?

911
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,785
- I didn't say that.
- No, okay, Ash, what you said was...

912
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,687
You said, "He broke into my car,
but he did it in a nice way."

913
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,727
- Maybe I'm not understanding.
- Okay, you know what?

914
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,921
- Can we just...
- Drop this?

915
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,131
This is obviously not
a cute little game anymore.

916
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,225
This has gone way too far.

917
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,808
Hi. No, I'm not over here.

918
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,304
Okay, I'm coming.

919
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,312
Parents' anniversary,
amazingly enough.

920
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,218
Just drop this, okay?

921
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,086
I'll call you later.

922
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,471
<i>This is Ronnie. Make it good.</i>

923
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,709
Ronnie, I did some research
on Turner's house, okay?

924
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,719
I'm looking at the blueprints, and it says
that when this house was first built,

925
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,255
this main house and the garage
weren't connected.

926
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,517
And now there's
this whole middle piece.

927
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,185
That middle piece wasn't there.
I mean, what would he need that for?

928
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:28,058
I'm just thinking out loud. Call me back.

929
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:09,836
- Who is it?
- It's Ronnie, man! Come on!

930
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:11,428
- Did you get my message?
- What? No, listen.

931
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,031
- I dropped my phone in his car!
- Wait, wait, wait.

932
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,440
- Wait.
- I went home, it wasn't in my pockets.

933
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,409
I must have put it down
when I was putting the thing back on.

934
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,502
- Okay, okay, stop.
- I don't want to...

935
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:19,581
Are you understanding what I'm saying?

936
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,513
Okay, look!
We're gonna get your phone, okay?

937
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,551
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna get your phone.

938
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,813
But I need you to do
one more thing for me.

939
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:32,918
<i>- Yeah. Okay. Okay.</i>
- You there?

940
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,019
<i>How am I looking? Can you see this?</i>

941
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,563
Yeah, you're good. I see you.

942
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,465
<i>Okay, how does it look over there?</i>
<i>Am I... Is anything moving?</i>

943
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,268
<i>How am I looking?</i>

944
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,670
- Yeah, you're good to go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

945
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,278
There you go. There you go.

946
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,350
<i>Wait, is this... You still got a signal?</i>

947
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,226
Yeah, no, I see you, I see you.
Do it from around the corner.

948
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,732
There you go.

949
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,498
<i>Are you sure I'm still clear?</i>

950
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,773
No movement. You're fine.

951
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,071
<i>Oh, God. I made a lot of noise.</i>
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

952
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,581
You're good.

953
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,284
<i>Oh, man, it reeks in here.</i>

954
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:36,184
- What's it smell like?
<i>- Like the corpse of a rotting hottie.</i>

955
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:38,555
<i>Okay, yes, the door's unlocked.</i>

956
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,359
<i>I'm not seeing it, man. It's not in here.</i>

957
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:45,797
Just keep looking. It's there.
Just calm down.

958
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,334
Just be patient, you'll find it.

959
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,098
<i>Oh, God, yes. Okay, I got it. I got it.</i>

960
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:52,703
<i>- Oh, thank you, thank you.</i>
- There you go.

961
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,435
Okay. Okay. Now listen.

962
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:58,001
- You gotta find the bag.
<i>- Okay. All right. Okay.</i>

963
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,438
<i>I don't see it.</i>
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>

964
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,077
<i>I see it, I see it. Do you see this?</i>

965
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,587
There it is. Good job. Good job.

966
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,382
- Okay.
<i>- All right, okay, okay.</i>

967
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,484
<i>I just gotta put the camera down</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

968
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,064
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>This is definitely the source of the stink.</i>

969
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:22,026
<i>Bro, I don't want to do this anymore.</i>
<i>I want to come home.</i>

970
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,231
Just stay calm. Stay calm.
I need you to look in the bag.

971
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:28,434
<i>God, there's a lot of blood.</i>

972
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,546
<i>- Wait a minute, I think that's hair.</i>
- Okay.

973
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,078
<i>Oh, Jesus, this is nasty.</i>

974
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,819
<i>Oh, God. This is sticky.</i>

975
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,949
Ronnie, the camera's sliding.
Ronnie. Shit.

976
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,961
<i>Well, that was close.</i>

977
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:53,390
Good save.

978
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,369
<i>Okay, I got it. Jesus. How am I looking?</i>

979
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,105
<i>Oh, no.</i>

980
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,007
<i>What the...</i>

981
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,204
Ronnie? Did you just close the door?

982
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,511
<i>I think there's someone in the garage.</i>

983
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:12,947
<i>Help me.</i>

984
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,555
Ronnie.

985
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,889
Oh, shit, he's in the house.

986
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,505
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

987
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,336
Ronnie?

988
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:45,681
Oh, shit.

989
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,073
Ronnie!

990
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,842
Ronnie!

991
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,849
Open the door!

992
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,280
Officer! Officer!

993
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,177
- Listen, my friend, has been kidnapped!
- Drop the bat now!

994
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,772
- Down on the ground!
- Okay. Okay.

995
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,977
Drop it. Now! Clear the bat.

996
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:53,286
The only reason I came here
is my friend is in the house.

997
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,789
He's kidnapped by the owner
of the house who's trying to kill him.

998
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,860
- No, come on, man!
- He's claiming a possible 10-31.

999
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,656
- It's open.
- It was open when I got here!

1000
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,753
- Breaking and entering.
- Bullshit!

1001
01:15:03,865 --> 01:15:06,095
- Mr. Turner?
- Yes, I am. Can I help you?

1002
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,793
Sorry to wake you, sir,

1003
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,804
but the kid here is claiming
that his friend is in your house.

1004
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,441
Do you know anything about that?

1005
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:15,333
No, I certainly don't.

1006
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,775
You lying son of a bitch, he's in your...

1007
01:15:16,878 --> 01:15:18,106
- That's it, come on.
- He's in the house.

1008
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,578
- Come on, here we go.
- Okay, look.

1009
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:20,807
He didn't just wake up five minutes ago.

1010
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,747
The man has been kidnapping
and killing people.

1011
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,309
Okay? There's a body in a blue bag
in his garage!

1012
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,349
Please.

1013
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,187
Sir, when we got here,
the door was open.

1014
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,654
Well, how would he get the door open?

1015
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,890
I'm not sure, sir. I don't see any signs
of breaking and entering.

1016
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,024
Just keep him here for a second.

1017
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:42,570
Yeah, he lives with his mother.
They live back here.

1018
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,901
Just give me a second, sir.

1019
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:48,067
Something doesn't feel right. Let's just
check it out. Just take a second.

1020
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:50,636
Come on, let's go.

1021
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,717
Sir, do you mind
if we take a look inside?

1022
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,547
Not at all. You be my guest.

1023
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:00,245
- He was stealing?
- Yeah, I think so.

1024
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:02,482
I'm not quite sure, but he did something.

1025
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,993
Okay.

1026
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,051
I hit it the other night.

1027
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:08,052
I thought I could save a few steps
and get it off the road myself.

1028
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,857
I was hoping to bury it sooner,
but it's been a hell of a week.

1029
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,985
But you found time to fix your fender,
though, right?

1030
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,961
Well, that car is a classic.

1031
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,691
I had to get it out of storage
for the auto show.

1032
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,892
I needed it in pristine condition.

1033
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,332
- The auto show?
- That's right.

1034
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,404
The auto show. Big car fan, huh?

1035
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:25,268
- All right, that's it.
- The auto show.

1036
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,601
Let's go.

1037
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,538
- What about my friend then, huh?
- All right, all right.

1038
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:31,043
- Where's my friend then, huh?
- Let's go. Come on.

1039
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,443
Auto show!

1040
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,418
It was his second violation, Mrs. Brecht.
He's due in court at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1041
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,817
Can he press charges?

1042
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,980
Well, your son was in his house,
Mrs. Brecht,

1043
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:45,685
and so, yes, Mr. Turner
can file charges if he chooses.

1044
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,020
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1045
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,563
Good night.

1046
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,465
I can't believe this.

1047
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,734
I can't believe you're actually buying
this guy's bullshit.

1048
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,776
- What? After what you just pulled?
- It's bullshit, Mom.

1049
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,277
And everything that's happened
this past year,

1050
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:07,348
it's a miracle
they didn't just take you away.

1051
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:11,112
- I have to go talk to him.
- What are you talking about? Now?

1052
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,686
- He could press charges, Kale.
- Now?

1053
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:15,813
- I don't care if he's gonna press...
- Sit down!

1054
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,018
I care.

1055
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,061
You are breaking my heart, Kale.

1056
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,549
Oh, shit.
What the hell are you doing, Ma?

1057
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,889
Oh, shit.

1058
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,066
Ronnie? Ronnie.

1059
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,639
Oh, no.

1060
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,784
Piece of shit.

1061
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,177
Ronnie.

1062
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,056
- Yo, don't kill me.
- You motherfuck.

1063
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,956
- Don't kill me. Hey...
- Are you serious?

1064
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:02,052
Do you have any idea
what I've just been through?

1065
01:20:02,163 --> 01:20:03,630
Hey! Come on!

1066
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,199
I thought you were dead.

1067
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,235
Dude, did you want me to go up
to the cops and be like,

1068
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:11,362
"Oh, hey, you know what, Officer?
He's right. I was in his house.

1069
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,168
"I went in there to get the phone
out of the car

1070
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:15,038
"that I broke into earlier today."

1071
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,974
Look, all I could think of was,
"I don't want to go to jail.

1072
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,273
"Hide. Hide."
And I went into the closet, and...

1073
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,975
Okay. All right, okay, okay,
that was a bad joke.

1074
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,778
- I just wasn't thinking straight, okay?
- I get it. I get it.

1075
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:25,853
- Please, please. I'm so...
- Yeah.

1076
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:28,286
- Yeah?
- Oh, God. You bastard.

1077
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,157
God. You bastard.

1078
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,687
- Hey, so what was in the bag?
- It was a dead deer.

1079
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,856
- Naturally.
- Yeah.

1080
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,736
Yo, what is your mom doing over there?

1081
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:45,032
She's keeping me out of jail.

1082
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,566
Oh, wait. You know what? Then before
they confiscate this evidence,

1083
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,440
you should come over here
and peep this.

1084
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,742
I'm serious, man.
I got my whole great escape on video.

1085
01:20:53,848 --> 01:20:57,284
I hope this works. I dropped it.
Here we are.

1086
01:20:57,952 --> 01:20:59,715
You know what?
I was in your closet for, like, two weeks.

1087
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,379
I gotta take a piss. Check this out.

1088
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,116
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Yo, it's genius.

1089
01:21:03,224 --> 01:21:05,454
<i>Ronnie? Did you just close the door?</i>

1090
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,528
<i>I think there's someone in the garage.</i>

1091
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:09,793
<i>Help me.</i>

1092
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,899
What was that?

1093
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:37,748
Yeah, but it's just been
really hard on him.

1094
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,191
He still blames himself.

1095
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,157
I understand.

1096
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:48,497
I know feelings like that, they don't...
You know, they don't just go away.

1097
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:11,889
Thank you so much.
You've just been so great about all this.

1098
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,687
Well, it's been my pleasure.

1099
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,859
Thanks.

1100
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,935
- Good night.
- Okay.

1101
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,441
Ronnie!

1102
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:39,319
Ronnie, get up here! Ronnie!
She's on the tape!

1103
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:42,188
Ronnie!

1104
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,155
The club girl, she's dead!

1105
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:47,621
Ronnie!

1106
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:21,886
So, he got her on tape?

1107
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,685
I really didn't want this.

1108
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,830
All I wanted

1109
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,964
was to live in peace,

1110
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:40,738
which is why we gotta keep
the spotlight on you.

1111
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,606
You've done most of the work already.

1112
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,306
You are the troubled neighborhood boy
who cried wolf.

1113
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:51,812
But now,

1114
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:57,250
you are really going to snap.

1115
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:07,191
First, you killed your buddy,

1116
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:11,194
because he was calling your girlfriend
behind your back.

1117
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:16,468
And now we gotta
bring your mom over here

1118
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,811
so you can slit her throat,

1119
01:25:21,482 --> 01:25:25,384
because she just wouldn't stop
blaming you

1120
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,785
for killing your dad.

1121
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,323
So, it sounds good?

1122
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:38,957
Good.

1123
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,627
Pen and paper.

1124
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:51,435
Write this down.

1125
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,709
"Dear Ashley,

1126
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,153
- "I killed Ronnie..."
- Kale?

1127
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:04,182
Kale!

1128
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,793
My God. Kale!

1129
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,136
Kale!

1130
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,581
Shut the door. Shut the door. Oh, God.

1131
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:31,080
Grab the phone.

1132
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,887
The scissors! Here, scissors.

1133
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,493
- Come on, 911.
- Phone is dead.

1134
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,030
Where is your mom?

1135
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,268
Turner's house. Here, take that.

1136
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:01,813
All right, we've gotta get across the line.

1137
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,950
Get ready to run, okay?

1138
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:33,378
Come on! Go! Jump!

1139
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:38,548
- Kale!
- Go!

1140
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,153
Come on!

1141
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,135
I've gotta get my mom.
Make sure the cops are coming, okay?

1142
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,329
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1143
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,632
- Go!
- Okay.

1144
01:27:58,773 --> 01:27:59,740
Go!

1145
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,191
Mom!

1146
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:33,263
<i>13-Adam? 13-Adam-74, come in.</i>

1147
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:35,103
13-Adam-74. Go ahead.

1148
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:39,771
<i>Yeah, I realize your shift's over,</i>
<i>but that kid just hopped the fence again.</i>

1149
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,872
<i>You still want first dibs?</i>

1150
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:47,716
13-Adam-74.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1151
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,650
<i>Roger that. Over.</i>

1152
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,820
Yeah, when I take care of it.

1153
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:58,656
Mom?

1154
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:18,444
Mom?

1155
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:55,750
Mom?

1156
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:08,368
Mom?

1157
01:30:20,147 --> 01:30:21,307
Shit.

1158
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,012
Oh, God.

1159
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,646
Oh, shit!

1160
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:39,566
Mom?

1161
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:07,281
It's the club girl.

1162
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,314
She never left.

1163
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,675
Mr. Turner?

1164
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,279
Sir, are you here? Police!

1165
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:40,847
Mom?

1166
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:08,949
Mom?

1167
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,300
Mom?

1168
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:43,039
Dispatch, 13-Adam...

1169
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,360
Mom?

1170
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:41,400
Hello?

1171
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,674
Mom? Mom?

1172
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:09,228
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1173
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,462
Oh, God.

1174
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:13,830
You're okay, you're okay.

1175
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:19,870
Here, I got you.

1176
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,792
You made me do this.

1177
01:36:48,168 --> 01:36:49,499
You know,

1178
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:51,934
I think you're the first one to ever get

1179
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:55,475
one of these things taken off early
for good behavior.

1180
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,077
- Good behavior?
- That's what I'm calling it.

1181
01:36:58,178 --> 01:37:00,806
You got a problem with it,
call somebody who cares.

1182
01:37:00,914 --> 01:37:02,381
Good behavior.

1183
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:06,649
You all set to pay the incarceration fee,
Mrs. Brecht?

1184
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:09,355
You're kidding.

1185
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,219
No, she's not kidding.

1186
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:12,758
Today counts.

1187
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:14,587
She's not kidding.

1188
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:15,923
No. Look.

1189
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,594
Follow me.

1190
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:37,376
So much for being spatially challenged.

1191
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:39,076
Does it scare you?

1192
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:41,177
Oh, yes. It terrifies me.

1193
01:37:53,233 --> 01:37:54,962
So, what happens now?

1194
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:58,161
- Did you see that?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1195
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,070
Mrs. Greenwood, hi. This is Joe Smith
from the satellite company.

1196
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:04,474
Well, we're just calling to check up
on our adult programming subscribers.

1197
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,842
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Skin flicks, ma'am.

1198
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:09,245
- That's what the kids are calling 'em.
<i>- Excuse me? What?</i>

1199
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:13,184
Well, we see that you're currently
accessing it, ma'am, as we speak.

1200
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:15,448
From receiver 3,
second floor of your house.

1201
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,387
<i>- But that's not possible.</i>
- I'm just doing my job.

1202
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:18,458
- Okay.
<i>- Thanks for your call.</i>

1203
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,026
Yes, ma'am.

1204
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:24,860
What are you watching?
What do you think you're doing?

1205
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,021
Nice.

1206
01:38:27,267 --> 01:38:28,962
And I am calling your mother!

1207
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:31,696
- You feel better now?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1208
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:33,773
- But that's just the first strike, though.
- Really?

1209
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,775
Well, yeah, it's an ongoing offensive
against neighborhood evil.

1210
01:38:36,877 --> 01:38:38,105
I'm very dedicated.

1211
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:39,702
You're my hero.

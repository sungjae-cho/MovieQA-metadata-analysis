1
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:47,511
Why don't you, like,
ever realise the truth, Vince?

2
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:50,794
I ate nine pies and a Meatball Hero
in one hour. That's a record.

3
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,276
It wasn't nine pies.
It was eight.

4
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:56,270
You left two slices of mushroom
on the last tray.

5
00:00:56,357 --> 00:01:00,191
- Violet?
- You guys, it was six pies. No Hero.

6
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:01,915
I had to call the paramedics
to pump your stomach,

7
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,715
and it was three and a half years ago.

8
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,150
When are you gonna talk
about something else?

9
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:08,627
When someone comes through
that door and breaks the record,

10
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:11,072
then we'll stop talkin'
about the subject.

11
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,512
Enjoy your pie, guys.

12
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:17,385
- It's the last one I'll ever serve.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

13
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,116
Quit it, Pete. I'm not doin' that.

14
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:24,434
It's a tradition. Sign the card.

15
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:35,826
I got it, folks.
I got the first autograph.

16
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:39,068
- Hey, Violet. All right.
- Violet's on her way to the wall.

17
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:44,310
That's 20 years
of girls leaving town.

18
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,872
That wall is jinxed.
I won't sit near that wall.

19
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:52,869
Let's hope you have better luck
than they did.

20
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:56,709
Ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,267
As you all know,
my best friend, Violet Sanford,

22
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:02,675
has decided...

23
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:06,595
has decided to leave
South Amboy tomorrow,

24
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:10,431
and travel the 42 miles
to New York City.

25
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:13,315
So... OK, come on.
Bring her up here, girls.

26
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,467
Come on, Violet.

27
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,029
Come on, Vi.

28
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,108
Come on, everyone.

29
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,950
Violet, come on.
Come up here.

30
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:27,234
- Come on, honey.
- You guys.

31
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:29,273
Now, I think it's only fair
that tonight,

32
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,996
on her last night here with us
in Jersey,

33
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,831
she grace us with a little tune.

34
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,513
- No way.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

35
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,194
Look at this.

36
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:19,508
Four people killed last night
in New York.

37
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,235
No reason at all.

38
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,751
Police have no leads.

39
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,476
- Tragic.
- Dad, what are you doing?

40
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:29,025
I guess four out of seven million
ain't so bad.

41
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:32,234
Headline should read,
"Millions Survive Night in New York."

42
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:35,152
Dad, stop. I get the point.
Here. Eat your eggs.

43
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:38,309
They're not eggs. They're egg whites.
And I'd rather eat the carton.

44
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,388
You've already lost six pounds.
You're staying on this diet.

45
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:42,513
No fast food. No sausage.

46
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,953
And I bought you some of those Lean
Cuisine meals, and I put 'em in the freezer.

47
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:49,473
- My mouth is watering already.
- And your vitamins are on the counter.

48
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:53,470
- I don't take vitamins.
- You do now. Just take them.

49
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:56,788
And I put fresh batteries in
the TV remote and set the VCR timer, so...

50
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:59,107
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Am I missing something here?

51
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm the parent. You're the child
running away to live by herself.

52
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,836
I should be tellin' you
how to live.

53
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,353
- Fine. How should I live?
- Simple. Don't go.

54
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,433
I got that Irish Spring you like.
And, Dad, whatever you do,

55
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:17,315
- don't do the laundry.
- Don't do the laundry.

56
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:20,036
Just leave it by the dryer, and I'll do it
when I come home every Sunday.

57
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,746
This is interesting. They say
the handrails on the subway system

58
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,953
could one day
lead to an outbreak of plague.

59
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,187
Dad...

60
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:32,714
Look, you said I could be
whatever I wanna be.

61
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,231
I never said "song-writer in New York City".
That's the exception.

62
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:39,105
You said anything,
and I believed you, so...

63
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,189
I'm not leavin' this house
without your support.

64
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:46,430
That's Gloria. What's it gonna be?

65
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,831
Violet, I saw how hard it was
for your mother when she didn't make it.

66
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,306
But if she was here,
she'd tell me to shut up,

67
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,992
wish you luck
and give you a big hug.

68
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:04,467
I'm not gonna give you a big hug,
and I'm not gonna wish you luck, but...

69
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:09,631
I am gonna shut up, sit here with my coffee
and pretend to be mad. Is that OK?

70
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,347
This is the last of it.

71
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:23,908
- Honey, are you OK with that?
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.

72
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,227
Wait. All right.

73
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:30,109
- That's everything.
- Let's hit it.

74
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,193
Good luck.

75
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,632
There, I said it.

76
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,916
- Love you.
- I put some pepper spray in your purse.

77
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,511
Even if you're not sure, just start spraying.

78
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,713
You know, you're not alone, Mr Sanford.

79
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:58,948
You know, me and you
should have dinner sometime.

80
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,426
I'm lockin' the doors.

81
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,147
All right. This is it.

82
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,593
What do you think?

83
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:42,669
I had a feeling
you were gonna need this.

84
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:46,432
- What are you doing?
- It's just some emergency cash I saved up.

85
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:50,590
Honey, from the looks of this place,
I'd say this is our emergency.

86
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,555
Well, I'm not takin' it.

87
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,226
Fine, then.

88
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,785
I'm freezing your assets.

89
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,675
So, thanks for everything. I'll call ya.

90
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,715
- What is this?
- It's just that all our lives, you know,

91
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:16,346
we always had one thing in common,
you and me.

92
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,473
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:21,549
It's like, you know we said
we wouldn't lose our virginity

94
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:23,593
until we got married,
and that didn't happen.

95
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,226
And then we said
we'd go to college or junior college,

96
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,785
or dental hygienist school,
you know.

97
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:32,027
And that didn't happen.

98
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,669
We've never followed through
on a single thing, you know.

99
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,271
And I think that's
what makes us so special.

100
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,151
And this is why you're crying?

101
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,228
Well...

102
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:49,026
A long time ago you told me
that you were gonna move to New York.

103
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,711
But everyone thought you'd just
stay in Jersey and get married,

104
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:56,234
like me and Danny are gonna.
You know, and look at you.

105
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:59,357
No matter what,

106
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,473
you really did it, Vi,

107
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,468
and I'm so proud of you.

108
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,952
Turn that down. You hear me?

109
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:32,392
You be quiet. It's not fair.

110
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:05,347
Hi. I'm Violet Sanford.
I just recently moved to New York,

111
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:08,349
and I was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists.

112
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,587
Violet, that is so cute.

113
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,669
Now, let me tell you about me.
My name is Wendy,

114
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:17,306
and I first moved to New York when I was
21 to be a dancer, but I broke my big toe.

115
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,185
And then I got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the Peace Corps.

116
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,474
So for the last 16 years I been
raisin' my daughter all by myself.

117
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:28,675
And then two weeks ago
she tells me that she is a bisexual,

118
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:33,114
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet.

119
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:38,225
Now, tell me
how I can help you, please,

120
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:42,674
because I am dying
to make your dreams come true.

121
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,752
You don't take the tape
unless it comes from an agent,

122
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,907
but I can't get an agent
until I get published?

123
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,306
If we were to listen to that tape,
that would give you grounds

124
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,151
for a copyright or plagiarism lawsuit.

125
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:57,388
It's just a little tape.
All I want is someone to sing my songs.

126
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:00,037
Welcome to the music business.

127
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,186
- Good evening. I.D., please.
- Hi. Sure.

128
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:19,307
- What can I get you?
- Let me ask you something.

129
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:22,912
I'm a song-writer. Is there someone
here I could talk to about my songs?

130
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,431
I've been a struggling
sax player for 12 years.

131
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,748
- What can I get you from the bar?
- Pepsi and some crackers.

132
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,513
Hey. How are you doing?

133
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,670
Excuse me.
Who's that guy?

134
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,233
That would be Mr O'Donnell.

135
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,709
Mr O'Donnell.
He's the manager or something?

136
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:56,515
Yeah. He's the music manager.
He's in charge of finding bands and...

137
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:59,270
booking new talent.

138
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:10,554
Where the hell were you, O'Donnell?

139
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,946
I got 15 orders stacked up here
and nobody to run the grill.

140
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,954
15 orders, Walt. Is that all?

141
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:18,507
Gimme ten minutes,
I'll catch us up. Go on. Lie down.

142
00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:20,827
Relax.

143
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,556
You look tired.
We can talk about my raise later.

144
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:27,391
You think this is Australia?
There's no raise. I'm about to fire you.

145
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,553
Excuse me. Mr O'Donnell?

146
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,116
Mr O'Donnell, my name is Violet Sanford.

147
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,995
I'm a song-writer.
I just wanted to give this to you.

148
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,796
I know it's not the most professional
way to submit a tape,

149
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:48,393
- but this is all pretty new to me.
- It's pretty new to me too.

150
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:51,435
I just figured as the manager
of a club like this,

151
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,473
you must know
every band on the East Coast.

152
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:56,515
The manager? Of this club?

153
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:07,473
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.
- Sure thing, Mr O'Donnell.

154
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:17,395
I don't usually do this, Violet,
but I have a feeling about you.

155
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:21,632
So I'm gonna take your tape,
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

156
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,673
Thank you.

157
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:26,712
I can't believe how easy this was.

158
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,788
Neither can I.

159
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,191
You wanna go for
some coffee or something?

160
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:35,155
O'Donnell, who do I look like?
Your goddamn maid?

161
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:39,992
That's Mr O'Donnell,
but I'll let it slide this time.

162
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,910
I told you to take your stuff home
and wash it.

163
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,669
You got cow grease caked on the front.

164
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:48,432
Walt, I've warned you
about your attitude...

165
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:51,786
- You're fired.
- You better not push me, kid.

166
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:56,746
I could find a hundred other little punks
like you who can burn a turkey burger.

167
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,913
Minimum-wage punk.

168
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:07,869
Maybe we should start over.

169
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:13,554
I'm Kevin O'Donnell, and I work the grill
here at the Fiji Mermaid Club.

170
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:17,355
I just made a complete fool of myself.

171
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,587
I was gonna tell you.

172
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:25,469
I'm almost sure I would have told you.

173
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:29,146
I just want you to know
I'm not following you home.

174
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:32,513
I'm just walking myself
26 blocks in the wrong direction.

175
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:36,146
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Did I mention how sorry I am?

176
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,910
I mean, not that it's all my fault.
You did throw yourself at me.

177
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,350
I didn't throw myself at you.

178
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,190
I was pretending to be sweet
and innocent so you'd give me a break.

179
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:45,791
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

180
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,675
Is there a reason we just walked
in a circle? Are you lost?

181
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,146
I'm not lost.
Somebody just moved my street.

182
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:54,991
You wanna play a game?

183
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:59,596
- I bet I can guess where you're from.
- I'm about to get out my pepper spray.

184
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:00,996
I reckon you're from a big city.

185
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:05,867
And there's no sign from here
of a bellybutton ring or a tongue piercing.

186
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:09,670
- I gotta go with Chicago.
- OK.

187
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:13,432
I've never had anyone stare at my ass for
half an hour, so I'm gonna say good night.

188
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:16,236
And I'm hoping
you're gonna say it back.

189
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,229
OK. I can take a hint.

190
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:22,427
I really do know a lot of people
in the music business.

191
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:24,428
You just don't give up, do ya?

192
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:27,350
Well, it was the sweet and innocent thing.
It did me in.

193
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,836
Good night, Kevin.

194
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,910
Just for the record, I was only staring
at your ass for the first 15 minutes.

195
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,953
- William Morris.
- I don't mean to interrupt. I just want to...

196
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,709
I'll transfer.

197
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,675
- William Morris. Please hold.
- It's a demo. I'm a song-writer.

198
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:52,351
William Morris.
I'll be right with you.

199
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:57,311
I just want to leave this
for Whitney or Mariah.

200
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,467
I'm sure they're personal friends of yours.

201
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:03,869
I'm sure it sounds great in your shower,
but karaoke ended a half-hour ago.

202
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,470
So if you'd like to get your songs heard,

203
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:10,267
you're gonna have to take them to
an open mic night just like everyone else.

204
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:13,350
William Morris.

205
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,632
I'll transfer.

206
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,389
You're not getting validated.

207
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,035
Can I help you?

208
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,746
Yeah, hi. I'm sure all your spaces
are filled for tonight.

209
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:51,546
I just wanted to come down and check out
what this whole open mic thing was about.

210
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:55,152
I can squeeze you in in ten minutes.
A couple of my regulars, they called in sick,

211
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,193
so I've got some spaces to fill.

212
00:15:57,277 --> 00:16:00,314
I need you to sign your name in here
and get yourself ready.

213
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,508
Bathroom's around the corner
if you want to throw up.

214
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:10,587
Next up we have a young lady
named Violet Sanford.

215
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:15,114
So let's put our hands together
for New Jersey's own Violet Sanford.

216
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:17,995
- Come on up, Violet.
- There we go. Yeah.

217
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,587
Go, Violet.

218
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:30,274
- I'm a little nervous.
- So are we, honey.

219
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,428
Don't tease me, honey. Sing.

220
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:37,077
Come on, give her a break.

221
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,754
Hello?

223
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:36,073
You gotta cheer up. You look like
somebody ran over your dog.

224
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:40,186
How much is a slice of pie?

225
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:46,667
We happen to have
the best French apple in town.

226
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,066
And it's on the house.

227
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:54,307
- It's enough to shut up.
- Sit up and pay attention, OK.

228
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:58,436
- Twenty says it's <i>Prett< Woman.</i>
- I will raise you ten,

229
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:01,429
- because it is <i>Home Alone.</i>
- You guys have to read the signs.

230
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,350
I call with <i>Saving Private R<an.</i>

231
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:06,712
- What?
- Let's flip this over,

232
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:12,116
and Miss Jennifer from Austin
says her favourite movie is...

233
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,794
No way. There's no way.
You already saw this one.

234
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:19,870
- You are such a cheater.
- Hello. A naked girl in army boots?

235
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,425
Easy play to call.

236
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,429
- Thank you.
- Those boots are kinda cute.

237
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:27,712
I'm gonna have to get me some of those.

238
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:30,751
Wait, wait, wait. Romero.

239
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:34,546
You gotta turn that up, baby.
That is the jam. Turn it up.

240
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,867
- There you go, there you go.
- Oh, no.

241
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:40,472
- Girl, what are you doing?
- Remember this? Remember this?

242
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,354
Here's my belly dance shimmy, girls.

243
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,349
Do you know those girls?

244
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,746
Yeah. They're here every morning
around this time.

245
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:58,271
- Winding down.
- Wait, wait, wait.

246
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:01,269
- They have to, in their line of work.
- Are they hookers?

247
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,268
No.

248
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:09,633
Coyotes.

249
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:15,548
All right.

250
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:18,834
You guys? You guys wanna see
what Al gave me for my birthday?

251
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,471
- This.
- You let him brand you?

252
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,673
- Isn't it cute?
- She let the man brand her.

253
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:28,750
Check it out, ladies.
We each made 300 bucks tonight.

254
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,665
You sure you wanna be
goin' off to law school?

255
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:38,145
- Let's make a toast.
- Yeah.

256
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:41,716
To Zoe's last week as a Coyote.

257
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,273
She's gonna be impossible to replace.

258
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:50,431
I just wanna tell you both
that I will never, ever forget you.

259
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,112
Who's up there?

260
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:12,032
- I'm looking for the owner.
- Come on down.

261
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,028
Bring a case with you.

262
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,712
What are you doin' here?

263
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,072
I'm gonna drop this case.
Where do you want me to put it?

264
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,829
That depends. What do ya want?

265
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,590
Well, I heard you might need a new...

266
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:29,669
That there might be a job opening.

267
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:33,386
Put it right there.
Let me take a look at ya.

268
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:37,114
Let me guess.

269
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:40,075
Piedmont, North Dakota.

270
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,752
- South Amboy, New Jersey.
- Same thing. You do any drugs?

271
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,347
Just coffee.
That's all I can afford right now.

272
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,627
- Let me see your arms.
- Are you kidding?

273
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:56,277
Do I look like I'm kidding?

274
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,627
Where'd you get that scar on your wrist?

275
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:03,107
Pizza oven. It's a permanent burn
from pulling slices for four years.

276
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:06,314
That could be the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

277
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:10,436
- What's next? You want a urine sample?
- I prefer blood.

278
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:13,668
Look, are you really the owner?
'Cause I've had a rough couple of days,

279
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:19,707
and so the last thing I need is some
waitress on a power trip wastin' my time.

280
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:34,067
You start Friday night. Be there at 11.
That's when we get busy.

281
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:40,031
- You're givin' me a job?
- I'm givin' you an audition.

282
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,507
- Don't be late, Jersey girl.
- I don't mean to press my luck,

283
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:46,191
but would you mind telling me
why you're hiring me?

284
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,190
Because the average male

285
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,666
is walking around with a toddler
inside of his pants.

286
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:55,954
A two-year-old
right there inside his Dockers.

287
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:59,871
Men have two-year-old children in
their pants? That's why you're hiring me?

288
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:03,950
You look like a kindergarten teacher.
The kids'll love it.

289
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,349
Sorry I asked.

290
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,706
- I.D., please.
- I'm supposed to start work here tonight.

291
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:18,106
Go ahead.
You picked a good night to start.

292
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:19,949
It's a little slow right now,
but it should pick up.

293
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,311
OK.

294
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:45,389
Is this a church meeting
or is this a bar? Make some noise.

295
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,072
Yeah.

296
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,309
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- I don't think so.

297
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:24,195
Just in time. Where you goin'?

298
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:28,750
- I was looking for you.
- Good. Let's go.

299
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:47,709
- Really love your top.
- Thanks.

300
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,867
I got it on sale down...

301
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:59,151
OK. Hair.

302
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,032
Let's see your moves.

303
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,955
That's Rachel.
You can learn a lot from her.

304
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,834
She just cut some guy's ponytail off.

305
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,590
Yeah. The court ordered her
to take anger management classes

306
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:13,668
after she pummelled a customer
for grabbin' her ass.

307
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:18,514
He pressed charges,
I gave her a raise. Cheers.

308
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,512
There is only two rules, OK?
What do you want?

309
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:32,428
Two beers.

310
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,189
- Don't date the customers.
- OK.

311
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:37,826
Second, don't ever bring your boyfriends
into my bar.

312
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:41,592
As of this moment you are to appear
available, but never be available.

313
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:45,113
Break my rules,
I fire you on the spot.

314
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,075
- I understand.
- Jesus.

315
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,308
Everybody.

316
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:54,308
Shut up.

317
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:59,429
I'd like you to meet my new girl,
whose name is...

318
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,508
Violet.

319
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:04,914
...Jersey.

320
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:09,027
Jersey is an ex-kindergarten teacher,

321
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:12,746
and a former nun who just escaped
from the convent,

322
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:15,715
and is tired of being the only virgin
in New York City.

323
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:21,712
Would anyone like
to buy her a drink?

324
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,875
- Come on, move. I'm workin' here.
- Sorry.

325
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:35,154
- Four Margaritas with salt.
- All right.

326
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,426
Got tequila.
No mix, no salt, no blender.

327
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:42,271
- OK, how about a Black Russian?
- Got vodka, no Kahlúa.

328
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,632
- White wine.
- Never carry the stuff.

329
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:47,436
- So basically you have...
- Jim, Jack, Johnny Red,

330
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,586
Johnny Black and José.

331
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,993
All my favourite men.
You can have it any way you like,

332
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:54,068
as long as it's in a shot glass.

333
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:56,352
OK, I'll take a beer.

334
00:25:56,437 --> 00:26:00,953
- Four dollars.
- I'm Cammie, the Russian tease.

335
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:03,426
Violet, the Jersey nun.

336
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:05,712
That one's Rachel,
the New York bitch.

337
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,585
We all play our little parts,
only Rachel really is a bitch.

338
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:11,787
And I really am a tease.

339
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:14,266
Cammie, you can only be a tease
if you stop sleepin' around, babe.

340
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,712
Yeah. I keep forgetting that part.

341
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:08,107
I'll have a shot of tequila, and don't
forget one for your pretty little self.

342
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:10,995
Thanks, but ever since
I got really drunk on tequila,

343
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:12,192
I never drink the stuff any more.

344
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:15,713
Lil, your new girl's
refusing your good booze.

345
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:18,789
No. I was suggesting
this gentleman buy me a double.

346
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:21,675
That's more like it.

347
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,835
I need eight shots.
Four Canadian, four South of the Border,

348
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:32,273
a six-pack of MGD,
and a double-blended back.

349
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,588
- You want eight shots of what?
- I got it.

350
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:38,635
Forty-six even, honey.

351
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:39,945
- Lil.
- Yo.

352
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:42,915
Your Jersey girl can't quite keep up.

353
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,465
Gimme a Scotch and water.

354
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:49,630
- OK, you got it.
- Lil, do we serve water with our whiskey?

355
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:52,185
Only water I serve's
got barley and hops in it.

356
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:55,952
Everybody.
Do we serve water in this bar?

357
00:27:56,037 --> 00:28:00,827
Hell, no H2O! Hell, no H2O!

358
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,996
Sink or swim time, Jersey.
Get up there.

359
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:23,833
I can't do that dance.

360
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,232
OK.

361
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,592
Here's some cash.
You did OK for a nun.

362
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,352
- You're firing me?
- I told you this was an audition.

363
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:46,905
Thanks for comin' in.
Now, get outta here.

364
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,393
No. Please.

365
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:03,146
Back off.

366
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:05,148
Guys. Guys, back off.

367
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:07,148
Look, the way I see it,
you got two choices.

368
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:09,745
You can start a fight here,
throw some punches, get a bloody nose,

369
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:14,228
make complete fools of yourselves, or you
can take this ten bucks I got right here

370
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:17,389
and buy these two pretty ladies
a round at the bar.

371
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:21,152
- Come on. What do you say?
- Let's go to the bar. Party.

372
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:27,066
Hold it, Jersey. I'm just dyin' to know
where that came from.

373
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:29,148
Try serving beer and pizza
on Monday nights

374
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:31,387
when the Giants play the Cowboys
in November.

375
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:33,308
I'm giving you a second audition.

376
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:37,709
There's a store at the corner of 6th and Hill.
Be there at noon tomorrow.

377
00:29:37,797 --> 00:29:40,630
I'm sending my fashion coordinator there
to take you shopping.

378
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,833
Now go home
before I change my mind.

379
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:47,155
And Jersey. I'd be shocked
if you survive another night.

380
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:10,746
Yeah.

381
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:15,107
- Hey, honey. How are you?
- All right. I miss you.

382
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:18,109
- I miss you too.
- What are you eating?

383
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:23,555
One of those Lean Cuisine meals.
Rice and vegetables. Delicious.

384
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:27,789
- See, they're good. Right?
- Yum.

385
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:34,907
So, tell me more about this bar.
What kind of place is it?

386
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:39,513
I don't know. It's just a bar, Dad.
Hold on a second.

387
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:53,073
- Hi.
- What's going on with your song-writing?

388
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:56,069
Song-writing.
He still has my tape.

389
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:07,351
I want my tape.

390
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,632
I had a feeling you'd be back to see me.

391
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:12,914
- No dates in the kitchen, O'Donnell.
- I'm not staying.

392
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,352
I just want my tape.

393
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:17,871
Please.

394
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:22,675
- Thanks. Bye.
- Did you really write all those songs?

395
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,350
You listened to my tape?

396
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:31,749
No, of course not. I mean,
that would be invasion of privacy.

397
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:35,585
Go ahead. Laugh it up.

398
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:37,952
'Cause there's nothing you can say
that's gonna bother me.

399
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:40,107
I'm just trying to tell you
I like your music.

400
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:43,394
I mean, do you always
take compliments so well?

401
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:47,871
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

402
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:50,790
I wanna see you again.
Where are you workin'?

403
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:56,026
- I'm a Coyote.
- Good. And what the hell is that?

404
00:31:56,117 --> 00:32:00,269
If you wanna see me again,
you'll figure it out.

405
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:04,396
Was that good?

406
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:10,509
Sorry I'm late.
Al and I had a big fight.

407
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,872
And then we made up.

408
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:15,187
Twice.

409
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:17,666
You're the fashion coordinator?

410
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:21,636
Lil told me to get you something
that would make the kiddies drool.

411
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:23,947
Trust me, Violet.

412
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:27,154
I have a serious shopping problem.

413
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:34,786
No. Forget it, honey.
That's a church dress.

414
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:38,950
Nobody wears leather in church.
You sure we're going in the right direction?

415
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:42,154
Try this one. It's very tasteful.

416
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:44,990
- It has a zipper in the crotch.
- Yeah.

417
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:50,194
- Who would wear that in public?
- Actually, I have it in blue.

418
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:05,792
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

419
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,748
Here I am.

420
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,993
Yeah, baby.

421
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:44,587
Come on. Knock it off.

422
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,267
Lil. The ice.

423
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,956
How do you like that, huh?

424
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,945
I don't know how you guys do it.
I can't have another drink.

425
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:05,029
Next time that guy buys you a shot...
That's on me, honey.

426
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,233
...chase it with a beer.

427
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:12,671
- I don't get it.
- I don't swallow it.

428
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:15,874
I just spit the shot back into the beer bottle.
They'll never know.

429
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,549
You try it.

430
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,837
Just keep an eye on your spittoon bottle.

431
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:25,388
Once Rachel served hers to Lou
by accident. Huge drama.

432
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:28,196
Cammie, I think I just fell
in love with you.

433
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:30,916
Violet. I'm not a lesbian.

434
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:33,716
I've played in the minors,
but never went pro.

435
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:37,152
- That's not what I meant.
- What are you doing?

436
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:41,270
Lil's starin' straight at you. Come on.
Grab this guy. Make yourself look busy.

437
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:45,270
- Hi. You look like you could use a shot.
- No, I'm waiting on Lil.

438
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:48,986
Sorry. It's a no-parking zone. If you
wanna sit here, you gotta order a drink.

439
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,955
- OK. Gimme a glass of water.
- OK.

440
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,067
- He just ordered water?
- Yeah.

441
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:57,671
You know what to do.

442
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:04,989
Testing.
Everybody, this guy just ordered water.

443
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:07,591
Do we serve water in our bar?

444
00:36:07,677 --> 00:36:10,510
Hell, no H2O. Hell, no H2O.

445
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:15,869
Jersey. No.

446
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,312
It's OK, Lil.
Nobody orders water in your bar.

447
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:22,185
He can order whatever he wants.
He's the fire marshal.

448
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,388
Mike, I'm so sorry.
She's new.

449
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:29,186
I'm OK.
Let's step outside.

450
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:33,947
Nice knowin' you, Jersey.

451
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:36,756
Come on, you guys. Let me hear you.

452
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,433
You OK?

453
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:44,748
- Who am I kidding? I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

454
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:49,274
Now cheer up, because there's
a really cute guy at the bar asking for you.

455
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,234
Somebody's asking for me?

456
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:53,877
He says his name is Mr O'Donnell.

457
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,793
He's hot.

458
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:05,032
You all right, mate?

459
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:09,148
Jersey. The fire marshal
threatened to shut me down.

460
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:12,354
- He let me go with a $ 250 fine.
- Lil, I'm really sorry...

461
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:15,634
I'll make you a deal. You figure out
a way to make me 250 tonight,

462
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,992
I'll let you come back tomorrow.

463
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:20,436
Great.

464
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:25,311
- So much for sweet and innocent.
- So, you found me.

465
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:28,787
Some guys at work told me
where I could look for Coyotes.

466
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,232
Well, take a good look,
because tonight's my last night.

467
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,467
- I think I'm gonna get fired.
- Why?

468
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:38,585
'Cause I have to make $ 250 in two hours.
It's completely impossible.

469
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,551
Here's nine dollars,
just to get you started, OK?

470
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,350
I always like to help a friend in need.

471
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:50,992
Why are you looking at me like that?

472
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:54,152
Kevin, I don't want your money.

473
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:58,749
All right, listen up.

474
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:02,432
Ladies, the bidding will start at $ 25.

475
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,348
For one night only,

476
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:10,467
you get this purebred, housebroken,
fully trained, young stud.

477
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:14,475
- No way.
- That's pretty cheap.

478
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:18,075
- Violet, what are you doing?
- You said you wanted to help, so...

479
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:21,786
Turn around, sir.
Let 'em take a look at ya.

480
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:27,192
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's payback time, Mr O'Donnell.

481
00:38:27,277 --> 00:38:29,029
Now, turn around.

482
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:32,511
No. God, no. Don't do this.

483
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:35,430
Go on. Show 'em what you've got.

484
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:37,792
- Do you wanna do this?
- All right, ladies. What'll you give me?

485
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:40,437
I've got 20 bucks.

486
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:44,036
I've got $ 25 right here.

487
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:45,789
Make it 35.

488
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,353
Thirty-five dollars.

489
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:53,470
- Forty dollars.
- Get... What are you doing?

490
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:56,833
- Come on, girls. Fifty?
- Fifty.

491
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,715
- Sixty-one dollars.
- I've got 70.

492
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:02,027
- Come on, girls. Seventy-five?
- Seventy-five dollars.

493
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:04,631
- Eighty.
- Eighty dollars.

494
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:09,666
- Come on, girls. Do I hear 85?
- Ninety. Ninety-five dollars.

495
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,952
One hundred dollars.

496
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:17,552
- That's it.
- You wanna come home with Mama?

497
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:24,430
Yeah. That's my boy.

498
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,990
- Yeah. Shake it, shake it.
- $125 back here.

499
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:33,195
$140, right here.
Come on, come on.

500
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,836
My goodness, girls, come on.
One-fifty and you'll see the butt.

501
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,385
Come on, girls.
You can do better than this.

502
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,627
One-seventy-five.

503
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,752
Yeah.

504
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:50,432
There we go.
Two hundred dollars.

505
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:57,312
- You've got 250 right here.
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

506
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,786
Sold, for $ 250.

507
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,633
- No.
- Come on up, honey. He's yours.

508
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,827
Damn you.

509
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:14,316
The blonde would have gone to 275.

510
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,635
Come with me.

511
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:21,995
You're gonna owe me big-time for this one.
That's 250 even.

512
00:40:41,557 --> 00:40:43,309
We're closin' up, girls.

513
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:45,627
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

514
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:49,153
What does "Coyote Ugly" mean?

515
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:53,987
Did you ever wake up sober
after a one-night stand,

516
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,989
and the person you're next to is layin'
on your arm, and they're so ugly,

517
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:59,671
you'd rather chew off
your arm than risk wakin' 'em?

518
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,952
- That's coyote ugly.
- Let's go, ladies.

519
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:04,312
But why would you name
your bar after something like that?

520
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:07,235
Because "Cheers" was taken.

521
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:09,630
Cabs are out front.

522
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:11,509
- You're rich, Jersey.
- Yeah.

523
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,155
Good night.

524
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:16,836
The woman who purchased me
is named Sandy Rosenfeld,

525
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:19,067
a divorcée with three grown kids,

526
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:22,433
a passion for long walks and short-haired
hunting dogs and Italian opera.

527
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:26,795
Her ex-husband is a C.P.A.
Her favourite artist is Van Gogh,

528
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:31,871
and her New Year's resolution is to lose
15 pounds, and to see Barbra in concert.

529
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,868
OK. I owe you.

530
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:37,070
What do you want?

531
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:40,388
Well, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I want what every man wants.

532
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:43,952
Breakfast.

533
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:46,986
And that's it? I go to breakfast
with you, and we're even?

534
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:49,989
No. We're not even close to even,
because I danced on a bar,

535
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:52,989
I took off my shirt,
and I unzipped my pants.

536
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,070
OK. Let's make a deal.
Breakfast and lunch.

537
00:41:57,157 --> 00:42:00,627
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That's four dates.

538
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:03,709
Yep. Which would make it the second
longest relationship I've ever had.

539
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:06,027
Get in the car.

540
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:11,156
I hate to spoil your evening, but
it looks like we're not gonna go anywhere.

541
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,636
Oh, my God.

542
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:20,188
It's hard to find parking in New York.

543
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:22,992
You ever eaten Turkish?
This is the place.

544
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,955
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, Kevin.

545
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:28,426
- Four of the regular?
- Sure, yeah.

546
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:32,032
- How you doin'?
- How are you?

547
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,711
Here it is, man.
Flown in from Miami.

548
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:37,311
- Check out the merchandise.
- Hey, man, no. I trust you.

549
00:42:37,397 --> 00:42:39,228
All right, all right.

550
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:47,188
Look, I don't know what you're into, but...

551
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:51,236
<i>The Amazing Spider-Man.</i>
Number 129, mint condition.

552
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:53,353
- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.

553
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,986
No, it's not just a comic book. This is
the first appearance of the Punisher.

554
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,307
This is the Holy Grail
of comic books.

555
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:02,150
You collect comic books. That's so cute.

556
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:06,230
It's not cute.
It's very rugged and manly.

557
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,356
- It's just a bit geeky. Huh?
- I think it's sweet.

558
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,836
So, do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car?

559
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:19,385
What can I say? I'm a romantic.

560
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,468
You think this is romantic?

561
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,913
Well, you may not be feeling it now,
but I think one day

562
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:28,626
you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.

563
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:31,550
"When We Were Downwind
From a Trash Barge."

564
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:34,674
Yeah. Catchy title. Hum a few bars.

565
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:39,186
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm a song-writer, not a singer.

566
00:43:39,277 --> 00:43:41,791
When I get on stage, I freeze.

567
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:45,313
What if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice?

568
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:50,755
OK. If the fate of the free world
depended on me singing, maybe.

569
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,351
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark

570
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:57,112
and hear someone great
singing my songs.

571
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,153
I wanna be the one
who writes the music.

572
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:04,629
I remember the first time my mother
played me "Bridge Over Troubled Water",

573
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:07,106
by Simon and Garfunkel.

574
00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:10,425
I remember exactly what she was wearing,

575
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:15,750
I remember exactly how her hair smelled,
and I remember exactly how I felt.

576
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,353
And every time I hear that song,

577
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:21,877
I remember exactly
what she was wearing,

578
00:44:21,957 --> 00:44:24,391
and exactly how her hair smelled,

579
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,593
and exactly how I felt.

580
00:44:27,557 --> 00:44:30,355
'Cause the great songs last forever.

581
00:44:31,197 --> 00:44:34,394
- So what's the problem?
- Well...

582
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:36,991
now they're telling me
the only way to get my songs heard

583
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,466
is to go out there
and sing 'em myself.

584
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:42,310
So we're gonna have to try and fix
this little problem straight away.

585
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:44,194
And how do you propose we do that?

586
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:47,952
Well, is there any place
you feel comfortable singing?

587
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:50,756
- The shower.
- We'll start there.

588
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:54,352
I don't care how long it takes, how many
hours we have to spend in that shower.

589
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:57,634
- Let's get to it.
- OK. Before we hit the showers,

590
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:00,106
maybe you could tell me
a little something about yourself.

591
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,506
Really?
What do you wanna know?

592
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,553
What part of Australia are you from?

593
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:07,390
I'm from all over.
My family moved around a lot.

594
00:45:07,477 --> 00:45:09,149
So the rest of your family
doesn't live in New York?

595
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:11,148
Do you always ask
this many questions?

596
00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:13,546
Do you always dodge
this many questions?

597
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:15,992
You could at least tell me where you got
all the moves you pulled on the bar tonight.

598
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:18,671
Well, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

599
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:23,312
That's original.

600
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,672
The sun's coming up.
We're gonna be late.

601
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,793
Late? Late for what?

602
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:33,314
This is incredible.

603
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,752
- Look at that fish.
- All right. Put this on.

604
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:38,988
- You're gonna need it.
- Why? What are you talking about?

605
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:41,671
You're gonna help me
unload the next bin.

606
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:44,032
- You're joking, right?
- No. It's not that bad, Vi.

607
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,587
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?

608
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:50,032
Tuesday through Saturday,
I'm at the club.

609
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,836
Sunday and Monday,
I park cars at the Plaza.

610
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,875
I've been a telemarketer.
"Would you like to switch to AT&T?"

611
00:45:55,957 --> 00:46:00,747
And for six terrifying hours
I delivered phone books in Queens.

612
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:03,067
Don't forget your extensive work in fish.

613
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:05,148
This is an expensive city,
and these guys pay cash.

614
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:08,832
I don't care if they pay in lobster.
I'm not sticking my hands in that fishy bin.

615
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,226
I was gonna split the money with you.

616
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:13,547
- A hundred bucks apiece.
- A hundred bucks?

617
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,674
- Wait, wait. Why didn't you say so?
- Thanks, Dan.

618
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,110
- You're not ready, are you? Fifty bucks.
- Wait. No.

619
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:19,516
- Twenty-five, ten.
- OK. OK.

620
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:21,474
Ready?

621
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:23,593
That's disgusting.

622
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:27,955
You'll hurt their feelings.
OK. Just on top of the other fish.

623
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,428
So, I know I just met you a few days ago,

624
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:37,350
but there's something I have to tell you.

625
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:40,110
You smell really bad.

626
00:46:41,277 --> 00:46:43,666
Well, so do you. I mean,
I was gonna kiss you goodbye,

627
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:48,035
- but I thought I might gag.
- You're a real charmer.

628
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:52,913
OK. Good night.

629
00:46:53,637 --> 00:46:55,787
Good morning.

630
00:47:12,717 --> 00:47:15,311
Don't look at me like that.

631
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,867
Spend it.

632
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:32,073
- What are you doing here?
- I changed my mind about this kiss.

633
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:35,317
I think we should give it a shot.

634
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,313
Well...

635
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:46,831
Have a nice day.

636
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:50,752
"Have a nice day"?

637
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:54,466
Yeah. I panicked.
I didn't know what else to say.

638
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:59,627
Have a nice day.

639
00:48:02,957 --> 00:48:06,745
- I wanna get in, I wanna get in.
- All right. Back of the line over here.

640
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:08,909
Yeah.

641
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,435
Come on.

642
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:33,395
- Yeah, I like it.
- Yeah.

643
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,911
- Hey, baby.
- Make a hole. Make a hole.

644
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,431
- Lou. Nobody else gets in here.
- Shit, the cops are here.

645
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:40,747
- Look at this place.
- Wait a minute.

646
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:43,715
I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do.
You're 50 people over max.

647
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,152
If you try to shut us down,
they'll tear the place apart.

648
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:49,229
Let's go outside and talk.
I'll take care of it.

649
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:55,986
This is not a gas pump, son.

650
00:48:56,077 --> 00:48:58,193
Wait your turn.

651
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:05,074
- No pictures, man.
- I'm a reporter from <i>The Voice.</i>

652
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:12,556
What are you doing?
Put me down.

653
00:49:12,637 --> 00:49:13,865
- Put me down.
- Cammie.

654
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:16,187
- Help.
- Come on. Let her go.

655
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:18,268
Rachel. Help.

656
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:21,190
Sailor boy. Come on. Break it up.

657
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:26,187
- Lou, where's Rachel and Cammie?
- I don't know.

658
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:31,595
Let me go.

659
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:49,747
Jersey. They're tearing this place apart.

660
00:49:56,317 --> 00:49:57,875
Rachel. Rachel.

661
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:46,513
I'm talking about that.

662
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:03,069
- Great. Yeah.
- Last call, Lil.

663
00:51:03,157 --> 00:51:06,115
- Start clearin' 'em out.
- You got it.

664
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,916
Let's go.

665
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:33,907
Did you see their faces?
I mean, wow.

666
00:51:33,997 --> 00:51:37,148
They all wanted you, honey.
Even the girls.

667
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:39,512
Not a dry seat in the house.

668
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,909
You guys, that was, like,
a one-time performance,

669
00:51:43,997 --> 00:51:46,955
that I have to repeat, like, every night.

670
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:51,546
She sang along with a jukebox.
Let's not start polishing a Grammy.

671
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:54,913
Come on, Rach.
She saved your butt. Admit it.

672
00:51:54,997 --> 00:51:58,751
No. She saved me from kicking the shit
out of a couple of drunks.

673
00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:00,236
That's it.

674
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,228
Dunk 'em good.

675
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,556
- Where you goin'?
- I don't know.

676
00:52:04,637 --> 00:52:10,030
I gotta walk or celebrate
or pass out or something.

677
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:13,149
Ladies and gent.

678
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:17,594
How about a big round of applause
for the singing Coyote from Jersey?

679
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,396
- So I'm a Coyote?
- Five nights a week.

680
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:36,667
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Why would anything be wrong?

681
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:40,955
You called me in the middle of the night
and said there was an emergency.

682
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:43,791
What was that for?

683
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:47,472
I had a good night.
I wanted a good-night kiss.

684
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:50,151
Well, wait a second.
Where are you going?

685
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:53,035
Have a nice day, Mr O'Donnell.

686
00:52:53,117 --> 00:52:55,187
"Have a nice day"?

687
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,672
What's going on?
Why do I need my guitar?

688
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:07,988
You'll find out soon enough.
No. This way.

689
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:10,637
OK, now there's a seat.

690
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:14,507
Just there.

691
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:15,347
OK?

692
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:17,388
Take a look.

693
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,393
Your fans wanna hear you sing.

694
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:25,469
I told you. I can't sing my own songs.
I never could.

695
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:29,948
Well, that's too bad, because
they've requested to hear your songs.

696
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:34,155
Be gentle on the keyboard.
I borrowed it from the club.

697
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:37,153
You did all this
just to help me sing?

698
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:40,991
I thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright I've heard so much about.

699
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,830
Kevin, I wish you could.

700
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:46,351
Come on. Let me try.

701
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:48,667
Tell me what it feels like.

702
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:55,073
You really wanna know?

703
00:54:56,037 --> 00:54:57,709
Yeah.

704
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,708
You asked for it.

705
00:55:02,477 --> 00:55:04,991
What are you doing?

706
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:07,511
The only way I can show you...

707
00:55:11,197 --> 00:55:13,153
is to make you...

708
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:15,751
really nervous.

709
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:22,306
The first thing that happens...

710
00:55:22,397 --> 00:55:25,867
is my heart starts to race.

711
00:55:31,637 --> 00:55:32,831
Good.

712
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,750
Racing heart. Yep.

713
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:37,987
- Got it.
- And then...

714
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:41,554
my entire body starts shaking.

715
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:48,831
Shaking body.
I'm getting that. Yeah.

716
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:50,714
And...

717
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:53,988
then everything gets...

718
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:57,468
a bit...

719
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,115
cloudy.

720
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:04,436
Clouds are definitely rolling in.

721
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,669
Then I start...

722
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:11,793
Iosing control.

723
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:15,476
Well, how long does this usually last?

724
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:18,393
It's been known to last all night.

725
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,752
- That must be horrible.
- It's excruciating.

726
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:42,354
I think that audience
got more than they paid for, really.

727
00:58:45,557 --> 00:58:47,787
What's "LMS" stand for?

728
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:50,152
Lynn Marie Sanford.

729
00:58:50,237 --> 00:58:52,910
It was my mom's guitar.

730
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:55,557
She died five years ago.

731
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:57,673
She moved to New York to be
a singer when she was my age.

732
00:58:57,757 --> 00:59:00,146
She came pretty close
to the big time.

733
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,228
What happened?

734
00:59:03,197 --> 00:59:07,987
She hated the stage. She said
it was the scariest place in the world.

735
00:59:08,957 --> 00:59:11,710
Sounds familiar.

736
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:17,070
You really want me to sing?

737
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,512
Just tell me what I have to do.

738
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:28,915
Disappear.

739
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:32,632
All right. No problem.

740
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:45,670
If you wanna write songs, if you wanna be,
like, a serious song-writer,

741
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:47,554
you've simply gotta go with the Mac.

742
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:50,913
Laptop. You can lay your tracks down
on a blank CD, and you're done.

743
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:52,828
Do you have a payment plan?

744
01:01:26,837 --> 01:01:27,952
Rachel.

745
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:30,032
Rachel.

746
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:42,871
Good work.
What a babe there. What a babe.

747
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:44,948
All right, that's two now, guys. Two.

748
01:01:45,037 --> 01:01:46,311
Come on, Cammie.

749
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:49,991
- Come on, Cammie.
- Go, Cammie.

750
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:52,193
- Come on, Cammie.
- Lil.

751
01:01:52,277 --> 01:01:54,347
- Yeah?
- I tell you what.

752
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:58,032
You're two out, bases loaded.
How about we double the bet?

753
01:01:58,117 --> 01:02:00,995
Forget it, Earl.
Cammie's my worst hitter.

754
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:03,955
I know that. Why don't we triple it?

755
01:02:05,717 --> 01:02:07,309
- All right.
- All right?

756
01:02:07,397 --> 01:02:09,547
All right.

757
01:02:09,637 --> 01:02:11,628
Let's go, toots.

758
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,428
Cammie.

759
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,348
- Yeah?
- Sure is a beautiful day out here.

760
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:19,827
Be a shame to waste it, don't you think?

761
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:20,906
Sure is.

762
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:07,265
Yeah, Cammie.

763
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:19,634
Get the ball over the plate, Earl.

764
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:23,874
OK, boys. Show me those balls.

765
01:03:24,877 --> 01:03:27,107
Five, and there's your six hundred dollars.

766
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:30,587
Yes, sir. Thanks, Earl. We'll be sure
to put you on the schedule for next year.

767
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:33,555
- Yeah, you do that.
- Yeah, Coyotes.

768
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,868
What are you doing?

769
01:03:47,677 --> 01:03:49,156
What are you, brain-damaged?

770
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:51,193
You know what kind of maniacs
we got driving through here?

771
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:52,869
They don't stop for nothin'.

772
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:55,551
- Whose boat?
- I borrowed it from a friend.

773
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:59,107
- Yeah? Looks like a guy's car to me.
- How can you tell?

774
01:03:59,197 --> 01:04:02,906
I've been staring at cars
every day for the last 16 years.

775
01:04:02,997 --> 01:04:04,953
- Who is he?
- He's a friend.

776
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,432
Look, I brought you a turkey sandwich,
no mayo, extra sprouts.

777
01:04:07,517 --> 01:04:09,872
Thank you. Great.

778
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:13,434
I'm starvin'.
Now, tell me about this bar.

779
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,872
Is it a bunch of bankers
havin' martinis after work?

780
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:18,107
I gotta go.
Look, I love you.

781
01:04:18,197 --> 01:04:20,506
I love you too. Be careful.

782
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:23,714
Do I come to your office and honk?
Come on.

783
01:04:27,437 --> 01:04:28,711
I got you a gig.

784
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:32,710
There's this club where a lot of music
people hang out called the Elbow Room.

785
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:37,791
My friend's the manager. He owes me a
favour, and you're it, next Thursday night.

786
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:40,345
Are you forgetting
about the stage fright?

787
01:04:40,437 --> 01:04:42,189
What about the bar?

788
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:45,155
Come on, Kevin. All I do
is sing along with the jukebox.

789
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:47,831
See? You're making progress.
A few more nights at my place,

790
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,306
and you'll be cured.

791
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:54,948
I hate to burst your bubble,
but I'll never be cured. It's genetic.

792
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:58,632
Stage fright DNA.
Yes, I saw that on <i>E.R.</i> last week.

793
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:02,426
OK. Laugh all you want, but my mom
couldn't do it, and neither can I.

794
01:05:02,517 --> 01:05:04,985
So was your mother afraid to try?

795
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:08,513
Look, I just wanna be a song-writer.
Why won't you give up on this?

796
01:05:08,597 --> 01:05:11,828
Because I've been giving up on people
my entire life, and it's a nasty little habit.

797
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:14,636
So, you're gonna sing
at the club, or I'II...

798
01:05:14,717 --> 01:05:17,151
Or you'll what?

799
01:05:17,237 --> 01:05:19,705
I'll never kiss you again.

800
01:05:19,797 --> 01:05:21,992
That sounds like a threat,
Mr O'Donnell.

801
01:05:22,077 --> 01:05:27,231
Well, let's just say
it's gonna be quite a long, cold winter.

802
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,232
- That's supposed to convince me?
- It's working, isn't it?

803
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:32,831
Your knees are getting weak.

804
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:36,512
- I'll think about it.
- Try again.

805
01:05:36,597 --> 01:05:40,067
- I'll see if I can get off work.
- You're gettin' warmer.

806
01:05:40,157 --> 01:05:42,671
All right. You win.

807
01:05:42,757 --> 01:05:45,430
- I'll do it.
- I love winning.

808
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:56,111
We have a special treat for you tonight,
boys and girls.

809
01:05:56,197 --> 01:05:58,791
Look who dropped by for a visit.

810
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:01,913
- Zoe.
- No.

811
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:05,307
I'm a paying customer tonight. I have
class in the morning. What are you doing?

812
01:06:05,397 --> 01:06:08,355
- Come on, Zoe.
- No.

813
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:12,191
Zoe. Zoe. Zoe. Zoe. Zoe.

814
01:06:16,077 --> 01:06:18,033
Time to get wet, girls.

815
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:08,072
Excuse me,
does Violet Sanford work here?

816
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,795
- She's on the bar.
- She's on what?

817
01:07:09,877 --> 01:07:12,835
- She's on the bar.
- What do you guys say?

818
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:14,191
Yeah.

819
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,555
Dad.

820
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:35,229
Wait.

821
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,706
Dad. It's not as bad as it looks.

822
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:42,590
Dad. It's not as bad as it looks.
I just sing here every night.

823
01:07:42,677 --> 01:07:45,794
People come here to see me.
Say something.

824
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:49,153
The guys are putting your picture up
in their booths.

825
01:07:49,237 --> 01:07:53,196
- I gotta go, get up early.
- Dad, it's just a bar.

826
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,394
- You can trust me.
- But you're my daughter.

827
01:08:22,877 --> 01:08:25,107
Hi, you've reached Bill Sanford.

828
01:08:25,197 --> 01:08:28,428
Please leave a message
when you hear the beep.

829
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,275
Dad, you can't avoid me
for the rest of your life.

830
01:08:32,357 --> 01:08:34,268
I have to come over and do your laundry.

831
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:36,825
We both know
you're running out of clean shirts.

832
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:40,830
I bet the one you're wearing
stinks pretty bad.

833
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:45,308
I'm not gonna apologise, because that
would mean I'm doing something wrong.

834
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:47,308
And I'm not sure I am, so...

835
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:52,788
I'm playing at a club tonight. A real club.
Someone important could hear my song,

836
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,994
and next month somebody
might be singing it on the radio.

837
01:08:56,077 --> 01:08:58,352
- So wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

838
01:08:59,277 --> 01:09:02,986
Anyway, I'll call you
and tell you how it goes.

839
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:06,312
Take care of yourself, old man.

840
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:10,747
"Old man."

841
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:15,029
All right. You should be dancing
on the floor. I wanna see your bras.

842
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:30,030
I'm in heaven. I'm in heaven.

843
01:09:45,397 --> 01:09:48,275
- Do you think this muff's been waxed?
- I hope so.

844
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:01,991
Is this the greatest party
we've ever been to or what, man?

845
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:05,311
Lil, I can only stay two hours.

846
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:08,673
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta leave early tonight, remember?

847
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:10,827
Bourbon.

848
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:14,148
Maybe you haven't noticed all the bodies
you had to crawl over to get in here tonight.

849
01:10:14,237 --> 01:10:16,956
Lil, I told you I gotta leave
by 10:30 no matter what.

850
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:19,631
- Here.
- I got it. I got it.

851
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:21,150
Seven.

852
01:10:29,877 --> 01:10:32,869
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

853
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:35,232
I gotta go. It's half past.
Can you have Lou call me a cab?

854
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:37,751
Listen, Jersey. You're not
going anywhere. Not tonight.

855
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:39,156
This place is out of control.

856
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:41,193
But, Lil, I told you.
I'm only working two hours...

857
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:43,586
You wanna sing? Sing for them.

858
01:10:43,677 --> 01:10:46,589
These people dragged
their asses out here to see us.

859
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:50,306
This is New York, and there's a line
halfway around the block.

860
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:53,673
That's something, Jersey,
whether you believe it or not.

861
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:55,550
And if I go?

862
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:59,471
If you were goin',
you would have left by now.

863
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:04,830
- Where are you?
- Lil won't let me go.

864
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:07,226
Violet, just walk out.
She doesn't own you.

865
01:11:07,317 --> 01:11:08,591
You can still make it here.

866
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:10,713
I'm sorry.

867
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:14,510
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

868
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:16,189
Violet...

869
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:21,708
- What's the story?
- She's not coming.

870
01:11:21,797 --> 01:11:24,357
So what am I supposed to do, Kevin?
I got a whole spot to fill.

871
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:27,395
I'm sorry, Richie.
I made a mistake.

872
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:30,275
This doesn't change
anything with us, Kevin.

873
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:33,030
A deal's a deal. Am I right?

874
01:12:10,677 --> 01:12:13,032
I'm the guy. Me.

875
01:12:17,397 --> 01:12:20,434
Zach, who said
you could be up here?

876
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:26,755
You're not supposed to be up here.

877
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:29,476
All right.
Take it easy, Zach.

878
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,115
Zach, take it easy.

879
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:38,276
- Knock it off.
- Kevin.

880
01:12:38,357 --> 01:12:39,790
Lil.

881
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:45,876
- Break it up.
- Kevin, that's enough.

882
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:48,989
Lou.

883
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:55,389
Kevin, that's enough.

884
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:58,310
- Kevin, that's enough.
- Get off me.

885
01:12:58,397 --> 01:13:00,706
Kevin, Zach's a regular,
and he was just having fun.

886
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,265
- Having fun with my girlfriend.
- Lou, get him out of here.

887
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:05,996
You're gonna chill outside,
or I'm calling the cops.

888
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:09,387
- Out of my way. Move.
- Let me go.

889
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:12,227
Get the hell outta here.

890
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:14,308
Everybody, free drinks on the house.

891
01:13:14,397 --> 01:13:16,672
I'm paying. Get up here.

892
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:18,031
Kevin?

893
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:21,712
Kevin, what is your problem? Look,
I'm sorry about tonight, but look at this.

894
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,355
There was no way
Lil was gonna let me out.

895
01:13:23,437 --> 01:13:25,792
This is not about Lil.
This is about you and this place.

896
01:13:25,877 --> 01:13:28,027
- This is my job.
- It's a goddamn sandbox

897
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,232
for you to stick your head in.

898
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,831
- What is that supposed to mean?
- The place is a joke.

899
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:33,396
All right?
They don't come to watch you sing.

900
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:35,354
They come to watch girls
shaking it on a bar.

901
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:37,632
And what would you have me do?
Sing for quarters in the park?

902
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:38,991
At least you'd be singing your own songs.

903
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:42,513
I told you I can't do that,
so stop pushing.

904
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:47,717
I'm just asking you to try,
but I guess that's asking a bit too much.

905
01:13:47,797 --> 01:13:49,674
Right. It's so easy to be you,
isn't it?

906
01:13:49,757 --> 01:13:53,306
You have no dreams, no hopes,
no chance of getting hurt.

907
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:56,195
When was the last time
you took a chance on something?

908
01:13:56,277 --> 01:13:59,269
- Some of us don't have that luxury.
- Why is that?

909
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:06,834
Right. We don't talk about you, right?
It's a big secret.

910
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,956
Come on, Kevin.
Let's play a game.

911
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:12,187
I'm gonna guess why
you left Australia.

912
01:14:12,277 --> 01:14:15,713
- Doesn't matter.
- You were in jail.

913
01:14:15,797 --> 01:14:18,994
No, that's not it.
You have a wife and four kids in Sydney.

914
01:14:19,077 --> 01:14:20,988
Come on. Am I getting warm?
Come on, Kevin.

915
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,513
I don't have a lot of time.
Why'd you run away from home?

916
01:14:24,597 --> 01:14:27,714
I didn't have a home.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

917
01:14:28,437 --> 01:14:30,905
I don't have a family.

918
01:14:30,997 --> 01:14:34,307
I mean, that's the big secret.
Are you happy?

919
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,148
Are you gonna feel sorry for me now?

920
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:41,867
You gonna hold me close while I tell you
I had to change homes every two years?

921
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:44,152
I had a bad childhood. Big deal.

922
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:46,990
I don't need your sympathy,
'cause I'm here,

923
01:14:47,077 --> 01:14:48,988
and I'm living on my own two feet
like I wanted to.

924
01:14:49,077 --> 01:14:51,511
That was my dream.

925
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:54,555
And at least I did it
with a little bit of dignity.

926
01:14:56,517 --> 01:14:58,712
And I didn't. That's it?

927
01:14:58,797 --> 01:15:01,391
Well, just unbutton the blouse
a little and unzip the pants,

928
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:05,311
show a little bit of flesh -
I think you can figure it out.

929
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:12,676
Go on in. Your fans are waitin' for ya
to crawl on the bar.

930
01:15:30,837 --> 01:15:35,592
- I told you not to break the rules.
- What are you talking about?

931
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:39,228
I'm talking about you and your boyfriend
making a scene in my bar.

932
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:41,990
I'm talking about a friend of mine
inside with a broken nose.

933
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:45,956
The rules were simple, Jersey.
I've fired girls for a lot less.

934
01:15:46,037 --> 01:15:49,632
What, so I can't have a boyfriend now?
What kind of stupid shit is that?

935
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:51,230
This place is my home,

936
01:15:51,317 --> 01:15:54,150
and I'm not willing to risk
everything I have on your personal life.

937
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:55,909
It's business, plain and simple.

938
01:15:55,997 --> 01:15:58,306
This is not business.
I work my ass off for you,

939
01:15:58,397 --> 01:16:02,026
- and you're supposed to be my friend.
- I never said I was your friend.

940
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:04,153
I'm your boss, and you knew
the rules like everybody else.

941
01:16:04,237 --> 01:16:08,913
Will you stop with "the rules"?
It's a bar, for Christ's sake.

942
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,393
Then what are you so upset about?

943
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:42,955
Oh, my God. Gimme a bite. I'm starving.

944
01:17:46,717 --> 01:17:50,266
- Thank you.
- How does it feel to be Mrs Molinaro?

945
01:17:51,757 --> 01:17:57,229
You know, I think he was the perfect choice
for my first marriage.

946
01:17:59,037 --> 01:18:02,950
Hey, Gloria.
Thanks for inviting me.

947
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:05,953
I gotta go to work.
I'm on graveyard tonight.

948
01:18:06,037 --> 01:18:09,791
- Thank you, Mr Sanford.
- Yeah, well, it's not worth a hug, dear.

949
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:12,516
It's only 50 bucks.

950
01:18:12,597 --> 01:18:16,510
- Your old man's a ten, Vi.
- Eleven. Some days a twelve.

951
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:20,665
- Well, it's a beautiful wedding.
- No, you can't go.

952
01:18:20,757 --> 01:18:24,272
I just want one picture of you and Violet
dancing together. Come on.

953
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,987
OK. Come on. Smile.

954
01:18:40,197 --> 01:18:43,155
Are you really working,
or are you just leaving because of me?

955
01:18:43,237 --> 01:18:45,831
You know I don't like to wear a tie.

956
01:18:53,557 --> 01:18:56,754
So this is how it's gonna be?
You're not gonna return my phone calls?

957
01:18:56,837 --> 01:19:00,193
If you needed money,
you should have come to me.

958
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,233
I would have found a way
to take care of you.

959
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:05,309
Dad, you can't even
take care of yourself.

960
01:19:06,277 --> 01:19:08,507
I am doing just fine on my own,
thank you very much.

961
01:19:08,597 --> 01:19:12,067
Really? So how come
you're not wearing any socks?

962
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:19,396
I had a minor disagreement
with the clothes dryer.

963
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:24,790
Look, just face it, Dad.
You need me.

964
01:19:24,877 --> 01:19:28,267
And I moved out,
and that's what bothers you.

965
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:33,354
No.

966
01:19:33,437 --> 01:19:35,348
No, what bothers me...

967
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:38,831
is for the first time in my life...

968
01:19:39,797 --> 01:19:41,947
I was ashamed of you.

969
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:46,349
I would have never thought
that would have ever been possible.

970
01:19:57,717 --> 01:20:00,390
It's me.
Leave a message after the beep.

971
01:20:00,477 --> 01:20:03,674
Violet? I've just finished work,
and in a few hours

972
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:07,306
I'm going to unload
three disgusting fish trucks.

973
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:09,957
I thought maybe you'd like
to come and give me a hand.

974
01:20:10,037 --> 01:20:11,595
- But you're not in.
- OK. I'm coming. I'm coming.

975
01:20:11,677 --> 01:20:16,512
Or you're not picking up.
So, I'll call back,

976
01:20:16,597 --> 01:20:21,546
because I'm hoping
one day you will wanna talk.

977
01:20:22,757 --> 01:20:24,668
Kevin? Hello?

978
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:41,276
Kevin? Hello? It's me.

979
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,034
I'm here.

980
01:20:44,117 --> 01:20:46,756
- Is this Violet Sanford?
- Yes.

981
01:20:46,837 --> 01:20:49,032
I'm calling from
Riverview Medical Centre.

982
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:52,154
We have a patient here by the
name of William James Sanford.

983
01:20:52,237 --> 01:20:53,386
Is that your father?

984
01:20:59,797 --> 01:21:01,867
Violet Sanford?

985
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:05,427
- Yeah?
- Your dad's in recovery right now.

986
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:07,951
The car struck him on his right side
when he was walking to the booth.

987
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:09,356
His right leg is broken,

988
01:21:09,437 --> 01:21:11,473
and there was some arterial damage
we had to go in and repair.

989
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:13,991
But other than that,
it's just a lot of bumps and bruises.

990
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,272
I'd say he's a pretty lucky guy.

991
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:18,426
Violet?

992
01:21:19,637 --> 01:21:23,676
I told you, don't come down here.
It's your wedding night.

993
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:28,035
Are you kidding? Danny's been
in my family for five minutes.

994
01:21:28,997 --> 01:21:31,636
You've been in my family
my whole life.

995
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:05,396
I'm sorry.

996
01:22:08,237 --> 01:22:11,274
I love you so much.

997
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:17,391
I never did thank you for the dance.

998
01:22:19,877 --> 01:22:21,629
That's OK.

999
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,592
It's all right.

1000
01:22:48,117 --> 01:22:50,312
My tapes.

1001
01:23:00,837 --> 01:23:04,910
Come on. Just call him.
Just pick up the phone and call him.

1002
01:23:11,557 --> 01:23:13,036
Don't call him.

1003
01:23:15,637 --> 01:23:18,276
I told you, this place is a palace.

1004
01:23:18,357 --> 01:23:20,871
It's pretty late.
Are you sure you wanna do this now?

1005
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:24,666
Well, here's my door.
No turning back now. Come on in.

1006
01:23:25,637 --> 01:23:28,435
Oh, you're so right.
This place is a palace.

1007
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:33,637
- Would I lie to you?
- This is a great idea. I'm so glad...

1008
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:37,226
Nice strong pulse.

1009
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:40,354
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a sick man.

1010
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:42,826
You can eat whatever you want now,
but when we go back home,

1011
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:45,147
it's egg whites and Lean Cuisines.

1012
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:48,513
- I'll see you later, Bill.
- Wait a minute.

1013
01:23:48,597 --> 01:23:51,953
What do you mean,
"until we go home"?

1014
01:23:53,357 --> 01:23:55,587
I'm moving back.

1015
01:23:57,077 --> 01:24:01,116
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't sing my songs.

1016
01:24:01,197 --> 01:24:03,108
I was afraid.

1017
01:24:07,637 --> 01:24:09,946
Do you know why Mommy quit?

1018
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,475
Yeah, she told me.
'Cause she couldn't do it.

1019
01:24:14,557 --> 01:24:17,469
No, that's not it.

1020
01:24:18,997 --> 01:24:21,557
She wasn't afraid, Vi.

1021
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:26,749
Your mother on stage...
She was amazing.

1022
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:30,797
Then why did she quit?

1023
01:24:31,757 --> 01:24:34,317
Because of me.

1024
01:24:34,397 --> 01:24:38,231
Right after you were born,
she told me she wanted to quit,

1025
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:40,911
and I let her.

1026
01:24:43,957 --> 01:24:47,870
See, I knew how good she was,
but I never told her.

1027
01:24:50,437 --> 01:24:53,190
I loved her...

1028
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:56,148
more than anything.

1029
01:24:56,237 --> 01:25:00,435
And I just went on and pretended
that there was no other choice.

1030
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:04,275
- Dad, it's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

1031
01:25:04,357 --> 01:25:06,075
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

1032
01:25:06,157 --> 01:25:07,988
You're not goin' back to work for Pete.

1033
01:25:08,077 --> 01:25:12,036
I don't care what it takes. I don't care
how many bars you have to stand on.

1034
01:25:12,117 --> 01:25:16,315
You are not comin' home.
I'm not letting you back in the house.

1035
01:25:16,397 --> 01:25:18,547
Forget it.

1036
01:25:27,677 --> 01:25:30,145
Are you wearing cologne?

1037
01:25:30,237 --> 01:25:34,947
No.
Well, it's just a splash of Old Spice.

1038
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,352
Where did you get Old Spice?

1039
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:41,986
That nice redheaded nurse
gave it to me as a gift.

1040
01:25:42,077 --> 01:25:44,352
Then she asked me out for coffee.

1041
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:46,632
I'm scared.

1042
01:25:46,717 --> 01:25:50,266
- Are you gonna go on a date?
- God, a date.

1043
01:25:51,717 --> 01:25:53,628
I'd better buy a pair of socks.

1044
01:26:05,437 --> 01:26:10,306
OK. Come on in here.
Watch out for the... OK. OK.

1045
01:26:48,397 --> 01:26:50,911
OK if I eat here at the bar?

1046
01:26:52,237 --> 01:26:55,866
- Do you have a reservation?
- Yeah.

1047
01:26:56,597 --> 01:27:00,192
It's under "cast-iron heartless bitch".

1048
01:27:01,077 --> 01:27:02,988
Could it be under
"stubborn and pigheaded"?

1049
01:27:03,077 --> 01:27:05,545
Yes. That's the one.

1050
01:27:06,957 --> 01:27:09,869
I'll have a double water
on the rocks, please.

1051
01:27:10,837 --> 01:27:13,476
- How'd you find me?
- Cammie.

1052
01:27:13,557 --> 01:27:17,186
She told me about your pop.
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1053
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:19,029
He's OK.

1054
01:27:19,117 --> 01:27:20,869
Good.

1055
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:25,234
- So am I.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

1056
01:27:26,957 --> 01:27:29,152
What's good to eat here?

1057
01:27:29,237 --> 01:27:32,593
Lil, you didn't come here to eat.
What do you want?

1058
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:37,996
OK.

1059
01:27:40,597 --> 01:27:44,556
I just wanted to let you know you can
come back to the bar whenever you want.

1060
01:27:46,357 --> 01:27:50,145
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm OK here.

1061
01:27:50,237 --> 01:27:53,991
I figured that.
You were never a lifer.

1062
01:27:54,077 --> 01:27:56,989
I'm married to that bar.
Hell, I'd...

1063
01:27:57,077 --> 01:28:01,150
I'd sleep there if I had the guts
to walk around barefoot.

1064
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,633
But that's me, you know?
I'm the original Coyote...

1065
01:28:06,597 --> 01:28:10,385
Just a small-town gal trying
to make it in the big bad city.

1066
01:28:11,357 --> 01:28:13,507
"Small-town gal"?

1067
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:17,634
Piedmont, North Dakota.

1068
01:28:19,957 --> 01:28:22,994
You ever tell anyone that,
I'll kill ya.

1069
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:27,313
Take care, Jersey.

1070
01:28:29,557 --> 01:28:31,627
You have one new message.

1071
01:28:33,597 --> 01:28:36,236
I have one message in eight hours.
How pathetic am I?

1072
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:38,831
Violet, this is Lyndsey Morgan
from the Bowery Ballroom.

1073
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:40,987
Listen, we loved your CD,

1074
01:28:41,077 --> 01:28:44,831
and we want you to play in our
song-writer's showcase next Sunday night.

1075
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:48,148
You're on at 10:00 sharp.
So drop your music by the club,

1076
01:28:48,237 --> 01:28:50,432
and the house band
can learn your song.

1077
01:28:50,517 --> 01:28:53,395
Now, if you have any questions,
don't be afraid to give me a shout.

1078
01:28:53,477 --> 01:28:54,830
See ya Sunday.

1079
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:57,636
- Here are the keys to the apartment.
It's all yours.

1080
01:28:57,717 --> 01:28:59,787
I can't thank you enough
for subleasing me this place.

1081
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,596
- You don't know how long I looked.
- And when is your boyfriend moving in?

1082
01:29:02,677 --> 01:29:04,588
He's actually coming in
tomorrow from Boston.

1083
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:10,429
It's historic, guys. This is the first night
I've closed early in three years.

1084
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:13,156
Ta-da. Will you hang that outside for me?

1085
01:29:13,237 --> 01:29:15,068
- Lou, you got that number I asked about?
- Yep.

1086
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:17,307
So why are you moving to Chicago?

1087
01:29:17,397 --> 01:29:20,195
I'll figure that out when I get there.

1088
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:24,913
Hello.

1089
01:29:24,997 --> 01:29:28,273
Do yourself a favour
and look at page 137 of <i>The Voice.</i>

1090
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:32,194
I can't believe your name is in the paper.
I'm gettin' this framed.

1091
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:35,394
Dad, if you're not ready in five minutes,
I'm gonna leave without you.

1092
01:29:35,477 --> 01:29:39,265
Keep your pants on, will ya?
I'm physically challenged.

1093
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:43,387
I only got three rolls of film.
I hope that's enough.

1094
01:29:43,477 --> 01:29:45,593
Dad, I'm only singing one song.

1095
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:47,793
Right. Better go get another one.

1096
01:29:50,597 --> 01:29:51,507
Bill.

1097
01:29:51,597 --> 01:29:53,952
My kid's singing tonight
at some club in the city.

1098
01:29:54,037 --> 01:29:57,507
She's a little nervous. Hey, maybe you
can give us a one, two, three for luck.

1099
01:29:58,237 --> 01:30:00,831
You got it. All right, let's give it up
for Bill Sanford's daughter.

1100
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:04,751
Light 'em up. One, two, three.

1101
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:09,553
Look, Vi.

1102
01:30:10,997 --> 01:30:12,555
I can't do this.

1103
01:30:13,517 --> 01:30:15,269
Jesus.

1104
01:30:16,317 --> 01:30:19,866
Did I mention to you that I was
recently in a horrific car accident?

1105
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,913
I can't do this.
I gotta go back.

1106
01:30:21,997 --> 01:30:24,557
- Violet, listen to me. Are you listening?
- Yes.

1107
01:30:24,637 --> 01:30:26,753
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You're already a star.

1108
01:30:26,837 --> 01:30:29,476
Dad, what are you talking about?
I'm a nobody.

1109
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:33,630
If you're such a nobody, then why did
I buy this off Pete for 20 bucks?

1110
01:30:35,677 --> 01:30:37,076
Why do you have that?

1111
01:30:37,157 --> 01:30:40,467
I saw it on the wall,
decided I wanted the first autograph.

1112
01:30:40,557 --> 01:30:42,275
I figured it'd be
a damn good investment.

1113
01:30:42,357 --> 01:30:45,269
Now what are you waiting for? I didn't
spend three months in physical therapy

1114
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:48,315
just to take a ride
to the state line, you got me?

1115
01:30:48,397 --> 01:30:51,309
- Yeah, I got ya.
- So what do you say, Vi?

1116
01:30:51,397 --> 01:30:54,150
How about another U-ey?

1117
01:30:57,117 --> 01:31:00,075
You guys call that a one, two, three?
Now, let's do it again.

1118
01:31:00,157 --> 01:31:02,148
This time I wanna feel chills.

1119
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:03,716
There goes Bill again.
He's back for seconds.

1120
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:06,072
Come on now. Let's give him all we got.

1121
01:31:08,437 --> 01:31:09,472
Let's go.

1122
01:31:09,557 --> 01:31:12,230
The only reason why I came down here
tonight is to see her fall on her face.

1123
01:31:12,317 --> 01:31:14,592
Take it easy, Rachel.
It's supposed to be a fun night out.

1124
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:16,713
- Excuse me.
- I'm cool. OK? Don't worry about me.

1125
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:18,594
Hi. Good evening, ladies.
Can I help you?

1126
01:31:18,677 --> 01:31:20,030
No.

1127
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:22,585
It's packed, Lyndsey. The house band
has been on for 15 minutes.

1128
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,668
If she's not here in five,
she's bumped.

1129
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:27,790
Jesus.

1130
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:30,594
Now that we're here,
I'm feeling a little nervous.

1131
01:31:30,677 --> 01:31:33,066
Thank you, Mr Sanford.

1132
01:31:33,877 --> 01:31:37,950
Probably just carsick.
Forget I mentioned it. I'm fine.

1133
01:31:38,037 --> 01:31:39,948
Have a great show.

1134
01:31:41,717 --> 01:31:43,548
Vi.

1135
01:31:43,637 --> 01:31:46,834
Get your butt in there.
Come on. We're right behind you.

1136
01:31:47,477 --> 01:31:49,035
Break a leg, sweetie.

1137
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:55,113
Ladies and gentlemen,
making her Bowery Ballroom debut,

1138
01:31:55,197 --> 01:31:57,074
Miss Violet Sanford.

1139
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,192
I'm sorry.

1140
01:33:11,597 --> 01:33:13,235
Violet.

1141
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:56,713
- Come on, baby. Shake it.
- Hey, pinhead.

1142
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,674
Shake it.

1143
01:33:59,237 --> 01:34:02,274
Don't do it, Rach. He's a big guy,
and you're still on probation.

1144
01:34:02,357 --> 01:34:04,427
Don't worry. Those classes
are really paying off.

1145
01:34:40,597 --> 01:34:45,227
OK. Let's give a big Coyote welcome
to LeAnn Rimes.

1146
01:34:53,557 --> 01:34:57,835
So tell me, what do you do when you
realise all your dreams have come true?

1147
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:59,828
You pay off old debts.

1148
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:07,466
Volume 129, the original appearance
of the Punisher.

1149
01:35:08,477 --> 01:35:10,115
The one I cost you.

1150
01:35:10,197 --> 01:35:11,312
Thank you.

1151
01:35:21,437 --> 01:35:24,986
Lil, I don't think
your new girl's gonna hack it.

1152
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:36,751
Jersey. Jersey. Jersey. Jersey.

1153
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:03,715
OK. In true Coyote tradition,
I'm gonna make every woman's night,

1154
01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:06,914
and auction off the most
handsome little hottie in the place.

1155
01:36:06,997 --> 01:36:09,306
Violet, come on.
You can't do this to me again.

1156
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:12,548
Here he is, girls.

1157
01:36:13,757 --> 01:36:15,236
Come on, Dad.

1158
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:19,866
OK, ladies.
The bidding will start at 25 dollars.

1159
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:24,228
Nobody wants this.
What are you getting me into, Violet?

1160
01:36:24,317 --> 01:36:25,989
25 dollars.

1161
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:28,193
You said you wanted
a more active social life.

1162
01:36:28,277 --> 01:36:31,713
Come on, girls. There's a lot of miles
left on these tires.

1163
01:36:31,797 --> 01:36:35,710
- Fifty dollars.
- Come on, Dad. Strut your stuff.

1164
01:36:36,437 --> 01:36:37,711
Seventy-five.

1165
01:36:47,597 --> 01:36:50,475
Take some of it off.

1166
01:36:53,277 --> 01:36:54,995
OK, put some of it on.

1167
01:36:56,157 --> 01:36:57,715
Yeah, baby!

1168
01:37:00,437 --> 01:37:02,997
- Ninety.
- Ninety-five.

1169
01:37:10,317 --> 01:37:12,387
Ninety-eight fifty.

1170
01:37:13,237 --> 01:37:15,193
A hundred.

1171
01:37:18,477 --> 01:37:21,071
- A hundred and fifty dollars.
- Sold.

1172
01:37:25,357 --> 01:37:27,075
I'm a Coyote.

1173
01:37:27,157 --> 01:37:31,275
Your father has no problem
with stage fright.

1174
01:37:33,717 --> 01:37:40,031
So tell me, what do you do when you
realise all your dreams have come true?

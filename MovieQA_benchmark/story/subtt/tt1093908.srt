there were real prices and mom prices.

4
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,120
Real prices got you shiny,
sparkly things that lasted three weeks,

5
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,123
and mom prices got you brown things...

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,542
...that lasted forever.

7
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,627
You notice they were 50 percent off?

I saw another world.

11
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,225
A dreamy world full of perfect things.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,813
A world where grown-up girls
got what they wanted.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,401
[woman] They were beautiful.

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,488
Like fairies or princesses.

They didn't even need any money,
they had magic cards.

16

I wanted one.

Moving to New York, I met guys.

If a man doesn't fit, you can't
exchange him seven days later

for a gorgeous cashmere sweater.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,276
And a store always smells good.

38
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,988

Wrap some old jeans around

00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,373
I am one of the best. I don't
let this out of my sight.

341
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,709
I guard it with my life.

342
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,545
A lot of pressure on me

343
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,340
to make sure everyone
gets these letters...

344
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,634
- Get them there on time.
- Got to get my job done.

345
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,220
See, I take my job very seriously.

346
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,931
- Yes. And to deliver...
- Oh, really?

347
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,476
And to deliver the mail,
but as the mail carrier

348
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,479
it's a lot of pressure on me
to get people their letters,

349
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,147
I've never lost a letter yet.

350
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,650
[French accent] I want
no more vertical buttonholes.

351
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm so bored with vertical buttonholes.

352
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,238
Is this for the Kaleidoscope shoot
with Paolo?

353
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:46,160
[speaking French]
Oh, but this!

354
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,790
[gasps] Cavalli.
He has read my mind.

355
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,251
It's marvelous. We can use it all.

356
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,419
Take it in.

357
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,886
[Alicia gasps] Oh, God.
What are you doing?

358
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,306
This is Alette.
Is this where you should be?

359
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,067
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

360
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,446
Dantay-West didn't hire me to be
an editor of this magazine.

361
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:27,118
They hired me to throw it a rope
and pull it out of the swamp.

362
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,911
- [knocking on glass]
- And that's...

363
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,289
Hi, everyone.
I'm Rebecca Bloomwood.

364
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,957
Sit down, Rebecca.

365
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,090
What makes a magazine
move from the newsstands?

366
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,551
[chair squeaking]

367
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,138
Real, unvarnished stories,

368
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,599
whether the people that we are
writing about like them or not.

369
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,312
Successful Saving is currently
the People magazine

370
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,607
of financial journalism,
and this is where that ends.

371
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,235
- From now...
- [pencil sharpener grinding]

372
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,201
Sorry.

373
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,999
From now on
we don't copy, we examine.

374
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,294
- We probe.
- Ooh!

375
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,090
I liked your piece.
I said that on the phone.

376
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,343
- Good. Good.
- Hayley!

377
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,094
What do you say a three-week trial.

378
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,847
- And give her this cubicle.
- Oh, this one's lovely.

379
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,766
They're all three by six.

380
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,352
You can start with a thousand words
on the effect of changing

381
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,270
interest rate on store card APRs.

382
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,272
Good.

383
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,533
[whispers] You still have the label
on your new glasses.

384
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,871
What? Oh.

385
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,499
You took a job
at a savings magazine? You?

386
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,959
I know it sounds bad,
but it is, in fact,

387
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,045
part of a very structured plan.

388
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,172
Yeah, that's great,
but then in a lot of ways

389
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,216
it's kinda not great.
What do they call it

390
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,094
when an animal rights person
gets trampled to death by a cow?

391
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,054
I don't think there is a word for that.

392
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,598
"Ironic." Ironic
that Rebecca Bloomwood

393
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,809
is advising people
on how to handle money.

394
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,895
But I guess it would be nice

395
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,398
if my maid of honor
could afford her own dress.

396
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,276
- He asked?
- Yes!

397
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,820
Oh, my God!
You should've been there.

398
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,405
- How did he say it?
- [man] Hey!

399
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,117
The, uh, credit limit
on your card was reached.

400
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,581
You know, I think I want my husband-
to-be to propose to me in Barneys.

401
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,377
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

402
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,089
- [girl] Yes, you are.
- I just found the perfect book for you.

403
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:49,760
Control Your Urge to Shop,
with Garrett E. Barton.

404
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,095
That's me.

405
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,641
Do you find yourself
constantly drawn toward stores?

406
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,810
- Yes.
- Nope.

407
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,896
Does your heart quicken
when you see new merchandise

408
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,356
in neatly stacked piles?

409
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,817
- Yes! This guy's good.
- No.

410
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,946
Did you answer no to these questions
and are consequently in denial?

411
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,073
- Yes.
- No!

412
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,576
Did you just say "no" again?

413
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,620
- No.
- [both] Yes.

414
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,125
Step one: de-clutter your life.
Throw it all out.

415
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,961
Just box it up and toss it!

416
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,757
Simplicity and order
are your new watchwords.

417
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,970
- [phone rings]
- Excuse me. Hello?

418
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,557
- [grunts]
- It's a fresh start calling.

419
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,227
And it's for you.

420
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,650
[creaking]

421
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,068
[Garrett] On your way to work,

422
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,031
ignore the siren call
of the store window.

423
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,411
Your new mantra is, "Do I need this?"

424
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,038
No.

425
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,499
What's this?

426
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,002
A thousand words
on store card APRs?

427
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,714
Which looks as if it's been copied
straight out of Money for Dummies.

428
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,011
No, I wanted a thousand words
on APRs from an angle.

429
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,221
Is that not an angle?

430
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,515
Not unless you call "head-on" an angle.

431
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,849
- No, I don't.
- Try it again.

432
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,310
- Remind me why I hired you.
- OK.

433
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,283
- Rebecca?
- [yelps]

434
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,456
Did you just type "good angles
on APRs" into Google?

435
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,336
Yes. I Googled.

436
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,678
- Am I fired?
- Get your coat.

437
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,179
You know these guys, right?

438
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,390
Comintex? Communications company?

439
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,016
Yes. Absolutely.

440
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,227
This year has been a year
of unparalleled growth

441
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,770
in the communications industry.

442
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,106
Overall, pal. Not in your company.

443
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,899
For us, at Comintex,

444
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,860
profits reflect that this has been
a year of acquisitions,

445
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:16,490
both of APL and of the Dutch
fiber-optic company, Zandak.

446
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,285
Neatly masking the 24 million in bonuses

447
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,496
- these guys paid themselves.
- Hmph. I know.

448
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,918
Now, what we have here, Rebecca,
is a situation in which someone

449
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,546
needs to be asking
some very hard questions.

450
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,923
- Absolutely.
- Put your hand up.

451
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,760
- What? No!
- Put your hand up.

452
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,429
I don't have hard-hitting questions.

453
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,723
- I'll give you questions.
- I'm gonna take notes.

454
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,100
- No, Put your hand up.
- I'm more of a student.

455
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,060
You'll be fine. Put your hand up.

456
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,271
Hello. Hi. Hello.

457
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,898
- He's not listening. He can't hear me.
- Louder. Stand up.

458
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,484
- Rebecca Bloomwood!
- ...should see a...

459
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,032
- Hello.
- [indistinct chattering]

460
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:03,370
- From. From. From. From.
- Hi, from Successful Saving.

461
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,538
It's a magazine.

462
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,791
We'll be taking questions
after the report.

463
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,627
Good. Uh...

464
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,087
- Ask him how much he earns.
- How much do you burn?

465
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,547
- Earn.
- Earn.

466
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,090
- Excuse me?
- Louder.

467
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,217
What do you earn?

468
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,846
- We'll take questions after.
- Why award themselves bonuses...

469
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,640
Why did you award
yourself bonuses...

470
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,475
- ...twenty-four million...
- ...of 23...

471
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,227
- Twenty-four. Million.
- ...billion...

472
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,938
- Million dollars...
- ...while investors lost eight percent?

473
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,651
...while your investors
lost eight percent?

474
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,903
[gasps, indistinct chattering]

475
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,616
As I said, I'll be happy
to answer questions...

476
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,534
Is that true?

477
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,000
A long pause and no answer.

478
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,587
- Long pause, no answer.
- No, no...

479
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,924
OK. You know why we did that?

480
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,926
Some kind of cruel initiation rite?

481
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,678
Listen to this.

482
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,348
"Security can mean different
things to different people.

483
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,559
For some, it's going to a party
wearing the right shoes.

484
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,187
This might leave you feeling
secure for an evening,

485
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,148
but have a crippling effect
on you in later life."

486
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,275
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that.

487
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,653
Now, what firms like Comintex

488
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,031
thrive on is an endemic lack
of public understanding.

489
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,866
They get away with murder because...

490
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,371
Maisie with a root beer and a $200
investment portfolio,

491
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,414
what does she know?

492
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,458
What does she actually know
about what those guys are doing?

493
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,627
What she's told.

494
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,963
And if the magazines
she looks to for answers

495
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,756
aren't asking the right questions,

496
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,800
it isn't good for Maisie.

497
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:45,556
I want you to tell the truth in a way
that Maisie can understand.

498
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,810
Now, go home,
write me an initial outline

499
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,688
and e-mail it to me by 3:00. OK?

500
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,127
Oh, no.

501
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,213
Oh, yeah. Nice!

502
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,717
You know, I just got a call
from Jeff Kanter at Comintex.

503
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,260
They're having
their stockholders' meeting.

504
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,763
- Yes, I sent someone.
- Yeah, you did.

505
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,598
A real find, actually, the girl I sent.

506
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,100
She's sparky, honest.

507
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,936
Exactly the type
that I was hoping to find.

508
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,399
I assume that's why Edgar West

taking your own advice?

- Hmm. We'll see.

[gasping]

1180
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,276
[cell phone] Do not answer
this call, it's Derek Smeath.

1181
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:45,787
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.

1182
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,456
Do not answer
this call, it's...

1183
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,000
Hello.

1184
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:59,467
Ah, yes. Is perfect.

1185
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,971
So, unfortunately, I cannot stay.

1186
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,099
But I am looking forward
to seeing how you accessorize it

1187
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,893
- for your TV debut. Hmm?
- Oh, thank you.

1188
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,978
Goodbye.

1189
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,320
- Oh, God.
- Is there a problem?

1190
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,409
Pretty much my entire
first month's salary.

1191
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,369
Mmm. But isn't it worth it?

1192
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:33,001
OK, no peeking. Don't peek.
Can you see? OK. Get up here.

1193
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:38,965
Now turn this way. OK, don't peek.
Don't peek. OK, open!

1194
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,761
Oh, and look, look, look!
The best part!

1195
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,642
- Do you love it?
- It's so her!

1196
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,769
Oh, Bex. This is so exciting.

1197
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,855
I'm getting married
and you love your dress,

1198
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,024
and you're getting to Alette, and...

1199
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,734
What's in that bag?

1200
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,196
Oh, that's just a dress
that Alette chose for me

1201
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,864
for the TV show.

1202
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,116
Mom, can you go get a cupcake?

1203
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,078
How much did it cost?

1204
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,665
Alette gets an incredible discount.

1205
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,459
Still going to Shopaholics Anonymous?

1206
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,668
Yes!

1207
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,837
- 'Cause you promised.
- I know!

1208
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,975
Oh, excuse me. Are you going
to the shopaholics meeting?

1209
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,644
Yes.

1210
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,647
Could you do me a favor
and stow these in your trunk?

1211
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,233
Doesn't look good entering
a self-help shopping group

1212
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,525
carrying a Barneys bag.

1213
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,778
Oh! I know exactly what you mean.

1214
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,197
- Leave it to me.
- OK.

1215
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:47,116
- Hey, save me a seat, huh?
- OK.

1216
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,329
- [Rebecca] Thank you!
- [church bells tolling]

My name is Ms. Korch.
I am your new group leader.

1218
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,296
I do things differently.

1219
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,426
Ms. Bloomwood?

1220
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,804
You're willing to give away
your money for things

1221
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,098
that you don't need,
so why not try giving away

1222
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,933
the things you don't need
for no money.

1223
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,310
But here's the thing:
I really need those things.

1224
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,104
I'll show you who really needs them.

1225
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,273
Steady! Steady.
Courage, woman.

1226
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,151
- Oh, my. Colorful.
- This is my bridesmaid's dress.

1227
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:26,030
Please! How many of us
have used that one before, hmm?

1228
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:32,620
OK. I just want you to take
these clothes and... do good.

1229
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:38,334
Ms. Bloomwood,
wasn't that liberating? Bravo!

1230
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:41,087
[all cheering]

1231
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:45,300
My will is strong. My wallet is closed.
I don't want to shop!

1232
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,635
Back to the basement.
I couldn't be prouder.

1233
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,140
There's been a mistake.
The dresses I gave in?

1234
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,392
- Hmm. I need it back.
- I see. Mm-hmm. Christy!

1235
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,893
Yes?

1236
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,688
Can't sell those two dresses.
There's been a mistake.

1237
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:01,607
- No returns.
- I really need these dresses!

1238
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,443
I'd bring back something tomorrow.

1239
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,653
- Something better.
- No exchanges.

1240
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:10,533
- OK, so, um, I'll buy 'em.
- You will? Oh, that's great.

1241
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,327
Oh, really.
We need every cent here.

1242
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:15,621
- OK. How much?
- A hundred and ten.

1243
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,999
What? How is this a charity store?

1244
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,751
This is from Barneys.

1245
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,172
I know. OK,
I don't have enough for both.

1246
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:27,592
- This one's twenty.
- Maybe come back for this one?

1247
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,511
Which is more important?

1248
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,639
Got money issues? Who hasn't?

1249
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,809
Oh! Tarkie, Tarkie, Tarkie, she's on!

1250
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,187
- This is her?
- Yeah.

1251
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:42,357
The Girl in the Green Scarf,
Rebecca Bloomwood,

1252
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,984
Oh, she looks like an expert.
How are her accessories?

1253
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:50,323
Hey, Janice. She's in the...
Whoa. What channel?

1254
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,867
...finance. Not my thing.

1255
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,079
- Jane.
- [Jane] Yeah?

1256
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,540
- Janey. Janey!
- What?

1257
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,377
[woman on TV] ...then I read your
columns, and I'm like...

1258
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,878
"Wow. I get it."

1259
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,922
Right. Which is exactly the point.

1260
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,383
Because so much
financial journalism is really...

1261
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,885
- Is really boring.
- I'm with ya on that!

1262
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,055
Yes! Go, Bex!

1263
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,890
It's not accessible.

1264
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,684
But it's ordinary people that have
the most money in savings.

1265
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,479
It is. It's people like my mom and dad.

1266
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,648
Ow!

1267
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,943
Tell us about the coat.
Tell the audience what you wrote

1268
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,821
about the cashmere coat and worth.

1269
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,782
- Well, that's you.
- No, no.

1270
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,243
- He inspired me.
- Aw...

1271
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,995
[Rebecca] It's the difference
between cost and worth.

1272
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,623
Essentially, something
you can't see, can't touch,

1273
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,918
but it's actually the most
valuable commodity in America.

1274
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:47,130
- And that's...
- Trust.

1275
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,593
Trust. I'm loving you guys.

1276
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,263
Who knew that debt
could be so much fun, huh?

1277
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,348
But we just have a little bit more time.

1278
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,350
We wanna get questions
from the audience.

1279
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,144
Is there anybody out there

1280
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,229
with any financial issues
that would like...

1281
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,480
Yes, you, sir.

1282
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:08,025
Well... I'm having trouble with debt.

1283
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,279
OK. Mortgage debt, car debt?

1284
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,912
- Ms. Bloomwood's debt.
- [laughs] Ms. Bloomwood's debt.

1285

That's right.

1286

I'm from the All City
Debt Collection Agency.

1287

- My name is Derek Smeath.
- [woman] Alrighty.

1288
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,092
Now, look, for God's sake,
can I just say that this man

1289
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,970
has been stalking Rebecca
for the past year.

1290
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,472
Yes, I have.

1291
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,766
To recover unrepaid credit
on a store card totaling

1292
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,811
$9,412 and a quarter.

1293
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,314
- [audience gasps]
- Is this for real?

1294
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:49,817
No, I'm sorry,
because he is her ex-boyfriend.

1295
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,738
Really?

1296
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,909
No wonder she didn't bring him home.

1297
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,997
That's good. I tell ya,

1298
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,416
the more you look at me,
the funnier that gets.

1299
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:12,006
OK, well, uh, my ex-girlfriend

1300
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,883
told me she couldn't meet me today

1301
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,552
because I might risk
contamination with an infection

1302
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:20,515
- she picked up in Finland.
- Oh!

1304

- [audience laughs]
- OK, we're on limited time.

1305
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,604
Anybody else like to ask...

1306
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,273
No, no, no.
The best is yet to come.

1307

Oh, God!

1308
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,693
Did you realize
our Ms. Bloomwood here

1309
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,946
is in the hospital with depression?

1310
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,490
Currently in the hospital
with gallstones.

1311
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:39,617
"Check is in the mail" 14 times.

1312
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,995
Check is lost in the mail 14 times.

1313
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,123
Recovering from
a chemical fruit acid peel.

1314

Called back for second tour
of duty in Basra.

Which of these excuses is true?

1317
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,178
Are any of them?

1318
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,765
Will the real Rebecca Bloomwood
please stand up?

1319
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,774
Well, at least I don't have to worry
about you being stalked!

1320
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,234
Luke, you don't understand!

1321
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,819
No, you're right, I don't!

1322
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,029
So do what I hired you to do, Rebecca,

1323
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,239
and make the truth clear

1324
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,866
to somebody who absolutely
doesn't understand.

1325
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,868
I shop.

1326
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,495
Oh, so you lie because you shop.

1327
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,790
- [stammering]
- OK, OK. Why do you shop?

1328
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:29,750
- Well, I...
- Come on, come on!

1329
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,502
Well, you're not giving me time...

1330
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,087
For what?
To make something up?

1331
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,673
Just, for once in your life,
tell me the truth.

1332
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:43,139
Because when I shop,
the world gets better.

1333
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,057
The world is better.

1334
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:51,606
And then it's not anymore.
And I need to do it again.

1335
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,696
Well, what about honesty?

1336
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,992
What about credibility?

1337
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,620
Well, I wanted to tell you,

1338
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:09,040
but I only took the job
to get to Alette.

1339
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,638
Well, I wish you all the best with that.

1340

Luke, I'm so sorry.

1341
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,477
No, no. I understand.
The whole thing was a lie.

1342
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,691

01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,983
Open the doors, Dad!

1512
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:11,655
- [♪ Jordyn Taylor: Accessory]

1513
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,740
[indistinct shouting]

1514
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:17,577
There's plenty for everyone.

1515
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,037
Just, take your...

1516
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,747
You'll note the delicious color,

1517
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,583
the smart collar
and these classic buttons.

1518
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,377
Thirty dollars is my final offer.

1519
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,587
I'll give you $30
to get away from my table.

1520
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,756
What about your mother?
What would she like?

1521
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:30,924
Sobriety.

1522
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:33,510
- I think it's...
- It's a lucky top.

1523
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,012
These are real Prada shoes, ladies.

1524
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,432
They go with the same pink
as this scarf.

1525
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,393
And the handbag.
Oh. And the gloves.

1526
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:44,104
OK, you know what, not for sale.
Not for sale.

1527
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:47,524
- Ms. Ptaszinski!
- I'm OK.

1528
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:49,985
And now...

1529
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,613
[all gasp]

1530
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,615
The green scarf!

1531
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,284
An icon.

1532
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:02,622
Supple, sensual,
the color of money.

1533
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,666
Rebecca always had such fabulous taste.

1534
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,835
No wonder she wound up
at Alette magazine.

1535
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:09,129
Oh, Becky didn't end up
at Alette magazine.

1536
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,131
She turned that "hoppertunity" down.

1537
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,341
- What? Why?
- Yes, Jane Bloomwood, hi.

1538
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:14,551
Oh, hi.

1539
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:19,389
Now who will be the next

1540
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,809

- Anyone else?

1541
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,352

- [Korch] Ninety dollars right here!

1543
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,774
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1544
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,652
I have a bidder on the phone.
One hundred and twenty dollars.

1545
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,113
One-twenty for the beautiful,
famous, elegant...

1546
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:36,823
- [woman] One-fifty!
- Don't sell it.

1547
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,658
You've sold so much already.

1548
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,496
- Two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1549

[all gasp]

1550
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:48,585
Two-fifty! I have 250.
The bid is against you at 250.

1551
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,380
- Well?
- Three hundred dollars!

1552
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,886
You can tell your friend on the phone,
I'll match anything they bid.

1553
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,514
She's like an assassin.

1554
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:03,099
Three hundred dollars. Going once.

1555
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:10,315
- Going twice.
- My bidder withdraws.

1556
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,652
Sold for 300 to the lady in pink.

1557
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:19,282
- [Rebecca] Wait!
- [all gasping]

1558
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,119
Uh...

1559
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:39,886
- Don't wear it with yellow.
- Never.

1560
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,682
- It could bring you love.
- Thank you.

1561
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,900
[cheering]

1562
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:04,578
One, two, three, four.
That's another thousand.

1563
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,163
Wow.

1564
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:11,084
$16,586, 72 cents.

1565
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:14,296
- You are a winner, babe!
- [all screaming]

1566
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,590
Oh, my God.

1567
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,366
- [screams]
- Mr. Smeath.

1568
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:47,120
What the hell is this?
What are you doing?

1569
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:50,624
I'm doing exactly what you did to me
on that television show, Derek.

1570
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,959
I'm just giving you what you deserve.

1571
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,962
But in the most
inconvenient way possible.

1572
01:33:56,047 --> 01:34:02,010
And that, I think, makes 9,412.

1573
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,180
Oh. And a quarter.

1574
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:12,562
[indistinct chattering]

1575
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,867
[Rebecca] I've got it. I've got it.

1576
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,624
[woman] OK. Ladies, it's time!

1577
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:39,756
- How'd you get it back?
- I did a deal.

1578
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,437
Get her some flowers.

1579
01:34:57,316 --> 01:35:00,860
- Sorry. OK.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1580
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,451
- Ready, sweetie?
- Bex!

1581
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,662
Come here.

1582
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,004
OK.

1584

See you at the reception!

1585
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:39,227
You sold all your clothes and kept that?

1586
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:53,074
- It's Suze's wedding...
- Wedding. I know.

1587
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:56,119
I'm an investigative
journalist, Rebecca.

1588
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:58,037
Give me some credit.

1589
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:11,426
You really sold it all?

1590
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:15,805
You have nothing left.

1591
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,933
I mean, I wouldn't put it like that.

[gasps]

1593
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,401
Neither would I.

1594
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,155
The bidder on the phone was you.

1595
01:38:34,366 --> 01:38:35,825
But you lost!

1596
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:41,122
Both bidders were me.

I actually learned Finnish.

Ahh... [speaks Finnish]

a relationship with my credit card,

I have a relationship
with someone who loves me back.

And never declines me.

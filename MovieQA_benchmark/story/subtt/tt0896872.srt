1
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,815
I have to get home.

2
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,487
-Mama's gonna kill me.
-No.

3
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,321
You are staying with me tonight.

4
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,078
Roman wants us there
at nine in the morning.

5
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,164
Raya we've been over this.

6
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,084
It's just a few months
working in a hotel.

7
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,498
Yes, but...

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,376
You want to work at
Copyshack like your mother?

9
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,551
He said it was both
of us or nothing!

10
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,730
No.

11
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,523
Fuck your mom!

12
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,760
-I'm sorry.
-It's 1:30 in the morning.

13
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,130
You don't understand!
Luba wanted me to...

14
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,507
If her mother lets her do
whatever she wants...

15
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,099
go live there.

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,311
You graduated.
You're an adult now.

17
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,516
Do what you want.

18
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,170
Raya?

19
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,646
Big smile.

20
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,529
Big smile.

21
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,444
Good.

22
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,363
What will you say at border?

23
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,532
I am Natalya...

24
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,659
I am Natalya Verbova.

25
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,372
I am going to Budapest
to buy carpets for reselling.

26
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,589
Raya...

27
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,212
Hello.

28
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,584
I'm working...

29
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,754
Out. Out.

30
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,058
Out.

31
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,694
Smile!

32
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,586
Hi, Kathy.

33
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,637
You're in a hurry.

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,301
Where's the fire?

35
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,055
Sorry.

36
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,633
- Hi, Mare.
- Hi.

37
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,060
Transfer come through?

38
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,480
No.

39
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,352
You'll find something, hon.

40
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,399
Yes.

41
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,281
-Hi, boys.
-Hi.

42
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,119
Why don't you guys go
inside and help your mom, okay?

43
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,369
All right?

44
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,374
Marie asked me to bring this.

45
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,250
Erin around?

46
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,548
-It's nice to see you too, Kath.
-Yes, right.

47
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,342
You can't hold this
against me.

48
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,431
I gave you plenty of
warning on this.

49
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,550
It's not my fault you're
married to that job of yours.

50
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,144
Plenty of warning?
You just sprung this on me.

51
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,012
Look, I'm not going to
do this in front of Erin, okay.

52
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,355
Where is she? Erin?

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,566
And actually I'm not
married to my job.

54
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,151
I happen to like it.

55
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,396
I don't see why that has
to make me a bad mother.

56
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,032
Well, it's not my fault the
judge didn't see it that way, Kath.

57
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,368
Thanks, Kyle. Thank
you for bringing that up.

58
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,115
Look, I told you, you're welcome
to come down to Dalton...

59
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,038
It's really simple for me, you know,
I've just got to clear my mortgage...

60
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,411
find a transfer, you know,
really a piece of cake.

61
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,336
Hey, sweetie, how's it
going? Come here.

62
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,720
-Come here.
-No, Kyle, it's fragile.

63
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,589
-How am I supposed to know?
-Hi, Marie. How's it going?

64
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,559
-I brought the camping gear.
-Thank you.

65
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,053
-Why don't you label them...
-Marie scares me.

66
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,390
I'll tell you a secret.
She scares me too.

67
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,607
Don't tell anyone.

68
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,439
You okay?

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,357
Tell me.

70
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,326
When are you coming?

71
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,745
Sweetie, I'm having a really
hard time finding a transfer.

72
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,666
It might take awhile. But
I'm trying really hard.

73
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,423
I'm going to make it
happen, okay?

74
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,378
I don't understand.
There's got to be something.

75
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,471
-I mean I have the experience...
-Kathy.

76
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,636
-I took extra forensic courses.
-Kathy!

77
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,093
You've done
everything right.

78
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,642
-This is just how the cards fell.
-Yes, story of my fucking life.

79
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,057
Look, there's something
I heard about.

80
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,229
Yes.

81
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,646
I didn't think it would
work for you...

82
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,772
what with you trying
to get closer to your kid.

83
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,398
It's incredible money.

84
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:36,244
A hundred grand tax-free
for six months' work.

85
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,656
Come on, is it legal?
What is this?

86
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,080
It's the contractor that
the government uses to provide...

87
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,203
peacekeepers in Bosnia.

88
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,712
Bosnia.

89
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,446
You see the bullet
marks? Eye level!

90
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,699
They just... Kicked out
with the store. All the store.

91
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,127
Hey, man.
You gotta watch your back.

92
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,639
You come here today as
a beacon of hope.

93
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,099
As representatives of
our highest aspirations.

94
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,059
You've been hired by
Democra Security...

95
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,651
to represent the US...

96
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,109
as monitors for the
United Nations.

97
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,486
In the next few months...

98
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,532
you will protect the rule of Law
where lawlessness is run rampant.

99
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,490
The 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords ended this war...

100
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,335
dictating that an international
police task force...

101
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,331
you, would smooth the
transition from war to peace.

102
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,547
During your training you
will see that peace...

103
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,129
is harder won than war.

104
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,555
That every morning's hope is
haunted by yesterday's nightmare.

105
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,563
As representatives of
the United Nations...

106
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,435
we stake our highest
values, even our lives...

107
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,567
on the belief that we
can rebuild.

108
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:39,652
We must renew and we will
witness the rebirth of this country.

109
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,577
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

110
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,381
It'll settle down.

111
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,469
Hey, honey.

112
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,388
-You been here before?
-This is my second mission.

113
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,135
You came straight from
the Academy?

114
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,480
No, I'm not a cop. I work
in administration.

115
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,814
You only need
a high school diploma...

116
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,313
and to be over 21 to get in.

117
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,274
What about you?
What brought you here?

118
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,619
I heard the food was
really great.

119
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,201
I thought the war was over.

120
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,415
De-mining.

121
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,290
-You okay?
-Yes.

122
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,713
I'm great.

123
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,096
I'm serious. He couldn't
move off the mine...

124
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,439
for eight days and eight nights.

125
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,433
So he's demanding time
and a half for nights.

126
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,653
Best part is that now,
sue me! How about that?

127
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,442
You still seeing the little guy?

128
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,238
Kathy, meet Fred Murray.

129
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,572
-Hi.
-Pleasure.

130
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,666
Hi, guys. We got a match.

131
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,331
High stakes tournament
situation. US versus Holland.

132
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,124
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh yes...

133
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,464
-Yes!
-Come on!

134
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,674
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on, yes!

135
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,133
I knew it!

136
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,473
You suck at pinball and
you suck at football.

137
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,388
-Who do you think invented pinball?
-Can you play?

138
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,103
-Can I play! Hold this.
-Okay. Alright.

139
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,472
-She's having the last one.
-The last one.

140
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,269
You know what?
You got to pull it, alright?

141
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,483
Yes, she knows, okay.
She knows.

142
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,693
-Okay, come on.
-Just watch this.

143
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,022
-Damn it!
-Okay. Here we go!

144
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,025
Yes! Yes!

145
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,489
Here we go, here we go!

146
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,576
Shit!

147
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,165
Sorry, guys. I don't
know what happened.

148
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,284
Who's not going to buy
the drinks?

149
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,290
I don't know what
happened there.

150
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,712
I would love some whisky and...

151
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,254
-Don't use...
-Shit!

152
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,599
Sorry, you can't use both flippers
at the same time, otherwise...

153
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,310
-Flippers?
-Yes, these are called flippers.

154
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,396
Well, this is the way I was taught.

155
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,191
-With a man behind you?
-Girls.

156
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,151
See, bam bam.

157
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,531
Bam bam, because it
has to bounce off.

158
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,399
This move still get you laid?

159
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,285
Well, in Holland it does.

160
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,554
I'm really out of practice.

161
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,215
Gentlemen.

162
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,144
So where do we sign
to say we came?

163
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,609
You sign...

164
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,355
Well, I think you have to
sign at the end of the session.

165
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,357
No. Why?
No, no, no.

166
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:52,408
Yep. It says right here, "UN mandate
requires you to sign at the end"...

167
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,248
Yes, but this paper is no
good. The new policy is...

168
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,745
Leave her alone.
They try it out with everyone.

169
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,498
You sign them in,
they bugger off.

170
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,624
-I'm McVeigh. You're Kathy?
-Yeah.

171
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,510
Welcome to paradise.
Follow me.

172
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,258
Okay, gentlemen. If you have
nothing better to do today...

173
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,057
I would like you to start
investigating two new stabbings.

174
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,730
Four new shootings...

175
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,728
and a wee man with
a broken leg...

176
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,193
who can barely remember his name.

177
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,146
First one. In here.

178
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,150
Gather around.

179
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,448
Kathy...

180
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,581
why don't you take
this, please?

181
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,291
Facial contusions from
repeated beatings with fist.

182
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,465
Lacerations on the eye caused
by the edge of an iron.

183
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:54,345
Left arm was the first entry
point of a large kitchen knife.

184
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,560
Okay, Mama, I'm Just
going to lift this up.

185
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,568
It's all right.

186
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,705
-Who did this?
-Looks like the husband.

187
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,117
Okay, that's the case.

188
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,702
Who's taking it and
what's their first step?

189
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,137
-I will take it.
-Very good.

190
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,393
All right. Calm down.

191
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,145
What is he saying?

192
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,401
Say woman is Muslim...

193
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,527
and she deserved it.

194
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,738
Alright, alright!

195
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,407
That's enough. Stop it!

196
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,080
Hands off.

197
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,259
Moving on. Next case.

198
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,180
Go. Everyone outside.

199
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,644
Kathy, you too.

200
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,559
Excuse me. What do
you mean moving on?

201
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,523
Who's going to investigate
and make an arrest?

202
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,313
This is a felony assault.

203
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,777
Okay, let me ask you something.

204
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,654
Can you tell a Serb
from a Croat or a Bosniak?

205
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,994
Because I can. Racial hatred
started a war in this country.

206
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,453
And as much as I'd like to be...

207
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,540
we aren't here as investigators,
we monitor. That's it.

208
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,702
Sometimes stepping
back is part of the job.

209
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,427
Zlata has been in the hospital
eight times because of her husband.

210
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,217
Each time she tried
to make complaint...

211
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,011
my bosses send her home.

212
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,430
They laugh at her. They
laugh at women in Bosnia.

213
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,223
They laughed at
my mother even.

214
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,564
And they do not prosecute
domestic violence.

215
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,356
Yesterday you wanted to help.

216
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,610
Now you can show me
how to do this.

217
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,446
So this is the hospital report.

218
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,495
You have no police reports.

219
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,122
Well, what you need to do
is investigate this...

220
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,503
as if it were a felony assault.

221
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,467
So if you go back to the hospital...

222
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,134
and get every single doctor
who treated her to testify...

223
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,508
well, then you might have a chance.

224
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,599
But you'll have to...

225
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,390
Cross reference every
injury with other cases...

226
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,725
where courts ruled
felony assault.

227
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:55,481
If our courts rule that stabbing
a man in a bar is criminal...

228
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:01,403
then the same should apply
to a woman in her home.

229
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,368
I have considered the evidence...

230
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,292
and rule in favour
in Zlata Sehik.

231
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,142
- H el I o.
- H el I o.

232
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,279
Don't mind him.
He's a complete wimp.

233
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,693
Well, you've been
stirring things up.

234
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,289
Ms. Rees, if I over-stepped protocol
with the Zlata Sehick case I'm...

235
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,328
Would you call me
Madeleine?

236
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,711
You've just done in two months...

237
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,590
what we failed to do
in four years. Sit down.

238
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,297
-Do you want some tea?
-Yes, please.

239
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,424
Viko Mezovic did a great job...

240
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:09,304
but you've just facilitated the first
conviction for domestic violence...

241
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,565
since the end of
the war in Bosnia.

242
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,061
Well, it was very basic...
Thank you.

243
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,233
Basic police work.

244
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,322
It's just my job.

245
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,114
You can't imagine how that makes
you stand out around here.

246
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,120
The IPTF have a
Gender Affairs Office here.

247
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,085
And the current head left...

248
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,172
and I think you're
the right person to take over.

249
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,598
Well...

250
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,217
Are you up for it?

251
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,606
-Hello.
-Hi, Sweetie.

252
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,602
Did you get the stuff I sent?

253
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,729
-Did dad say you're not coming back?
-No.

254
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,355
Of course I'm coming back.

255
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,232
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

256
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,780
-For Labour Day?
-Well, I...

257
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,652
Because my friends
are renting a boat and...

258
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,245
But I have to stay longer...

259
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,116
because they've asked me
to be the head of a department.

260
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,041
Oh, well...

261
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,498
You know what?
I'm making a lot of money...

262
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:21,384
so I can move nearer dad and
I can see you all the time.

263
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,049
That's cool. Hold on!
Sorry, I've got to go, Mom.

264
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,512
-I have a game.
-Okay.

265
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,802
-I love you. Bye.
-Bye.

266
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,189
-Kathy?
-Yes.

267
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,450
Nick Kaufman, Contingent Commander.

268
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,115
-Good to meet you.
-Great to meet you.

269
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,328
-How are you?
-Can I give you a hand?

270
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,573
-I'm fine. This way?
-Yeah.

271
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,082
Good having another
American in the mix.

272
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,577
Some people get pissed off,
saying we're taking over.

273
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,329
Makes my life easier.

274
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,249
Especially when it's a good-looking
woman reporting to me.

275
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,718
I don't mean to burst your bubble
but I report to Madeleine Rees.

276
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,508
It's a joint appointment.

277
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,222
And she's Human Rights.
But you're Democra.

278
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,514
So ultimately you're all mine
at the end of the day.

279
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,487
No, you can't. Don't, don't.
Please don't.

280
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,492
Just don't touch. Just step
away from the table, please.

281
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,494
I've had my eyes on this
table for a long time.

282
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,041
This one is mine, lady.

283
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,504
-This is your table?
-This is my table.

284
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,170
I'm sorry to tell you
but this is my table.

285
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,629
I have a new job over at HQ
with a lot of fancy diplomats...

286
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,303
and for someone
in my position this...

287
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,016
-Would have this table?
-Yes.

288
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,760
I feel very strongly about it.

289
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,649
-You don't care about my feelings?
-I don't care about your feelings.

290
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,401
-So you're just going to take it?
-I'll tell you what.

291
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,067
If you buy me dinner you can
have the damn table.

292
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,445
-Come on! Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

293
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,533
I was married twice.

294
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,417
Like, two times?

295
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,379
-Two times.
-That's twice.

296
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:09,044
Yes, once and then again and
I messed it up both times.

297
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,679
-What about you?
-Well, technically I'm still married.

298
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,383
But it is...

299
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,225
it's complicated right now...

300
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,436
because we are in the middle of...

301
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,558
what I would call an ending.

302
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,442
But you're married.

303
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,563
Right. But we are in
the process of...

304
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,405
-Kids?
-Yes, we have two.

305
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,819
-Two?
-Boys.

306
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,405
It isn't that complicated
but it is.

307
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,995
If I slept with you,
I'm going straight to hell.

308
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,083
You are.
Let's get drunk first.

309
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,462
I'm sorry!

310
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,250
Stop fighting, okay?

311
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,470
-Put it down.
-Stay here, please.

312
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,132
Total goat fuck!

313
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,431
Musical apartments!
Just hold the people back!

314
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,644
What do you need me to do?

315
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,601
The Muslim women are supposed
to get their old apartments back.

316
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,725
Serbs took them during the war.
Serbs don't want to leave!

317
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:09,274
And a lot of places got sold to
third-party Croats or God knows what!

318
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,396
And everyone's pissed.

319
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,613
And I figured it's a
bunch of widows...

320
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,030
-so your Gender Office can handle it.
-Okay.

321
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,152
-Bolkovac?
-Yes.

322
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,243
They need you. Come on.

323
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,532
-Murray, can you deal with it?
-I'll take this then. Great!

324
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,160
She was talking but
I couldn't understand.

325
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,457
She's not local.

326
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,304
Hey.

327
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,054
Hey?

328
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,202
All right.

329
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,544
I'm not going to touch you.

330
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,520
What is it? Are you in pain?

331
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,604
Oh God, this girl is seriously ill.
Could you call a medic?

332
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,103
Somebody call an ambulance!

333
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,447
Raya, are you okay?

334
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,488
-She was further back in the woods.
-It's me, Irka. Wake up!

335
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,488
They make raid!
They abuse the girls.

336
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,581
Okay, calm down.
Take a breath.

337
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,498
Nine girls there.

338
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,995
-Help them!
-Where?

339
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,497
-Florida Bar.
-Florida Bar?

340
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,124
-What is Florida Bar?
-It's one of the bars in the hills.

341
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,125
Raya!

342
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,002
I can take them to
the Zenica Shelter.

343
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,255
That's where we usually
take these girls.

344
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,722
Usually!?

345
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,140
Where is the bar?
How do I get there?

346
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,139
What's happening here?

347
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,560
What's going on here?

348
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,437
-IPTF told us to come.
-Really?

349
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,686
That's interesting.
Since when do you listen to us?

350
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,063
Well, where are they?
I don't see any monitors.

351
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,656
Lady, what do you want?

352
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,448
I got called to come here to take
the girls to Zenica so I'm here.

353
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,161
What's Zenica?
What's it?

354
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,625
Mothersuckers. I don't pay you
fucking Smurfs no more.

355
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,584
Pay? Pay?
What's he talking about?

356
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,169
What does he mean, pay?

357
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,169
-What did he say?
-I don't know.

358
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,093
I am Bosniak and he is Croat and
I don't understand Croat!

359
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,342
Bullshit! I know you
understand him.

360
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,222
Smart lady.

361
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,064
-What's in Zenica?
-It's a woman's shelter.

362
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,351
You know, the whores
get a good meal.

363
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:41,483
They can talk about problems.
It's like a vacation for them.

364
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,442
Very funny.

365
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,162
Oh my God.

366
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,538
Jesus Christ.

367
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,483
Quickly! Over here.

368
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,444
-Is this the Zenica Shelter?
-Yes.

369
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,745
We have to be careful.
Sometimes they watch.

370
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,492
-Who watch?
-Traffickers.

371
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,622
-Traffickers?
-Yes. Human trafficking.

372
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:17,383
These girls were
abducted and sold.

373
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:26,233
They are told they must
work off their debt.

374
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,989
And then they'll be let go.

375
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,118
But they never are.

376
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,536
Since the end of the war...

377
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,412
sex trafficking has spread
like cancer.

378
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,800
-Why since the end of the war?
-Half our men are dead.

379
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,678
So...

380
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,558
who are these girls
brought in for?

381
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,694
This is our volunteer nurse.

382
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:31,002
She says Raya has bad infection.

383
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:36,420
The nurse found objects inside her.

384
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,217
Excuse me?

385
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,298
Coins.

386
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,179
Like you saw, they're
not prostitutes.

387
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,058
They are slaves, treated
like dogs.

388
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,443
Do you have a doctor here?

389
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,438
We don't have doctor.

390
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,443
Try the Global
Displacement Agency.

391
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:06,333
If they keep them or not,
I don't know.

392
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,588
Wait, please. There
were other girls?

393
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,390
The ones who were
from the Florida Bar.

394
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,431
The police brought them
here about an hour ago.

395
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,226
Here? No police came.

396
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,102
Are you sure?

397
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,189
These girls never arrived.

398
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,455
I'm looking for Laura Levi.

399
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,679
Okay. We'll see you later.
Okay?

400
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,066
I'm Kathy Bolkovac. I'm the new
Head of Gender Affairs.

401
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,481
I heard. Congratulations.
I'm Laura Levi.

402
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,104
What nationalities are
we dealing with here?

403
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,451
I presume these two women
want to be repatriated?

404
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,736
I don't know.

405
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:28,081
Actually, I brought them here because
they need medical attention.

406
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,242
We'll get them to the medical centre.

407
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,290
As soon as we get clearance,
we'll know where we stand.

408
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,297
Clearance? What does that mean?

409
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,301
Look, I'll do whatever
I can to help...

410
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,465
but I have to determine
if they'll cooperate...

411
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,555
with their repatriation program.

412
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,265
That's the only way
I can let them stay here.

413
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,180
It's not me, it's policy.

414
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,726
I see, policy. Okay. One more thing
I just wanted to ask you.

415
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,558
The other girls from
the raid were supposed to go...

416
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,185
to the Zenica Shelter
but they never arrived.

417
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:02,032
Really? Why don't you check
the IPTF message boards?

418
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,777
Listen, half the time
these raids are for show.

419
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,532
I'm sure the owner has paid off
whoever he had to by now.

420
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,750
Your missing girls are
probably back at the bar.

421
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,626
Excuse me now.

422
00:36:56,673 --> 00:37:01,042
-Murray, mind if I join you?
-Yes, have a seat.

423
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,387
-Not eating?
-No, I just have a quick question.

424
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,801
You know the raid you
ordered last night?

425
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,641
Local police said they were
taking the girls to Zenica...

426
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,431
but they never showed up.

427
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:18,107
Fucking mess! It's the locals
dragging us into their turf war.

428
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,318
Some cop from another
canton calls in a fake tip...

429
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,401
about a prostitution bust.

430
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,115
But the bar is legit and
the girls just waitresses. So...

431
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,775
Waitresses?

432
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,408
It doesn't hurt to be
thorough, though, right?

433
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,410
Yes, right.

434
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,625
Thing is I found padlocked rooms,
young women's passports...

435
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,247
and there was a lot of
US currency...

436
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,341
Where are we going,
Columbo?

437
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,430
I don't know, but something
fucked up is going on.

438
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,395
Honey, it's like I say,
this is Bosnia.

439
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,439
These people specialize
in fucked up.

440
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,109
And speaking of which...

441
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,075
we've got another re-housing goatfuck
in Gorazde, so catch you later.

442
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,193
See you later, guys.

443
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,407
Let's go.

444
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,332
Should have seen this place.

445
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,211
There were pictures all over
the walls of guys with those girls.

446
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,632
And almost every
single guy in there is ours.

447
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,226
I saw one of your guys there.

448
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,350
-You saw one of my guys there?
-Yes, he was wearing your flag.

449
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,143
You want to ask me something?

450
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,028
I guess I do.

451
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,360
Okay, listen...

452
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:54,029
I've heard about these places.
I know they exist.

453
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,701
I know my guys go up
there once in awhile.

454
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:00,042
I figured for strippers or sex.
I don't know, I haven't been there.

455
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,504
I know nothing about any girls
being locked up. What the fuck?

456
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,214
Okay.

457
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,170
I'm sorry.

458
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,641
At home...

459
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:27,192
I worked in a Precinct
where there were 25 guys.

460
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:33,485
And I knew them really well,
I knew every one of them.

461
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,080
I know their families.
I know everything about them...

462
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,413
and I trust them completely.

463
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,499
I was dumb enough to think...

464
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,345
I'd be joining some
elite police officers here.

465
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,679
But I don't know who
these people are.

466
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:08,687
Three, two, one, clear.

467
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,234
Kaufman!

468
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,320
-Is it okay for me to be here?
-Sure. Just wait there.

469
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,627
What's up? You finally come
and see me in action.

470
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,125
I live to see you in action.

471
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,087
This is for you.

472
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,262
I think Fred Murray's taking
payoffs from brothels.

473
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,513
And it's not prostitution.
The girls were trafficked.

474
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:48,565
The problem is, who investigates,
how to charge him?

475
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,238
All the international personnel
have immunity.

476
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,072
They can't be Prosecuted.

477
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,072
But this is good work, Bolkavac.

478
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,073
I think it might even deserve
a dinner out with yours truly.

479
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,082
Don't think I've earned that.

480
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,660
Girls, how are you doing?

481
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,539
Did you get some rest?

482
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,425
I went to the Florida Bar...

483
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,516
and I saw the room in the back and
I know what's been happening to you.

484
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,182
Good for you. Can we go now?

485
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,522
What happened to the girls?

486
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,188
Did you see my friend Luba?
Is she safe?

487
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,479
No.

488
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,733
The police took
the girls back to the bar.

489
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,533
But we can still help
your friend.

490
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:09,413
I believe the bar was raided
because Tanjo, the owner...

491
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,207
was refusing to pay
this man money.

492
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,710
Is that true?

493
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,974
Look, I know you're
scared to talk but...

494
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,642
if you can tell me that
this is the man then...

495
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,436
Then what?

496
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,438
You put him in jail?

497
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,522
No, he has diplomatic
immunity.

498
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,492
That means he's protected
by the UN.

499
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:46,534
But Tanjo can go to jail.
He can go to jail.

500
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,749
And if you both say
in a court...

501
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:55,167
that Tanjo has been taking
payoffs from this man...

502
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,499
then his name will go on record...

503
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,219
and the UN has to do
something.

504
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:05,052
They can't knowingly have one
of their men involved in rape...

505
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,469
kidnapping and torture.

506
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,594
How do you do this
if you work for the UN?

507
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,762
I'm an American police officer.

508
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,310
It doesn't matter who I work for...

509
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,649
I wouldn't let anybody
get away with this.

510
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:20,021
So if we go to court you promise
you can stop these men?

511
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,484
I can't promise I can stop
all these men. I promise...

512
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,487
If you cannot promise then
why do we agree?

513
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,500
There is too much danger
to go speak in a court, even this...

514
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,040
to say anything to you.

515
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,333
How do I know this is safe?

516
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,299
You're a smart girl.

517
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,396
I have a daughter.

518
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,311
She was taken away from me and...

519
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,609
I can't change that.

520
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,659
But maybe I can change
what happens to you.

521
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,382
-Will we be safe?
-Yes.

522
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,383
Do you promise?

523
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,184
I promise.

524
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,279
Hello.

525
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,696
I'm calling from the Global
Displacement Agency in Sarajevo.

526
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,285
Do you have a daughter
named Raysa?

527
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,201
- Yes. Yes.
- We have her here.

528
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,621
If everything checks out...

529
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:59,120
we will send her home
in a few days.

530
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,588
-I'll come there now.
-I'm sorry, we can't afford...

531
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,584
I'll pay for it.
Just tell me where to go.

532
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,766
Roman will be home soon.

533
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,237
Roman seems to be doing well.

534
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,230
Milk?

535
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,196
I need to borrow money.

536
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,125
They found Raya in Sarajevo.

537
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:43,001
I want to go and get her.
I don't need much.

538
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,677
Does he still hit you?

539
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,108
You know I hate to ask.

540
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,490
But she's my daughter...

541
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,615
and your niece. Please.

542
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,493
I will get you the money.

543
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,622
But you have to go.
Roman will be home soon.

544
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:28,546
He won't give it to me
if he knows it's for you.

545
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,571
You need an armored security
vehicle for two teenage girls?

546
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,490
-What the hell did they do?
-None of your business.

547
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,245
Okay, well, it's tough today.

548
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,284
They sent most of
our convoy up to Tesla.

549
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,248
-Found some war criminal.
-Shit!

550
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,038
I can push for end
of the week.

551
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,287
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

552
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,710
But I'll put it through.
You never know, right?

553
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:22,764
-Is Viko around?
-Viko, your girlfriend is here.

554
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,270
Come on, let's go.

555
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,273
The van just sits here.
It's no problem.

556
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:36,573
It is not armored like you want
but it's heavy like tank.

557
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,536
So it's okay.

558
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,580
They don't build them like this.
So we go straight to the safe house.

559
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:48,047
Here's the address. after they
make statement in court, yes?

560
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,086
I made the call, so it's okay.

561
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,768
Where is Irka?

562
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:06,349
-I need to have a word with you.
-Okay. Hey, Raya.

563
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,777
There was a problem.

564
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,615
During repatriation procedures
we realized Irka had no passport.

565
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:20,037
Okay, so we get her one.
Where is she?

566
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,498
You don't understand.
She was trafficked from Grozny.

567
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,370
Her parents were killed in Chechnya
and she has no documentation.

568
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,043
No embassy will recognize her.

569
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,415
She's a girl without a country.

570
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,419
Okay, you're not answering
my question. Where is Irka?

571
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,801
We handed her over to
the police a few hours ago.

572
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,096
How could you do that?
Viko, take Raya.

573
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,348
-So you meet us when you're done?
-Yes.

574
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,516
-Come on. Let's go.
-Raya, I'll see you soon, okay?

575
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,981
-It's okay.
-How could you do that?

576
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,269
I couldn't keep her. She
didn't have the paperwork.

577
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,365
-This is bullshit!
-Every case needs to be justified.

578
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:00,362
I know what you think
but it's an uninformed opinion.

579
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:04,536
-We have a system that works here.
-Really, for who?

580
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,120
Sorry, I look for Laura Levinia?

581
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,416
That's me.

582
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,011
Hey.

583
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,009
You know where they took her?

584
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,306
The police take them to the border.

585
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,436
Once they've crossed, there is one
less trafficking victim in Bosnia.

586
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,150
Take the 761 to Visegrad.

587
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:57,210
Hey, I'm looking for a girl.

588
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,177
The police dropped
her here a few hours ago.

589
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,637
Could you check the border logs?

590
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,677
She's 15 years old, no passport.

591
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:07,349
Okay. Lady, I know
what you look for.

592
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,727
Those girls do not go
through border.

593
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,690
They go through there.

594
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:17,112
To Serbia, if they survive.

595
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,689
Jesus.

596
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,481
Irka!

597
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,063
Leave me alone!

598
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,479
Go home!

599
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,573
Irka, please wait.

600
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,486
You promised.

601
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,700
Irka!

602
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,119
Stop doing that!

603
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,301
Please.

604
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,509
Just let me die.

605
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,306
I'm sorry. Irka, I'm sorry.

606
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,303
No.

607
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,022
It's okay.

608
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:40,275
Alright, alright.

609
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,216
It's okay. It will be over soon...

610
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,465
then you go home
with your mother, okay?

611
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,572
Where's the other girl?

612
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,202
She's not here. Let's go.

613
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,092
We'll do whatever
we can to get Raya back.

614
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,518
I'm truly very sorry.

615
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,456
What will they do to her?

616
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,122
What will they do to her?

617
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,293
I want to show you what happens
when you talk to the devil.

618
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:28,137
Now. Bring her in.
Bring her in.

619
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,096
Bring her in.
Bring her in.

620
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,643
Watch. Make sure
they are watching.

621
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,598
Open your eyes.

622
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,274
Watch! Watch!

623
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,394
Take a good look.

624
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:48,650
Look at your fucking friend no w.

625
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,475
What happened?

626
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,781
The car must have
been following us.

627
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,536
Do you know who they were?

628
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,200
No.

629
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:05,415
Nobody at my station
knew where I was going.

630
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,415
Did you tell anybody at IPTF?

631
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,590
Madeleine, I need to see you.

632
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,446
This is Peter Ward.

633
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,490
Hello.

634
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,614
Peter's an old friend,
Internal Affairs.

635
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,659
So, Kathy, have you had
any report on Raya?

636
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,286
None.

637
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:55,093
Kathy, from now on I want you to run
your investigation alongside Peter.

638
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,636
The best way to find Raya...

639
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,757
is to continue your investigation
into Fred Murray.

640
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,185
You handed in a vehicle
request to IPTF.

641
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,348
Yes.

642
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:09,479
Well, the traffickers obviously knew
where you'd be, so there's a leak.

643
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,487
I know that cops don't like
to work with Internal Affairs...

644
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,530
but considering what just
happened, it's our only way.

645
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,371
Well, I don't know how
to move forward.

646
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,498
I've lost two witnesses.

647
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,128
Raya, and Irka won't testify
now, she's too terrified.

648
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:42,137
Do you think Fred Murray is only
getting payoffs from one bar?

649
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,517
No.

650
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:49,686
So there could be other girls willing
to testify against Fred Murray.

651
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,229
It's possible.

652
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,729
Well, if you can get any of these
girls to testify in court then...

653
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,491
well, there'd be something quite
substantial to work with.

654
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,118
Agreed?

655
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,467
Thank you.

656
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:24,092
I don't want to put any of you
in a dangerous position...

657
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,593
and ask you to speak out
against your traffickers.

658
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,728
I just want to know if you
recognize this man.

659
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,117
Maybe give them some time.

660
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,408
I'll let you know...

661
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,625
if anyone says anything.

662
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,630
Okay.

663
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:03,472
Milena, would you show them
this photograph, too?

664
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,018
Just maybe someone has
heard something about her.

665
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,021
You look for this girl?

666
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,735
She is okay?

667
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,410
No. No, she's not.

668
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,250
Do you know her?

669
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,458
No.

670
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:53,222
But I know him.

671
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,274
He comes in the same group...

672
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:05,238
every month to take
money from Ivan.

673
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,452
-He came in a group?
-Yes.

674
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,203
I want to show you some
other photographs.

675
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:19,666
If you could tell me if any
of these people were in the group.

676
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,342
That is Paolo.

677
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,305
He liked pain.

678
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,391
He liked weird things.

679
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,601
He wanted me to like too...

680
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,317
This made my price go down.

681
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,279
I know then...

682
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,071
it will take me two more years
to pay my debt.

683
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:58,712
He buys girls for other men
and puts them in apartments.

684
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,171
Soldiers pay money to own
girls for themselves.

685
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,058
Check it out, three grand
and she's all mine.

686
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,636
Luc got one for 25 hundred.

687
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,604
Turn around, let me see your ass.

688
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,104
Take off your bra.

689
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:25,355
When we come through
checkpoint he drives the van.

690
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,028
-What?
- Him. He was the d river.

691
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:37,076
This man drove you in a van...

692
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,411
across the border...

693
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,081
into Bosnia?

694
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,425
Yes.

695
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,218
We stop at border.
See man in blue like you.

696
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:57,138
I thank God. I think
we have our saviour.

697
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,654
Then he jumps in
and drives the van.

698
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,706
Madeleine, they're
bringing them in.

699
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:23,163
IPTF are actually trafficking girls
and bringing them across the border.

700
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,671
And it's not just IPTF.

701
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,385
This involves all kinds
of internationals...

702
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,681
from military officers
to diplomats.

703
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,184
I thought I was only
going after one guy.

704
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,648
I had no idea what
I'd be handing over.

705
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,734
Get this off to Peter
as quickly as you can.

706
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,630
Are you sure you want
to go ahead with this...

707
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:09,296
because you know there'll be
no going back after?

708
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,303
Yes, ma'am.

709
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,513
Right.

710
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,470
You work in two hours.

711
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,026
You sleep on whichever
mattresses are free.

712
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,775
They bring us food in the morning.

713
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,078
You have to eat it all,
or you get fined.

714
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,534
Come sit down.

715
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,634
Don't let them see you like this.

716
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,340
Okay?

717
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,216
What is your name?

718
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,311
Raya Kochan.

719
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,395
I've nearly paid my debt.

720
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,281
Then I can go home.

721
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,323
-It's all bullshit.
-No.

722
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,615
He sent a girl back
three months ago.

723
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,621
I was here.

724
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,375
What is your name?

725
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,502
She is Luba.
Luba Pallch.

726
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:29,437
I'm afraid we can't keep
you here any longer.

727
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:35,188
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

728
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:44,573
We'll do anything we
can to get Raya back.

729
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,008
- Kathryn Bolkovac?
-Yes.

730
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,127
You're wanted
in Human Resources.

731
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,004
- Now?
-Yes, now.

732
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,404
-Sorry to keep you waiting there.
- No problem.

733
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,109
John Blakely.

734
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,199
Kathy Bolkovac.
Nice to meet you.

735
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,651
Have a seat.

736
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,156
-So you keeping busy?
-Yes.

737
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:31,662
Your superiors, they tell me
that you're working hard.

738
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,414
I enjoy my work.

739
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,127
You're dedicated, thorough.

740
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,253
Thank you.

741
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,673
Tough stuff, though, your area.

742
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,434
Stressful.

743
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,433
Do you ever worry about burnout?

744
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,188
No. Never.

745
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,445
You must miss your daughter.

746
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:11,456
It's unusual, isn't it, that a judge
would award custody to the father?

747
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:20,210
I would imagine there's almost
some kind of a stigma around that?

748
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,712
What did you want
to talk to me about?

749
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,517
I'm sorry. I just wondered.

750
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:33,231
Because we award
special paid leave to folks...

751
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,475
who work in stressful departments.

752
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:38,728
You know, parents especially,
we really encourage it.

753
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,073
And you'd have some time
to hang out with your daughter.

754
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:46,069
Nice little jaunt around
Europe, see the sights.

755
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,323
I'm going to have
to think about it.

756
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,167
You're not the maternal type?

757
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,786
Bitch.

758
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,246
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Go home before you get...

759
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,584
We're watching you...

760
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,207
You'd do better to shut
your mouth, you fucking...

761
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,254
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important.

762
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,302
And be careful. Make sure
you're not followed.

763
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:36,141
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important. And be careful.

764
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,105
Make sure you're not followed.

765
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,481
Fuck!

766
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,028
The world and its mother
knows about my investigation.

767
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,281
I know.

768
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,078
-Would you like something to drink?
-No.

769
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,750
-Do you mind if...
-Go ahead.

770
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,549
Kathy, Internal Affairs is
shutting down all your cases.

771
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,168
Why?

772
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,590
All of your files look like this.

773
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,103
Jesus.

774
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,397
I've been completely
steam-rolled.

775
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,561
They've sent Fred Murray
home on some kind of leave.

776
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,480
And top level military
commanders...

777
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,321
are walking into my office
and pulling your files.

778
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,739
I've never seen I.A.
over-ridden like this before.

779
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,699
Over-ridden by who?

780
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,160
I don't know.

781
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,370
I mean, I can't be sure.

782
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,374
It's the State Department.
Or Democra.

783
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,666
You do know what
they stand to lose if this...

784
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,293
I guess not.

785
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,592
Their contract in Bosnia
is worth millions.

786
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,555
Globally, just this year alone...

787
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,552
billions of dollars
in US government contracts.

788
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,554
And now you come along
with this scandal...

789
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,647
I don't want a scandal.
I'm just doing my job.

790
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,483
I know, but it doesn't matter.
Nobody cares about you.

791
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,497
I'll get you the rest of
your files back from I.A.

792
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,170
You get them out of here,
take them public.

793
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,634
Or this will never see
the light of day.

794
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:18,091
-I can't leave these girls.
-You're not helping them here.

795
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,013
And, frankly, you're not safe
to walk around.

796
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,602
It's completely exposed you.

797
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:26,646
Kathy, accidents do happen.
A car blows a tire, a mine explodes.

798
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,193
We don't have to report
civilian deaths.

799
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,742
I'll get you the rest of these...

800
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,488
and you get yourself the hell
out of here as soon as you can.

801
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,456
Trust me. This is
the right thing to do.

802
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:05,226
I was so stupid. I mean I thought
I could work inside the system.

803
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,642
Like I knew what the fuck
I was doing.

804
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,519
Like I knew how to play ball
with all these fancy diplomats.

805
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,567
I don't know. What would you do?

806
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,240
I have to go home.

807
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,700
My wife got a lawyer.

808
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,662
I have to go home for the kids.

809
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,252
I'm so sorry.

810
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,386
But I'm worried about you.

811
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,105
Don't be.

812
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,192
I don't want...

813
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,027
I don't want to leave you
in the middle of all this. And...

814
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,410
I don't want this to be the end.

815
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,048
Please be careful.

816
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,333
What is it?

817
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,171
-We have to get out of here...
-Don't...

818
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,544
You'll get us in trouble.

819
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,512
Go.

820
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,348
I want to take you home.

821
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,220
-Ivan!?
-Come.

822
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:14,601
How much do you want me to pay
for these girls, to take home?

823
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,398
-You want to take them home?
-Yes!

824
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,610
It's ten times normal.

825
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:22,484
It's three thousand each.
Sorry, not this one, she's trouble.

826
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,954
I'm sorry, sir.

827
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,038
So just this one?

828
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,287
You bring the girl back, I give
you the deposit back, okay?

829
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,333
Okay.

830
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,255
Come on. I'll get you a drink.

831
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,366
Sign at the bottom, please.

832
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,452
-Yes?
-It's Viko.

833
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,539
-I can't talk right now, Viko.
-I think I know where Raya is.

834
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,044
Okay.

835
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,662
We have a bit of a problem.

836
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,077
What kind of problem?
Where's the girl?

837
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,004
All right. All right.

838
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:50,631
There you go, Raya.

839
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,349
-What did she say?
-Names of girls. Raya.

840
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,264
Raya!?
Raya is there?

841
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,603
All right. Calm down, you're okay.

842
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,063
-We go to Oasis?
-Yes!

843
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,353
-And IPTF?
-Fuck protocol.

844
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,147
We just raid the bar.

845
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,156
Here.

846
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,375
-You trust these guys?
-Yes, I do.

847
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,586
-They're going to listen to you?
- Out!

848
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,417
You sure?

849
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,757
I do trust them. Let's go.

850
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,323
Hello?

851
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,796
We need to bring the owner out here.
We arrest him outside.

852
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,759
I don't want him
threatening the girls. Go!

853
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,247
Here we go, go! Go!

854
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,746
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

855
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:49,091
Ivan Bladzic has been arrested
for human trafficking.

856
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,209
Get out of here.

857
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,087
You don't have to be afraid
of Ivan. He can't hurt you.

858
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,512
We're going to get you somewhere
safe and help get you home.

859
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:00,474
Raya. Raya. Come on.

860
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,149
These girls work here.

861
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,650
They have all documents,
passports.

862
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:19,201
-And you can fuck off!
-Really?

863
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,242
Fakes. Bad ones.

864
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,414
And you, too, fuck off.
And you, too, fuck you!

865
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:27,538
Okay, Viko, get the blankets
out of the van...

866
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,414
and get these girls out of here.

867
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,508
Okay, girls, come on.
You're safe. Just come.

868
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,468
All right, come.

869
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,011
Let's go.

870
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,552
Don't be afraid, we can all
go now. Raya, come on.

871
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,550
It's going to be okay. All right?

872
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,098
Now. Come on, Raya.
Let's just...

873
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,147
Come on, what's the matter?
What?

874
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,100
What's the matter?
What's...

875
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,148
What the fuck are you
doing here?

876
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:53,147
-We got a call about this raid.
-From who?

877
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,655
Get out.

878
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,282
Get out! Come on, get out.
Get out! Out!

879
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,658
Get out right now!
Get out! Out!

880
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,377
-Get your hands off me.
-Fuck!

881
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,340
Don't look at these guys.
Don't be afraid of these guys.

882
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,467
Just say you want to go
and I can walk you...

883
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,387
Raya, I can walk you out
of here, right now.

884
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,178
You just have to say you
want to go, that's all.

885
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,388
Don't look at him.

886
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,392
Look at me. I want you
to look at me.

887
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,186
You are safe.

888
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:35,526
Listen to me, don't look at him.

889
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,734
Out of here!
Just get out! Fuck!

890
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,154
Okay, Raya, just look at me.
Look at me. Please.

891
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:48,331
Okay. Just say yes.
Just say yes.

892
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,078
It's all you have to do.

893
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:56,715
Raya, please. Just say
you want to go.

894
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,673
No.

895
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,349
Just say you want to go.

896
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,186
No.

897
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,567
Fuck! What the fuck is
the matter with you?

898
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,232
Don't you know anything!

899
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,451
We are supposed
to protect these people.

900
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:23,195
-You're a crazy bitch!
-We are supposed...

901
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,367
to protect these people.

902
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,622
-I know this girl.
-I know you do.

903
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,538
I know this girl.
I can't leave her here.

904
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,127
Let's go. Come on, Raya.
Let's go.

905
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:36,167
-I can't leave her here.
-Look at me! Kathy!

906
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:41,722
We cannot force them.
Nothing will hold up in court.

907
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,309
Please, understand. They will be
brought down here, punished.

908
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,728
You want blood on your hands?

909
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,233
-You fuck!
-Get the fuck out of here!

910
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,650
You piece of shit. You fuck!

911
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:59,649
What the fuck is the matter
with you people?

912
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:02,200
What is the matter with you?

913
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,067
My husband arranged
for me a job.

914
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,370
But his friend
bought me for $2,000.

915
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,413
With renewed funding from...

916
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,535
USAID the Global
Displacement Agency...

917
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:56,380
continues to be a pioneer at
international counter-trafficking.

918
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:59,420
My sister arranged for my papers.

919
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:04,096
Her boyfriend did this for
1 2 other girls.

920
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,431
Mostly traffickers prey
on those they know...

921
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,142
banking on the fact that
the girl will trust them.

922
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:13,355
Traffickers can be fathers,
brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles...

923
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,542
I wanted to tell you.

924
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,718
It's how you pay for this.

925
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:49,091
Roman, he does...

926
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,020
How could you...

927
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,109
sell your own blood?

928
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,607
You swine.

929
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:10,446
You swine.

930
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,161
You swine.

931
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,545
- Where is she?
-I don't know.

932
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,756
- Where is she?
-I don't know.

933
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:26,719
Where is she?

934
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,798
Where is she?
Where is she?

935
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,352
Where is she?

936
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,611
She is no longer your sister.

937
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:46,569
Stay away from me.

938
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:13,141
Where's Raya? Where's
the little bitch?

939
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,311
She's in the back.

940
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,434
I didn't say anything.

941
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,254
I didn't say anything.

942
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,261
Please...

943
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,052
Are you sure you want to see?

944
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,304
Excuse me.

945
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,581
Would you please cover her up?

946
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:11,175
Could you find a blanket, please?

947
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,386
Could you cover her up?

948
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:32,166
I am a police officer
obligated to report crimes.

949
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,669
I have taken statements from
women describing their physical...

950
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,422
psychological...

951
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,507
and emotional torture.

952
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:45,554
On arriving in Bosnia,
these women are sold...

953
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,233
and forced to provide
sexual services.

954
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,609
Their clientele consists of SPOR...

955
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,528
IPTF, local police...

956
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:00,410
and international employees.

957
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:05,582
Worse, they have become
in olved in the trade itself.

958
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:14,170
It is time each and
every one of you realize...

959
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:17,089
this is a serious organized crime...

960
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,305
with enormous profits.

961
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:27,729
We are peacekeepers who came
to protect the innocent...

962
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:32,276
but now prey upon them
in the worst ways possible.

963
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:39,691
We may be accused of thinking with
our heart instead of our heads...

964
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,280
but we will have our humanity.

965
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,624
Good morning.

966
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:33,336
I have to ask you to
surrender your ID.

967
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:35,380
What?

968
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,298
What's going on?

969
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,764
You've been ordered out
of this mission.

970
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,598
You can't be serious.

971
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,768
I'll need the ID.

972
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:06,119
-Thank you. Guys...
-Come on.

973
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,332
Why do you want to get rid of her?

974
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:19,253
Madeleine, I have to protect this
organization and so should you.

975
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:23,720
The UN is too fragile, too important.
That's what immunity is for.

976
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:27,215
Immunity not impunity.

977
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:31,136
The United Nations was formed
from the ashes of Auschwitz.

978
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:34,605
The United States led the way and
it's a point of honour with me...

979
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:38,644
that the UN is not
remembered for raping...

980
01:33:38,655 --> 01:33:41,397
the very people we must protect.

981
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:47,281
Those girls are whores of war.
It happens.

982
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,156
I will not dictate for morality.

983
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,367
So what are we dictating for?

984
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,245
I'll go to Washington. I'll go to
the State Department if I must.

985
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:59,419
Democra isn't even based out of the
States, it's based out of England.

986
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:02,421
It's a private corporation.
We work in the real world.

987
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,198
Thank you so much.
Really helpful.

988
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,083
I had to send that e-mail.

989
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,678
They killed Raya.

990
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:53,476
-They shot her in the head.
-I know.

991
01:34:56,482 --> 01:35:00,316
She wanted to testify and
they made an example of her.

992
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:04,521
I'm responsible for this.

993
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,483
No, dear, you're not.

994
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:11,744
I promised her I would
protect her.

995
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:20,294
Oh God, I can't stop
thinking about her mother.

996
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,629
How do we tell people
what's happening here?

997
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:31,472
Democra is registered in
the UK, in Britain.

998
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:37,512
So you are entitled
to appeal your dismissal.

999
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,732
We've got to get those files out
of the mission right away.

1000
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:48,524
Because you're a whistleblower,
so the press will want to know.

1001
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,487
I handed in my ID
and my keys.

1002
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,163
Shit!

1003
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,377
I don't know how
to get in there.

1004
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,415
We'll have to find a way.

1005
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,520
Zoe. Zoe!

1006
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,019
What are you doing here?

1007
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:28,984
I need to get something
out of my office.

1008
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,033
I was wondering if you
could get me a set of keys.

1009
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,658
Kathy, I can't.

1010
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,248
It's too risky.
I would lose my job.

1011
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,706
I wish I could help, I really do.

1012
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:48,090
I'm sorry. I'm just not like you.

1013
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:23,076
-You scared me.
-Sorry, I didn't recognize the coat.

1014
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:26,621
We don't have much time.

1015
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:49,106
I can't go up there with you.
You understand, right?

1016
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,148
Yes.

1017
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:52,693
Alright, now make
certain you get everything.

1018
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:56,238
And that includes any files you
didn't send to I.A. or to me.

1019
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:57,451
Yes.

1020
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:01,660
If anybody's going to believe this,
the press needs to see it all.

1021
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,497
Okay, I'll meet you
in the atrium, right.

1022
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,665
Okay.

1023
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,339
You're an asshole.

1024
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:45,097
You really didn't think you were
going to get away with this, did you?

1025
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,597
Those look right to you?

1026
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,151
Yes, it's all here.

1027
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,742
You're trespassing.

1028
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:06,239
So what? What are you going
to do, fire me again?

1029
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,333
You going to arrest me?
I have diplomatic immunity.

1030
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,748
Isn't that what you all rely
on around here?

1031
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:15,465
You had immunity. You don't
have a UN ID anymore.

1032
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:17,550
You're a civilian now.
You're on your own.

1033
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,253
I'm sure the State Department
will be happy to hear...

1034
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,346
-from me when I get back.
-Where do you think this comes from?

1035
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,181
The State Department
owns your contract.

1036
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,641
They don't want you here.

1037
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,761
Democra wants you out.

1038
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,357
You talk to whoever you want.
They're not listening.

1039
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,110
You're finished.

1040
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:20,404
Did you get what you need?

1041
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,654
The State Department
owns your contract.

1042
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,323
They don't want you here.

1043
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,530
Democra wants you out.

1044
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,287
You talk to whoever you want.
They're not listening.

1045
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:34,539
That's good.

1046
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:39,715
As soon as you get to London
take this right to the BBC, okay?

1047
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:43,757
-Thank you, Peter.
-Go.

1048
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:22,000
I can categorically state
not one United Nations officer...

1049
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:25,177
has been involved in
the trafficking of a single woman.

1050
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:28,548
You believe all these victims'
claims to be false?

1051
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,346
Well, I don't want to make
accusations against those girls.

1052
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:35,097
But I will assert over and over again,
I run a Zero Tolerance program...

1053
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:36,517
for that type of activity.

1054
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:39,767
Now we've just set up a full
taskforce dedicated to abolishing...

1055
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,145
all sex trafficking
in the region.

1056
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:51,324
Thank you.

1057
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:58,457
We spoke to Bill Hynes, the senior
UN official in Bosnia at the time.

1058
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:00,295
I saw that interview.

1059
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,460
And as you watched it,
what did you think?

1060
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:06,427
I think Mr. Hynes knows
that he made a false statement.

1061
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,130
So you're accusing
him of lying?

1062
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,591
Yes. Absolutely.

1063
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:15,223
We have considered
Democra's explanation...

1064
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,722
as to why they
dismissed Ms. Bolkovac...

1065
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,190
and there is no doubt
whatsoever...

1066
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,355
that the real reason
for her dismissal...

1067
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:24,570
was that she made
a protected disclosure...

1068
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,565
and accordingly
was dismissed unfairly.

1069
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:31,365
You smuggled files that belonged
to the UN out of the mission.

1070
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:35,035
Don't you think that was a rather
reckless thing to do?

1071
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:39,376
Those young women had put themselves
at great risk by confiding in me.

1072
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,372
And I led them to believe
that they would receive justice...

1073
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,589
but we let them down.

1074
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:48,044
So the least I can do is
let them be heard.

1075
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:57,600
Given everything
you've been through...

1076
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,271
would you do it again?

1077
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:02,433
Yes.

1078
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,439
Yes, I would.

1079
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,444
No doubt about it.

1
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,646
I'm on my way back
from Benny's.

2
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,117
I'm almost home.

3
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,910
You tell me where you are,
I'll come get ya.

4
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:09,025
Ha. I wouldn't say
I'm drunk.

5
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,430
Ha ha. Hello?

6
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,076
Are you still there?

7
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,303
OK.

8
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,059
# Tonight #

9
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,148
# Tonight, to-to-tonight #

10
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,287
# Well, all right #

11
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,327
# Tonight #

12
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,773
# Tonight #

13
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,291
# Wait, now #

14
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,642
# Wait #

15
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:46,749
# Now #

16
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,513
# Wait #

17
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,699
Ohh!

18
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:50,070
Oh, shit.

19
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:06,871
Shit.

20
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:32,024
A-Are you all right?

21
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:36,024
This is the fifth time
this year.

22
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,338
How many is it gonna take...

23
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,683
for the state
to put a fence up?

24
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:40,343
Which way'd it go?

25
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,329
Hmm?

26
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,934
The deer.

27
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:43,922
Where'd it go?

28
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:45,874
Oh. Uh...

29
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,684
I th... That way.

30
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,242
Oh, poor thing.

31
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,357
You sure you're all right?

32
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,731
Yeah, I'm fine.

33
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,357
I'm just a little
shaken up, that's all.

34
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,872
Hey, I have
my new cell phone with me.

35
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:03,987
I can call the police for you.

36
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,915
No! No, th-that's OK.

37
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,289
I, uh...

38
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,371
They're on their way already.

39
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,785
I'll call.

40
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,129
Chief's a friend of mine.

41
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,985
No, it's all right. You really
don't have to do that.

42
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:13,967
No, it's no trouble.

43
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,400
I pay for this thing.
I never use it.

44
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,483
I live just up the hill.

45
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,897
You're welcome to wait
there if you want.

46
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,345
No, thanks.
I told them I'd be here.

47
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,353
Yes. Calling about
another deer collision...

48
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:48,874
Musta leaped.

49
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,049
I'm sorry?

50
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,710
There's no damage
to your radiator.

51
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,432
Usually, you'd be pickin'
kneecaps outta your grill.

52
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,638
Are you injured?

53
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,683
Heh. No, sir.

54
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,662
You had anything
to drink tonight?

55
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,041
Nope.

56
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,756
I'll need your license
and registration.

57
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,795
Of course.

58
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,489
I don't have
my license on me.

59
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,043
I must have left it at home.

60
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:28,236
It's unlawful to operate a
motor vehicle without a license.

61
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,222
I have one.

62
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,793
I just... I left it.

63
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,743
Forgot it.

64
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:33,865
Your name's Jack Levin?

65
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:34,854
Levine.

66
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,239
Levine?

67
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,964
You're the owner
of this vehicle?

68
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,009
That is correct.

69
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,344
Mr. Levine, would you object
to a breathalyzer?

70
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,659
I prefer a sobriety test.

71
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:49,998
That's your right.

72
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,527
Please step out of the car.

73
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,881
Sober up. You can do this.

74
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,297
Right back here.

75
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,119
Recite the alphabet backwards.

76
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,099
Um...

77
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,509
Go ahead.

78
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:19,113
Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T...

79
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,190
Um...

80
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,532
S-R-Q...

81
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:29,861
P-O-N-M-L-K-J-l-H...

82
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:37,604
# G-F-E-D-C-B-A #

83
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,415
You want me to walk
a straight line or anything?

84
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,762
No, that won't be necessary.

85
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:43,942
OK.

86
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,803
Wait here.

87
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,346
Mr. Levine...

88
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:08,900
your license to drive
was revoked three months ago...

89
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,346
following a D.U.I. charge.

90
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,095
I'm placing you under arrest
and impounding your vehicle.

91
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:14,789
Oh, please, not the car.

92
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:16,255
Turn around, place
your palms flat on the trunk.

93
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:18,656
Right now.

94
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,479
Sorry about the tie.

95
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:26,496
Out of cuffs.

96
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,062
What's in the trunk?

97
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,446
You need a warrant
to look in the trunk.

98
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:37,471
I know the law.

99
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,757
Oh, really?

100
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:41,127
So then you know the term
"exigent circumstance"?

101
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,894
There's nothin' in there
but an old tarp.

102
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,943
See?

103
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:58,844
You sick fuck.

104
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,294
I...

105
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,375
You think just because
you didn't shoot her...

106
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,757
you can cart her off?

107
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,700
Her?

108
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,815
I don't see any antlers, do you?

109
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,026
It's not even season yet.

110
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,918
Well, I didn't think
it should go to waste.

111
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,503
I mean, I know venison
is expensive, but Jesus.

112
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,703
She's messed up really badly.

113
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,691
I don't think
you want to look at...

114
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:18,716
Did I ask you?

115
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,323
Got her wedged in here
pretty good.

116
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,011
Fuck!

117
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,803
L-Car-1 to dispatch, over.

118
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:41,535
Go ahead, George.

119
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:43,939
Overpass collision
not a deer, but a man.

120
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,379
Repeat, a man.

121
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,387
Locate next of kin for...

122
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,697
name: Aaron Lewis.

123
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,871
Lima, Echo, Whiskey,
India, Sierra.

124
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:54,428
Driver in custody.
Request assistance.

125
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,224
Jesus, you're having
a rough night.

126
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,721
I'll get on the horn.
Sit tight.

127
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,869
You have the right
to remain silent.

128
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:02,208
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

129
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,191
You have a right
to an attorney.

130
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,249
I waive my Miranda rights.

131
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,240
What?

132
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,461
I waive my Miranda rights.

133
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,481
I'm sick of hearin' 'em.

134
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:09,790
Fine. Third time tonight.

135
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,103
I'm gettin' pretty
sick of 'em, myself.

136
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,054
Move over. You got company.

137
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,878
I was here first.

138
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:15,862
This isn't a cab.

139
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:16,986
Just shut up and move over.

140
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,586
There isn't any room.

141
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,706
Why don't you put him in front?

142
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,208
I need you to move
over right now.

143
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,624
I gotta put someone else
back here. Move over.

144
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,901
Duffy, can you move over?

145
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:24,886
Make some room.

146
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,336
I'm trying.

147
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,511
Fuck!

148
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,949
Duffy, come on!

149
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:15,514
Ohh!

150
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:20,596
Frank?!

151
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:25,461
Oh, it's you.

152
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,404
Have you seen my husband?

153
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,300
I sent him to look
for the deer.

154
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,828
I have to find him right away.

155
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:32,817
Can you help me?

156
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,289
I really have to get home.

157
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:35,925
Please? Something terrible...

158
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,225
Frank?

159
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,216
Uhh.

160
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,209
I'm OK.

161
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,234
Frank!

162
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,157
Frank, where are you?

163
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,088
This can't be happening.

164
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,581
What happened?

165
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,789
Chief, uh...

166
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,924
Garvey called.

167
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,797
My only child...

168
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,832
has been hit by a car.

169
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,644
They just called?

170
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,721
Right after I came home...

171
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:28,787
just, um... a few minutes
after I left you.

172
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:39,918
You...

173
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,302
Freeze!

174
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,637
Please step back, ma'am.

175
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,647
I tried to help you.

176
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:46,768
It was an accident.

177
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:48,084
Ma'am, step away.

178
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,647
Some goddamn deer!

179
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,964
It all happened so fast.

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,177
Let me handle this! Ma'am!

181
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,328
Are you drunk?

182
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:56,494
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,147
Ma'am, ma'am!

184
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,653
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

185
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:01,643
Calm down!

186
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:03,093
I'll kill you!

187
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:17,804
Aah! Uhh!

188
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,373
Ohh.

189
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:24,075
Huh? Huh?

190
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,518
Don't move!

191
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,178
You'll burn...

192
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:37,228
for what you did
to my daughter.

193
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,839
Daughter?

194
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,795
#... Just had
a heroin injection #

195
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,525
# Big slam
like you're droppin'... #

196
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,194
You're such a dick!

197
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:26,702
- Glad you could make it, Timmy.
- Dumbass.

198
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,882
Turn the fucking music down.

199
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:28,903
Shut up.

200
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:33,061
What'd you guys bring?

201
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,087
Well, observe.

202
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,956
Ahh, ahh...

203
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,901
Ohh, uhh...

204
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:43,181
ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh...

205
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,191
ohh, ohh, ahh...

206
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,792
What is that?

207
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:47,944
Ready?

208
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:51,363
Yes!

209
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,196
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

210
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,246
I am a god.

211
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,236
That's pretty sweet.

212
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,166
Except that's our first sign
he's hit all fuckin' night.

213
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,409
You can shut up now.

214
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,007
Now, what's with the books?

215
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,068
You're gonna burn a book?

216
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,524
It's not like this is great
fucking literature or anything.

217
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,355
I'm doing the world a favor.

218
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,365
Just don't light that shit
in my car, all right?

219
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,698
Shit.

220
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,400
Now, come on, man!

221
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:18,339
Aah! Jesus, Eddie!
Come on, God!

222
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:20,170
Dude, you just broke my box.

223
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,864
Yeah, well, your mom
told me that last night.

224
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:22,883
Gimme.

225
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,027
Lighter.

226
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:30,914
OK. See, what you gotta do
is crumple the pages...

227
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:32,811
so you can get
the air in there, OK?

228
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,916
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

229
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:35,905
Check this out.
Check this out.

230
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,442
Look, look, look, look.

231
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:40,428
Yeah!

232
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:44,486
Sorry!

233
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,930
How the fuck did
you pass your driving test?!

234
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,036
Hey, listen, Tim, if you're
gonna keep complaining...

235
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:49,766
we're just gonna
take your ass home, OK?

236
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:50,752
So shut the fuck up.

237
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,071
Try it now. All right.

238
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,785
Get it! Get it right...
Get it right up here.

239
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:56,834
Get it right there.

240
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,823
Ohh, shit!

241
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,906
Open the window!
Open the window!

242
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,335
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

243
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,628
Aah! Fuck me, man!
That was my head!

244
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,942
All right, new fuckin' rule.

245
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:10,279
No more of that shit,
all right?! Cut it out.

246
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,361
I gotta piss.

247
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,249
- How many of those have you had?
- Like, four.

248
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,288
Just hold on, all right? Wait'll
we get through the center...

249
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,988
and then I'll find a place
to pull over.

250
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:20,196
No, no time.

251
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:21,543
What the fuck are you doing?

252
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:22,657
What does it look like
I'm doing?

253
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:23,646
You're kidding me, right?

254
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,096
No! Just hangin' out!

255
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,078
You're fucking kidding me,
dude.

256
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,069
We need
to freshen out the van.

257
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,381
Jesus. No, no, no, no,
fuckin' no!

258
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,365
Yes!

259
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:31,783
# Yeah #

260
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:32,831
Ha ha ha ha ha!

261
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,497
Will you fucking cut it out?!

262
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,510
Look! You're gettin' it
all over my fuckin' car!

263
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:37,829
Spank it! Spank it!

264
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:46,783
Shit. What the fuck
just happened?

265
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,165
Who'd you...

266
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:57,918
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no...

267
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,300
Ohh, fuck.

268
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:01,822
What did you do, dude?

269
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,001
She's... She's...
She's gonna be OK.

270
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,459
She's gonna be fuckin' OK. Fuck!

271
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,104
Oh, fuck!

272
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,956
Oh, fuck, go! Go!

273
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,018
Oh, fuck! Oh, my God!

274
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,622
Oh! Ohh! Oh!

275
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,609
Oh, my God.

276
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,343
Is everybody all right? Ohh!

277
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,676
Oh, fuck!

278
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,083
Oh, Jesus.

279
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:35,835
Stop the car.

280
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,566
Are you fucking nuts?!

281
00:19:37,604 --> 00:19:39,676
I'm not stopping
this fucking car!

282
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:40,196
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?!

283
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:40,959
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?!

284
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,712
Never touch this fucking wheel!

285
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:45,024
Calm down!

286
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,954
My mom doesn't even know
I have the goddamn car!

287
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:55,355
Hey, keep pressure on it.

288
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,280
Here, here, here,
no, it's OK...

289
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,070
Here, here, here, here. OK.

290
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,398
Holy shit! He's shot!

291
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,768
No, man, his dick got...

292
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,078
Fuck me.

293
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,706
We gotta get him
to the hospital.

294
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:16,727
No.

295
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,973
What do you mean no, Eddie?

296
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,057
Jesus, look at you.

297
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:22,780
We have to go back
and get it first.

298
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,435
Eddie, you're bleeding
pretty bad.

299
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:28,058
Maybe we should just
take you to the hospital.

300
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:32,439
l... I don't want
to live like this!

301
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,757
Please.

302
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,992
We're going back.

303
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,658
What the fuck?!

304
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,867
We were... We were
just fucking shot at!

305
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:40,886
We're going back!

306
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,870
I am not going back there, Tim!

307
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:44,471
Come on, man!
Look at him!

308
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,935
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

309
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:53,626
Hey. Don't worry, all right?

310
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:54,611
I'm gonna find it.

311
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,477
Hurry.

312
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:03,827
Tim, it's been cut off.

313
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,819
They can reattach it.

314
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,040
Well, how the fuck
are they gonna do that?

315
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,026
What am I, a surgeon?

316
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,142
They use leeches and shit.

317
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,076
This is so stupid!
What about the cops?!

318
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,230
Just be here
when I get back!

319
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,825
Fuck.

320
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:38,963
That was fast.

321
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:45,433
Hey, Kev, you want
to grab me a cover for her?

322
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,306
Want to grab me a cover, Kev?

323
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:51,314
Yeah, you got it.

324
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,210
Where do we put it?

325
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,486
Uh, they're in the front.

326
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,504
Got it.

327
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,650
Here's the license.
Call it in.

328
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,606
Shit. I used to baby-sit her.

329
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:10,519
Call it in, Kevin.

330
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:11,536
OK.

331
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,943
What happened?

332
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:19,221
It was a hit-and-run.

333
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,879
Need any help?

334
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,051
Ha. I got it. Thank you.

335
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,492
Ready? One, two, three.

336
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:34,510
Got it.

337
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,321
Whoa. You OK, Kev?

338
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,919
I don't feel so hot.

339
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,846
We got a frozen dick we gotta
get to the hospital, man.

340
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,023
I know, I know, I know.

341
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:54,990
Listen, it happens to everybody
the first time.

342
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,004
Here. You want a smoke?

343
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,508
Yeah, thanks.

344
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,624
Ohh, gross.

345
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:14,635
We're sorry.

346
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,746
You know something about this?

347
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,263
Friend of yours lose something?

348
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:24,785
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,576
Yeah? Then what the fuck
are you doin' in there?

350
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:28,521
I just...

351
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:29,993
need a new cooler.

352
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,149
You should just
tell me the truth.

353
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:32,137
I am.

354
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,732
I'm a klepto.

355
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:36,179
Dr. Fowler says that
I'm makin' progress...

356
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,218
but I still have
a long way to go.

357
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,405
What, do you think
this is funny?

358
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:41,068
I never said it was funny.

359
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,732
This kid's full of shit.

360
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

361
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:45,863
Home.

362
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,401
No, you're not.
Come with us.

363
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:48,687
Yeah. The cops are gonna
want to talk to you.

364
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,097
I didn't do anything.

365
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,756
There's a person
in this ambulance...

366
00:23:51,795 --> 00:23:53,005
and she's dead...

367
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:54,319
and I think
you're the reason why.

368
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:04,874
Where's my daughter?
Where's Cheri?

369
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:07,975
Fuck!

370
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,832
Ecch.

371
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:34,372
Go! Go!

372
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:35,822
Oh, shit!

373
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,129
Go, go, go, go!

374
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,542
Jump in! Jump in, Tim!

375
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,497
Are you OK?
Are you all right?!

376
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,852
Did you get it?

377
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:54,054
Did you get it?

378
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,581
Don't say
I never did anything for you.

379
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,239
Oh, shit! Cops!

380
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,451
Don't worry. He's busy.

381
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,287
Sorry it took me so long, man.

382
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,463
I was lookin'
for something bigger.

383
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:18,273
Oh, hey...

384
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,778
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,959
Even if they put it back on...

386
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:24,135
it's not gonna
work the same.

387
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:27,587
Sure, it will.

388
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:29,929
Your dick's like Timex, dude.

389
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,620
We're gonna have to
go to the police, man.

390
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,546
Well, that's easy
for you to say, Tim.

391
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,756
You weren't the one
that was driving.

392
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,287
Well, what do you want
to do, Mark?

393
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,203
We can't just skip town.
He saw our faces.

394
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:52,486
Well, I'm not saying that.

395
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:55,042
I'm just saying
let's get our story straight.

396
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:56,064
OK?

397
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,039
OK.

398
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,253
OK. Um...

399
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,940
OK, Eddie was
pissin' out the window.

400
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:07,109
OK, yeah, Eddie was
pissin' out the window...

401
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:12,415
but, uh, but I never
turned around, ya know?

402
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:14,464
I never turned around.
I was never hitting him...

403
00:26:14,504 --> 00:26:16,293
and... and she just
ran out in front of me...

404
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:18,401
and I didn't have time
to stop.

405
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,349
OK.

406
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,814
Did you hear that, Eddie?
I never hit you.

407
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:25,474
Why should I lie?

408
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:30,624
Wh... What are you
talking about?

409
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:33,565
Why should I lie
when this is all your fault?

410
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,974
My fault? How the fuck
is this my fault?

411
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:38,909
Well, if ya hadn't been so
worried about your paint job...

412
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,609
my penis would be
in my pants right now...

413
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,338
and not in my fucking hand!

414
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,148
If you hadn't have been pissin'
out the goddamn window...

415
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:47,556
none of this
would have happened!

416
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,538
Guys, calm down.

417
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,077
No, you stay out of this, Tim!

418
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,867
Now, listen, I'm not going
to jail over your little dick...

419
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,724
so you can either say
I didn't hit you...

420
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:57,311
or you can bleed
to death for all I care!

421
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,422
Say it!

422
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,881
You didn't hit me.

423
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:41,180
Its expandable
stomach allows the Komodo...

424
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:44,218
to devour up to eighty percent
of its body weight...

425
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:45,852
in a single meal.

426
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,423
Mulligan, come on.

427
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,850
You have a good nap, boy?

428
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,897
We're gonna go
for a little walk.

429
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,963
No, no, no, no.

430
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:58,588
Oh, my God.

431
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:03,164
Oh, Cheri, oh, God,
what have you done?

432
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:15,545
Oh, you little pervert.

433
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,914
You left her no choice,
didn't you?

434
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,398
No.

435
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:24,784
No, I will not see you
ruin her life.

436
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:26,289
No.

437
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,844
OK, what do we do? Ohh.

438
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,507
No. Come on.

439
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:53,484
Stay.

440
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:56,523
Stay, stay. Stay, boy.

441
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:32,169
Oh, no.

442
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,553
Freakin' imports!

443
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,256
OK.

444
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:59,082
Oh, God.

445
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,559
Ohh...

446
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:14,063
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.

447
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:15,176
Please. Shit! Shit!

448
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,726
Oh, no. Son of a...

449
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,654
Stay. Stay.

450
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,541
OK.

451
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,545
Don't be
looking at me like that.

452
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,413
Cheri going to jail is
not gonna change anything.

453
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:19,240
The guy's dead.

454
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:24,424
Oh, my God.

455
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,408
Oh, that's better.

456
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:41,600
Stupid little shits!

457
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,537
Oh, my God.

458
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:51,682
God almighty.

459
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,275
Assholes.

460
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:38,076
Mulligan!

461
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,198
Mulligan, get down!

462
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:40,864
Mulligan.

463
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:57,340
OK.

464
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:33,600
Oh, Lord, please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

465
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,576
OK.

466
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:58,040
Mulligan!

467
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,543
Mulligan, get over here.

468
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,268
Mulligan, come.
Mulligan, come here now.

469
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,756
Mulligan, come now.

470
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,793
Mulligan, come here.

471
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:13,847
That's my baby boy.

472
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,797
That's a good boy.
Come here.

473
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,879
Come here.
Yes, sweetheart.

474
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,024
No. No. No. No.
Come back, you dog.

475
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,786
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.

476
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,894
Mulligan. Mulligan.
That's a good boy.

477
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:34,422
OK, dog, give me that thing.

478
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:49,755
Mulligan, come on!

479
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,005
There you are.

480
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,545
Ah, shit! Oh, shit!

481
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,173
Shit.

482
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,449
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

483
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:09,556
Mulligan.

484
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:12,083
Dog, I oughta rip you
a new asshole.

485
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:13,946
You bad dog.

486
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:15,768
Bad dog.

487
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,363
Now, where is it?

488
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:23,639
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.

489
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,300
Come on.

490
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:15,181
Frank?

491
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,787
Honey, what are you doing?

492
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:27,605
Well, l... I...

493
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,834
I caught these punk kids running
around, starting fires...

494
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,204
so I scared 'em off.

495
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:34,285
And, uh...

496
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:39,059
I was just trying to kick
this fire into the sewer.

497
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:41,134
Be careful. You don't wanna be
hurtin' your back now.

498
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,864
Oh, God, I know.

499
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,225
Hop in. You look tired.

500
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:47,920
Uh...

501
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,090
Come on, Mulligan.

502
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,246
Sit.

503
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,597
Oh, hi.

504
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,772
So, how was your night?

505
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:06,957
OK.

506
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:09,008
Just OK?

507
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:10,956
Yeah.

508
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:14,545
I wonder what happened.

509
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,600
Oh, that reminds me.

510
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:20,105
Another deer got hit tonight.

511
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:21,834
Really? Where?

512
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,882
Same spot just down
from our house.

513
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,515
Happened a few minutes ago.

514
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:27,693
So it ran into our woods...

515
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,065
and I want you to go see
if he's still alive.

516
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,041
Frank?

517
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,634
Huh? Um...

518
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:35,655
Yeah, OK.

519
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:39,112
Mulligan,
what have you been eating?

520
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,815
- Hit the lock.
- Ah.

521
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,734
Come on out, young fella.

522
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,463
Oh, thanks. Hey, you.

523
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:09,804
- You got him?
- Yeah.

524
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,814
Oh, here, here, here.
Take this.

525
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,125
'Cause if the deer's still alive
I don't wanna spook him.

526
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,436
Who could that be
at this hour?

527
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:19,113
OK, I'll see you later.

528
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,133
OK.

529
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,924
OK.

530
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,181
# OK, what is it tonight? #

531
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,358
# At least just tell me
what the hell is wrong #

532
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,155
# Do you want to eat? #

533
00:41:41,193 --> 00:41:42,175
# Do you want to sleep? #

534
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:43,461
# Do you want to drown? #

535
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:47,010
# Just settle down,
settle down, settle down #

536
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:52,511
Hey, Duff.

537
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,494
What's going on?

538
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:55,943
Not much.

539
00:41:57,672 --> 00:41:58,850
You want me
to lock up for you?

540
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,896
Yeah. It's about that time.

541
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:16,863
How was your shift?

542
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,691
Fucking boring.

543
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:21,214
Whole goddamn town
shuts down at nine o'clock.

544
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:23,811
What else is new?

545
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:35,163
Are you OK?

546
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,859
You don't look so good.

547
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,215
I got a call this morning.

548
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:42,464
From who?

549
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,450
Cheri.

550
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:44,638
So?

551
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:46,652
She's pregnant.

552
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,343
Are you sure it's yours?

553
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,060
Of course it's mine!

554
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:01,277
Whose the fuck else
would it be?

555
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:02,264
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

556
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:03,649
Don't worry about it.

557
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,113
Just, it's fine.

558
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:06,562
What are you gonna do?

559
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:07,610
What do you think?

560
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,080
She's gotta get
an abortion, right?

561
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:11,098
That's expensive.

562
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:12,546
Well, no shit,
it's fuckin' expensive.

563
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:13,756
That's my problem.

564
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,083
How much?

565
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:18,978
Five hundred dollars.

566
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,029
Guess a two-dollar condom's
lookin' pretty good...

567
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,244
right about now.

568
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:26,492
That's just it.

569
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,839
We were always safe.

570
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,118
I don't know how
this could've happened.

571
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:34,844
There's not much point
in worrying about it now.

572
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,834
We're closed.

573
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:42,174
Well, he's in there.

574
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:43,616
He works here.

575
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:44,958
Please. We'll be really fast.

576
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:46,007
I promise.

577
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:48,925
Come on.

578
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,389
Duff, I cashed out already.

579
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:55,446
- You're a prince.
- Thanks.

580
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,546
Those doughnuts are old.

581
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,339
Doesn't matter.

582
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,601
4.89.

583
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,614
What's in there?

584
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:18,941
Uh, Bong Water. Six.

585
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,883
9.48.

586
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:23,577
Keep the change.

587
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:27,603
You want one?

588
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:28,824
Yeah, they're old.

589
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:32,794
Blah!

590
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:42,167
She got any money?

591
00:44:42,205 --> 00:44:44,180
No. Her dad
buys her everything...

592
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:45,563
and this is
obviously one bill...

593
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,090
that she doesn't
want him to see.

594
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:48,955
Well, what about you?

595
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,606
I blew my wad on
the new transmission last month.

596
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:53,368
So what are you gonna do?

597
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:55,793
Well, that's what I've been
thinking about all day.

598
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:59,349
I could ask my dad,
but there's just no way.

599
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:01,526
I thought about asking Lloyd
for an advance...

600
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:02,610
but you know how he is.

601
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:03,634
Yeah.

602
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:05,498
So that only leaves one thing.

603
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:10,386
I'm gonna rob this place.

604
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:13,685
Yeah, right.

605
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,552
No way.

606
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:20,243
No fucking way.

607
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:22,355
Lloyd finds
one bill missing...

608
00:45:22,394 --> 00:45:24,630
and he's gonna fire me,
and I need this job.

609
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,706
My sister's sick.
You know that.

610
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:30,161
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I don't have a choice.

611
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:32,274
Well, take it on your own shift.

612
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,223
I can't.
She needs the money tomorrow.

613
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,280
Why?

614
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,881
Because her parents
are gonna be gone all day.

615
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:38,230
It's the only time she can go.

616
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,720
Well, she's just
gonna have to wait.

617
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:42,900
You're not taking any money
from here tonight...

618
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:44,398
and that's that.

619
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,282
I don't believe this.

620
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:53,360
Please, Buzzy,
just give me the money?

621
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,821
You gonna shoot me, huh?

622
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:57,271
Buzzy.

623
00:45:59,128 --> 00:46:01,037
Would you shoot Cheri
if I needed money?

624
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:02,061
Oh, come on.

625
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:03,281
Why do you always
have to do this?

626
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:04,366
Well, would you?

627
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:06,578
Just tell Lloyd you were robbed.
Is that so hard?

628
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,688
I'm a bad liar.

629
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:11,028
But you won't be lying.

630
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,950
It's not like he's
got surveillance or anything.

631
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:15,470
He's been looking
for a reason to fire me anyway.

632
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:22,709
Are you gonna give me
the money or not?

633
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:25,362
Look...

634
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,307
you know I wanna help you.

635
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,389
Don't ask me to do this.

636
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:30,836
Melinda's got no insurance.

637
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,877
She needs
every dollar we've got.

638
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:37,039
Just... Come on. Just...

639
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:38,986
No. You do what you gotta do...

640
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,076
but I'm not gonna
open up this drawer.

641
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:45,484
God. Damn it.

642
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:49,259
Look at me.

643
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,982
Why, so you can
shoot me in the face?

644
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,743
Come on. Just look at me.

645
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:57,902
God damn it,
you're so stubborn!

646
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:01,169
Lloyd's an idiot
if he fires you!

647
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:03,210
Christ, he should
make you the manager!

648
00:47:03,923 --> 00:47:05,329
Jesus.

649
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:13,351
Hey.

650
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:15,882
Hey. I gotta talk to you.

651
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,850
OK.

652
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:27,051
Be right back.

653
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:37,193
What's up?

654
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:39,654
Did you get the money?

655
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:41,576
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

656
00:48:41,612 --> 00:48:42,757
I didn't mean to.

657
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,323
Why?!

658
00:48:44,364 --> 00:48:45,541
I didn't mean anything.

659
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,238
Give me that fucking thing.

660
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,653
Better get you out of here.

661
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:54,626
I'm dead.
I'm... I'm so dead.

662
00:48:56,907 --> 00:48:59,558
Hey, could I borrow your jacket?
It's cold out.

663
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:01,537
Yeah.

664
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:11,623
I love you.

665
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:20,838
All right, you can
blame this on the robber.

666
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,019
Say he shot and missed.

667
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:23,006
Will you stop thinking
about your own problem...

668
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,998
for one minute?

669
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,252
I'm trying to save my job!

670
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:27,525
Buzzy, I am saving your job.

671
00:49:27,561 --> 00:49:28,543
Think about it.

672
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:30,592
The cops are probably
on their way already.

673
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,350
How much cash
is in the register?

674
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:35,010
1,200 and change.

675
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,942
Duffy, no.

676
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,056
You're not thinking.

677
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:43,104
You're not thinking
things clearly here, OK?

678
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:44,900
This way, you get
to keep your job...

679
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:48,581
and then seven hundred dollars
goes straight to Melinda.

680
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:57,310
Good.

681
00:50:03,623 --> 00:50:05,478
No, just take it all.
I'll get mine later.

682
00:50:07,846 --> 00:50:11,774
Wait. One thing you have
to do for me before you go.

683
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:13,822
- What?
- Shoot me.

684
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,007
What?!

685
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:18,908
Lloyd will know
I'm lying in a second.

686
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,193
But if you shoot me...

687
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,618
I'm hurt, he can't
ask any questions.

688
00:50:22,662 --> 00:50:23,807
Are you out of your mind?

689
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:25,503
No, I'm serious, Duffy.

690
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:26,948
I need this job.

691
00:50:27,973 --> 00:50:28,955
I can't!

692
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:29,979
Duffy?

693
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:31,231
No. No.

694
00:50:32,165 --> 00:50:33,627
I'll tell Cheri
about that time last summer.

695
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:38,786
You wouldn't.

696
00:50:49,475 --> 00:50:50,752
All right.

697
00:50:52,995 --> 00:50:54,010
All right.

698
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,801
Um, wait. No. Go over here.

699
00:50:56,835 --> 00:50:59,868
That way it'll look like
it's a real robbery, you know?

700
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:01,151
All right, good thinking.

701
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,936
All right. OK.

702
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,919
All right.

703
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,490
Where do you want it?

704
00:51:09,954 --> 00:51:11,361
In my arm.

705
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:13,281
Wait. I'm right-handed.
Here. My left arm.

706
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:14,296
All right.

707
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,072
Here.

708
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:19,095
There?

709
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:20,544
Yes. You can't shoot
through my arm.

710
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,066
- All right, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

711
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:25,309
- OK, right here.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

712
00:51:25,345 --> 00:51:27,287
You ready?

713
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:28,278
You ready?

714
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:30,077
Ow! God.

715
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:32,982
Ow? That's nothing compared
to what it's gonna feel like.

716
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:34,453
Have you thought about
what it's gonna feel like?

717
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:35,478
It's gonna hurt.

718
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:37,626
Go.

719
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:38,679
Ready?

720
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,585
Goddamn it!
I can't fucking do it!

721
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:48,031
It's the worst idea
you ever had!

722
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,656
Duffy, you have to do this.

723
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:50,644
I can't do it.

724
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,182
As my friend, just do it.

725
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:53,783
I want you to do it.

726
00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:56,345
Just make it quick
before I think.

727
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:57,365
All right.

728
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,000
We'll do it on three, OK?

729
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:00,565
Yeah. Yeah!

730
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:02,013
Three... three... three...

731
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:03,421
- You ready?
- Yeah.

732
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,429
One...

733
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,419
Ow! Ow!

734
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:08,153
Oh, my God!
I'm so fucking sorry!

735
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,139
I'm so fucking sorry!

736
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:11,734
Ow! You said on three!

737
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:13,683
I thought you might flinch.
I didn't wanna hit the bone.

738
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:15,995
What can I do?
I'm really sorry.

739
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,207
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean...

740
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:19,100
Then get me
something for my arm!

741
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:22,931
OK. I'm sorry.

742
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:26,322
Oh, God.
Oh, God, does it hurt?

743
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:27,347
Yes!

744
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:31,480
This was your idea!
It's not working!

745
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,491
Give it to me!
Get the phone!

746
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:34,613
OK, the phone. Why?

747
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,179
9-1-1.

748
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,627
I can't call 9-1-1.
I'm not supposed to be here.

749
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,871
Well, then, get it for me!

750
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:40,250
OK. It's not here.

751
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:41,364
The phone's not here!

752
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:42,713
Where's the fucking phone?!

753
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:45,366
The pager! Hit the pager!

754
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,242
Ow! Oh!

755
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:51,959
What the hell did you
put it over here for?!

756
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:55,061
Who puts the fucking phone
on the fucking shelf?

757
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,041
Ow!

758
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:59,254
OK, here. Here. Here.

759
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:01,625
Here. No, this side.

760
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:03,415
Go.

761
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,522
9-1-1 emergency.

762
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:08,410
Yeah. Uh...

763
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:09,425
Hi.

764
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,254
What is your emergency?

765
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,850
Uh, I was shot.

766
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,185
I'm all alone now,
and I need an ambulance.

767
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:22,550
Keys?

768
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:24,757
Fuck!

769
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:33,682
Thank you, baby.

770
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:51,026
Calm down.

771
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:53,136
Calm down, Duff.

772
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:54,931
Everything's cool.

773
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:57,553
Everything is cool.

774
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,878
Everything's cool.

775
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:03,307
Jesus, that was fast.

776
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,265
What the...

777
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:35,080
# Lay the rules down
in the heat of July, 1975 #

778
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:36,651
# And we're cruising
till we can't stop #

779
00:54:36,692 --> 00:54:40,434
# Flyin' in Mustangs
and Camaros #

780
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:42,889
# We got speed race running
on a Saturday night #

781
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,386
# And this engine rides
to the lower East Side #

782
00:54:45,428 --> 00:54:50,664
# Today in Mustangs
and Camaros, yeah... #

783
00:54:52,115 --> 00:54:53,457
Cheri!

784
00:54:57,203 --> 00:54:58,828
I got it!

785
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:01,354
My car won't start!

786
00:55:08,114 --> 00:55:09,707
Where the fuck's
my bowling ball?

787
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,693
Look out!

788
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:27,279
Cheri!

789
00:55:31,984 --> 00:55:35,431
No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.

790
00:55:35,472 --> 00:55:37,359
It's gonna be OK, baby.
Come on.

791
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:39,693
Come on, wake up. Wake up!

792
00:55:42,224 --> 00:55:43,206
Wake up.

793
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:51,788
I got the money.

794
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:54,638
I got the money, baby.

795
00:56:03,118 --> 00:56:04,230
Fuck. Oh, fuck! Go!

796
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,830
Go! Go! Go! Go!

797
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,769
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down right now.

798
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,161
On the ground,
nice and slow.

799
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:33,665
That's right.

800
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:38,240
Face down toward the curb,
hands behind your back.

801
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:40,039
Do it right now.

802
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:57,633
You have the right
to remain silent.

803
00:56:57,674 --> 00:57:00,095
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

804
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:01,087
You have the right
to an attorney.

805
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,177
If you cannot afford one...

806
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,265
one will be
appointed for you.

807
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:04,321
If you choose
to answer questions...

808
00:57:04,362 --> 00:57:05,344
you have the right
to stop at any time.

809
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:07,241
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

810
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:08,222
Yeah.

811
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:09,378
OK, watch your head.

812
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:20,925
Dispatch, I need
medical to Center pronto.

813
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:22,561
I'm on it.

814
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,713
Ugh!

815
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:46,530
Jesus.

816
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:03,676
You wanna tell me
what happened?

817
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:06,364
They hit her.

818
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:07,932
Who?

819
00:58:07,974 --> 00:58:09,981
Those kids.

820
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:12,606
I don't know their names.
They're in a blue van.

821
00:58:12,645 --> 00:58:15,994
Someone reported a suspect
fitting your description...

822
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:18,175
shooting a clerk at Lloyd's
a few minutes ago.

823
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:20,831
I know you work there.

824
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,964
The gun and the money?

825
00:58:27,556 --> 00:58:28,963
How 'bout the penis?

826
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:42,719
How you guys doing?

827
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:44,893
George, we got the shooting
victim in the back, OK?

828
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:47,200
We got a human penis
right there by the curb.

829
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,926
Somebody's gotta be
looking for that.

830
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,785
I'm not getting a pulse.

831
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,240
One, two, three, four, five...

832
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:55,224
Mind stepping down for a second?

833
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,869
- Keep going.
- Massive head trauma.

834
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:04,311
We got a suspect
over in the car.

835
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,434
You wanna come take
a look at him?

836
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,361
Can you I.D. him for me?

837
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:09,760
He's over in the car.

838
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:11,932
Um... no.

839
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,147
What do you got to tell me?

840
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,251
Yes.

841
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:18,329
I should really stay in
the ambulance because of this.

842
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:20,573
Are you hearing
what I'm saying?

843
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:23,450
You have the right
to remain silent.

844
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:24,732
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

845
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:25,913
in a court of law.

846
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:27,261
You have the right
to an attorney.

847
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:28,311
If you cannot afford one...

848
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:29,562
one will be appointed
for you.

849
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,843
Just breathe.

850
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,789
Do you understand those rights
as I have read them to you?

851
00:59:34,016 --> 00:59:34,998
Yes?

852
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:55,130
I'm sorry.

853
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,053
L-Car-1 en route to station.

854
00:59:57,086 --> 00:59:58,973
Robbery suspects in custody.

855
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:00,086
Be advised...

856
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:01,849
hit-and-run suspects
at large in a blue van.

857
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:02,965
Over.

858
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:04,085
Hey, we just got a call...

859
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:05,849
about a deer collision
under the overpass.

860
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:08,252
Be a hon and check it out
on your way back, OK?

861
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:10,009
Can it wait?

862
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:13,013
Sorry. Friend of the chief's.

863
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,349
Ten-four.

864
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:56,025
# Liked you when we
first met #

865
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:59,538
# I felt the stare
come across the floor #

866
01:00:59,577 --> 01:01:02,577
# They say once you
taste a little #

867
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,748
# You're gonna want
a whole lot more #

868
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:07,378
Steph, what are you doing?

869
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,516
Calling you.
Has Aaron been over yet?

870
01:01:10,553 --> 01:01:12,462
Never should've told you
about him.

871
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:15,799
Hmph. I can't believe
you're making them both pay.

872
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:18,037
Why shouldn't they?
I don't know whose it is.

873
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:20,112
Yeah, but they
could've split it...

874
01:01:20,152 --> 01:01:22,225
if they knew about each other.

875
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:24,598
Heh. So when are you
having it done?

876
01:01:24,632 --> 01:01:26,192
Tomorrow.

877
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:27,639
Are you scared?

878
01:01:27,672 --> 01:01:30,988
Nah. Listen. I gotta go.

879
01:01:31,032 --> 01:01:32,526
Aaron's here.

880
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:33,844
I'll call you later.

881
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,606
Coming up at eleven:
The Komodo dragon.

882
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:47,314
So, is that Aaron's car outside?

883
01:01:47,351 --> 01:01:48,299
Yeah.

884
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,390
...not seeing him anymore.

885
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:50,543
I'm not.

886
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,547
I'm just hanging out.

887
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,590
Cheri.

888
01:01:57,525 --> 01:01:58,540
Cheri.

889
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,480
I do not trust that guy.

890
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,143
So you said.

891
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:06,059
Look at me!

892
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:11,252
If he hits you again,
I'll kill him.

893
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:14,445
I can take care of myself.

894
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:17,038
This week,
we focus on nature.

895
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:20,425
Travel to the remote
Komodo Island in Indonesia.

896
01:02:36,979 --> 01:02:38,288
What's up, baby?

897
01:02:38,323 --> 01:02:39,567
Did you bring it?

898
01:02:39,603 --> 01:02:40,651
Mm-hmm.

899
01:02:40,691 --> 01:02:41,639
Let's see.

900
01:02:41,682 --> 01:02:43,722
What? Don't you trust me?

901
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:48,369
Come on. Let's go
park down the street.

902
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:50,606
How can you think about sex
at a time like this?

903
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,722
Get in.

904
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:53,835
Not in your car again.
It's too small.

905
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:56,523
Let's go inside then.

906
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:58,023
My dad's home.

907
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,658
Shit.

908
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:03,248
Really want me?

909
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:06,920
Gonna have to
catch me first.

910
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:12,806
I'm gonna get you.

911
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,463
Come back here.

912
01:03:16,656 --> 01:03:18,566
Come on, baby.
You know I'm gonna get you.

913
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:21,900
All right, I'm gonna
make you pay. Stop!

914
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:23,529
- Aah.
- Come on.

915
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:25,903
Oh, shit!

916
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:26,950
You're gonna get it.

917
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:28,618
You're in fuckin' trouble.

918
01:03:28,656 --> 01:03:30,860
Come on. Come on.

919
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:46,219
You're mine now.

920
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:47,464
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

921
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:48,485
Yeah.

922
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:50,824
Oh, yeah.

923
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:01,316
Want me?

924
01:04:01,357 --> 01:04:03,179
Yeah.

925
01:04:20,748 --> 01:04:22,123
A check?

926
01:04:22,156 --> 01:04:24,523
Yeah? So?

927
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,465
Better not bounce.

928
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,827
Where's your condom?

929
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,460
Uh, I didn't bring one.

930
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:32,994
What?

931
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,336
Duh. You're already pregnant.

932
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,094
Yeah, but other things.

933
01:04:37,131 --> 01:04:39,269
Don't worry, baby. I'm clean.

934
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:41,346
Besides, it's the only time
we'll be able to do it...

935
01:04:41,387 --> 01:04:43,209
without having to worry about
anything. You know what I mean?

936
01:04:44,778 --> 01:04:46,153
What's wrong?

937
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:48,259
Nothing.

938
01:04:56,585 --> 01:04:57,829
Oh...

939
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:34,752
Huh?

940
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:43,805
Did you come?

941
01:05:46,535 --> 01:05:47,712
Aah!

942
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:56,095
Don't pass out.
Don't pass out.

943
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:57,661
Don't pass out.

944
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:53,976
How'd it go?

945
01:06:54,018 --> 01:06:55,927
Steph, can you keep a secret?

946
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:57,878
Of course. What is it?

947
01:06:57,922 --> 01:07:00,823
Duffy just drove by
and saw us.

948
01:07:00,865 --> 01:07:02,010
He saw you with Aaron?

949
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:04,253
Yeah. I've never
seen him so mad.

950
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:06,362
Oh, my God.
Duffy's gonna kill him.

951
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,980
...The world's
longest-living reptile.

952
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,925
- Where's Aaron?
- He left.

953
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:29,396
That's good.

954
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:32,599
What are you doing?

955
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:36,508
Is that blood? Are you bleeding?

956
01:07:39,678 --> 01:07:40,758
Let me see.

957
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:41,943
I'm fine, all right?

958
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:43,641
I just cut my hand
on a pricker bush.

959
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,843
Are you OK?

960
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:47,795
- I'm fine, Dad.
- What happened?

961
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:51,220
Cheri.

962
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,818
Honey?

963
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:58,934
You can tell me.

964
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:02,076
You know I'm always
looking out for you.

965
01:08:03,805 --> 01:08:05,692
Cheri.

966
01:08:05,725 --> 01:08:06,805
Uhh!

967
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,427
Dad, have you seen my keys?

968
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,704
No.

969
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:13,813
Can I borrow your key
to the Honda?

970
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,824
Where are you going?

971
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,616
Dad, please.

972
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,582
You need to be more
careful with your keys.

973
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:35,731
Thanks.

974
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,009
You sure there's nothing
you wanna tell me?

975
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:46,361
Here the Komodo
dines on a fresh kill.

976
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,806
Goddamn piece of crap!

977
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,649
Shit!

978
01:09:26,615 --> 01:09:28,274
Ooh ooh.

979
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,456
Girl!

980
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:34,892
Need some help?

981
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:38,829
Can I offer you a delicious
Bong Water?

982
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,739
How about a doughnut?

983
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:44,106
Forget it, dude.

984
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:45,524
She's going out
with Duffy Nichols.

985
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:46,987
You know Duffy?

986
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,523
Sure. He used to mow my lawn.

987
01:09:48,565 --> 01:09:50,027
Yeah. We just saw him
over at Lloyd's.

988
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:51,051
Lloyd's?

989
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:52,751
You want a ride?

990
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,794
Nope. Thanks for the tip.

991
01:09:59,893 --> 01:10:00,875
Whoo!

992
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,832
Fuck.

993
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,421
God damn it!
You're so stubborn.

994
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:56,207
Lloyd's an idiot
if he fires you!

995
01:10:56,241 --> 01:10:58,445
Christ, he should make you
the manager!

996
01:10:58,481 --> 01:10:59,463
Jesus.

997
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,658
- Hey.
- Hey.

998
01:11:11,696 --> 01:11:14,085
I gotta talk to you.

999
01:11:15,696 --> 01:11:16,972
OK.

1000
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:24,902
Be right back.

1001
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:26,633
What's up?

1002
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:29,607
Huh?

1003
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:39,204
What's up?

1004
01:11:40,654 --> 01:11:41,996
Did you get the money?

1005
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:44,393
Sorry, babe.

1006
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,284
I'm not gonna be able to get
it till work tomorrow night.

1007
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:49,481
It's OK. I understand.

1008
01:12:01,228 --> 01:12:03,617
Ohh. What's gotten into you?

1009
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,547
Can't a girl kiss her boyfriend?

1010
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:17,383
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1011
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,532
I didn't mean to.

1012
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,520
Why?

1013
01:12:19,563 --> 01:12:20,872
I didn't mean it.

1014
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:22,020
Give me that fucking thing.

1015
01:12:23,883 --> 01:12:25,858
Better get you out of here.

1016
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:30,946
I'm dead. I'm so dead.

1017
01:12:33,706 --> 01:12:35,877
Hey, could I borrow your jacket?
It's cold out.

1018
01:12:35,914 --> 01:12:37,376
Yeah.

1019
01:12:46,249 --> 01:12:47,231
I love you.

1020
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,071
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1021
01:13:45,701 --> 01:13:46,911
Thank you.

1022
01:14:11,044 --> 01:14:12,058
Aah!

1023
01:14:19,491 --> 01:14:20,571
9-1-1.

1024
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:22,498
Um, hi. I think...

1025
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,051
I just saw a man shoot
the clerk at Lloyd's.

1026
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:26,498
Can you describe
the suspect?

1027
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,879
Uh, black t-shirt
and green pants.

1028
01:15:03,424 --> 01:15:04,569
Huhh.

1029
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:23,896
Aaahh!

1030
01:15:49,436 --> 01:15:50,680
Hey, sexy.

1031
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:51,961
I need you to come
and get me.

1032
01:15:51,997 --> 01:15:54,069
I thought you wanted
to leave tomorrow.

1033
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:56,116
And now I wanna leave
now, all right?

1034
01:15:56,156 --> 01:15:58,043
OK. OK.

1035
01:15:58,076 --> 01:15:59,963
Did you get the money?

1036
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:01,403
I got Aaron's.

1037
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,989
What about, uh, Duffy's?

1038
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,468
Did he find out?

1039
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:10,995
Did he?

1040
01:16:11,035 --> 01:16:12,596
Does he know
you're not pregnant?

1041
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:14,195
No. He believes me.

1042
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,602
It's just
everything's fucked.

1043
01:16:16,635 --> 01:16:18,042
Where are you?

1044
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,636
I'm on my way back
from Benny's.

1045
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,082
I'm almost home.

1046
01:16:21,114 --> 01:16:23,962
You tell me where you are,
I'll come and get you.

1047
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,401
I'm not home.
I'm in the Center.

1048
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:26,678
Heh.

1049
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,795
Are you drunk?

1050
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:31,630
Ha! I wouldn't say
I'm drunk.

1051
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:34,357
Look, just come and get me
so I can get my shit...

1052
01:16:34,394 --> 01:16:36,085
and get the fuck out
of this...

1053
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:37,430
Cheri!

1054
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:41,141
I got it!

1055
01:16:41,177 --> 01:16:43,926
My car won't start.

1056
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:48,759
Hello? Are you still there?

1057
01:16:48,793 --> 01:16:50,287
Listen, I might get
Duffy's half after all.

1058
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:52,084
I'll call you back.

1059
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:09,047
# You keep saying
you've got something for me #

1060
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:14,829
# Something you call love,
but confess, yes #

1061
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:19,889
# You've been messin' where you
shouldn't have been a-messin' #

1062
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:23,952
# And now someone else
is gettin' all your best #

1063
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,885
# These boots
are made for walking #

1064
01:17:28,918 --> 01:17:30,925
# And that's just what
they'll do #

1065
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:36,118
# One of these days, these boots
are gonna walk all over you #

1066
01:17:41,525 --> 01:17:42,954
# Yeah #

1
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:41,100


2
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,661
- Is he here yet?
- No.

3
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:10,932
- You scared him.
- I gotta take a massive piss.

4
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:14,702
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

5
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:31,967
Anyone got any beer?

6
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:37,198
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

7
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:41,278
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

8
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,920
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,780
- Thanks a lot, Eric.
- Anytime, anywhere.

10
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,931
- This is gonna be sweet.
- I'm glad I thought of it.

11
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,692
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

12
00:01:55,902 --> 00:01:59,732
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

13
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:04,134
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

14
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:08,875
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

15
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:13,245
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

16
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,647
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

17
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:18,757
You know I don't dance.

18
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:22,628
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

19
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:27,129
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

20
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,699
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

21
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,310
Like yourself.

22
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,771
He's here!

23
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,571
All right, here he comes.

24
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,742
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

25
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,323
I can't wait to see you fly!

26
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:52,854
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

27
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:58,165
You're late.

28
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,036
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know...

29
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:07,148
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

30
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,088
If there is a next time!

31
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,760
Dean! Is he always like that?

32
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,920
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,662
Wait up, baby!

34
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:31,983
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

35
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,509
Okay, here's the deal.

36
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,309
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

37
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,111
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

38
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,551
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,521
All right. All right.

40
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,291
Let's do this, okay?

41
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,773
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

42
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:24,935
- How deep is this?
- I don't really know.

43
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:26,706
Let's go find out.

44
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:31,618
Let's do it.

45
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:02,224
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

46
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:06,855
Come on, let's go!

47
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,524
Jump!

48
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:14,066
- You done this?
- We've all done it.

49
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:19,406
- I hope you had your Wheaties!
- You guys gonna do this tonight?

50
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:21,518
On three.

51
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:23,738
One.

52
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,649
Two.

53
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,119
Three!

54
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,073
Oh, shit.

55
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,643
Landon, he's hurt!

56
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,145
- Is he okay?
- Landon, get down here!

57
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:53,615
- What the hell?
- Dean, what the hell?

58
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:56,185
- You guys, he's hurt!
- Come on, man!

59
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:00,857
- I told you it was a bad idea!
- Get him out of the water!

60
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:06,197
- Hurry up!
- Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

61
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,828
Help me!

62
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,240
- Get him over here!
- There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

63
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Get him out of the water!

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,451
Watch his head! Watch his head!

65
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,022
Hey, who's down there?

66
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:27,492
Tracie, come on!

67
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:32,403
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

68
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,594
Come on, Landon.

69
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,375
Come on!

70
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,606
You guys, just take him!

71
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,805
Give me his arms!

72
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,886
I got him.

73
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,688
We gotta get out of here.

74
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:54,628
- Go! Get out of here!
- Landon, come on!

75
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,500
I told you not to do this!

76
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,230
Calm down.

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,511
Belinda, let's go!

78
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,113
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

79
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,648
Damn it!

80
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,974
Shit!

81
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,510
Put your hands on the wheel.

82
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:03,147
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

83
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,048
I don't think I can go any place.

84
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:11,289
- Maybe I should call your father.
- No.

85
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm not talking to him.

86
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,671
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

87
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:26,272
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

88
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:30,823
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

89
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:34,855
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

90
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,407
- So how's the leg, man?
- It's good.

91
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,818
I can't believe you were in jail.

92
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:23,579
- What'd you tell them?
- It was a nice night for a drive.

93
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,199
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

94
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,530
Tried to help him, got spooked.

95
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,191
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

96
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:37,741
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

97
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:41,242
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

98
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,744
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

99
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,514
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

100
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,714
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

101
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:53,456
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

102
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,426
Nice sweater.

103
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,496
Thank you.

104
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,638
Thank you.

105
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,562
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

106
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,432
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

107
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:31,595
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

108
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:34,674
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

109
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,875
What, are you gonna expel me?

110
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:38,815
Not yet.

111
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:45,317
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

112
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:48,987
- For pay?
- For the inner satisfaction it brings.

113
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:53,629
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

114
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,100
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

115
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,609
The spring play?

116
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,681
It's time you experienced
other things.

117
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,782
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

118
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:10,112
Don't blow it, Landon.

119
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:21,325
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

120
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,336
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

121
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,378
This is a star frame.

122
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,877
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

123
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:39,990
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

124
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,720
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

125
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,760
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

126
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,632
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

127
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:55,133
Well, if there is a higher power...

128
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,942
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

129
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,814
He's too busy looking for your brain.

130
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:05,155
Laugh, it's a joke.

131
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:08,084
- Let's get out of here.
- I gotta stay.

132
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:11,526
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

133
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,827
Come on. Come on.

134
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:17,667
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

135
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,928
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

136
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,481
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

137
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,851
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

138
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:38,293
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

139
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,834
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

140
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,093
I know. I just thought...

141
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,864
It's over.

142
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,975
Yeah. Whatever.

143
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:04,188
Okay.

144
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,299
Good morning, Landon.

145
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,070
Landon, wake up!

146
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,111
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

147
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,841
Up!

148
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,952
It's Saturday, no school.

149
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,022
Tutoring.

150
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,737
Let's try this again.

151
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:50,248
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

152
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,449
What do you think?

153
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,519
Man, I think this is bullshit!

154
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,031
Makes two of us.

155
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:27,087
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

156
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:31,327
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

157
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,297
No.

158
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,040
So I saw you in there with Luis.

159
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,839
And I know it can be difficult...

160
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:45,641
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

161
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:53,392
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

162
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,864
That would be a no.

163
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:03,635
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

164
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:06,745
Is this your idea of small talk?

165
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:10,716
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

166
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,717
- It's called peer pressure.
- How do you know?

167
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,187
You read it in your precious book?

168
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:24,259
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

169
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:27,401
But I do. I do.

170
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,900
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

171
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,942
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

172
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:39,912
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

173
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:44,714
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

174
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:47,455
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

175
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,355
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

176
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,125
How's that sound?

177
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:58,107
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

178
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:02,538
- You don't care what people think?
- No.

179
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:35,286
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

180
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:39,115
This is bullshit. Thanks.

181
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:43,527
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

182
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:47,498
- Be back in an hour.
- Tell them to do West Side Story.

183
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:53,839
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

184
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,180
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

185
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,682
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

186
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:10,483
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

187
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,133
Eddie, perhaps-

188
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,894
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

189
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,864
Sure.

190
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:22,236
Now then, let's see...

191
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:28,176
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

192
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:32,418
- Sally will be playing Caroline.
- Congratulations.

193
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,789
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

194
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:41,760
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

195
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,461
When did you know, Tommy?

196
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,101
IKnow what?

197
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,671
That we were in love.

198
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,183
Love?

199
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:59,414
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

200
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,284
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

201
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:07,095
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

202
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:14,567
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

203
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,937
...pour me another glass.

204
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,908
Are you trying to be bad at this?

205
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,280
No, just comes naturally.

206
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,520
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

207
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:35,801
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

208
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,902
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. See you.

209
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,704
Bye.

210
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:56,757
- So would it kill you to try?
- Yep, and I'm too young to die.

211
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,127
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

212
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:04,058
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

213
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:09,609
- That's thoroughly predictable.
- Your act only works on an audience.

214
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,317
Feeling Christian?

215
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:46,207
Seat belt?

216
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,713
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

217
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,183
Forty-two.

218
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:14,514
What do you mean, forty-two?

219
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:17,884
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

220
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:23,125
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

221
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:25,356
Like getting a new personality?

222
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:28,538
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

223
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,728
Ambitious.

224
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:33,638
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

225
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:37,408
What's number one?

226
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,181
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

227
00:22:58,374 --> 00:22:59,204
I've come...

228
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:00,774
...to see if you're ready.

229
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:04,915
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

230
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,947
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

231
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:12,287
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

232
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,287
When you walked into...

233
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:22,229
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

234
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,529
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

235
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:28,371
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

236
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,951
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

237
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,811
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

238
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,993
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

239
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:43,683
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

240
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,493
I didn't write it, okay?

241
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:50,295
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

242
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:54,906
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

243
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:59,137
I'm just busting on you.

244
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:04,478
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

245
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:07,020
With tomatoes.

246
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,219
Thanks, man.

247
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:13,160
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

248
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,331
- Yeah.
- No problem.

249
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:25,713
Jamie.

250
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:28,774
What do you want?

251
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:33,714
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

252
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:37,426
I need help with my lines.

253
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:43,126
- Landon Carter's asking me for help?
- Yeah.

254
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:46,138
Okay, I'll pray for you.

255
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,338
Jamie, look-

256
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:52,879
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

257
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:58,020
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

258
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,711
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

259
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:06,732
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

260
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:11,663
- Please?
- Okay. One condition, though.

261
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:13,534
What's that?

262
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:17,145
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

263
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,847
- That's not a problem.
- Okay. I'll see you today after school.

264
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:32,157
Landon Carter is coming here?

265
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,599
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

266
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,740
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

267
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,460
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

268
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,701
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

269
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,142
It's him I don't trust, not you.

270
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,396
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

271
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,566
Come on in.

272
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:15,978
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

273
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:18,178
Oh, yeah.

274
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:20,578
It's not likely.

275
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:41,443
That is one scary-looking-

276
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,444
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

277
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:49,455
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

278
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,386
Congratulations.

279
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:54,566
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

280
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:56,857
I didn't let you.

281
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:02,839
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

282
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:08,739
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

283
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,940
But I see you.

284
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:17,891
I'll be in my office, just here.

285
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,051
Ready?

286
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:22,993
Yeah, let's go.

287
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:32,035
- Landon! Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

288
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:35,046
- Hey, come here.
- What's up?

289
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:38,577
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

290
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,641
What the hell?

291
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,025
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

292
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:21,926
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

293
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,567
Maybe.

294
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:26,296
Where you going?

295
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:29,347
Come and see.

296
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:38,279
Okay. What is that?

297
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:43,221
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

298
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:46,321
Take a look.

299
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:54,073
Saturn. Very cool.

300
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:59,544
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

301
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:03,615
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

302
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,586
Nature's miracles. I get it.

303
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:11,628
- Get what?
- That you're into all this stuff.

304
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:14,357
This stuff?

305
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:18,938
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

306
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:22,700
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

307
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,370
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

308
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,240
Tell that to those who suffer.

309
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:35,263
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

310
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,962
- She's trashy.
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

311
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,994
Here comes your leading lady.

312
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:46,235
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

313
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,275
In your dreams.

314
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,288
Hi. Where's your sweater?

315
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:12,400
Let's get out of here.

316
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,471
What's up, dude?

317
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:47,177
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

318
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,109
What do you want?

319
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,090
- You're not in a good mood.
- You don't miss a thing.

320
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,291
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

321
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:02,662
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

322
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:07,504
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

323
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,504
We could be secret friends.

324
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:13,474
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

325
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:17,116
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

326
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:24,516
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

327
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:29,928
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

328
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,639
But I was very wrong.

329
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,840
Damn it!

330
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,292
Sorry. Sorry.

331
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,131
You know the answer?

332
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,972
Come on, man, I know you know.

333
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:41,944
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

334
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:44,714
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

335
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:47,515
Take a step towards the basket.

336
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:53,656
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

337
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,668
- Yeah.
- Are you?

338
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:59,498
- Yeah.
- So, what did we just make?

339
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:07,040
- A similar triangle?
- Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

340
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,320
You got it, two sides the same.

341
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,252
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

342
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,621
I came to say I'm sorry.

343
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:35,153
Well, you did. Feel better?

344
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,563
No. I feel like shit.

345
00:35:37,773 --> 00:35:42,734
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

346
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:49,946
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

347
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,787
I made that jump once.

348
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:57,847
I thought I was a badass.

349
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:04,259
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

350
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,430
Did it hurt?

351
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:13,042
Like hell.

352
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,811
Good.

353
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,824
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

354
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:34,676
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

355
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:38,037
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

356
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:40,647
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

357
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:44,618
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

358
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,759
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

359
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,820
That's it! We are through!

360
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:53,990
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

361
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,931
And I hope you drown in it!

362
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,762
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

363
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,702
The singer?

364
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:08,713
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

365
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:12,355
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

366
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,115
Look, I ain't blaming you.

367
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:21,057
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

368
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,397
I just did what I had to.

369
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:34,679
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

370
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,509
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

371
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,881
Nothing's coincidence.

372
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:45,582
Your face... You look so familiar.

373
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:50,493
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

374
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:53,223
Tell me about this dream girl.

375
00:37:58,104 --> 00:38:02,065
Well, I don't remember.

376
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:08,216
All I know...

377
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,588
...is you're beautiful.

378
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,460
The song, the song.

379
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,911
The dream.

380
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:31,942
Help me to remember.

381
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,273
Will you sing for me?

382
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,348
That was great.

383
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:49,119
Hi, kids.

384
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:53,701
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

385
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:55,491
Thanks, but please stop.

386
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,201
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thanks.

387
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,642
Okay, okay.

388
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,174
- Interesting rewrite you did there.
- I did my best.

389
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:07,783
Your acting didn't suck either.

390
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:11,584
- Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

391
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:15,056
- Landon, you were marvelous!
- Thank you.

392
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:21,927
Landon? Fine performance, son.

393
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:26,008
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd get a bite.

394
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,408
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't walk away.

395
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:30,379
You taught me how.

396
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:41,352
Oh, my God.

397
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,852
Look who's here.

398
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:50,303
Don't look at him.

399
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,064
You don't want to stare too much.

400
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:58,184
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

401
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:15,489
- People can see.
- That would ruin your reputation how?

402
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:17,189
What's that?

403
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,671
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

404
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:28,372
- And how many books are there?
- A hundred.

405
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:33,423
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

406
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:37,924
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

407
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:48,636
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

408
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:50,537
Maybe...

409
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,807
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

410
00:44:56,017 --> 00:45:00,859
- Maybe you inspire me.
- Sounds like bull.

411
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,750
- Which part?
- All of it.

412
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,859
- It's not.
- Prove it.

413
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,632
Jamie!

414
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,583
- You've no idea how to be a friend.
- I don't just want that.

415
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:24,914
- You don't know what you want.
- You're scared someone wants you.

416
00:45:25,124 --> 00:45:29,425
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind books...

417
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:33,426
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

418
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:36,867
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

419
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,867
It's because you want
to be with me too.

420
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:03,492
We gonna get this party jumping!

421
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:07,673
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

422
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:11,275
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

423
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:16,105
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

424
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,976
What we got here?

425
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:24,388
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

426
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:27,227
Jamie lent it to me.

427
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:30,029
You're listening
to her people's music.

428
00:46:30,229 --> 00:46:31,829
- Her people?
- Yeah...

429
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,470
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

430
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,511
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

431
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:41,611
- She's not like that.
- Well...

432
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:45,582
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

433
00:46:45,782 --> 00:46:48,624
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

434
00:46:55,494 --> 00:46:59,996
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

435
00:47:00,206 --> 00:47:04,296
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

436
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:08,138
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

437
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:12,579
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

438
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,478
- Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
- No.

439
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:18,450
I did.

440
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:31,732
You.

441
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:34,243
Me.

442
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,444
What is it?

443
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:42,885
I got you something.

444
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:48,497
Thank you.

445
00:47:51,797 --> 00:47:54,697
Well, I'll see you at school.

446
00:47:55,337 --> 00:47:56,999
Okay.

447
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:09,651
- Mr. Carter.
- Later, Reverend.

448
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:34,036
Boys like that...

449
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:38,017
...they have...

450
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:45,430
They have expectations.

451
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,229
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

452
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,410
Fine.

453
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,542
You might not care
what I say or think...

454
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:01,742
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

455
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:05,524
I think he wants me to be happy.

456
00:49:08,694 --> 00:49:12,184
Dad, it's just a sweater.

457
00:49:12,394 --> 00:49:15,296
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

458
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:29,219
I talked to your dad today.

459
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:34,251
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

460
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:38,831
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

461
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:45,663
- Landon, there are a lot of reasons-
- He left us.

462
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:49,433
You need to forgive him too.

463
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:59,215
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

464
00:49:59,425 --> 00:50:03,116
She was looking all right
in that play.

465
00:50:03,327 --> 00:50:04,697
She doesn't look hot.

466
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:10,167
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

467
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,238
I have the best idea.

468
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:16,669
Can you do something, like, move it?

469
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,980
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

470
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,210
Take one.

471
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,712
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

472
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:33,723
Hey, look at this.

473
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:35,793
Here.

474
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:39,134
Take one. Look.

475
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:47,176
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

476
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:51,747
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

477
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:55,118
Landon and I are way over.

478
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:58,618
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

479
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,530
You'd be so beautiful...

480
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,601
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

481
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:12,542
- Come on, eat lunch with me.
- Okay.

482
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,732
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

483
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,433
Okay.

484
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:29,826
Wow.

485
00:51:30,536 --> 00:51:32,506
Is that you?

486
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,308
Nice bod.

487
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:13,146
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

488
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:15,346
Stay here.

489
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:22,427
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

490
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:25,898
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

491
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:30,670
- Dean, stop!
- You stay out of this!

492
00:52:39,151 --> 00:52:42,593
- We're through. We're through.
- That's great.

493
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:44,912
- We're through forever!
- You okay?

494
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,683
- You made a mistake, Landon!
- You sure?

495
00:52:47,893 --> 00:52:49,654
Let's get out of here.

496
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:52,335
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

497
00:52:54,435 --> 00:52:57,635
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

498
00:52:57,835 --> 00:53:01,076
They're animals, all right?

499
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:03,647
You want me to take you home?

500
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,547
Let's get out of here.

501
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:13,449
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

502
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:18,729
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

503
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:28,873
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

504
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:37,654
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

505
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:43,525
I'm sorry. I can't go.

506
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,708
- You have something else going on?
- No.

507
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:55,168
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

508
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,550
I'm not allowed to date.

509
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:12,852
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

510
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:19,734
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

511
00:54:19,944 --> 00:54:24,705
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap-"

512
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:27,746
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:31,686
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

514
00:54:31,956 --> 00:54:34,087
That's not possible.

515
00:54:36,257 --> 00:54:41,958
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

516
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:46,609
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

517
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:52,410
You can exit the way you entered.

518
00:54:56,951 --> 00:55:00,723
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

519
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,584
She deserves more than that.

520
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:07,124
I'm asking you for the same thing...

521
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:10,565
...you teach us every day in church.

522
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:14,226
And that's faith.

523
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,448
I can't believe you asked permission.

524
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:26,679
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

525
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:28,719
- Thank you.
- This is for you.

526
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:32,660
- Thank you very much.
- Would you like something to drink?

527
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,130
- Sweet tea, please.
- Make that two.

528
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,062
Right away.

529
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:42,702
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

530
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,742
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

531
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:48,244
Choose whatever you want.

532
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,574
So, what'll it be?

533
00:55:52,554 --> 00:55:54,784
Is everything okay?

534
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:59,086
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.

535
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,168
Would you like to dance?

536
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:13,109
Sorry, I don't dance.

537
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:17,080
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

538
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:23,081
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

539
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:26,053
Everybody can dance.

540
00:56:26,262 --> 00:56:29,062
Come on, you can't be that bad.

541
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:32,133
Please?

542
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:34,433
For me?

543
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:37,435
Come on.

544
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:56,519
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

545
00:56:56,729 --> 00:57:00,970
- In all fairness, you warned me, right?
- That's right.

546
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:08,641
So, what's number one on your list?

547
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:13,251
Okay.

548
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:17,943
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

549
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:22,114
Getting out won't be your problem.

550
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:26,895
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

551
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:29,036
What do you mean?

552
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:33,878
I mean, you can do anything.

553
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,032
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

554
00:57:58,873 --> 00:58:01,862
Come on, come on. Let's go!

555
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:04,844
- What are we doing?
- Run!

556
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:08,315
- Okay, okay. Stand there.
- All right.

557
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:12,455
- One foot there, and one foot here.
- Okay.

558
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:17,527
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

559
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,997
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

560
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,398
Okay.

561
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,739
You're in two places at once.

562
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:46,324
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

563
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:48,523
You choose.

564
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:53,235
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

565
00:58:58,346 --> 00:59:00,375
Where do you want it?

566
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,618
Right here.

567
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:15,130
Okay.

568
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:25,815
How can you see places like this...

569
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:30,857
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

570
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:35,357
You're lucky to be so sure.

571
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,139
It's like the wind.

572
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:47,410
I can't see it, but I feel it.

573
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,711
What do you feel?

574
01:00:52,592 --> 01:00:57,112
I feel wonder and beauty...

575
01:00:57,322 --> 01:01:01,093
...joy, love.

576
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:06,294
I mean, it's the center of everything.

577
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:12,106
I might kiss you.

578
01:01:14,446 --> 01:01:16,747
I might be bad at it.

579
01:01:20,157 --> 01:01:22,618
That's not possible.

580
01:01:47,053 --> 01:01:49,114
I love you.

581
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:06,548
Now would be the time
to say something.

582
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:12,609
I told you not to fall in love with me.

583
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:24,095
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

584
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:28,867
Landon, go home. The night's over.

585
01:03:29,077 --> 01:03:30,776
- Good night.
- Good night.

586
01:03:30,976 --> 01:03:32,877
Good night, sir.

587
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,789
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

588
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:45,689
- You act with that boy like you're-
- In love?

589
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:50,201
- Jamie, you are a child.
- Dad, look at me...

590
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:54,001
- ...I'm not a child.
- Then stop acting childish.

591
01:03:57,713 --> 01:03:59,583
I love him.

592
01:04:02,354 --> 01:04:06,755
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

593
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:30,670
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,822
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

595
01:04:36,032 --> 01:04:38,962
So, what did you tell your father?

596
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:43,122
The truth. I just left you out of it.

597
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:46,394
So, what do you want to see?

598
01:04:47,244 --> 01:04:48,834
Pluto.

599
01:04:49,104 --> 01:04:52,564
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

600
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:54,615
Right...

601
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:59,847
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

602
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:04,758
...and a blanket.

603
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:08,798
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

604
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:13,159
Are you trying to seduce me?

605
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,570
Why? Are you seducible?

606
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,741
That's what I thought...

607
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,613
...ergo, a second blanket.

608
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:28,813
- One for me, and one for you.
- Thank you.

609
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:45,877
- Can you find this star right here?
- Sure.

610
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,350
So why am I looking for this star?

611
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,061
Because I had it named for you.

612
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:06,901
See?

613
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,572
It's official.

614
01:06:10,172 --> 01:06:14,613
It's from the International
Star Registry.

615
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:20,414
This is wonderful!

616
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:27,386
I love you.

617
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:44,270
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

618
01:06:53,032 --> 01:06:56,863
So, what's your number one?

619
01:07:01,003 --> 01:07:04,664
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

620
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:07,705
That's where my parents were married.

621
01:07:37,111 --> 01:07:40,783
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

622
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:44,383
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

623
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,284
Sorry.

624
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:51,425
Landon, were you with Jamie?

625
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:54,996
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

626
01:07:55,206 --> 01:07:57,676
- Mom-
- Please!

627
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:59,936
It's different with her.

628
01:08:00,246 --> 01:08:03,607
- It's different with her.
- Yes.

629
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:08,679
It better be different with her.

630
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,820
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

631
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:26,542
"Examine a moon rock.

632
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:30,074
Go to college.

633
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:33,975
Get into medical school."

634
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:44,027
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

635
01:08:44,227 --> 01:08:50,728
- But you'll have to work really hard.
- I can do that.

636
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:55,569
Yeah, you can.

637
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,281
Mama...

638
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:06,111
...Jamie has faith in me.

639
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:09,253
You know?

640
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:14,163
She makes me want to be different.

641
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:17,034
Better.

642
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:22,145
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

643
01:09:27,046 --> 01:09:31,148
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

644
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:37,218
Are you worried
about your college applications?

645
01:09:37,428 --> 01:09:38,859
No.

646
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,590
I'm not applying.

647
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,599
- I thought you said-
- No, you assumed.

648
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,211
- Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
- No.

649
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:54,442
What are you gonna do?

650
01:09:57,883 --> 01:09:59,783
I'm sick.

651
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:03,684
- I'll take you home, you'll be-
- No, Landon!

652
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:05,995
I'm sick.

653
01:10:09,966 --> 01:10:12,456
I have leukemia.

654
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:19,468
No.

655
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:23,108
- You're 18, you're perfect.
- No.

656
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:27,950
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

657
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,131
So why didn't you tell me?

658
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:39,663
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

659
01:10:39,873 --> 01:10:43,243
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

660
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:46,703
- Including me?
- Especially you!

661
01:10:49,685 --> 01:10:54,716
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

662
01:10:59,057 --> 01:11:03,398
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

663
01:12:11,883 --> 01:12:14,473
Dad, open the door!

664
01:12:24,836 --> 01:12:26,327
Landon?

665
01:12:27,867 --> 01:12:30,807
- I need your help.
- What's wrong? You okay?

666
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:34,467
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's...

667
01:12:36,309 --> 01:12:41,549
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

668
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,479
Okay, calm down.

669
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:47,221
- Can you help me or not?
- I don't know her case.

670
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:51,522
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't-

671
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:56,263
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

672
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:59,844
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

673
01:14:37,826 --> 01:14:40,425
Your mom called me.

674
01:14:41,495 --> 01:14:43,837
Talk to me, man.

675
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:46,227
About what?

676
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:50,408
About you...

677
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:52,709
...about Jamie.

678
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:58,610
What's there to talk about?

679
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,551
She's the best person I've ever known.

680
01:15:07,832 --> 01:15:10,492
I didn't understand.

681
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,004
It's okay, man.

682
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,386
It's okay.

683
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,411
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

684
01:15:51,322 --> 01:15:53,722
I'm not going anywhere.

685
01:15:54,052 --> 01:15:56,543
Please tell Jamie that.

686
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:31,091
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

687
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,392
I made you do too many things-

688
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:36,801
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

689
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:48,354
Are you scared?

690
01:16:49,425 --> 01:16:50,915
To death.

691
01:16:54,366 --> 01:16:56,226
Lighten up.

692
01:16:56,426 --> 01:16:58,697
It's not funny.

693
01:17:19,822 --> 01:17:22,993
I'm scared of not being with you.

694
01:17:26,733 --> 01:17:29,724
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

695
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:40,716
I'll be here.

696
01:17:43,857 --> 01:17:45,187
Mom.

697
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,818
Can you do me a favor?

698
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:24,579
So I talked to Eric.

699
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,881
Need some help with this stuff?

700
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:35,952
Sure.

701
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,232
What's that boy doing in the yard?

702
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:22,272
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

703
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:32,797
Landon. Run along, son.

704
01:21:32,997 --> 01:21:35,269
I'm not tired.

705
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:39,710
I need just a minute with her.

706
01:21:47,721 --> 01:21:51,522
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

707
01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:17,317
Daddy...

708
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:20,888
...so serious.

709
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:36,933
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

710
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:40,413
...and you said you hated gravity...

711
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:44,024
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

712
01:22:46,324 --> 01:22:50,955
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

713
01:22:51,165 --> 01:22:56,567
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

714
01:22:57,737 --> 01:22:59,397
Dad...

715
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:07,979
You know, when I lost your mother...

716
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:17,291
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

717
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:28,803
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

718
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:36,216
But then...

719
01:23:40,657 --> 01:23:43,987
I love you so much.

720
01:24:11,534 --> 01:24:14,095
I wanted to give you these.

721
01:24:14,505 --> 01:24:17,264
The pictures from the play.

722
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:26,906
- I'm sorry about the flyers.
- It doesn't matter.

723
01:24:30,718 --> 01:24:33,879
I guess you're with who you should be.

724
01:24:35,229 --> 01:24:37,419
It's like she chose you.

725
01:24:38,759 --> 01:24:42,060
Yeah, I don't even know why.

726
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:46,771
I do.

727
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,551
How you feeling?

728
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:32,352
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Pretty good.

729
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:35,592
- I have something for you.
- You do?

730
01:25:40,873 --> 01:25:44,134
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

731
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:49,945
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

732
01:25:51,216 --> 01:25:54,816
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

733
01:25:56,727 --> 01:26:01,028
- Come on.
- Okay, let's check it out.

734
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,801
"What is a friend?

735
01:26:11,011 --> 01:26:16,501
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

736
01:26:17,382 --> 01:26:20,283
- Right here.
- Okay.

737
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:23,413
"Find out who you are...

738
01:26:23,623 --> 01:26:26,523
...and do it on purpose."

739
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:29,494
That's Dolly Parton.

740
01:26:31,005 --> 01:26:33,665
I always thought she was smart.

741
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:49,559
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

742
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:53,990
Love is never boastful or conceited.

743
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,961
It is never rude or selfish.

744
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:03,301
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

745
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:15,454
- You know what I figured out today?
- What?

746
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:22,056
Maybe God...

747
01:27:22,825 --> 01:27:27,597
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

748
01:27:28,968 --> 01:27:33,639
Like, this journey never ends.

749
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:39,780
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

750
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:45,792
To help me through all this.

751
01:27:57,004 --> 01:27:59,444
You're my angel.

752
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,489
What's going on?

753
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:23,569
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

754
01:28:23,769 --> 01:28:27,671
- What does she mean?
- He's been trying to reach you.

755
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:31,502
He's going to pay
for private home care.

756
01:29:01,088 --> 01:29:02,948
Thank you.

757
01:29:22,942 --> 01:29:24,934
Sorry.

758
01:29:27,044 --> 01:29:29,915
It's all right, son.

759
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:11,503
- I gotta finish this tonight.
- Here, something hot.

760
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,895
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

761
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,705
- Yeah, they're in here.
- Good.

762
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:23,877
- What about side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

763
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:27,818
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

764
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:33,119
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

765
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,489
It's beautiful.

766
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:38,570
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

767
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:20,378
There it is.

768
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:26,691
Come here. Come look.

769
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:31,662
Come here. Come look, quick.

770
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:43,204
That is cool.

771
01:31:53,027 --> 01:31:54,546
Do you love me?

772
01:32:02,009 --> 01:32:06,769
- Will you do something for me then?
- Anything.

773
01:32:09,811 --> 01:32:12,301
Will you marry me?

774
01:33:36,519 --> 01:33:42,891
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

775
01:33:43,091 --> 01:33:48,333
- I love you.
- "Love is never boastful nor conceited.

776
01:33:48,533 --> 01:33:51,062
It is never rude or selfish.

777
01:33:51,273 --> 01:33:56,104
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

778
01:33:56,314 --> 01:34:00,685
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

779
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:04,815
...but delights in the truth.

780
01:34:05,025 --> 01:34:10,397
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

781
01:34:10,598 --> 01:34:13,158
...and to endure...

782
01:34:14,527 --> 01:34:16,628
...whatever comes."

783
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:21,810
- I, Landon Rollins Carter...
- I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

784
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:24,370
...do solemnly swear...

785
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:28,711
- ...to take Jamie Sullivan...
- ...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

786
01:34:28,921 --> 01:34:31,082
- ...as my wife.
- ...as my husband.

787
01:34:31,282 --> 01:34:37,254
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

788
01:34:57,018 --> 01:35:00,719
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

789
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:05,689
... with more love than lots ofpeople
know in a lifetime.

790
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:10,421
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

791
01:35:32,965 --> 01:35:35,557
It's been four years...

792
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:40,367
...but the vision ofJamie
walking towards me...

793
01:35:41,677 --> 01:35:44,608
... will stay with me forever.

794
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:49,119
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

795
01:35:55,891 --> 01:35:59,152
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

796
01:36:06,273 --> 01:36:07,824
Landon.

797
01:36:11,814 --> 01:36:14,545
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

798
01:36:14,745 --> 01:36:16,906
I'm getting by.

799
01:36:28,298 --> 01:36:32,999
- What's new, Landon?
- Well, I got into medical school.

800
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,359
Your mother told me that.

801
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:41,201
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

802
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:45,913
Listen.

803
01:36:51,493 --> 01:36:56,195
I want you to have this.

804
01:36:56,665 --> 01:36:58,964
Oh, Landon.

805
01:37:05,006 --> 01:37:06,997
Oh, my.

806
01:37:09,947 --> 01:37:10,967
Thank you.

807
01:37:15,589 --> 01:37:18,849
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

808
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:25,451
She did.

809
01:37:27,671 --> 01:37:29,662
It was you.

810
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:41,644
Jamie saved my life.

811
01:37:42,284 --> 01:37:45,156
She taught me everything.

812
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:48,896
About life, hope...

813
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:51,826
...and the longjourney ahead.

814
01:37:53,237 --> 01:37:55,638
I'll always miss her.

815
01:37:56,968 --> 01:38:01,208
But our love is like the wind.

816
01:38:02,979 --> 01:38:05,410
I can't see it...

817
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,080
...but I can feel it.

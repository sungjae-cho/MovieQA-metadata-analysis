You know ...
It feels so ...

14
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,358
Right.

15
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,594
Yeah.

5,339 miles from home,
and somehow i feel I belong.

I think this is probably the most fun
I've ever had. You know?

20
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:33,087
I'm so glad we came Clive.

I was over there, on my own.

25
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,530
That there is a black vampire.

26
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:44,902
Watch out !

27
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,232
She bites.

28
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,939
- How much?
- 1,349 dolars, 99 cents.

29
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:54,389
Are you gonna get it?

30
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,256
Fair enough.

31
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,456
I can't believe we're gonna meet
Adam Shadowchild.

00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,425

Welcome my friends.

37
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,921
I just wanted to say that "Planet
Vortulagy" is a huge influence on me and ...

38
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:17,871
... and my work and Sebastian
Rico is a wonderful protagonist.

39
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,051
Don't tell me.

40
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,596
You're a writer.

41
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,614

No, not today.

46
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,179
No, it's a legal thing,
I'm sure it's ...

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,586
I'm sure it's good, it's
a wonderful cover ...

48
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,332
Three tits.

49
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,245
Awesome ...

00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,568
- That was ... Graeme.

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:43,569
My illustrator.

52
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,126

- You brought a book?
- No ...

56
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:53,749
Then fuck off ...

57
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,771
Let's get picture of you and
me and Adam.

58
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:58,596

- Yes, yes.
- Is that the RV place?
- Yes.

61
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:15,902
It's definitely two single beds because
there's been a bit of a mix up at the hotel.

62
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,762
Ok, excellent, thank you very much ...

63
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:21,299

00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,269
- Are they here?
- It's in the car park.

65
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,208
- You mean the "parking lot".
- I suure doe ...

66
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:30,686
Like two American boys.

67
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:36,444
It nice isn't it? We're actually here.
America, huh?

68
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,196
How long have we dreamt about this?

69
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:40,399
Since we were kids.

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,255
Yeah.

71
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,689
Now, look at us.

72
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,850
Grown men ...

73
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,901
- Pizza !
- Pizza !

74
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,557
- Hi ! How you are?
- Good evening sir.

75
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,383
Come on in.

76
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:54,737
Uh ... Where can i set these down?

77
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,562

00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,252

00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,886
No ...

80
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:03,724
- No, we're just ...
- We're just friends.

81
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:06,404
There's been a mix up at the ...
reservations been messed up.

82
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,858
Let's clear up the table.

83
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,540
Going on a road trip, huh?

84
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,691
- Yeah, yeah.

85
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:12,784
Well, you know what?

86
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,653
Better way to follow a comic con ...

87
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,971

famous UFO hot spots.

88
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:18,439
Huh?

00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:20,668

92
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:30,872
... then down to Rosewell, New Mexico,
for the sight of the famous crash in '47.

93
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,114
- Ah, no ...
- Everybody knows that.
- Stop it !

94
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,559
It's an alleged sight at this point.

95
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,288
But why would they admit the crash
if the crach happened somewhere else?

96
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,625
- Just agree to ...
- Agree to disagree.

97
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,073
- Again.
- That's what we ...

98
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,708
Do you believe in Aliens?

99
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,365
What do you mean, "Aliens"?

100
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,943
- I'll get rid of that ...
- I'll get it ...

101
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,677
... out of your way.

102
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:58,370
It's the worst thing.

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,446

104
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,935

We met Adam Shadowchild.

115
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,519
Who the hell is Adam
Shadowchild?

116
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,853
Oh,we wrote the "Venusian
Pangenesis".

00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,244
That's kind of a romance.

123
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,182
What you mean?
A woman and a machine?

124
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,227

Very funny.

135
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,569
You sit on top of that bull, right?

136
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,474
And he goes ... co-co-coues ! (?)

137
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:11,953

138
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:15,120

00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,505
How do you thinks
that makes me feel?

141
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:24,738
Be rude to me.

142
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,206

They got a soap dispencer like
an head of an aliens head.

148
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,188
It's brilliant !

149
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:41,061

150
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,035

What is this, some kind
of gay bar?

155
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,603
Nah, it's a place where you
can get a bite to eat and ...

156
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:03,790
... maybe share a close encounter.

157
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,386
Yep, sounds like a gay bar.

158
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,969
Oh ! Oh, no we're just friends.

159
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,481
So, you guys look like you
could do like a couple of beers.

160
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,115
You go do that !

161
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,463
All right, we can do that !

162
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,527
Yeah, yes.

163
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,089
Leave it, leave it.

164
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,457

166
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,828
Don't you put those queer eyes on me !

167
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:33,945
I forgot the sticker !

168
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,492
What took you so long?

169
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:36,617
I was putting the sticker up.

170
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,877

174
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,203
Oh !

175
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,804
That wasn't their truck, was it?

176
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,673
No ...

177
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:50,762
Should I go and have a look?

178
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,698
No ...

It's probably the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

183
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,715
Do you remember when we
googled it on your mom's computer and ...

184
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,562
... and the phone rang and you
thought that it was the FBI ?

185
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,055
I didn't really thinks it was the FBI.

186
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,314
- You started crying.
- I just ...

187
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,541
You never been to Brussels.

188
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:24,763
Go stand next to it.

189
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:25,948
Yep.

190
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:27,527
Smile.

191
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,569
It's good.

192
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,506
Imagine if we got buzzed by a craft.

193
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,137
Amazing, isn't it?

194
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:35,556
Smile.

195
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:40,359
What would you do if they actually landed?

196
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,248
Well, the first contact is a big
responsibility, isn't it?

197
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,690
They come in peace,
we go to pieces?

198
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,527
- That's not how i roll.
- Nah ...

199
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,241
Do you think, that's those men?

200
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:02,818
No ...

201
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,332
I think we've seen enough ...

202
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,136
Let's go ...

203
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,715
Go, go, go ... !

204
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,537
- Come on, get it ...
- This is like "Deliverence".

205
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,290
A rapist who break arms?

206
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,724
I don't want my arms broken !

207
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,149
Come on, the toilet ...

208
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,295
- You've just been ...
-You know I've god child's bladder.

209
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:31,395
Do not let 'em get past !

210
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:32,715
What you want me to do?
Ram them?

211
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:33,796
What about the deposit ?!

212
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:38,047
It's not them !

213
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,578
It's not them,
It's not them ...

214
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,872
Ah, oh my God ...

215
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,066
It was awful ...

216
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,306
Hello?

217
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,837
Maybe you should call for help.

218
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:52,966
It's ringing.

219
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,426
I wouldn't do that if i were you.

220
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,160
Put ... the phone ... down.

221
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:16,260
Oh, fuck me ...

222
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,366
What have you done to him ?!

223
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,129
I didn't do anything, he fainted.

224
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,100
But ... you made him faint !

225
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,507
Yes, but it's not like i set
my phaser to faint ...

226
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:24,732
You've got a phaser?

227
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,779
No ... I don't ... look !

228
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,604
Listen ...

229
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,156
Hey ... I really need your help. Ok?

230
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,601
Can we get this guy back in your wagon?

231
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,604
What ... whe ...

232
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,509
You're an alien !

233
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,484
To you, I am, yes.

234
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:37,484
Are you gonna probe us?

235
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,778
Why does everyone
always assume that?

236
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,650
What am I doing?
Am I harvesting farts?

237
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,994
How much can I learn from an ass?

238
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,203
What ... I ... what ...

239
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:46,729
I'm sorry, what's your name?

240
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,987
Graeme Willy

241
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,102
And what's his name?

242
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,289
Uh, that's the writer
Clive Gollings.

243
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,152
Ok, cool.
I'm Paul.

244
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:53,894
Paul?

245
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:54,830
Yeah.

246
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,728
It's a nickname, it stuck.
My ship crashed and i ...

247
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:58,639
... dog ! It doesn't matter.

248
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,368
Look, can we get Clive Gollings back
on the RV and get the hell outa here, please?

249
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,752
- I can't be ...
- I'm in a hell of a pickle ...

250
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,645
And if you don't help me,
I could die on this road tonight.

251
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,493
I don't know, we're in a
quite tight schedule ...

252
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:12,631
Look man ...

253
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,786
Sometimes you just gotta
roll the dice.

254
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,331
What do you say?

255
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,441
Okay.

256
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,128
Okay. Perfect, great !

257
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,246
Okay, help me, help me grab him.

258
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:32,882
This man's peed his pants.

259
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,068
Yeah, he's got childs bladder.

260
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,543
Oh, fantastic ...

261
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:56,539
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

262
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,376
Well, I ...

263
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:01,455
- I'm sorry, the speed limit is 70 ...
- Screw the speed limit !

264
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:06,163
Actually, no. Uh, don't screw it.
That's good thinking. Okay?

265
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,730
Stay conspicuous.
That's good.

266
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,107
How come i can understand you?
You using some sort of neoron language router?

267
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,985
Actually, I'm speaking English,
you fucking idiot !

268
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,684
Sorry ...

269
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,146
You're in shock right now.

270
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:21,068
I understand this must be very weird for you.

271
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,370
Just act normal and drive north.

272
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,519
Okay?

273
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,933
Gotta get as much as we can
between us and the Big Guy.

274
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,552
<i>Zoil?</i>

275
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:13,592
<i>What's happening?</i>

276
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,032
He's gone.

277
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:17,899
<i>Shit !</i>

278
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,573
<i>Looks like he hitched a ride too.</i>

279
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:22,021
<i>- What do you mean?
- Tire tracks.</i>

280
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:23,485
Bastard jacked a native ?!

281
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,547
<i>Could be too ...</i>

282
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,212
Don't you think this is a bit
of a coincidence?

283
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,967
Are you suggesting anew?

284
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,830
<i>The little fucker might've
found home.</i>

285
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,659
There might be a rescue party on the way.

286
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,433
Zoil, we need to break out the big guns.

287
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,169
Do you think that's wise?

288
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,891
The last thing we need is...

289
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,932
... a hu-ha ?!

290
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,227
Maybe you're right.

291
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:47,402
<i>Listen, I got 2 rookies on a
special mission 75 clicks north of you.</i>

292
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,525
<i>I'll have them set up a road block.</i>

293
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,861
These are just civillians,
why don't you let me take care of it?

294
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,593
<i>You might need the extra muscle.</i>

295
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:57,220
<i>Just keep 'em in the dark.
I don't want any loose ends.</i>

296
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:59,403
Well, these roads can be
treacherous at night.

297
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:03,383
People get in accidents ...

298
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,818
... all the time.

299
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,531
I like your thinking.
Get it done.

300
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,355
Heads up !

301
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,630
We just got reassigned.

302
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,669
Nice !

303
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,998
What about the sandwich?

304
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,248
- She said we could share it.
- I love this job.

305
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,603
I love pistachios.

306
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,912
I hate when you get a closed one, right?

307
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,559
I usually just bite them.

308
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,119
No, you don't do it at all.

309
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,220
They should be opened on their own way.

310
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:06,200
- No, that's mussels.
- No, I meant the pistachios ...

311
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:08,530
What are you doing ?!

312
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,265
He's ok, he's fine, he's friendly !!

313
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,239
His name's Paul !

314
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,475
Aliens aren't called Paul ...

315
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:19,703
Was that Klingon?

316
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,755
You psychotic nerd !

317
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:26,973
Listen, Paul is from a small M-Class planet
nothern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.

318
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,050
Thank you.

319
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,299
He looks too obvious !

320
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,586
There's a reason for that Clive !

321
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,819
Over the last 60 years, the human
race has been drip fed of images ...

322
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,787
... of my face, on lunch boxes,
and t-shirts and shit.

323
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:41,600
In case our species do meet,
you don't have a fuckin' spaz attack !!...

324
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,497
Don't do it again !

325
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:47,092
You fuckin' dorf, get
your fingers outta there !

326
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,047
If i get a jorf infection, you're dead !

327
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,166
Oh, my god !

328
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,139
Oh, shit ...

329
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:57,002
Paul ...

330
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,294
Paul?

331
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,847
Ok, ok, this could be it.

332
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,570
So, what are we looking for again?

333
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,898
I don't know.

334
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,278
What brings you to USA?

335
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,605
Uh, we're on holiday.

336
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,582
We've been to comic-con.

337
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,734
Comic-con?

338
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,566
Don't tell O'Rilley.
He loves that shit.

339
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,093
You guys know Benny Hill?

340
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,574
No ...

341
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,056
Oh my god, look at this !

342
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,673
- What ?!
- Look at this !

343
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,114
These guys met Adam Shadowchild.

344
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:32,307
Who the hell's
Adam Shadowchild?

345
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,847
He wrote the "Jupiter Praxis".

346
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:36,064
What?

347
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,117
"Jenny Starpepper
and the Huge White Gibbon"?

348
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,193
Huh?

349
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,812
"Night of the Moths"?

350
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,335
Are you speaking English?

351
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:44,630
He's ... brilliant ...

352
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:46,113
What was he like?

353
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,803
He was a bit intense.

354
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,005
Oh, he's an artist.

355
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,016
Let me see this.

356
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,960
What is this, nerd porn?

357
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,808
- Oh no, that's Clives ...
- It's my novel.

358
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:55,672
Okay ...

359
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,578
Uh ! Three tits !

360
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:58,770
That's awesome ...

361
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:01,112
You guys should've
given her 4 tits.

362
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,234
That's just sick !

363
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:04,922
I was just sayin'

364
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,003
Do you think this is it?

365
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:07,949
Not that full ...

366
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,739
What else did you find in there?

367
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,610
No, not much ...

368
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,012
Just some pissy jeans.

369
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,919
- Oh, Clive's got a child bladd....
- Shut up ...

370
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:16,116
Okay, you guys can go.

371
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,119
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

372
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,569
Can I have my novel?

373
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,538
Thank you very much.

374
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,846
May I ask what you're searching for?

375
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:25,192
No ...

376
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,785
Come on, Graeme.

377
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,917
- Way to go, Dirty Harry.
- You got that?

378
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,153
I ... did I catch you?
Oh my God, like a cold mechanic.

379
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,540
I think it's pretty obvious
what happened there isn't it?

380
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:44,447
Is it?

381
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,681
The government used some kind of
neoro toxic paint on the Black Mailbox.

382
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,741
Caused a shared hallucination
about aliens, it makes complete sense.

383
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:56,283
Oh !...

384
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:03,685
You're dick is gone ...

385
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:05,119
Oh, no ...

386
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:07,136
What?

387
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,123
Come on, grow up ...

388
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:10,715
You guys seen my shorts?

389
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,767
How did you do that?

390
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:13,852
How did you go invisible?

391
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,011
Oh, it's camouflage response.

392
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:17,025
Well, like "Predator"?

393
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,484
Exactly, altough i can only do it
while holding my breath.

394
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:20,633
You can do it anytime you want?

395
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,393
"Anytime".

396
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,297
That's just like it ...

397
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,511
Am I the only sane person here ?!

398
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:30,411
Eh ?!

399
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:32,435
It's allright for you, isn't it ?!

400
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,421
You'll go back to area 51 ...

401
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,508
... we'll be arrested for
harboring a fugutive !

402
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,639
And sent to Guantanamo Bay !

403
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,650
Why don't I go make
some bagels and coffee?

404
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,986
Leave you two alone.

405
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:47,472
What's the matter Clive?

406
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:52,079
There's an alien in the kitchen
making bagels and coffee.

407
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,981
- Did you want tea?
- No, I don't want tea !

408
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,531
Right, because tea is
weird in America, right?

409
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,215
They leave the baguette  ...

410
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:01,529
What's weird Graeme is that we
picked up an extra terrestrial ...

411
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,563
... hitch hiker and you seem
completely fine with it !

412
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:06,791
Bagels and coffee ...

413
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,518
Uh ! Marmite ...

414
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,774
He said his life's in danger.

415
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:12,247
He needs our help, you know?

416
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,618
Sometimes you just gotta
roll the dice.

417
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:20,257
What if we wake up and
find him inserting a probe ...

418
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:21,546
... into our anus?

419
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,310
Apparently they don't do that.

420
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,048
Anyone, want one of these?

421
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,563
Eh, anyone?

422
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,383
Anyone?

423
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:32,047
Eh?

424
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,134
48, 49, 50.

425
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,323
Coming, ready or not,
you son of a bitch ...

426
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,154
Where's the other one?

427
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,446
I don't know sir.

428
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,491
Uh ...

429
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:54,680
Haggard !

430
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,081
Sorry, we were just ...

431
00:23:58,527 --> 00:23:59,416
Haggard !

432
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,828
Fuck ...

433
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:05,493
Nice ... uh ...

434
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:08,272
Get over here ... it's
the guy with the badge.

435
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,247
We were just playing hide and seek ...

436
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,379
... so we have a lot of time.

437
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,054
Hurry up.

438
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:13,819
I was hiding.

439
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,580
You have any traffic through here?

440
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,088
No, just a couple of hillbilly types.

441
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,209
Two nerdes in an RV.

442
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:21,639
Nerds, huh?

443
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,456
Yes, they've come from comic-con !

444
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:24,923
They've met Adam Shadowchild !

445
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,936
Who the hell is
Adam Shadowchild?

446
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,867
He ... he wrote Prison Hawk 441.

447
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,226
Ok? Jenny Starpepper and
the Spinning Worm.

448
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:33,563
Right? Fluxing your anus.

449
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:35,220
You know you're grown man, right?

450
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:38,091
Probably shave, pay taxes?

451
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:39,271
Have pubic hair?

452
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,817
All of those things.

453
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:42,889
- Did you search that vehicle?
- Yes , sir.

454
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:43,576
What'd you find?

455
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,084
Uh, nothin' much, just ...

456
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,679
A book with a green woman with three...

457
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,974
- ... titties.
- Dude, it's three titties.

458
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,382
Three tits, that's awesome.

459
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:55,469
Oh, and some pissy jeans.

460
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,622
Close that.

461
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,623
Preexisting problem ...

462
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,561
Listen to me you freakin' fuck,
i want to know everyting you ...

463
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:03,961
... can remember about the
pissy nerds, ok?

464
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,004
We're leaving.

465
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,442
What about the road block, sir?

466
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:08,879
It didn't work.

467
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:29,773
Hey ! Rieces pieces !

468
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:31,975
Yes, thank you.

469
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:57,579
Heard there was a commotion
on the road after Rachel.

470
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,034
Funny, I didn't hear that.

471
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,842
It must've been the boys out to paste.

472
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,821
Hey.

473
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,771
That's a bit much, isn't it?

474
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:09,460
- What?
- Put it all back !

475
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,329
What about Paul's "Rieces Pieces"?

476
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,518
Just hurry up !...

477
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:17,994
No, you go ahead.

478
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,516
Thank you.

479
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,452
- Is that beast outside yours?
- What?

480
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:25,003
What do you mean "beast"?

481
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:25,973
Your RV?

482
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,340
Oh, the, yes ...

483
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,601
The RV is ....

484
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,088
Where are you boys from?

485
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,589
England.
England.

486
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,278
I heard about England.

487
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,755
No guns.

488
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:37,910
- No, not many.
- No ...

489
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,636
Not really, just you know ...

490
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:40,752
Farmers ...

491
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,082
How are police supposed to shoot anybody?

492
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,677
- They don't ...
- They try not to.

493
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:54,931
15.58 $

494
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,852
Um, 20. Keep the change.

495
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,188
And give it to charity or something.

496
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,892
You're amazing, Graeme !
That cop didn't suspect a thing !

497
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,288
And Clive ...

498
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,226
You didn't pee you pants.

499
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,021
I don't like to be stick in the mud but ...

500
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:17,088
You're asking a lot from us, right?

501
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:20,065
We just met, we don't know
where we're going, or why ...

502
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:22,292
You don't think we deserve an explanation?

503
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:25,582
Look ... the less you guys know the better.

504
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,565
I want you to have plausible deniability.

505
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,150
Let's just say, I spent a lot of time
in that base thinking i was a guest ...

506
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,421
Turns out ... I was a prisoner.

507
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:37,253
But don't worry.

508
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:39,766
I got it all under ... Ah !!

509
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:47,969
Fuck, that made me jump.

510
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:49,393
Poor little thing.

511
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:51,113
I don't know, you could've done mate.

512
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,247
Ew ... What are you doin'?

513
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:58,817
Just watch ...

514
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:24,813
It's a miracle !

515
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,304
Man, I'm gonna miss these ...

516
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:32,471
What would you do that?

517
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:34,557
I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am I?

518
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:44,419
<i>You got me thinking that I'm
wasting my time ...</i>

519
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,828
<i>Don't bring me down ... Oh guys !</i>

520
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:49,205
Eleven o'clock,
Twelve o'clock ...

521
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,314
Come on, it's fun !

522
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:53,654
If you think about it,
it's time travel ...

523
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,267
Eleven o'clock,
twelve o'clock ...

524
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:02,419
Yes, all right !

525
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:07,198
Let me see, let me see.

526
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,703
No, just sit still ...

527
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,373
You gonna try me like
one of your French girls, Jack?

528
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:15,947
I'm joking.

529
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:18,246
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
just don't make me look fat, ok?

530
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:20,679
- First gravity sats ass ...
- Paul !

531
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,722
Can I ask you a question?

532
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:23,516
Shoot !

533
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,386
Have you ever done that to a person?

534
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:29,332
Yes, I've eaten many people.

535
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,364
I'm joking big guy ! Relax ...

536
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:33,658
No, I mean you know, fix them.

537
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,644
Oh, no ! Not a dead person.
Recently dead bird, that's one thing ...

538
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,229
... dead person, whole other ball game.
It's actually really dangerous for me,

539
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,430
The damage can actually bounce back on to me ...

540
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,634
I'm sorry, am I boring you?
Have you heard this one before?

541
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:48,859
Are you tried saussage?

542
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,842
Don't call me that in front of him !

543
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:53,817
Are you tired though?

544
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:56,369
Eggie, I'm bushed !

545
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,163
You know what? We're all tired.

546
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,188
Let's just pull over and stop for the night.

547
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,953
We're fugutives Paul, all right?
I refuse to just ...

548
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:05,844
... sit around and wait around to
get fingered by the Men in Black.

549
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:10,050
Look, we just gotta find somewhere quiet,
and don't draw attention to ourselves.

550
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:12,356
But, where are we going, Paul?

551
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,402
Oh, you'll know it when you see it.

552
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:18,014
- Two white guys?
- Two, strange ...

553
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:19,776
Strange white guys, got it.

554
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,896
- Order anythig weird?
- Chocolate.

555
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:25,327
Chocolate, awkward.

556
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,912
<i>Zoil, report.</i>

557
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:31,580
We've tracked him into a gas
station in Eli, he maybe travelling ...

558
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,553
... in an RV with two men
from England.

559
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:35,173
New England?

560
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,864
<i>Old England.</i>

561
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:40,168
Creepy. What are they, MI6?

562
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:43,535
Negative, just couple of nerds
in the lam from comic-con.

563
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,658
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

564
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,990
<i>I think he's getting help
from the inside.</i>

565
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:54,642
<i>I want those nerds iced and
that little green prick get back ...</i>

566
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:57,090
<i>... in his fishbowl or dead, ASAP.</i>

567
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,900
<i>I'm closing in, I can feel it.</i>

568
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,406
<i>In 24 hours he'll wish he
never set foot on planet earth.</i>

569
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:04,739
Okay.

570
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,217
Here we are, this is the place.

571
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,790
<b>THE PEARLY GATES</b>

572
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:11,019
Yeah, this looks good.
Doesn't look like anyone's been murdered here.

573
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:18,011
Awfully quiet.

574
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:19,816
Quiet is good, Graeme.

575
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,107
Quiet is our friend.

576
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:24,905
Hi there !

577
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:27,638
There's a girl outside ...

578
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,156
Okay.

579
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:38,572
We're just a couple of regular guys
on a tour of the American Midwest.

580
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:40,293
I don't think she heard you.

581
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:42,671
I'm talking to you,
I'm talking to you.

582
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:43,716
Oh, sorry.

583
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:45,555
Hi.

584
00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:47,557
I'm Ruth Buggs.

585
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:51,988
Good evening Ruth,

586
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:54,862
This is my friends cohort

587
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,174
Um ...

588
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,850
Do you got room?

589
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:07,289
Sure, yeah, park in Bay 9.
It's 25 $ a night, including hook-ups ...

590
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,898

591
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:09,908
Okay.

592
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:18,932
There you go, It's
my passport.

593
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,516
The UK ...

594
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:22,590
I love the UK.

595
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,678
- Have you been ...
- No.

596
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,722
You should go.

597
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:27,808
Oh ...

598
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,361
Oh, no, no, no.
I mean, you should go to London.

599
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,928
There's a lot of places I wanna go.

600
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:34,940
RUTH !!

601
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:36,274

Well, I'll be by to get your money

603
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:41,688
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

604
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,343
And you, bye.

605
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:48,801
She was lovely.

606
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:52,268
You just marry her then.

607
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,112
- Boo !!
- Hey !

608
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:04,840
What took you so long?

609
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:06,740
I was just talking Papa.

610
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:08,652
You talk too much.

611
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:10,885
Sorry Papa.

612
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,231
Hello.

613
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:23,545
Want a cigarette?

614
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:25,210
No thanks, I don't smoke.

615
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,200
Can I ask you something?

616
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:30,957
Yeah, sure.

617
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,080
You and Graeme, you guys uh ...

618
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,205
What?

619
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:35,703
You know ...

620
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:40,853
You know ...

621
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:43,317
You guys, two guys ...

622
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,410
Aren't you getting me?

623
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,084
What you ...

624
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,016
- I don't know what you mean.
- Gay !  - No !!

625
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:10,386
Why do people keep saying that?

626
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:11,753
Nah, I'm just wondering ...

627
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:13,652
Totally cool, if you are.

628
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,638
Everyone's fine on my planet.

629
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,266
It's all about the pleasure thing.
You know I'm sayin'?

630
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,654
Why you here Paul?

631
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:23,512
Oh, I was on a science mission actually.

632
00:34:23,513 --> 00:34:28,121
And then I had some
spaceship related ... problems.

633
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:31,114
And I kinda ... crashed ...

634
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,919
Lucky for me though. This little
girl, she pulls me out of the wreck ...

635
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,272
... next thing i know, guys arrive
carv me up to the base.

636
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:40,519
What have you been doing here
all this time?

637
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,243
You know ...

638
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:44,400
Getting back man, I've been shootin' the shit ...

639
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,497
- ... I've been advising the Government.
- Not just the Government ...

640
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:51,816
- You I wanna have some kind of a
special power, you know?  - Yeah.

641
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:55,343
- Something messianic.
- Okay, Steven.

642
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:59,277
- Uh, how about cellular revelification?
- Yeah, I don't know what that is.

643
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:02,610
Oh, restoration of damaged tissiue
through telephatic manipulation ...

644
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,685
- ... of a transit field memory.
- What's that mean?

645
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,433
- It means, "healing" Mr Spielberg.
- Yeah, right.  - It's ok.

646
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,765
Like by touch or something like that like ...

647
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:13,044
... maybe its finger lights up when
he reaches out and touches.

648
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,478
Maybe, you know, somethimes
I find less is more.

649
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,500
Hey ... Trust me.

650
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,097
You'd be surprised how much he's
influenced popular culture over the last 60 years.

651
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,896
Agent Moulder was right.

652
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:26,564
- Agent Moulder was my idea !
- Really ?!

653
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:27,646
- Wow ...
- Yeah !

654
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,121
That's cool.

655
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:30,710
Honk that shit Earth-Man.

656
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,111
I like this song.

657
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:34,250
Harvard's my boy.

658
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:37,121
Come on.

659
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:38,872
Break it down a bit boys.

660
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:40,818
Don't be afraid.

661
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,369
Yeah, look at me, I'm breaking it down.

662
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,112
Use them tongs !

663
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,090
Get those tongs !

664
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,927
Stope the fire ...

665
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,060
Yes.

666
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,701
Ruth !! Prayers !

667
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:22,069
I don't know the rest of this song.

668
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,436
No one does.

669
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,068
Uhh, who's knocking?

670
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,236
Stop this.

671
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,766
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, shut up ...

672
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,736
I'll hide in here.

673
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:46,907
- Don't come out.
- Why would I come out?

674
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,196
- Who is it?
- It's Ruth.

675
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,935
Don't you dare opening
that door ...

676
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:52,610
- Hi there.
- Hi.

677
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,298
Good morning.

678
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,729
May I come in?

679
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,007
- No.
- Yeah, Come on in.

680
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,265
- No, no, no.
- Make yourself at home.

681
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:59,299
Not really dressed.

682
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,189
So, where's the other one?

683
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,810
The other one?

684
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:06,569
It's just ...

685
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,491
Oh, oh, it's ok.
We don't charge by the person.

686
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,984
There were three shadows i saw
dancing around the RV last night, right?

687
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,567
- The other one ...
- Oh ...

688
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:16,409
I'm in the can.
I ate a ...

689
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,177
... a closed pistachio.

690
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:20,755
I'm paying for it.

691
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:24,102
It's a nice t-shirt.

692
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,007
Oh thanks, I got it at my church.

693
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:28,704
"EVOLVE THIS"
- It's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin.

694
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,332
Why would Jesus wanna
shoot Charles Darwin?

695
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,012
Because of his blasphemous theories?

696
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,272
Are you men of God?

697
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:44,338
We're men of science ...
You know, we believe in the ...

698
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:48,299
... establishment of a biological order
through the maelstrom of physical ...

699
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,406
... and chemical chaos.

700
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:53,774
The world is 4000 years old and can only
be the product of an intelligent design.

701
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,213
That's whoreshit !!

702
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,415
Um ... alright ...

703
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:05,046
Well then, please explain how something as complex
as the human eye simply just comes into being?

704
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:07,129
Just come into being ?!
It's the combination of ...

705
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,339
... billions of years of development
and cost countless species !

706
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,061
What are you talking about ?!

707
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:13,899
Evolution baby !!

708
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:15,946
Blasphemy !

709
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:19,065
- Blasphemy ?!  - Nothing that you can
say can shake my beliefs. Perfect.

710
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:22,452
And the short and certain knowledge that
God made Heaven and Earth and ...

711
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,209
... created us all in his own image.

712
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,089
- His own image ?!
- Yeah ...

713
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,670
Well, I got a question ...

714
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,253
How do you explain me ?!

715
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,092
She's goin'. She's fallin'
Catch ...

716
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,592
And that's Jenga.

717
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,792
Why did you do that ?!

718
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:41,074
I ... just ... she fainted !

719
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:42,188
We've gone through this !

720
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,845
But we have to take her with us now !

721
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:46,012
- No ! No !
- What ...

722
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:49,130
This is America. Kidnapping a Christian,
that's worse than harboring a fugutive.

723
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:50,358
Yeah, but she's seen you !

724
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,845
If we leave, she's gonna call the police !

725
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,449
No one's gonna believe this
God bothering cyclop ...

726
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,780
... let's just dump her on the road !

727
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,363
- Just roll her up on the road ...
- No, we can't risk that !

728
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:01,563
If we take us, then we
can get her on our side.

729
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:03,293
Yeah, you'd love her to
get her on our side, wouldn't you?

730
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:04,737
That doesn't make sense.

731
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,871
Look, she'll be fine.
We're quite nice !

732
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:09,994
All right. What about my passport?

733
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,407
Oh, God ... Guys.

734
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:15,761
"JESUS has the right of way"

735
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:24,367
Uh, no !!...

736
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,135
Hollings
Clive
British Subject

737
00:39:37,136 --> 00:39:39,356
Oh, yes ...

738
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:41,952
Ruth, what in the Lord's name ...

739
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:43,963
Morning ...

740
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,720
Morn ...

741
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,686
Go, go, go, go, go !! ...

742
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:56,719
Oh fuck !

743
00:39:57,821 --> 00:39:59,232
Shook yourself daemon !

744
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,895
Where are you ?!
Where are you ?!

745
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:03,119
Passport, passport !!

746
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,665
Jump, jump !!

747
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,134
What? That's actually small
on my planet.

748
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,869
<b>FUCK YOU</b>

749
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:34,212
Um, Ruth?

750
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,533
Hello, Ruth.
Would you like a cup of tea?

751
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:41,250
Where am I?

752
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:44,775
Hey, look who's awake?

753
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,079
Daemon ! Daemon !

754
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,923
No, no, we're sorry,
we're not gonna hurt you, i promise.

755
00:40:49,924 --> 00:40:52,131
And we'll let you go as
soon as we can.

756
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,386
You've been decieved by an agent
of Satan himself.

757
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:55,251
He's evil !

758
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,677
I'm sitting right here, come on !

759
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:59,016
No, no, he's not evil.
He's just a bit rude.

760
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:00,529
We're trying to help him get home.

761
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,183
He's from another world.

762
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,384
There's only one world.
Our world !

763
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:06,001
The world that God, the
father created !

764
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:09,254
Hey, if it makes feel any better,
my existence only disproves ...

765
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:11,602
... the traditional notions of
Abraham and todays notion of Chrisian God.

766
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,016
As well as all thrology,
that's all i meant.

767
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:16,574
<i>Amazing Grace ...</i>

768
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,519
<i>... How sweet the sound ...</i>

769
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,931
What is with you people ?!

770
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:23,764
Ruth, just listen to me for
one second, if you could just calm down ...

771
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:26,855
I can't ... drive like this.

772
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:31,579
Fuck this !

773
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,411
What did you do to her ?!

774
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:51,666
I just transfered my collective knowledge and
experience through her tactile psyscho connective bridge.

775
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,278
Oh, wow, could you do me?

776
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,753
It really takes the head of me.

777
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:55,728
Oh, come on, please.

778
00:41:55,729 --> 00:42:01,896
Oh, wow ...

779
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,695
Oh, yeah ...

780
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:06,415
He always knew what was
going on at Battlestar before me ...

781
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,286
... 'cause his mom had cable.

782
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:09,334
Fine, pull over, I'll do you.

783
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:11,205
Absolutely not, no spoilers !

784
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,630
I didn't call the Government !
I called the police !

785
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,692
This is not the police's area
of expertise Mr Buggs.

786
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:22,138
That devil took my doughter.

787
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,398
What do you mean "devil"?

788
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:26,022
And your doughters name
is Ruth, is it?

789
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:26,775
That's right.

790
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:29,626
I brought her up by myself
after her momma died.

791
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:35,818
Yeah, she's pretty easy to spot.
She's got this eye thing since she was 4 years old.

792
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,524
Do you have a phone here
that your doughter might try to ...

793
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:41,062
... reach you at if she
decides to call?

794
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,008
Yeah, in the back.

795
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,553
Hey, Peter Parker.

796
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:46,580
Wanna put the snappy down and
get to the phone?

797
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:47,727
Right ...

798
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:49,884
She'll call me if she can.

799
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:52,306
You mentioned it when ...

800
00:42:58,547 --> 00:42:59,501
Fuck you ...

801
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:01,727
Here we go.

802
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:03,102
Boys, to the car.

803
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:05,695
Sir ...

804
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:07,584
Might tell us what we're looking for?

805
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,775
Yeah, what are we looking for?

806
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:11,263
I told you this is a
need to know operation.

807
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,875
Yes ... sir.

808
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:14,314
But ...

809
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:16,540
Sh ... Dammit ...

810
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:20,812
<i>Sir, i think it's time you tell us.</i>

811
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:23,120
<i>Hey, just do what the fuck i tell you, Haggard.</i>

812
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:27,281
<i>Now, let's go find that crazy old bastards
little girl before it's too late.</i>

813
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:35,158
Ruth !

814
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,420
Ruth, wait !

815
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:38,471
Leave me alone !

816
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:40,643
Please, please stop, i got shin splints !

817
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:46,449
He ... he can not be from space.
It's not possible !

818
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,601
Okay? He's from somewhere else !

819
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:50,798
Look, Ruth, you saw it
for yourself, okay?

820
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:51,780
He showed you.

821
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:54,155
There's probably billions of intelligent
civilizations out there.

822
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:55,876
So, where is everybody?

823
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,604
I ... but ... one of them's there !

824
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,613
Are they lookin' ?
Are they lookin' ?

825
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:02,274
Are they lookin' right now ?!

826
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:03,821
Sorry !

827
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:07,343
That's pathetic ...

828
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:11,907
What's your beef Clive?

829
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,011
I don't have beef.

830
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:17,718
I'm from outer space ...

831
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:21,088
... you're a science fiction writer.
We should be best buds.

832
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,808
It's not you.

833
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,497
It's me.

834
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:33,409
Is that what this is?
You're jealaous of ... her ?!

835
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:36,751
It's not just that.

836
00:44:37,862 --> 00:44:38,769
Whoa ...

837
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,392
Of me ?!

838
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:46,015
Oh my ... This is because me and
Graeame got like 2 minutes when you were asleep?

839
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,016
- Is that what this is?
- I wanted it to be special, you know?

840
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:51,419
I've dreamt about meeting you.

841
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,186
Ever since I saw Mac and Me.

842
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:55,661
And I blew it.

843
00:44:55,662 --> 00:44:58,221
Now you two are friendly and ...

844
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:00,310

845
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:01,142
Where am I ?!

846
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:03,053
Come on man !

847
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:05,354
This ... is special.

848
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:07,393
You guys being all nerdy and shit.

849
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:09,700
And meeting me, that is fate.

850
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:12,618
Who cares if you pissed your pants man?

851
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:16,843
When I first got here, first time
I saw you, I puked.

852
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:22,057
You guys are weird lookin',
you've giant bodies, tiny ...

853
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:22,779
... tiny heads.

854
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,373
You're just being nice now.

855
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,535
Look, do you want it sugar?

856
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,970
It's just knowledge and experience man.
You're a writer. Might give you some inspiration.

857
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:36,805
Will it hurt?

858
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:38,396
Only if you struggle.

859
00:45:39,555 --> 00:45:40,406
Allright.

860
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:52,457
So there's no heaven, no hell.
No right, no wrong, no sin.

861
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,433
What ...

862
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,656
- I can drink.
- If you like.

863
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:58,956
- I can fornicate.
- Maybe.

864
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,300
- I can curse.
- Well, yeah.  - Penises !

865
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:06,882
- Ruth ...  - Assing hairy
boobs poop, farting, butt holes !

866
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:08,309
Ruth, I'm not sure this is helping !

867
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,575
Wha ... what are you doing ?!

868
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:12,406
Ha ... stop it !

869
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:14,023
Why ?! Why should i stop ?!

870
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,089
This is ...

871
00:46:20,384 --> 00:46:21,329
Because ...

872
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,525
You have your whole life
to explore new things.

873
00:46:24,526 --> 00:46:25,763
Okay?

874
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:27,730
Doesn't necessarily mean ..

875
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:29,850
You should be exploring mine right now ...

876
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:33,768
You ...

877
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:35,896
You said you wanted to travel, allright?

878
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:38,012
To see like new stuff.
This is your chance !

879
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:40,308
I ... I really think you
should come with us.

880
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:42,687
Where would i sleep?

881
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:45,612
I'll sleep on the sofa.
And then you can have my bed.

882
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:48,469
You know? But I'd push the
tissues off with a pen if i were you ...

883
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:49,745
... because I've had a cold.

884
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,020
Oh ...

885
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:00,717
Ruth has decided that she would
like to come with us.

886
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:03,841
Wicked ...

887
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:06,252
I'm gonna go refreshen up.

888
00:47:06,253 --> 00:47:08,634
Hey. Ruth !

889
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:09,899
Wait up

890
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,591
You don't smoke.

891
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:13,856
I just wanted to say thanks.

892
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:16,517
I know this is been weird for you, but ...

893
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:18,068

894

Okay?

How did you know that?

900
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:31,560
Lucky guess.

901
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:34,035
Do you mind if i take a
look at it for one second?

902
00:47:40,146 --> 00:47:42,550
What does it say in the Old
Testament? An eyer for an eye?

903
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:45,283
Wait ... i don't ...

904
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:46,994
It's okay. You can trust me.

905
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:47,855
I don't know.

906
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:50,118
Just have a little faith, ok?

907
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:20,549
How did you do that?

908
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,157
Evolution baby.

909
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,867

Uh? See, it's easy.

Small corrections Paul,
make small corrections.

917

Get to the right !!

918
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:01,318
Hey there sleepy face ...

919
00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:05,385
Fuckaroo, that was the best
titty farting sleep I've ever had.

920
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:09,765
Uh ... I gotta feeling that you're
new to cursing Ruth ...

921
00:50:09,766 --> 00:50:12,392
Look, cursing's fun,
you just gotta pick your moments, ok?

922
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:16,222
Hey, maybe we should stop for some food,
is anybody hungry?

923
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,468
Fuck yeah !

924
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:19,928
- Ruth ?
- You bet your big fat cock I am !

925
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:20,929
Nice !

I'm starvin' ...

927
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,345
What's new "fat hair" ?

928
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:28,154
It's not fat Paul, it's power.

929
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:29,958
- Fat power.  - It's rude.
- You're rude.

930
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,489
Maybe you should call my dad.

931
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,033
What ?!

932
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:33,159
What? Why?

933
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,820
I've been gona for a whole day,
and if he calls the police ...

934
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:37,253
... they're gonna be looking for us.

935
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:40,816
If I don't there's a good chance
that we all end up in Shit Butt City.

936
00:50:40,817 --> 00:50:42,601
You're really getting the hang of this.

937
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:44,015
Thanks dick-milk.

00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,217

<i>Listen to me carefully.
I want you to tell me where you are.</i>

944
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:41,603
Who is this?

945
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,888
My name is Agent Zoil and it's very
important you tell me where you are ...

946
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:47,801
... and where you are headed Miss Buggs.

947
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,915
I ... I ... can't tell you.

948
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,548
I mean, I ... don't ... know.

949
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:57,259
You've been abducted. The individual
that you're travelling with is highly dangerous.

950
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,973
<i>Oh no, he's not dangerous.
I mean, he's kind of rude ...</i>

<i>He curses a lot ...</i>

952
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:03,454
And a couple of times I've seen
him scratch his ...

... space man ... balls.

extremely worried about you ...

you home Miss Buggs.

No, that is exactly what they'll
expect us to do, trust me !

Find somewhere to chill.

Couple hillbilly types in the back
of that meat wagon won't stop crying.

1019
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:45,367
Did you gentlemen see anything
unusual this evening?

1020
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:50,063
Are we sure?

I'll tell you, tell you, that's just funny.

1025
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,971
It was when you
kiss me yesterday.

1026
00:56:18,972 --> 00:56:21,235
- Sorry.
- No.

1027
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,520
I was like, "Girl for you rapists !"

1028
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:31,033
Do it again if you like.

1029
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,063
What?

1030
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:34,504
Said, you can do it
again if you like.

1031
00:56:36,331 --> 00:56:37,430
Really?

1032
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:40,729
If you're gonna try it, then maybe
you should do it with a friend, you know ...

1033
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,156
... rather than some stranger, because,
there's a lot weirdos out there.

1034
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,220
Oh, I am planning on doing a lot of kissing ...

1035
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:48,616
... and fornicating so ...

1036
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,462
... you'd really be helping me out.

1037
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:51,655
Great.

1038
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:54,588
Wh ... what ... do you mean now?

1039
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:55,641
- I tought, ...
- Yeah, I did but ...

1040
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:56,867
We could, let's do it now.

1041
00:56:56,868 --> 00:56:58,231
- I mean,
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:58,232 --> 00:57:00,495
Um, my hands on you ...

1043
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:01,781
Staying here ...

1044
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:04,203
Hold steady ...

1045
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:11,944
Fuck ! I'm sorry.
I tought I was gonna pass out ...

1046
00:57:12,677 --> 00:57:13,964
Carry on ...

1047
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:17,479
- How's that mate?
- Nothin' nothin', just hangin' around.

1048
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,271
They were about to make out.

1049
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:21,336
It was awkward ! ...

1050
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,854
We were just ...

1051
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:25,568
Good ...

1052
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:27,271

1053
00:57:32,773 --> 00:57:33,911

Are you sure?
It's pretty strong shit.

1057
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:44,981
I got it from the military actually.
This is the stuff that killed Dylan.

1058
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:45,918
Bob Dylan is not dead.

1059
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:47,677
Isn't he?

1060
00:57:49,742 --> 00:57:50,726
Hit me.

1061
00:57:50,727 --> 00:57:53,942
Ok, just ... you know ... go easy on it.

1062
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:55,942
Ruth ...

1063
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:57,169
A little bit, a little bit.

1064
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:08,336
It's not so bad.

1065
00:58:08,337 --> 00:58:10,840
To be fair, it takes a while
to be absorbed in.

1066
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,106
Oh, shit ...

1067
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:20,690
I'm hungry. We should
cook up some saussages.

1068
00:58:20,691 --> 00:58:22,056
Do we have any saussages?

1069
00:58:22,057 --> 00:58:23,776
What do you mean by that?

1070
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,615
Why do you guys hate me?

1071
00:58:25,616 --> 00:58:27,447
Can we go cook up
some saussages?

1072
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:30,157
Oh, I have waspes in my brain !

1073
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,886
She'll be fine ...

1074
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,336
That happened to me the first time.

1075
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:38,968
Paul ...

1076
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:41,149
I was gonna ask ...

1077
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,291
you know us right?

1078
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:45,543
Yeah, Graeme we're
like modified BFF.

1079
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,113
Why are you in such
a hurry to leave now?

1080
00:58:50,114 --> 00:58:57,464
Well, according to the Government,
I fulfilled my usefulness.

1081
00:58:57,465 --> 00:59:01,466
I told them eveything I know,
the only thing I've left off for them now ...

1082
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:02,850
... are my abilities.

1083
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:06,349
The healing, the thought transfer,
the camouflage.

1084
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:09,957
In order to cultivate those abilities,
they need some of my stem cells.

1085
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,224
And I'm not really down with that.

1086
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:15,478
Lucky for me, I do have
one friend left on the inside.

1087
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:18,139
So, a man should get
SOS a beamed into space ...

1088
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:21,022
... I got my people primed
and ready to pick me up.

1089
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:24,497
Then, motherfuckers brought the
procedure forward by a day ...

1090
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:25,689
... and my whole plan goes to shit !

1091
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,706
What happened?

1092
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,130
The way at the labs?

1093
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,318
I zapped my ass, I stole his car
I took off.

1094
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,168
Found you guys.

1095
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,714
So what happends if you get cought?

1096
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:36,872
Graeme ...

1097
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,464
They're gonna cut out my brain.

1098
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:40,720
Oh ...

1099
00:59:41,764 --> 00:59:43,120
Yeah, it's fucked.

1100
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,847
It's kind of a buzzkill.

1101
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,534
Let's lighten the mood shall we ...

1102
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:48,878
... Clive, when did you last get laid?

1103
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:52,211
Oh, hmm ...

1104
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:57,283
- Connect many at London(?) '08
- '08 ...

1105
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:58,257
Ewok chick ...

1106
00:59:58,258 --> 01:00:01,195
Clive likes boning space bears !...

1107
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:02,636
Shut up !

1108
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:05,281
Clive, seroiusly, be honest with me.

1109
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,425
What was it like?

1110
01:00:07,426 --> 01:00:08,909
Well ...

1111
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,192
She was furry nice ...

1112
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:13,580
Oh ! This is gonna say !

1113
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:14,930
Uh, that's gross !

1114
01:00:20,994 --> 01:00:22,469
Hey Clive ...

1115
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:26,306
- Oh, Boomer it's forbidden.
- Hey Clive ...

1116
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,914
Clive !
Let's go guys !

1117
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:31,366
We gotta get outa here.

1118
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,399
Where's Ruth?

1119
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:41,920
She went back to the RV.

1120
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:47,256
'course ...
He can read minds !

1121
01:00:47,257 --> 01:00:48,191
Come on ...

1122
01:00:48,192 --> 01:00:49,757
<b>GONE BACK
2 RV. XR</b>

1123
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:53,899
Uh, guys, I think we have
a slight problem over here.

1124
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:58,574
Uh ... man.

1125
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:02,213
I can't hold my breath the whole
way through town.

1126
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:05,018
Wait here ...

1127
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:09,049
Wait, Oi, Wait ...

1128
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:22,081
Morning. Agent Zoil, Secret
Service. Do you mind if I come ...

1129
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,388
... in there and ask you
a few questions?

1130
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:24,540
Not at all ...

1131
01:01:32,216 --> 01:01:32,946
Morning.

1132
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,175
Why are we holding hands?

1133
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:42,163
- So we look like a family.
- Yeah, the fuckin' Freedmants.

1134
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:44,669
- You could be a midget.
- You're obsessed with midgets ...

1135
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:47,787
- No, I'm not.
- Stop it, just act normal.

1136
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:52,435
Ok, we're just a couple of ragular guys
walking down the street with a small cowboy.

1137
01:01:52,436 --> 01:01:53,528
Allright Clive?

1138
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:55,034
Clive?...

1139
01:01:55,035 --> 01:01:57,012
- Clive ...
- Oh, come on !

1140
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:03,015
Katana
249.99 $

1141
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:04,197
Clive, what're you doing?

1142
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:05,852
Yeah man, what the fuck ?!

1143
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:07,063
I want it ...

1144
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:09,259
Well I can appreciate the bargain
and everything but this is ...

1145
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,580
... not Comic-Con, Clive,
this is reality.

1146
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,521
False economy anyway, you'll
break the fist time you use it, let's go.

1147
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:15,639
Why would I ever use it?

1148
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,939
Can we just go please?

1149
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,062
Wait ... maybe we should go inside.

1150
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:21,169
- What ?!
- We'll hide out.

1151
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,433
You go back and get Ruth.

1152
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,390
Get the RV, pick us up in 10 minutes.

1153
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:25,465
You sure?

1154
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,621
Trust me ...

1155
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:36,800
Morning. My name is Agent Zoil,
Secret Service, mind if I come in ...

1156
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,649
- ... and ask you a few questions?
- Um ...

1157
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,946
No, do you mind if we just
do it right here?

1158
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:41,982
Okay.

1159
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:43,506
This placeis a real ...

1160
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:45,278
... cock suckin' mess.

1161
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,199
Got it.

1162
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:52,024
I'm telling you.
We're looking for a goddamn alien.

1163
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:54,710
I thought all that Project
Bluebook stuff was whoreshit.

1164
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:56,220
Nah, it all makes sense.

1165
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:58,022
I mean, all this hush hush crap ...

1166
01:02:58,023 --> 01:02:59,537
... the drawing that I found ...

1167
01:02:59,538 --> 01:03:01,847
And what do you think that
girl was talking about last night?

1168
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:04,402
Holy shit ! Spaceman balls ...

1169
01:03:04,403 --> 01:03:06,664
Yeah, and who has
spaceman balls?

1170
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:08,175
Buzz Aldrin?

1171
01:03:08,176 --> 01:03:09,220
Be serious.

1172
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,842
"Encounter Brief"
- Hello, handsome.

1173
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:22,218
Is that you?

1174
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,870
Oh, huh?

1175
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:25,565
Is that you on the cover?

1176
01:03:26,876 --> 01:03:28,405
I ... no ...

1177
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:30,328
What's your name?

1178
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:31,442
Keith Nash.

1179
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:34,042
Nice to meet you.
I'm Paul.

1180
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,925
- Right.
- So ... uh ...

1181
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:37,148
You're not freaked out by me?

1182
01:03:38,509 --> 01:03:39,983
Mmh, yes and no.

1183
01:03:41,095 --> 01:03:42,946
You mind taking a look
in these photographs,

1184
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:44,827
... tell me if you recognise
anyone of these gentlemen ...

1185
01:03:44,827 --> 01:03:46,130
... or the one-eyed girl?

1186
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:48,282
Mam?

1187
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,565
No ...

1188
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:51,050
Anything, anything at all?

1189
01:03:53,547 --> 01:03:55,546
- I mean, look this is an alien?
- Yeah ...

1190
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:57,780
- This is huge.
- I know.

1191
01:03:57,781 --> 01:03:59,687
- This is huge ...
- I know ...

1192
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:01,345
Is that a comic book shop?

1193
01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:02,717
Can we go in there?

1194
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:04,233
Maybe.

1195
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:05,565
If you're good.

1196
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:07,649
Thanks so much for your
time Misses ...

1197
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,480

- Thanks ...
- Yeah, it's good.

1202

01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,912
Um, how much is that?

1210
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:53,699
The sword, 299.99.
Plus tax.

1211
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:55,168
Ok, I'll have it now.

01:04:56,038 --> 01:04:57,970
Come on man, let's go !

Chute, it's like a cufflink thing.

1215
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:25,798
Spaceman balls?

1216
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,805
Get your goddamn hands off

1217
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,888

O'Reilly ! You dumm shit

Holy Mary Mother of  God ...

01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:02,846
I gotta quit smoking ...

1222
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:16,685
- Shit !
- Come up behind me !

1223
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,124
Hurry up, butt-crocks !

1224
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,487
Hey look, it's that nerd.

1225
01:06:22,998 --> 01:06:24,247
Whoa whoo !
Yeah !

1226
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:27,367
- Who's that kid?
- Keith Nash !  Punch it !

1227
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:29,982
Wait, who's that kid ?!

1228
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:38,742
Come on buddy, let's go !

1229
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,603
Woah, woah, what's goin' on?
Did you guys get me some information?

1230
01:06:42,604 --> 01:06:45,215
- We saw it, we saw the alien.
- It was in the comic book shop ...

1231
01:06:45,215 --> 01:06:46,668
... hidious, I think I shit my pants !

1232
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,126
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

1233
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:50,552
You know what ?!

1234
01:06:50,553 --> 01:06:53,827
You know exactly what we're

I'm sick and tired of you the d ....

1236
01:06:56,607 --> 01:07:00,486
Where ... the ... fuck ... did ... he ... go?

1237
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:01,990
I got two doors for you.

1238
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:03,073
I got mine.

1239
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:05,637
With, with those nerds.

1240
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:09,599
So ... you wanna follow us ... big guy?

1241
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,711
- You kids are gonna back to the base,
- Uh huh ...?

1242
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:14,897
You guys gonna stick behind.
Do a little adult work, now ...

1243
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,500
... tell me which way the
little green guy went.

1244
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,092
North, north east highway !

1245
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:19,207
North east highway.

1246
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,253
Stragiht home now.

1247
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:26,584
Sorry guys, it's my dad !

1248
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:29,813
This guy doesn't quit !
Kinda have to respect it.

1249
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:40,044
- Oh God, Graeme, drive faster !
- Oh wait !  - Calm down.

1250
01:07:40,045 --> 01:07:41,527
Asshordes are gonna catch us !

1251
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:43,828
- Hey calm down, pull over !
- What do you mean "pull over" ?!

1252
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:44,650
Pull over !!

1253
01:08:03,962 --> 01:08:06,666
Allright ... that's it ...
this is too dangerous ...

1254
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,576
... I'm ... I can make it on my
own from here.

1255
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:09,506
- What do you mean ...
- No !

1256
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:11,086
Graeme, you've done enough.

1257
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,870
I'll boost a car or something,
I can drive an automatic !

1258
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:15,314
You're a terrible driver !

1259
01:08:15,315 --> 01:08:17,305
He's right Paul, you can't
even drive a spaceship.

1260
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:20,295
I'm close now.
I'll be fine !

1261
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,762
Oh, but we've come all this way !

1262
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:23,337
Yeah, and at what cost, huh ?!

1263
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:25,704
I've shaken your faith,
I've almost got you guys killed !

1264
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,828
I just want to get home ...

1265
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:31,472
You are going home, I think we've
come too far to let you do this alone !

1266
01:08:31,473 --> 01:08:33,365
Yeah ! What happened to BFF's ?!

1267
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:34,976
We're in this together Paul !

1268
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,611
You bet your hairy love eggs we are !

1269
01:08:37,612 --> 01:08:40,286
The last 72 hours have been
the ride of my life and ...

1270
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:42,477
... I'm fucked if I'm getting
off this bus now !

1271
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:44,393
- Yeah, me too.
- And me.

1272
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:46,011
Well that settles it.

1273
01:08:46,012 --> 01:08:47,638
We're all fucked.

1274
01:08:49,663 --> 01:08:51,853
Thank you guys, so much ...

1275
01:08:51,853 --> 01:08:55,607
... if if if you're absolutely sure,
there's a little somethin' you can do for me.

1276

1278
01:09:04,465 --> 01:09:05,871
Seems rather fitting.

1279
01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:07,147
Hmm.

1280
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:10,815
That wasn't good
at there was it?

1281
01:09:10,816 --> 01:09:12,292
Cool.

1282
01:09:12,293 --> 01:09:13,659
Hello.

That'll ve 299.99
plus tax.

1284
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,210
Hmm, same as the swords.

1285
01:09:22,973 --> 01:09:23,880
Look, they're running.

1286
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:26,935
- Holy shit ! Get the door !
- Oh, shit ! Can you drive this thing ?!

1287
01:09:26,936 --> 01:09:28,555
I've been driving these
things my whole life.

1288
01:09:31,604 --> 01:09:32,886
Come on, get in, get in !

1289
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:36,338
Praiseful !

1290

<i>Zoil, picked up a 911
outside of prospect.</i>

1291

<i>Fireworks store just got ripped off
by two British nerds in an RV.</i>

1292
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:49,786
Son of a bitch !

1293
01:09:49,787 --> 01:09:53,062
<i>According to the local, they're
on the 14th. 40 miles west of you.</i>

1296

I don't know man. I don't
know, he looks awful mad.

1311
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:41,583
Fuck him. He's a dinosaur.
It's time for some new blood.

1312
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:49,834
Welcome to
MOORCROFT

1313
01:10:49,835 --> 01:10:51,684
Ok, we're nearly there.

1314
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:53,057
This is where we've been headed?

1315
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:55,751
No, I ... I just need a
little stop first, ok?

1316
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,085
Do you think we really got
time to be making little stops Paul?

1317
01:10:58,086 --> 01:11:00,245
This is something
I really have to do.

1318
01:11:01,522 --> 01:11:03,767
Ok, stop here,
that's good.

1319
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:04,454
That's close enough.

1320
01:11:09,492 --> 01:11:10,995
Shouldn't we park a bit closer?

1321
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:11,954
No ...

1322
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,855
We don't wanna scare her.

1323
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,231
Scare who?

1324
01:11:17,688 --> 01:11:19,923
- You knock.  - You knock.
- I always knock.

1325
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:22,395
Who's there ?!

1326
01:11:22,396 --> 01:11:25,794
Uh ... Is that Tara Walton?

1327
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:27,878
Leave me alone !

1328
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:33,032
Miss Walton !
My name is Clive Gollings !

1329
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:35,477
I'm here with my friend
Mr Graeme Willy !

1330
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:42,024
Now, what do you want?

1331
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:47,779
We're here with the alien
that killed your dog 60 years ago.

1332
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,810
Let's go, let's just go.

1333
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:56,227
What is this, some
kind of a joke ?!

1334
01:12:00,711 --> 01:12:01,440
Hey Tara !

1335
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:06,369
You ...

1336
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,320
It's a very loud clock, isn't it?

1337
01:12:16,406 --> 01:12:18,591
You have a nerve
showing your face here.

1338
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:20,063
All these years ...

1339
01:12:22,106 --> 01:12:23,661
Maybe I should make some tea.

1340
01:12:23,662 --> 01:12:25,066
I'll do it.

1341
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,777
Huh, ok.

1342
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:43,182
Uh, look, Tara I ...

1343
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:46,103
I only just stopped
believing in you, you know?

1344
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:48,802
I've spent a very
long time trying to ...

1345
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:51,050
... convince folks about what
happened that night.

1346
01:12:51,051 --> 01:12:53,424
Everyone said I was mad !

1347
01:12:54,756 --> 01:12:58,672
They told me it was a meteor that
squashed little Paul.

1348
01:12:58,673 --> 01:13:02,298
They said that I was
concussed hallucinating ...

1349
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:03,690
... but I knew you were real !

1350
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:07,072
I pulled you from that
spaceship myself.

1351
01:13:07,073 --> 01:13:10,012
I kept you warm and
comfartable and sat there ...

1352
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,224
... with you 'til the
men came to take you away.

1353
01:13:13,552 --> 01:13:16,196
Well, word got
out about my story.

1354
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:19,921
Kids used to come and
throw stones at the house.

1355
01:13:19,922 --> 01:13:21,067
Call me names.

1356
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,810
Then, I just hid myself away.

1357
01:13:26,356 --> 01:13:29,518
I spent whole nights up
staring at the sky hoping ...

1358
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:30,947
... that I catch a glimpse of you.

1359
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,587
And here you are.

1360
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:39,804
Um, I'm sorry, you know
if I could've done it any other way ...

1361
01:13:39,805 --> 01:13:41,565
Oh, it's ok.

1362
01:13:41,566 --> 01:13:43,646
You're real.

1363
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:45,580
That's all that matters.

1364
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:49,523
I was sure of it.
And all those folks that ...

1365
01:13:49,523 --> 01:13:53,124
... said I was crazy, they
can all go and fuck themselves.

1366
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:57,765
I brought something for you.

1367
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,238
I thought you might want it back.

1368
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,304
Uh, here you go.

1369
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:11,042
Oh, thank you.

1370
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:21,677
Who do you suppose that is?

1371
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:25,781
Where did that come from ?!

1372
01:14:25,782 --> 01:14:26,827
Holy shit, it's them !!

1373
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:28,085
I'll take the front !

1374
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,552
What the fuck are you
doin' here ?!

1375
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:35,453
Go, go !!

1376
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:42,900
Haggard ... !

1377
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,372
Alien !

1378
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:59,118
Haggard, where's the
pervy man ?!

1379
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,773
There's no one in this place !
Come on buddy, help me out !

1380
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:05,654
Freeze motherfucker !

1381
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:06,877
So weak ...

1382
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,428
Give me the alien !

1383
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:10,261
Give me the ...

1384
01:15:10,262 --> 01:15:11,411
Give me the fuckin' alien !

1385
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:13,389
- No.
- Aah ! Fuck, watch it !

1386
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,875
Give me the alien !

1387
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,847
Get your own alien !

1388
01:15:27,707 --> 01:15:29,432
Tara, come this way !

1389
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:33,024
Oh man balls !
It's my dad !

1390
01:15:33,025 --> 01:15:36,404
- Hey, am I heavy ?!
- I told you it's not fat, it's power !

1391
01:15:38,677 --> 01:15:40,241
Oh, great ...

1392
01:15:45,829 --> 01:15:47,534
I told you we should've
parked closer !

1393
01:15:49,768 --> 01:15:51,844
No sir, they're mine !

1394
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:53,812
Consider that a warning !

1395
01:15:53,813 --> 01:15:54,837
Crazy bastard !!

1396
01:15:56,603 --> 01:15:58,248
Got you still spacefreak ...

1397
01:15:58,249 --> 01:16:00,435
Ruth ! Get back here !

1398
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:01,583

Oh, I got you sucker ... coming ...

Ready or not ...

It's ok, he's allright ...

1407
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:37,821
He's ok ! He's ok !

1408
01:16:39,384 --> 01:16:40,416
Wait for me !

1409
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,823
Graeme !!

1410
01:16:57,144 --> 01:16:58,841
Ruth, drive !

1411
01:17:01,428 --> 01:17:02,279
Come on Graeme !

1412
01:17:04,441 --> 01:17:05,516
Don't leave me !

1413
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:12,511
Never ...

1414
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:16,788
Graeme, you scared the
shit out of me ...

1415
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,141
Ruth, why aren't you driving ?!

1416
01:17:19,254 --> 01:17:20,581
I told you, it's easy !

1417
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:29,243
Got it, got it, got it !

1418
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,305
Shit, shit, shit !
Oh, ok ...

1419
01:17:32,305 --> 01:17:33,938
Small corrections !
Small corrections !

1420
01:17:37,335 --> 01:17:39,073
Oh, my weed ! ....

1421
01:17:58,765 --> 01:18:03,068
Motherfuckin' titty suckin'
tooball bitch !

1422
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:13,131
<i>Zoil, progress report.</i>

1423
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:18,518
This is Haggard sir !
Agent Zoil is no longer in command !

1424
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:21,588
<i>I don't give a shit who's in command
Where the fuck are they ?!</i>

1425
01:18:21,589 --> 01:18:24,227
Just ahead of me, heading
east towards Lytle Creek !

1426
01:18:24,228 --> 01:18:27,983
<i>I don't wanna hear from anybody
till that cocksucker is dead ! Get me ?!</i>

1427
01:18:27,984 --> 01:18:29,784
Yes sir. Mam ...

1428
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:37,680
Goddammit ...

1429
01:18:42,516 --> 01:18:44,646
This is official Government business !

1430
01:18:44,647 --> 01:18:48,633
Stand down, or I'm authorised
to use deadly force !!

1431
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:50,424
That thing has my daughter !!

1432
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,787
This isn't your mission !!

1433
01:18:52,788 --> 01:18:55,380
I'm on a mission from GOD !!

1434
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:56,888
Tell him you failed !

1435
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,446
Shit, we got company !

1436
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,691
He's trying to overtake us !

1437
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:23,917
Don't let him get passed !

1438
01:19:23,918 --> 01:19:25,819
- Should I ram him ?!
- What about the deposit ?

1439
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,854
Fuck the deposit !

1440
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,847
Lytle Creek
National Park
LIMITED PARKING

1441
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:46,960
Oh, fuck ! Come on !

1442
01:19:46,961 --> 01:19:48,712
Smile you son of a bitch !

1443
01:19:48,713 --> 01:19:51,221
Eyes forward butt butthorn.

1444
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:02,481
Do you think he'll be ok?

1445
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:04,104
Yeah, he'll be fine.

1446
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:14,849
<i>- Haggard ...
- Zoil.</i>

1447
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,238
<i>Where are the other two?</i>

1448
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,954
One crashed and burnt, the
other just burnt.

1449
01:20:18,955 --> 01:20:22,079
<i>Jesus Christ, it's been one
fuck up after another ...</i>

1450
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:23,596
<i>... I should've handled
this myself.</i>

1451
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:26,133
I am very close, you
give me 1 hour.

1452
01:20:26,134 --> 01:20:28,394
<i>An hour? I'll be
eating canapes ...</i>

1453
01:20:28,394 --> 01:20:30,918
<i>... with the Governor in an hour,
I need this wrapped up now.</i>

1454
01:20:30,919 --> 01:20:33,767
No, they're mine dammit,
I'm gonna finish this once and for all !

1455
01:20:33,768 --> 01:20:36,832
<i>Too late Zoil.
I'm bringing in the big g ...</i>

1456
01:20:38,003 --> 01:20:39,685
Boring conversation anyway.

1457
01:20:45,885 --> 01:20:49,294
Well dear friend, you're
a face from a mighty steeve.

1458
01:20:49,295 --> 01:20:50,322
I can't believe she's gone.

1459
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:52,088
Need better bagger tits ...

1460
01:20:52,089 --> 01:20:53,920
Oh, what do we do now Paul?

1461
01:20:55,068 --> 01:20:56,144
Paul ? ...

1462
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,661
Paul, where are you goin' ?

1463
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:12,259
See? What did I tell you fellas?

1464
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,395
You know it when you saw it.

1465
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:18,747
Of course.

1466
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:32,478
Huh, right. Shoots
flaming balls.

1467
01:21:33,745 --> 01:21:35,251
Can you just light the
fuckin' thing?

1468
01:21:35,252 --> 01:21:36,762
They're not toys Paul.

1469
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:38,422
What is the suggested safe distance?

1470
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:40,065
Right, um ...

1471
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:42,458
500 feet.

1472
01:21:42,459 --> 01:21:43,954
That's gonna be put us
behind the tree line ...

1473
01:21:43,954 --> 01:21:45,070
... we're not gonna enjoy
the full effect.

1474
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:46,257
Yeah, that's true actually.

1475
01:21:46,258 --> 01:21:49,097
Ho, ho, ho !
There you have it, huh ?!

1476
01:21:49,098 --> 01:21:50,355
It's not funny, that's dangerous !

1477
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:24,370
What now?

1478
01:22:25,437 --> 01:22:26,527
We wait ...

1479
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:39,574
- It's amazin'
- Thank you.

1480
01:23:13,837 --> 01:23:15,205
Oh, no you don't.

1481
01:23:18,964 --> 01:23:20,282
Wait a minute.

1482
01:23:30,544 --> 01:23:33,695
Stay where you are you
little green bastard !

1483
01:23:55,045 --> 01:23:56,303
It's the Big Guy.

1484
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:00,821
Well, what do ya know?

1485
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:02,970
Small world ...

1486
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:05,946
Paul !

1487
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,781
Zoil ?!

1488
01:24:34,534 --> 01:24:36,641
Don't fucking move.

1489
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:40,338
- Did ...
- Be cool, be cool.

1490
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:44,265
I gotta say I'm a little
hurt Agent Zoil.

1491
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:46,459
He introduced me to 
my wife, he's my friend.

1492
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,333
So stupid son of a bitch.
You could've been where I am ...

1493
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:50,412
... in 15 years.

1494
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:51,921
I don't wanna be where you are.

1495
01:24:51,922 --> 01:24:53,210
Too bad.

1496
01:24:53,878 --> 01:24:55,116
Let's go mork.

1497
01:24:55,117 --> 01:24:56,234
Don't call me mork.

1498
01:24:56,235 --> 01:24:58,395
- No.
- Guys you don't have to do this.

1499
01:24:58,396 --> 01:24:59,771
No, he's going nowhere.

1500
01:25:00,877 --> 01:25:02,508
Can it nerds.

1501
01:25:02,509 --> 01:25:05,783
What do you think you can
possibly bring to the table ...

1502
01:25:05,783 --> 01:25:06,906
... at this point in the game?

1503
01:25:09,132 --> 01:25:10,751
Blind Fury.

1504
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:14,779
Oh ...

1505
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,636
False economy, I told you.

1506
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:18,000
Step aside.

1507
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:19,009
Fag.

1508
01:25:25,142 --> 01:25:28,592
Oh, hu !
Insane !!

1509
01:25:31,257 --> 01:25:32,335
Leave him alone !

1510
01:25:50,326 --> 01:25:52,360
Get away from her you bitch !

1511
01:25:58,677 --> 01:25:59,797
Zoil ...

1512
01:25:59,798 --> 01:26:00,651
You ok man?

1513
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,099
So much for the plan, huh?

1514
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,219
I know, right?

1515
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,308
Sorry I zapped you at
the farm house.

1516
01:26:06,309 --> 01:26:08,895
That's ok, I'm sorry I wasn't there to
meet you outside at the base ...

1517
01:26:08,893 --> 01:26:10,432
... by the time I got there
 you were already gone.

1518
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:12,727
But you got yourself a plan B, huh?

1519
01:26:12,728 --> 01:26:14,237
Did I ever?

1520
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:15,465
These are my friends.

1521
01:26:15,466 --> 01:26:18,313
- Hello.  - Pleasure to meet you boys
you did a hell of a job.

1522
01:26:18,314 --> 01:26:19,426
Thank you Agent Zoil.

1523
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:21,411
Please call me Lorenzo.

1524
01:26:22,288 --> 01:26:23,532
- Lorenzo Zoil?
- Lorenzo's Oil?

1525
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:25,550
That's right.

1526
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:28,852
Ruth !!

1527
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:30,967
Papa ?!

1528
01:26:41,175 --> 01:26:42,337
That was close ...

1529
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:49,916
Oh my ...

1530
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:53,075
No !!

1531
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:54,435
Oh God, Graeme ...

1532
01:26:57,602 --> 01:26:59,319
Put the gun down Mr Buggs !

1533
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,849
Drop the fucking gun, Dad !

1534
01:27:03,483 --> 01:27:05,088
I really am gonna miss ya.

1535
01:27:05,089 --> 01:27:06,668
This is all my fault.

1536
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,737
We should never come
on holiday.

1537
01:27:08,738 --> 01:27:11,971
No, no, no. It's fine,
it's fine Clive.

1538
01:27:11,972 --> 01:27:13,979
We've had a good time,
haven't we?

1539
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,095
Yeah?

1540
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,100
But, you got shot.

1541
01:27:16,863 --> 01:27:19,112
Yeah I know, but I can
honestly say Clive ...

1542
01:27:19,112 --> 01:27:21,236
... this is the most fun
I've ever had.

1543
01:27:28,574 --> 01:27:29,721
Graeme?

1544
01:27:35,404 --> 01:27:36,373
Graeme?

1545
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:38,603
Graeme ?!

1546
01:27:43,748 --> 01:27:45,144
I've gotta try, right?

1547
01:27:48,122 --> 01:27:49,345
Yeah?

1548
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:50,674
No ...

1549
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:55,774
Paul ...

1550
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,428
Think about this.

1551
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,027
Paul !!

1552
01:28:53,357 --> 01:28:54,396
Paul?

1553
01:29:13,122 --> 01:29:14,685
Oh, that sucked ...

1554
01:29:14,686 --> 01:29:16,121
And I don't even get to eat him.

1555
01:29:22,116 --> 01:29:23,818
Wasn't that really really
dangerous?

1556
01:29:24,891 --> 01:29:27,896
Sometimes ... you just
gotta roll the dice.

1557
01:29:28,852 --> 01:29:30,537
It's a miracle !

1558
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,775
The Lord has delivered
his healing hand ...

1559
01:29:36,682 --> 01:29:38,165
Can't live with these people.

1560
01:29:43,615 --> 01:29:44,939
Sorry you got killed by my dad.

1561
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,494
That's fine.

1562
01:29:47,707 --> 01:29:49,439
Do you wanna try to
kiss again?

1563
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,844
Fuck yeah.

1564
01:30:07,076 --> 01:30:09,179
Well ain't this ...

1565
01:30:12,438 --> 01:30:15,653
I changed my mind.
THAT is Jenga.

1566
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:41,520
Oh, it looks good.

1567
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:43,568
- That's a nice one of you.
- Thank you.

1568
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:45,081
Mr Buggs?

1569
01:30:45,082 --> 01:30:46,788
It's been a hell of a ride, huh?

1570
01:30:47,646 --> 01:30:49,202
Sorry I frightened the
shit out of you.

1571
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:52,371
You didn't frighten me,
you freed me.

1572
01:30:53,444 --> 01:30:54,599
I'm glad.

1573
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:57,182
Hmm, that's nice.

1574
01:30:57,183 --> 01:30:58,795
Thanks.

1575
01:31:04,655 --> 01:31:06,165
Hey, take care of
her big man.

1576
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:08,906
Oh, I will sir.
And God be with you.

1577
01:31:08,907 --> 01:31:10,318
Yeah, whatever dude.

1578
01:31:15,577 --> 01:31:17,367
Say bye to Karen for me.

1579
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:20,535
Safe trip short round.

1580
01:31:20,536 --> 01:31:22,008
Thanks.

1581
01:31:32,181 --> 01:31:33,328
Oh, you're coming with me.

1582
01:31:33,329 --> 01:31:34,267

1583
01:31:35,334 --> 01:31:36,709
I ruined you life, Tara.

1584
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,574
I think it's only
right, I give you one.

1585
01:31:42,905 --> 01:31:44,287
But, I don't have my toothbrush.

1586
01:31:44,288 --> 01:31:46,805
Baby, where we're goin' ...

1587
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:48,151
... you don't need teeth.

1588
01:31:54,783 --> 01:31:56,238

1589
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:57,315

I, um ...

1593
01:32:09,474 --> 01:32:11,230
I meant to ask ...

1594
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:12,275
What did you think of the book?

1595
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,597
I know, I liked it, actually,
really liked it, there's a lot of ...

1596
01:32:15,597 --> 01:32:17,864
... good ideas in it.

1597
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,559
Uh, i kinda find it hard to finish.

1598
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,750
To be honest.

1599
01:32:20,751 --> 01:32:22,184

Well, safe to say we've all
learned something from ...

1606
01:32:36,447 --> 01:32:40,040
... this. Be yourselves, speak
from your hearts, some shit like that ...

1607
01:32:41,003 --> 01:32:44,161
Yeah, I certainly feel
a bit different.

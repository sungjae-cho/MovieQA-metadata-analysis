1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,128
There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

2
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,845
It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,289
They're just touched
by something extra.

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,149
One such fish was The Beast.

5
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:13,326
And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

6
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:18,104
He'd passed up more $ 100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

7
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,823
Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

8
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:25,120
...who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

9
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:31,317
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

10
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:35,242
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

11
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,998
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

12
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,711
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

13
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,509
And on the day you were born...

14
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:46,367
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

15
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,688
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

16
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:53,756
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

17
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,428
But on that day I had a revelation:

18
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,207
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

19
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:05,799
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

20
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,952
- Your finger?
- Gold.

21
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:12,500
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

22
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:17,529
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

23
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,599
And then I cast upriver.

24
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:27,882
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

25
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:32,599
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

26
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,916
Well, you can see my predicament.

27
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:38,257
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

28
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,679
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

29
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,434
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

30
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:45,229
What did you do?

31
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,984
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

32
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,911
This fish, The Beast...

33
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:58,939
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

34
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:01,196
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

35
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,680
Now, I was in a situation.

36
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,520
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

37
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:12,862
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,994
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

39
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,103
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

40
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,775
This ladyfish and I...

41
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,406
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

42
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:28,185
Now, you may well ask...

43
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,296
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

44
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:38,263
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

45
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:41,230
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

46
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:44,027
...the day my son was born.

47
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:50,390
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

48
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,566
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

49
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,418
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

50
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,383
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

51
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:12,557
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

52
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,314
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

53
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,217
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

54
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,285
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

55
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:26,230
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

56
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,696
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

57
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:33,078
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

58
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:37,376
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

59
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:41,071
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

60
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:46,957
After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

61
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:56,036
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...

62
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,508
We communicated indirectly, I guess.

63
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:06,117
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

64
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:11,398
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

65
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:14,279
True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

66
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:20,749
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

67
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:24,132
And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

68
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:31,727
We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

69
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,012
In telling the story
of my father's life...

70
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,706
...it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

71
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:48,845
The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

72
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,396
It doesn't always make sense,
and most of it never happened.

73
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,488
Give me back my ring!

74
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:33,806
Thank you!

75
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,456
But that's what kind of story this is.

76
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,061
His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

77
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:52,214
No longer than most men's,
but larger.

78
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:54,552
And as strange as his stories got...

79
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,912
...the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

80
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:26,570
Yes. Yes, he's here.

81
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,930
It's your mother.

82
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:38,196
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

83
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,496
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

84
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,459
Yeah, I'll wait.

85
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,483
It's bad?

86
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,385
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

87
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,851
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

88
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:58,067
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

89
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,134
I'm going with you.

90
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,940
Now, which one's it gonna be?

91
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,903
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

92
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:33,813
The one about the witch.

93
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,762
The one about the witch.

94
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,815
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

95
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,053
Well, neither was I, at first.

96
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,268
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

97
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:53,900
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

98
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,659
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

99
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,957
There were five of us
out there that night:

100
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,525
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

101
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,261
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

102
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:12,227
And not one of us knew
what was in store.

103
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,881
It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

104
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:19,200
...if only to eat
misbehaving children...

105
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:22,455
...and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

106
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,439
Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

107
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,216
...and make the land infertile.

108
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:32,201
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

109
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,082
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

110
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:35,774
Your momma's a bitch.

111
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,964
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

112
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:39,363
- Shit.
- Damn.

113
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:40,616
Screw.

114
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,640
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

115
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,665
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

116
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:48,317
...there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

117
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:52,323
For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

118
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:56,435
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

119
00:09:56,438 --> 00:10:00,150
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

120
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,322
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

121
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,828
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,127
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

123
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,527
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

124
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:14,241
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

125
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,370
Edward, don't!

126
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:20,563
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

127
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:23,111
She makes soap out of people.

128
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:13,100
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

129
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,919
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

130
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,572
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

131
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,616
Let's see it.

132
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,130
Whoa, help!

133
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:52,465
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

134
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,431
I wasn't old at all.

135
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:05,991
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

136
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,874
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

137
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,649
...it could kind of screw you up.

138
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,571
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

139
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:19,703
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

140
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,944
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

141
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:38,303
That's how I go.

142
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:00,909
Hi, Mom.

143
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:11,635
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

144
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:15,205
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

145
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:19,191
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

146
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,552
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

147
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:26,308
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

148
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,211
Not yet.

149
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,174
Will.

150
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,993
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

151
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,645
My wife, Josephine.

152
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,962
A pleasure.

153
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,072
- You're seven months.
- To the day!

154
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,080
It's a boy.

155
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:55,382
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

156
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,367
Dad?

157
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,620
You want some water?

158
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:13,406
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

159
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:16,079
Having a kid changes everything.

160
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,960
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

161
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:23,008
- Did you do any of that?
- No.

162
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,847
But I hear it's terrible.

163
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:31,418
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child...

164
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:36,093
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

165
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:40,957
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

166
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,907
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

167
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:48,829
Everyone wins.

168
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,210
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

169
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,091
This is not how I go.

170
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,180
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

171
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,145
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

172
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,880
No, she was old and probably senile.

173
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:11,222
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

174
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,103
So how does it happen?

175
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:17,714
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

176
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,410
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

177
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:24,248
Look at us. We're talking fine.

178
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,169
We're storytellers, both of us.

179
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:31,802
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

180
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,644
Dad...

181
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,799
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

182
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,284
You mean while I'm here.

183
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:46,332
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

184
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,212
Events. Stories.

185
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,633
You.

186
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,408
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

187
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,018
- lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

188
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:11,150
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

189
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:17,346
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

190
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,166
And this here, being stuck in bed...

191
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,882
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

192
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:30,537
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

193
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:34,024
The last part is much more unusual.

194
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,677
Trust me on that.

195
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,990
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

196
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,622
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

197
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,921
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

198
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:39,107
Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

199
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,612
Most times a person
grows up gradually...

200
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:44,409
...while I found myself in a hurry.

201
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:51,524
My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

202
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:54,761
So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

203
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:58,997
...with the encyclopedia being
my only means of exploration.

204
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,919
I had made it all the way to the G's...

205
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:03,987
...hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...

206
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,765
...when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

207
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,459
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

208
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,130
With more space...

209
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,157
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

210
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,372
It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

211
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,647
...was that I was intended
for larger things.

212
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,507
After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

213
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:31,100
As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

214
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:36,045
...I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

215
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,049
Tigers, go!

216
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:53,791
Edward Bloom!

217
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:38,935
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!

218
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,416
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

219
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,256
Until one day, a stranger arrived.

220
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:13,208
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

221
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:17,132
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

222
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,805
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

223
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,581
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

224
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:24,857
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

225
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,528
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

226
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,448
I'll do it.

227
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,519
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

228
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,796
That creature could crush you
without trying.

229
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:51,385
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

230
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,402
Hello?

231
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:30,062
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

232
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,922
Go away!

233
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:37,993
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

234
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,832
I said, go away!

235
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:02,728
Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

236
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:04,879
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

237
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:10,324
All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

238
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,434
Why are you here?

239
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:15,190
So you can eat me.

240
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:19,509
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

241
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:23,037
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

242
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:26,793
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

243
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,281
So I guess, well...

244
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:34,807
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

245
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:50,066
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

246
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,676
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

247
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,348
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

248
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:57,207
Here.

249
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,565
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

250
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:05,093
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

251
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:08,768
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

252
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:12,797
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

253
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,968
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

254
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:17,680
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

255
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:20,019
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

256
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,461
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

257
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:24,904
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

258
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:27,845
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

259
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:30,685
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

260
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,170
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

261
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,135
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

262
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,786
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

263
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:44,230
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

264
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,363
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

265
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,202
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

266
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,333
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

267
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:57,297
So, what do you say? Join me?

268
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,536
Okay.

269
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,353
Okay.

270
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,378
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

271
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:27,666
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

272
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:31,319
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

273
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,283
But take with you
this key to the city...

274
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,935
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

275
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:39,940
...all our doors are open to you.

276
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,421
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

277
00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:55,385
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

278
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:58,621
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

279
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:03,212
But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

280
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,245
She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

281
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,647
...gets that way
by never being caught.

282
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,202
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

283
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:33,229
There were two roads out of Ashton:

284
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,400
A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.

285
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:38,426
People didn't use
the old one anymore...

286
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,139
...and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

287
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,352
Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

288
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:48,714
...this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

289
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:53,494
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

290
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:56,083
He was going to Paris, France.

291
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:59,610
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

292
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,032
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

293
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:05,496
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

294
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,712
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

295
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,156
Here.

296
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:16,642
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

297
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,698
Why, you son of a...

298
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,561
Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

299
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,276
...will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

300
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,201
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

301
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,752
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

302
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:41,967
...the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

303
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,075
Friend! Welcome to you!

304
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,851
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

305
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:48,735
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.

306
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:52,658
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

307
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:55,310
We weren't expecting you yet.

308
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,376
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

309
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:02,362
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

310
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,579
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

311
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,690
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

312
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:12,612
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

313
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:13,741
What is this place?

314
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,351
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

315
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,711
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

316
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:24,154
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

317
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:26,056
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

318
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:30,311
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

319
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,068
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

320
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,823
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

321
00:30:35,658 --> 00:30:39,537
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

322
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:15,668
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

323
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:17,424
It truly is.

324
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:25,916
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

325
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:30,676
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

326
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:34,433
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

327
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:38,377
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

328
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,700
Hey! Jenny!

329
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,121
Come back here!

330
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,842
Jenny!

331
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:08,624
Hey, I need those.

332
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:12,692
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

333
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,968
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

334
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,773
I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

335
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:26,405
...the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

336
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,982
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

337
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:34,548
Really?

338
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:39,972
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

339
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,456
May I?

340
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,746
It's only three lines long.

341
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,215
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

342
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,529
I got him!

343
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,040
There's leeches in there.

344
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:24,732
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

345
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:28,427
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

346
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:31,956
Yes, she was.

347
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:36,023
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

348
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,698
Fish looks different
to different people.

349
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:42,849
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

350
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,418
...back from the dead.

351
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,490
Oh, darn.

352
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:54,832
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

353
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

354
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:03,491
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

355
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:07,917
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

356
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:10,652
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

357
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:45,573
Hey, Edward!

358
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,351
I love Spectre...

359
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,865
Excuse me.

360
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:16,922
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

361
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,492
What?

362
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,517
I said, you're quite a catch.

363
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:45,624
I have to leave.

364
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,404
Tonight.

365
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:52,240
Why?

366
00:36:53,473 --> 00:36:55,809
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

367
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:59,899
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

368
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:03,593
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

369
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,703
But no one's ever left.

370
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:10,293
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

371
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:12,737
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

372
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,145
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

373
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:26,261
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

374
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,067
Promise me you'll come back.

375
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,076
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

376
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:12,139
That night,
I reached two conclusions.

377
00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:17,127
The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

378
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:21,970
The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

379
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:25,247
These woods would become
my graveyard.

380
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:31,968
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

381
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:36,289
After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

382
00:38:49,651 --> 00:38:53,989
And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

383
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:56,932
This isn't how I die.

384
00:39:13,174 --> 00:39:14,383
Friend.

385
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:19,224
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

386
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,947
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

387
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:39,555
...in the most recent Newsweek.

388
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,313
Really?

389
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:44,795
That's just wonderful.

390
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:51,054
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

391
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:55,604
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

392
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:08,025
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

393
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:13,888
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

394
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:15,791
Really?

395
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:19,754
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

396
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,740
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

397
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,496
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

398
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:32,193
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

399
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:34,575
Everything but religion.

400
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:36,955
Why not religion, Dad?

401
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:42,129
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

402
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:50,396
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

403
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,028
Oh, so you know.

404
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:11,332
Hello.

405
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,523
Hi. How are you feeling?

406
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:18,469
Oh, I was dreaming.

407
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:21,641
What were you dreaming about?

408
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,794
Oh, I don't usually remember...

409
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:28,967
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

410
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:32,141
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

411
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:35,376
Like one night, I had a dream...

412
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:40,071
...where this crow came and said:

413
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:42,619
"Your aunt is gonna die."

414
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,044
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

415
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:50,926
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

416
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:54,663
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

417
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:56,876
That's terrible.

418
00:41:56,877 --> 00:42:02,591
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

419
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:07,310
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

420
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:11,672
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

421
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,660
I didn't know what to do.

422
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:18,270
I finally told my father, but he said:

423
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:24,278
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

424
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:27,036
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

425
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:31,543
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

426
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:36,928
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

427
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,851
"Your daddy's gonna die."

428
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:45,485
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

429
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:48,118
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

430
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:51,415
...like he was waiting
for the ax to fall all day.

431
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:53,838
He said to my mother:

432
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:57,760
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

433
00:42:57,846 --> 00:43:01,767
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

434
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:06,734
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

435
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:13,184
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

436
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:19,321
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

437
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,099
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

438
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,500
Please?

439
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,672
All right.

440
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:32,973
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

441
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,374
There is a great one
of you and my father.

442
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:46,163
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

443
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:49,483
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

444
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:52,947
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

445
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:56,851
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

446
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:59,523
Will never told you?

447
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,069
Probably just as well.

448
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:04,804
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

449
00:44:05,057 --> 00:44:08,185
All the facts, none of the flavor.

450
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:12,088
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

451
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:16,032
Well, it's not a short one.

452
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,376
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

453
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:21,045
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

454
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,294
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

455
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:26,177
Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

456
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:31,017
...I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

457
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,578
Coco! Coco! There they are.

458
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,920
Ladies and gentlemen!

459
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:11,052
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

460
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:16,416
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

461
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:21,864
But I've traveled
to the five corners of the world...

462
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:28,833
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

463
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:35,349
When I met this man...

464
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,459
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

465
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,152
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

466
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,411
Because when you worked
beside him...

467
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,958
...he blocked out the daylight!

468
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:53,674
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

469
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:58,494
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

470
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:01,772
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

471
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,320
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

472
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:06,637
...he will not hurt her...

473
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:10,414
...because he is our own gentle giant.

474
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:17,885
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

475
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:42,315
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

476
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:44,342
...thank y'all for coming.

477
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,287
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

478
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:52,272
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

479
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,842
And I met mine, almost.

480
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:00,766
They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

481
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:02,272
And that's true.

482
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:48,462
What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

483
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:52,886
...it moves extra fast to catch up.

484
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:25,763
What's your name?

485
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:30,582
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

486
00:49:35,825 --> 00:49:41,372
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

487
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:43,900
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

488
00:49:45,905 --> 00:49:48,742
- Nope.
- Great.

489
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,788
Here you go.

490
00:49:52,147 --> 00:49:53,857
Here you are.

491
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:59,700
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

492
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,998
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

493
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,357
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

494
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,467
Hey, kid.

495
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,805
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

496
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,358
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

497
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:29,299
Pleased to meet you.

498
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:36,915
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

499
00:50:37,274 --> 00:50:40,569
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

500
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:43,680
"Depressed"?

501
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,728
See? The big guy likes it.

502
00:50:48,314 --> 00:50:50,316
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

503
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:53,280
I know it. But I lost her.

504
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:55,932
Oh, tough break.

505
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:59,834
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

506
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:04,885
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

507
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:06,953
Damn, kid.

508
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:12,379
Let me guess. Real pretty?

509
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,116
Reddish-blondish hair?

510
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,373
Blue dress?

511
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,980
Yeah!

512
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,401
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

513
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,447
Who is she? Where does she live?

514
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,516
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

515
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:32,940
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

516
00:51:32,962 --> 00:51:37,466
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

517
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:39,202
You don't have a plan or a job.

518
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:42,143
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

519
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:44,962
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

520
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:49,157
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

521
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:53,686
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

522
00:51:53,565 --> 00:51:56,026
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

523
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:59,490
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

524
00:51:59,845 --> 00:52:03,474
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

525
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:07,398
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

526
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:09,487
And I may not have much...

527
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:13,117
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

528
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:18,836
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

529
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:21,824
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

530
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:23,537
...and you won't have to pay me.

531
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,730
You just have to tell me who she is.

532
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:33,973
Every month you work for me...

533
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:37,228
...I'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

534
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:43,675
Let's get started.

535
00:52:56,494 --> 00:53:00,123
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

536
00:52:59,815 --> 00:53:02,734
I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

537
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:05,364
And four days without sleeping.

538
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:08,411
What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

539
00:53:08,455 --> 00:53:09,664
...who would be my wife.

540
00:53:17,097 --> 00:53:19,433
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

541
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:23,374
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

542
00:53:23,378 --> 00:53:24,921
It's been a month today.

543
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:30,346
This girl, the love of your life...

544
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:35,604
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.

545
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,262
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

546
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,436
Daffodils.

547
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,109
Daffodils.

548
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:54,290
True to his word...

549
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:57,170
...every month Amos would tell me
something new...

550
00:53:57,422 --> 00:53:59,716
...about the woman of my dreams.

551
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:02,741
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

552
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,286
She's going to college.

553
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:08,835
College. She's going to college.

554
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,922
She likes music.

555
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:24,261
Music. She likes music.

556
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,669
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

557
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:33,215
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

558
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:36,076
...but not her name,
and not where to find her.

559
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:40,583
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

560
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:53,402
Mr. Calloway?

561
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:58,930
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

562
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:05,049
Mr. Calloway?

563
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:39,466
No. Wait!

564
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,943
That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

565
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,677
...are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

566
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:39,852
Didn't kill anything, did I?

567
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:44,984
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

568
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:50,849
That would explain the indigestion.

569
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,848
Thank you.

570
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:03,604
I was wrong about you, kid.

571
00:57:03,689 --> 00:57:07,026
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

572
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,866
You could get any girl.

573
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:11,932
There's only one I want.

574
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:17,422
Her name...

575
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:23,099
...is Sandra Templeton.

576
00:57:24,813 --> 00:57:27,774
She goes to Auburn.

577
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:31,947
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

578
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,555
Thank you. Thank you.

579
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:36,834
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

580
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:49,270
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

581
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:56,154
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

582
00:57:56,217 --> 00:57:59,637
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.

583
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:36,980
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

584
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:38,276
...and I love you.

585
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:43,618
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

586
00:58:43,704 --> 00:58:47,917
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

587
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:51,026
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

588
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:54,347
...and to finally get to talk to you.

589
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:56,560
Because I'm destined to marry you.

590
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:03,110
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

591
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:08,165
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

592
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,127
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

593
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,674
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

594
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,318
But you're wrong. I do know you.

595
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,551
At least by reputation.

596
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,931
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

597
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,294
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

598
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:36,696
He was a few years older than you.

599
00:59:47,073 --> 00:59:48,449
Well...

600
00:59:50,914 --> 00:59:51,999
Congratulations.

601
00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:57,341
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

602
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:05,480
Stop it! It's not funny.

603
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:08,404
That poor boy.

604
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:11,804
Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.

605
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:14,039
After all this work to leave Ashton...

606
01:00:13,957 --> 01:00:19,463
...the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.

607
01:00:19,718 --> 01:00:21,887
There's a time when a man
needs to fight...

608
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:25,184
...and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...

609
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:29,567
...the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.

610
01:00:29,319 --> 01:00:32,531
Truth is, I've always been a fool.

611
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,393
Sandra Templeton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

612
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:43,173
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life...

613
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:49,522
...supply and demand
makes much more sense.

614
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:53,444
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger...

615
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:04,675
- for three hours.

616
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:06,240
Look!

617
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,220
- Daffodils!
- They're your favorite flower.

618
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:40,912
How did you get so many?

619
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,395
I called everywhere in five states.

620
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,691
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

621
01:01:48,532 --> 01:01:50,283
You don't even know me.

622
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:53,434
I have the rest of my life to find out.

623
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:55,960
Sandra!

624
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,301
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

625
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:03,015
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

626
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:05,749
- Bloom?
- Don.

627
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:11,070
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

628
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,722
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

629
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:19,379
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

630
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:21,404
I promised I wouldn't.

631
01:02:22,136 --> 01:02:24,930
Stop it!

632
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:26,225
Don, stop!

633
01:02:26,937 --> 01:02:31,983
While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.

634
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:36,534
All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.

635
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:38,665
Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.

636
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:53,276
Don! I will never marry you.

637
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:56,532
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

638
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:59,829
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

639
01:03:26,945 --> 01:03:32,409
As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.

640
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:35,355
Only the groom had changed.

641
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:40,071
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

642
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:42,993
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

643
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:50,383
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

644
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:54,515
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

645
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,856
Never really known why.

646
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,279
There was a time when I was 11...

647
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,948
You were talking about your wedding.

648
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:07,351
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

649
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:10,963
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

650
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:14,866
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

651
01:04:15,432 --> 01:04:16,808
I like your stories.

652
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:16,892
And I like you.

653
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,729
And I like you.

654
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,105
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

655
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:23,142
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

656
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:26,242
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

657
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:29,832
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...

658
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:32,295
...the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

659
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,655
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra...

660
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:41,268
...the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S. government.

661
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,516
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point...

662
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,522
...and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra...

663
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,362
...I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

664
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,326
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find...

665
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:16,023
...with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

666
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:18,340
Go! Go!

667
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,724
When I was offered
a secret mission...

668
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:26,564
...to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...

669
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:30,258
...I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.

670
01:05:33,204 --> 01:05:35,373
Go! Go!

671
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,564
Any of you got needs?

672
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:11,718
How could you miss your cue?

673
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:16,078
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

674
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:17,541
You weren't alone!

675
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:20,922
Who the hell are you?

676
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,550
I'm not going to hurt you.

677
01:09:22,678 --> 01:09:23,638
Damn right you're not.

678
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,077
GUARD!

679
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:28,187
Tell your men not to bother us!

680
01:09:28,438 --> 01:09:29,689
And close that curtain!

681
01:09:32,278 --> 01:09:34,364
Please, I need your help.

682
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,578
What makes you think we'll help you?

683
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,767
Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...

684
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:53,399
...and the ordeal that brought me
before them.

685
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,864
As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.

686
01:09:57,242 --> 01:09:59,328
It was destined to be.

687
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:02,249
We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...

688
01:10:02,524 --> 01:10:04,651
...involving a whaling ship
to Russia...

689
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:08,969
...a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.

690
01:10:08,764 --> 01:10:12,018
We all knew it would be dangerous.

691
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:14,982
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

692
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:16,737
I can get you bookings.

693
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,741
I know the biggest man
in show business.

694
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:21,767
Bob Hope?!

695
01:10:22,205 --> 01:10:23,165
Bigger.

696
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:27,883
Ready?

697
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:34,684
And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...

698
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:36,606
...halfway around the world.

699
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:41,070
Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.

700
01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:44,891
And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.

701
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:03,030
No, God!

702
01:11:04,452 --> 01:11:08,748
After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.

703
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:13,090
When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.

704
01:11:13,093 --> 01:11:17,932
When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.

705
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:54,585
I talked with your father last night.

706
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,868
You never told me
how your parents met.

707
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,061
They met at Auburn.

708
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,816
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

709
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:08,780
The circus. The war.

710
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:10,700
You never told me any of that.

711
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,788
That's because most of it
never happened.

712
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,670
But it's romantic.

713
01:12:19,824 --> 01:12:22,285
- What?
- What, I know better...

714
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:25,999
...than to argue romance
with a French woman.

715
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:28,985
Do you love your father?

716
01:12:29,424 --> 01:12:33,053
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

717
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:35,811
Do you love him?

718
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:42,426
You have to understand.

719
01:12:42,386 --> 01:12:46,182
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

720
01:12:46,227 --> 01:12:50,190
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

721
01:12:51,027 --> 01:12:53,822
Another family, another house.

722
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:57,119
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

723
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:58,896
Or, or...

724
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:05,572
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

725
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:10,352
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories...

726
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:13,255
...because he can't stand
this boring place.

727
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:16,156
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?

728
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:20,706
He's never told me
a single true thing.

729
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:24,131
Look, hey...

730
01:13:25,592 --> 01:13:28,387
I know why you like him.

731
01:13:28,473 --> 01:13:31,727
I know why everyone likes him.

732
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:35,045
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

733
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:38,072
Oh, you're not.

734
01:13:39,994 --> 01:13:42,747
And I think you should talk to him.

735
01:13:47,675 --> 01:13:50,762
Larry Puckett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.

736
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:54,269
Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.

737
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:58,401
And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.

738
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:01,428
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.

739
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,582
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

740
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:11,384
I know someone who hasn't.

741
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,140
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

742
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,460
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it...

743
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:21,404
...and flew off with the whole car.

744
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:29,460
But the real story
is how I got the car.

745
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,215
- You see...
- Dad?

746
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:32,864
Son.

747
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:34,763
Can we talk?

748
01:14:37,123 --> 01:14:39,417
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

749
01:14:39,524 --> 01:14:41,651
I'll help you.

750
01:14:56,806 --> 01:15:00,059
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?

751
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:02,189
I saw an iceberg once.

752
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:05,778
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

753
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:09,931
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

754
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:12,396
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!

755
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:14,838
What?

756
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,950
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

757
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,392
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question...

758
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,480
...because people
want to answer questions.

759
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,318
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."

760
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:30,825
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 10 percent.

761
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:34,353
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

762
01:15:34,252 --> 01:15:36,254
And that's...

763
01:15:36,172 --> 01:15:38,966
...what it is with you, Dad.

764
01:15:39,052 --> 01:15:41,804
I am only seeing this little bit...

765
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:43,768
...that sticks above the water.

766
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:46,939
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My...

767
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:50,133
Dad, I have no idea who you are...

768
01:15:50,093 --> 01:15:53,221
...because you've never told me
a single fact.

769
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:57,666
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

770
01:15:57,295 --> 01:16:00,756
You tell... lies, Dad.

771
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:02,345
You tell amusing lies.

772
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:05,140
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

773
01:16:05,455 --> 01:16:08,124
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain...

774
01:16:08,817 --> 01:16:10,902
...when your son is 10 and 15
and 20 and 30.

775
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:13,615
And I believed you.

776
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:18,874
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

777
01:16:18,897 --> 01:16:21,942
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible...

778
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:23,905
...I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

779
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,347
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

780
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:28,414
Just as charming and just as fake.

781
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:30,835
You think I'm fake.

782
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,947
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

783
01:16:37,621 --> 01:16:39,331
Look.

784
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:43,003
I'm about to have...

785
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:44,507
...a kid of my own.

786
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:47,365
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life...

787
01:16:47,702 --> 01:16:49,829
...never understanding me.

788
01:16:50,103 --> 01:16:52,397
It would kill you, huh?

789
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:57,530
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

790
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,494
Just yourself.

791
01:16:59,224 --> 01:17:02,853
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

792
01:17:03,064 --> 01:17:06,109
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

793
01:17:06,425 --> 01:17:10,846
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

794
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,973
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office...

795
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:48,689
...and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

796
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:50,048
So...

797
01:17:51,552 --> 01:17:56,223
You'll know better than me
what's important.

798
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:08,039
What is it?

799
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:11,275
It was during the war.

800
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:15,113
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

801
01:18:16,035 --> 01:18:18,329
Oh, that really happened?

802
01:18:18,436 --> 01:18:22,231
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

803
01:18:23,715 --> 01:18:26,677
I think I'll go check on him.

804
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:30,999
I need to lie down for a bit.

805
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:34,025
Okay, go.

806
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,121
After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.

807
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,794
Each had the advantage over me.

808
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,902
They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.

809
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:00,075
With my prospects few...

810
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:03,997
...I took a job as a traveling salesman.
It suited me.

811
01:19:03,562 --> 01:19:06,648
If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...

812
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:09,049
...it's that I am a social person.

813
01:19:10,283 --> 01:19:13,328
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

814
01:19:13,643 --> 01:19:16,104
I could be gone
for weeks at a time.

815
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:19,443
But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...

816
01:19:19,404 --> 01:19:22,866
...into an account set aside
for a proper house...

817
01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:25,101
...with a white picket fence.

818
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:34,033
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product...

819
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:36,539
...the Handi-matic.

820
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:54,780
A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...

821
01:19:54,449 --> 01:19:58,036
...until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.

822
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:23,190
Edward?

823
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:24,922
Edward Bloom!

824
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:26,842
It's me, Norther Winslow.

825
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,971
I don't believe it.

826
01:20:29,014 --> 01:20:33,226
I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...

827
01:20:33,335 --> 01:20:35,212
...all the way out in Texas.

828
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:39,134
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

829
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:42,599
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

830
01:20:42,456 --> 01:20:43,999
So I traveled.

831
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:47,462
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

832
01:20:47,257 --> 01:20:49,926
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

833
01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:52,223
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

834
01:20:52,537 --> 01:20:54,915
What are you doing now?

835
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:57,358
I'm robbing this place.

836
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:02,931
All right, everybody down!

837
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:07,750
Hey!
Just slide that over.

838
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:16,456
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?

839
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:17,897
The gun.

840
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:21,736
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers...

841
01:21:21,822 --> 01:21:25,951
...and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

842
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:35,407
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

843
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,288
Let's go!

844
01:21:56,387 --> 01:21:58,306
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

845
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:01,393
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

846
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:03,587
It's not that.

847
01:22:04,068 --> 01:22:06,028
It's just...

848
01:22:11,269 --> 01:22:12,728
There's no money.

849
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:17,549
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

850
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:21,472
It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...

851
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:25,938
...not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.

852
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:28,111
All right, let's go!

853
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:40,635
Norther!

854
01:22:59,276 --> 01:23:02,070
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

855
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:04,576
And that's just from the drawers.

856
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:07,101
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

857
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:19,019
This is it? The whole vault?

858
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,900
I'm afraid so.

859
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,388
It's got your deposit slip on it.

860
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,120
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

861
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,627
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...

862
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:36,051
I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...

863
01:23:36,241 --> 01:23:39,119
...and its effect on real-estate prices...

864
01:23:39,122 --> 01:23:42,209
...and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...

865
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:46,278
...had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.

866
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:51,120
Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:

867
01:23:51,124 --> 01:23:54,585
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

868
01:23:54,484 --> 01:23:57,946
I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...

869
01:23:57,845 --> 01:23:59,012
Thanks for the hand!

870
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,245
...Norther's were just beginning.

871
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:03,708
When Norther made
his first million dollars...

872
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:05,816
...he sent me a check for 10,000.

873
01:24:06,005 --> 01:24:10,051
I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.

874
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:13,747
It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...

875
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:15,647
...with a white picket fence.

876
01:24:15,607 --> 01:24:19,736
And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.

877
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:54,011
I was drying out.

878
01:24:55,453 --> 01:24:57,872
I see.

879
01:24:59,774 --> 01:25:03,903
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister...

880
01:25:03,614 --> 01:25:06,409
...so we can just spray you
like a fern.

881
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:33,794
Come, now.

882
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,995
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

883
01:26:36,747 --> 01:26:39,709
You carry on. I'll see...

884
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:46,223
Hello.

885
01:26:46,349 --> 01:26:50,270
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.

886
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:52,483
And you're Will.

887
01:26:52,591 --> 01:26:55,552
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

888
01:26:57,871 --> 01:27:00,582
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

889
01:27:00,751 --> 01:27:02,962
We can go again next week.

890
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:05,111
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

891
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:07,971
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

892
01:27:18,594 --> 01:27:19,929
How did you know my father?

893
01:27:20,595 --> 01:27:22,638
Well, this was on his sales route...

894
01:27:22,515 --> 01:27:26,519
...so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

895
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:28,837
Were you having an affair?

896
01:27:31,156 --> 01:27:33,450
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

897
01:27:34,037 --> 01:27:37,749
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

898
01:27:39,316 --> 01:27:42,319
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

899
01:27:42,678 --> 01:27:46,890
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...

900
01:27:46,518 --> 01:27:49,896
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

901
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,635
Well, can I ask you a question?

902
01:27:54,678 --> 01:27:57,473
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

903
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,292
Because he's dying.

904
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:13,919
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

905
01:28:13,402 --> 01:28:15,445
You have one image of your father...

906
01:28:15,802 --> 01:28:18,013
...and it'd be wrong of me
to change it...

907
01:28:18,202 --> 01:28:19,787
...especially this late in the game.

908
01:28:20,123 --> 01:28:22,417
My father talked about things
he never did...

909
01:28:22,523 --> 01:28:26,110
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

910
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,844
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

911
01:28:31,164 --> 01:28:34,251
The first thing
you have to understand...

912
01:28:34,526 --> 01:28:37,320
...is that your father
never meant to end up here.

913
01:28:37,885 --> 01:28:39,178
Yet he did.

914
01:28:39,326 --> 01:28:40,869
Twice.

915
01:28:41,246 --> 01:28:43,665
The first time, he was early.

916
01:28:44,126 --> 01:28:46,128
The second time, he was late.

917
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:51,887
Those days, your father was working
for himself.

918
01:28:51,808 --> 01:28:54,727
If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom...

919
01:28:55,167 --> 01:29:00,131
...it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.

920
01:28:59,969 --> 01:29:03,097
One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...

921
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:06,854
...when he hit a thunderstorm
unlike any in his life.

922
01:30:50,864 --> 01:30:53,241
Fate has a way of circling back
on a man...

923
01:30:53,265 --> 01:30:55,309
...and taking him by surprise.

924
01:30:59,986 --> 01:31:03,657
A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.

925
01:31:03,346 --> 01:31:07,308
This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.

926
01:31:08,627 --> 01:31:12,214
A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...

927
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:15,074
...and with it, banks, liens and debt.

928
01:31:15,348 --> 01:31:20,145
Almost everywhere you looked,
people were bankrupt.

929
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:24,404
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

930
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:27,056
- The opening bid will be $ 10,000.
- So Edward Bloom...

931
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:29,686
...decided to buy the town.
- 50,000.

932
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:36,928
- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...

933
01:31:36,952 --> 01:31:42,082
...but he had made other men rich,
and now he asked for their favors.

934
01:31:43,673 --> 01:31:46,634
- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.

935
01:31:47,033 --> 01:31:50,203
They only had Edward's words
to describe it.

936
01:31:49,913 --> 01:31:53,292
That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.

937
01:31:53,753 --> 01:31:56,465
So first he bought the farms.

938
01:31:56,155 --> 01:32:00,034
Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.

939
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:05,522
Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent.

940
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:08,466
They were just asked to keep
doing as they were doing.

941
01:32:08,637 --> 01:32:12,599
In that way, he could make sure
the town would never die.

942
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:20,258
Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.

943
01:32:20,157 --> 01:32:22,701
With one exception.

944
01:32:46,082 --> 01:32:49,085
You must be Edward Bloom.

945
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:50,130
How do you know?

946
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:53,468
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

947
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:56,599
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

948
01:32:56,643 --> 01:32:58,895
You're buying the town.

949
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:04,008
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

950
01:33:03,845 --> 01:33:08,683
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

951
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:10,104
And so I've heard.

952
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:13,422
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

953
01:33:13,446 --> 01:33:16,949
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

954
01:33:17,287 --> 01:33:19,998
Now, let me get this straight.

955
01:33:19,686 --> 01:33:22,522
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

956
01:33:22,566 --> 01:33:25,069
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

957
01:33:25,448 --> 01:33:29,285
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

958
01:33:29,288 --> 01:33:31,207
Do I have that right?

959
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:33,669
In so many words, yes.

960
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:36,529
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

961
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:40,411
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...

962
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:43,291
...in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

963
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:48,966
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

964
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:52,622
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

965
01:33:52,812 --> 01:33:54,396
Some sort of midlife crisis?

966
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:57,673
Instead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

967
01:33:58,092 --> 01:34:00,178
Helping people makes me happy.

968
01:34:00,972 --> 01:34:04,059
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

969
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:08,296
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.

970
01:34:08,174 --> 01:34:10,092
You did exactly what you promised.

971
01:34:10,574 --> 01:34:15,037
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

972
01:34:22,095 --> 01:34:23,555
You're Beamen's daughter.

973
01:34:25,456 --> 01:34:28,208
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

974
01:34:28,817 --> 01:34:33,864
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

975
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:46,576
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

976
01:34:47,059 --> 01:34:48,602
I see.

977
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:52,880
Well, thank you for your time.

978
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:05,508
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

979
01:35:15,383 --> 01:35:18,427
- Oh, I'm so sorry! l...
- It's okay. Just leave it.

980
01:35:18,744 --> 01:35:21,080
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.

981
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:24,878
- But...
- Go.

982
01:35:26,905 --> 01:35:31,701
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.

983
01:35:31,706 --> 01:35:33,749
But Edward was not like most men.

984
01:35:33,626 --> 01:35:34,168
But Edward was not like most men.

985
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:45,043
Hold!

986
01:35:48,989 --> 01:35:51,116
They both had completely
different characters but...

987
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:53,912
...well, just one pair of legs.

988
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:07,290
As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...

989
01:36:07,231 --> 01:36:11,110
...until the shack no longer
resembled itself.

990
01:36:26,434 --> 01:36:30,646
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

991
01:36:31,234 --> 01:36:33,778
By the time the twins and I
had got to Havana...

992
01:36:33,635 --> 01:36:39,308
...we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

993
01:36:57,638 --> 01:37:01,100
- Well...
- You could leave it there.

994
01:37:17,801 --> 01:37:19,261
No.

995
01:37:29,323 --> 01:37:31,075
Now, don't.

996
01:37:31,723 --> 01:37:36,311
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that...

997
01:37:37,485 --> 01:37:39,612
I'm in love with my wife.

998
01:37:40,365 --> 01:37:42,325
Yeah, I know.

999
01:37:42,764 --> 01:37:45,559
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die...

1000
01:37:45,645 --> 01:37:47,689
...she's the only one.

1001
01:37:48,525 --> 01:37:50,986
Lucky girl.

1002
01:37:51,406 --> 01:37:54,576
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

1003
01:38:01,487 --> 01:38:03,906
Wait! Edward.

1004
01:38:43,734 --> 01:38:46,653
One day, Edward Bloom left...

1005
01:38:46,614 --> 01:38:50,451
...and never returned
to the town he'd saved.

1006
01:39:02,456 --> 01:39:04,417
As for the girl...

1007
01:39:04,376 --> 01:39:06,879
...the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...

1008
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:09,531
...and crazy at that.

1009
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:14,121
She became something
of a legend herself.

1010
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:20,173
And the story ended where it began.

1011
01:39:20,699 --> 01:39:23,744
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was...

1012
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:24,747
...old when he was young.

1013
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:28,315
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1014
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:32,739
See, to him there's only
two women:

1015
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:34,641
Your mother...

1016
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:36,289
...and everyone else.

1017
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:37,938
And one day...

1018
01:39:38,462 --> 01:39:42,800
...I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1019
01:39:43,263 --> 01:39:46,224
I was living in a fairy tale.

1020
01:39:46,623 --> 01:39:48,876
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1021
01:39:49,023 --> 01:39:51,609
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...

1022
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,238
I'm glad I know.

1023
01:39:53,824 --> 01:39:57,077
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1024
01:39:57,665 --> 01:39:59,458
And I'm...

1025
01:39:59,585 --> 01:40:02,004
I was never gonna be.

1026
01:40:04,385 --> 01:40:05,970
I was make-believe.

1027
01:40:07,265 --> 01:40:12,187
And his other life, you...

1028
01:40:12,067 --> 01:40:13,652
You were real.

1029
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:38,657
Mom?

1030
01:40:39,431 --> 01:40:41,266
Josephine?

1031
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:44,689
Josephine?

1032
01:40:58,153 --> 01:41:00,197
Will!

1033
01:41:01,034 --> 01:41:02,410
What happened?

1034
01:41:02,475 --> 01:41:04,059
Your father had a stroke.

1035
01:41:04,874 --> 01:41:07,460
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1036
01:41:07,275 --> 01:41:08,526
Is he gonna be okay?

1037
01:41:16,396 --> 01:41:18,440
I don't suppose that I could...

1038
01:41:18,316 --> 01:41:20,860
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case...

1039
01:41:21,677 --> 01:41:24,596
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1040
01:41:24,558 --> 01:41:25,767
I'll stay.

1041
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:29,919
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1042
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:34,719
- Is that okay?
- Fine.

1043
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,959
Will, you'll call if there's any...?

1044
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,486
I will. I will. I'll call.

1045
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,682
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.

1046
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:53,430
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1047
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,836
One of my greatest
annoyances is when...

1048
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:02,051
...people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1049
01:43:02,011 --> 01:43:04,097
Well, we have an advantage.

1050
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:06,496
My father and I never talk.

1051
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:16,139
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1052
01:43:15,933 --> 01:43:19,228
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1053
01:43:19,294 --> 01:43:23,256
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1054
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:25,241
No.

1055
01:43:25,535 --> 01:43:28,871
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1056
01:43:28,895 --> 01:43:33,567
Her neighbor drove her, on account of
your father was away on business...

1057
01:43:33,216 --> 01:43:34,675
...in Wichita.

1058
01:43:35,616 --> 01:43:39,370
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1059
01:43:39,456 --> 01:43:45,170
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1060
01:43:45,218 --> 01:43:49,973
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries...

1061
01:43:50,018 --> 01:43:54,189
...so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1062
01:43:54,339 --> 01:43:56,925
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1063
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,994
Not very exciting, is it?

1064
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:03,979
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version...

1065
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:08,361
...and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring...

1066
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,221
...I might choose the fancy version.

1067
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:13,102
But, then that's just me.

1068
01:44:14,022 --> 01:44:16,024
I kind of liked your version.

1069
01:44:37,065 --> 01:44:38,692
Dad?

1070
01:44:40,426 --> 01:44:43,888
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1071
01:44:45,706 --> 01:44:48,751
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1072
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:51,444
You want some water?

1073
01:44:51,948 --> 01:44:53,366
You want a bit of water?

1074
01:44:56,267 --> 01:44:59,020
The river.

1075
01:45:00,109 --> 01:45:01,986
The river?

1076
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:06,596
Tell me how it happens.

1077
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:11,148
How what happens?

1078
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:13,485
How I go.

1079
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:19,936
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1080
01:45:33,233 --> 01:45:36,486
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1081
01:45:39,474 --> 01:45:42,477
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1082
01:45:42,354 --> 01:45:44,982
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1083
01:45:47,155 --> 01:45:50,826
Like this.

1084
01:45:50,996 --> 01:45:52,998
Okay. Okay.

1085
01:45:55,317 --> 01:45:58,654
Okay, so it's in the morning...

1086
01:45:58,676 --> 01:46:02,722
...and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1087
01:46:02,998 --> 01:46:06,293
...and I see you,
and somehow you're better.

1088
01:46:06,838 --> 01:46:08,006
Dad?

1089
01:46:07,799 --> 01:46:09,759
You're different.

1090
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:13,640
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.

1091
01:46:13,559 --> 01:46:14,768
Then I say:

1092
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,502
Dad, you're in no condition...

1093
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,734
Get that wheelchair.

1094
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,284
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1095
01:46:23,161 --> 01:46:25,455
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1096
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,270
And we get in the wheelchair...

1097
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:30,942
- Faster!
...like we're escaping the hospital.

1098
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,802
What are you doing?

1099
01:46:32,762 --> 01:46:34,972
We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.

1100
01:46:35,162 --> 01:46:38,124
- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.

1101
01:46:38,042 --> 01:46:40,003
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1102
01:46:40,444 --> 01:46:42,362
Mom and Josephine
are at the end.

1103
01:46:42,364 --> 01:46:45,325
No time to explain! Stall them!

1104
01:46:50,524 --> 01:46:52,485
We come flying out
over the curb...

1105
01:46:52,444 --> 01:46:56,907
...and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.

1106
01:46:57,245 --> 01:46:59,498
And I pick you up...

1107
01:46:59,165 --> 01:47:02,836
...and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1108
01:47:06,847 --> 01:47:09,600
Leave it! We don't need it!

1109
01:47:11,647 --> 01:47:14,108
Water. I need water.

1110
01:47:16,928 --> 01:47:18,888
- Where are we going?
- The river.

1111
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:27,947
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic...

1112
01:47:27,969 --> 01:47:30,764
...because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1113
01:48:10,216 --> 01:48:15,388
And as we get close to the river...

1114
01:48:23,178 --> 01:48:25,305
He's here!

1115
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:28,415
...we see that everybody
is already there.

1116
01:48:44,301 --> 01:48:45,761
And I mean...

1117
01:48:47,182 --> 01:48:48,350
...everyone.

1118
01:49:00,144 --> 01:49:02,896
It's unbelievable.

1119
01:49:03,504 --> 01:49:08,259
The story of my life.

1120
01:49:15,506 --> 01:49:18,425
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1121
01:49:18,386 --> 01:49:20,971
Everyone is just so glad
to see you...

1122
01:49:22,227 --> 01:49:24,437
...and send you off right.

1123
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:29,777
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1124
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:43,055
My girl in the river.

1125
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,356
You become what you always were.

1126
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,134
A very big fish.

1127
01:51:03,041 --> 01:51:05,460
And that's how it happens.

1128
01:51:06,883 --> 01:51:08,676
Yeah.

1129
01:51:11,202 --> 01:51:13,371
Exactly.

1130
01:51:53,929 --> 01:51:55,639
Mom?

1131
01:53:18,901 --> 01:53:22,071
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1132
01:53:22,261 --> 01:53:26,015
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1133
01:53:25,622 --> 01:53:28,542
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1134
01:53:28,502 --> 01:53:30,463
He restores my soul.

1135
01:53:30,903 --> 01:53:34,865
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1136
01:53:35,223 --> 01:53:38,393
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1137
01:53:38,585 --> 01:53:41,254
...I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1138
01:53:40,984 --> 01:53:45,239
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1139
01:54:30,432 --> 01:54:35,062
Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?

1140
01:54:34,752 --> 01:54:38,756
And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.

1141
01:54:39,072 --> 01:54:42,158
You remember why you loved it
in the first place.

1142
01:54:43,874 --> 01:54:46,960
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 15 feet tall!

1143
01:54:46,754 --> 01:54:50,216
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1144
01:54:50,594 --> 01:54:51,845
Pretty much.

1145
01:54:52,034 --> 01:54:54,162
See? So he was a giant.

1146
01:54:53,955 --> 01:54:56,333
That was my father's final joke,
I guess.

1147
01:54:56,835 --> 01:55:02,591
A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.

1148
01:55:03,556 --> 01:55:05,809
They live on after him.

1149
01:55:08,357 --> 01:55:11,611
And in that way,
he becomes immortal.

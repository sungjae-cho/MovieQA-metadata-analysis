1
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,958
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,418
Keep it clear.

3
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,295
Stand back.

4
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:44,637
Slow it down.

5
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,526
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

6
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:01,491
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.

7
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:06,370
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

8
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,332
Ready. Move it.

9
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:10,997
And push!

10
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,463
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.

11
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:31,310
Jophery, raise the gate.

12
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:51,697
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

13
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,588
Somebody help him!

14
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,673
Work her back!

15
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:17,230
Shoot her!

16
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,773
Shoot her!

17
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:59,399
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.

18
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,570
There's a $20 million lawsuit
for that worker's death...

19
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:05,228
...and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

20
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:08,444
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

21
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,572
I understand, but we need to deal
with the situation now.

22
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:13,822
- The insurance company...
- You okay?

23
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:20,873
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

24
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,547
That makes the investors very anxious.

25
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:27,217
I had to promise to conduct
a thorough, on-site inspection.

26
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,475
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

27
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,643
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

28
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:42,146
Watch your head.

29
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:47,695
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys'll back off.

30
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,111
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

31
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,781
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

32
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,030
You'll never get him out of Montana.

33
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:56,620
Why not?

34
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,082
Why not?

35
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,624
Because Grant's like me.

36
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,921
He's a digger.

37
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,510
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

38
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,387
I hate computers.

39
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,348
The feeling's mutual.

40
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,526
Take a look.

41
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,655
Did it work?

42
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,835
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.

43
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,000
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

44
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,169
Bounces it back...

45
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:34,301
This new program is incredible.

46
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,347
A few more years' development,
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

47
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:40,142
Where's the fun in that?

48
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:44,228
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

49
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,436
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

50
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,066
Velociraptor?

51
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:51,732
Yes. Good shape, too.

52
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:55,234
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.

53
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:56,655
- Look...
- What'd you do?

54
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:57,776
He touched it.

55
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:02,112
- Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.

56
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,705
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrist.

57
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,250
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

58
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,497
No, seriously.

59
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,138
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

60
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:21,968
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward,
like a bird's.

61
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:25,928
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.

62
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,436
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey. "

63
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,734
That doesn't look very scary.

64
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,149
More like a 6-foot turkey.

65
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:39,949
A turkey?

66
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,533
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.

67
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:50,582
You'd get yourfirst look at this
6- foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

68
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:53,466
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

69
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:58,179
You keep still because maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

70
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:01,051
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

71
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,348
But no, not Velociraptor.

72
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:07,678
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

73
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:12,984
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

74
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,362
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

75
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,529
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...

76
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,115
...and he is out in force today.

77
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,415
And he slashes at you with this...

78
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:34,417
...a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

79
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:38,547
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

80
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,471
He slashes at you...

81
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:43,341
...here or here...

82
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,548
Alan.

83
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,219
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

84
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:55,310
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

85
00:08:57,072 --> 00:09:00,073
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

86
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,156
Okay.

87
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:14,171
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

88
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,790
Yeah, I know. Kids.

89
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,002
You want to have one of those?

90
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:25,054
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of child could be intriguing.

91
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,808
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

92
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:32,223
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

93
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,727
Cheap, cheap.

94
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,181
They smell.

95
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,152
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

96
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:39,525
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

97
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,161
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

98
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,537
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!

99
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:54,493
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

100
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,922
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

101
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:01,624
What?

102
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:19,194
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

103
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,771
We were saving that.

104
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,780
For today, I guarantee it.

105
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,364
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.

106
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:32,824
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

107
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:38,871
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

108
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,788
Who's the jerk?

109
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:44,299
- This is our paleobotanist. Dr....
- Sattler.

110
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:46,671
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

111
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:50,140
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

112
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,218
- Did I say "jerk"?
... we're in a hurry.

113
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:55,680
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

114
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:59,649
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

115
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:03,021
- There's samples all over here.
- I know my way around the kitchen.

116
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,023
Now, I'll get right to the point.

117
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:09,067
I like you. Both of you.

118
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,745
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

119
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:19,002
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

120
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:23,087
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

121
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,666
...I've been setting up a biological preserve.

122
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:28,133
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

123
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,673
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

124
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:35,930
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

125
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:39,391
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.

126
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,440
And not just kids, everyone.

127
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:46,984
We're opening next year, if the lawyers
don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?

128
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,826
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

129
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:55,989
I do, and there's a particular one right now,
who represents my investors.

130
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,084
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

131
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,793
What kind of opinions?

132
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,922
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

133
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:08,087
Let's face it, in your particularfields,
you're the top minds.

134
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,634
And if I could just persuade you...

135
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,264
...to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

136
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,763
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

137
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:23,975
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?

138
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,237
It's right up your alley.

139
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:34,361
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

140
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,621
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

141
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,574
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

142
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,870
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

143
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,375
We just dug up a new skeleton...

144
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,511
I'd compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

145
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,640
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...

146
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,049
...for a further three years.

147
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,440
Where's the plane?

148
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,063
- Okay.
- Three years.

149
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,183
Cheers.

150
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,733
Dodgson!

151
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,913
You shouldn't use my name.

152
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,751
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

153
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,583
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

154
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,050
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

155
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,837
- Well?
- $750,000.

156
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,884
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

157
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,009
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

158
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,215
I'll get them all.

159
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,224
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

160
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,556
How am I supposed to transport them?

161
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,028
The bottom screws open.

162
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,357
That's great. Oh, my God.

163
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,988
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.

164
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:42,618
- You guys. That's great.
- Customs can even check it if they want to.

165
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:44,081
- Let me see.
- Go on.

166
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,834
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?

167
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,171
The embryos have to be back here
in San José by then.

168
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:53,000
That's up to your guy on the boat.

169
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,756
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

170
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,836
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.

171
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:04,634
18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

172
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,016
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

173
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,397
That was Hammond's mistake.

174
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,456
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

175
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,667
- Well...
- We try to.

176
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,471
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

177
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:50,104
He suffers from a deplorable excess
of personality, for a mathematician.

178
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,147
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

179
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,025
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

180
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,897
...particularly what it says
about his science project.

181
00:15:56,988 --> 00:16:00,321
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

182
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:03,279
Because of the behaviour
of the system in phase space?

183
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:06,655
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching...

184
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:07,952
Don't.

185
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:11,167
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

186
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:12,374
No.

187
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,295
No? Non-linear equations?

188
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,750
Strange attractors?

189
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,386
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

190
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:30,762
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

191
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:36,265
There it is.

192
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,925
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

193
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,423
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece...

194
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:42,258
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

195
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:44,750
Great.

196
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,425
The full 50 miles of perimeterfence
are in place?

197
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,711
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

198
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:12,006
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

199
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:15,182
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

200
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:18,352
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

201
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:21,557
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

202
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:24,899
48 hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

203
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:26,729
I'll shut you down, John.

204
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:31,485
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.

205
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,123
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.

206
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:46,833
This shouldn't be here.

207
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:09,696
Alan, this species of veriforman
has been extinct, since...

208
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,532
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

209
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:13,945
What?

210
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:44,850
Look at that.

211
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,441
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,950
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

213
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:02,870
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

214
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,330
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

215
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,119
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

216
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,752
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- 30 feet.

217
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,896
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

218
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:37,282
How fast are they?

219
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,612
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

220
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:43,872
T. Rex?

221
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,909
You said you've got a T. Rex?

222
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,201
Say again.

223
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,583
We have a T. Rex.

224
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,708
Put your head between your knees.

225
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,380
Dr. Grant...

226
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,755
...my dear Dr. Sattler...

227
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:03,971
...welcome to Jurassic Park.

228
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,791
They're moving in herds.

229
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,623
They do move in herds.

230
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,304
How did you do this?

231
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,429
I'll show you.

232
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,542
G'day.

233
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:16,836
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

234
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:19,879
...incorporating all the latest technologies.

235
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:23,254
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

236
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:27,558
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

237
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:31,226
...that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

238
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,390
So, what are you thinking?

239
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,609
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?

240
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:49,700
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

241
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:53,667
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

242
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,336
<i>Hello.</i>

243
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:01,505
Say hello.

244
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,709
Hello.

245
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,258
<i>Hello, John.</i>

246
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:07,764
Yes, I've got lines.

247
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,301
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

248
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:16,312
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

249
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,140
Your blood.

250
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,230
<i>Right.</i>

251
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,269
<i>That hurt.</i>

252
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:25,823
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

253
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:27,943
<i>Hello, John.</i>

254
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:34,035
Cloned from what? Loy extraction
hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.

255
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,201
Not without massive sequence gaps.

256
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,121
Paleo DNA, from what source?

257
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,296
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

258
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,336
<i>What? What?</i>

259
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,053
<i>Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?</i>

260
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:53,507
<i>From your blood.</i>

261
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:57,897
<i>Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...</i>

262
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,474
<i>...the building blocks of life.</i>

263
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:05,897
<i>A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.</i>

264
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:11,358
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...</i>

265
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:16,579
<i>...left their blueprints behind for us to find.
Wejust had to know where to look.</i>

266
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:21,579
<i>100 million years ago,
there were mosquitoesjust like today.</i>

267
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:25,000
<i>Andjust like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.</i>

268
00:25:25,301 --> 00:25:29,844
<i>Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...</i>

269
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:34,677
<i>...mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

270
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:39,930
<i>After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilised...</i>

271
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:44,941
<i>...just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

272
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:49,237
<i>This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber...</i>

273
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:53,827
<i>...waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...</i>

274
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:56,997
<i>...until Jurassic Park scientists came along.</i>

275
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:02,128
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...</i>

276
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:06,542
<i>...from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!</i>

277
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:11,970
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

278
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:16,684
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...</i>

279
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,932
<i>...it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.</i>

280
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:25,685
<i>It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</i>

281
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,989
<i>Now that's where our geneticists
take over.</i>

282
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:32,782
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...</i>

283
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:35,276
<i>...break down the strand in minutes.</i>

284
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:37,535
<i>And virtual-reality displays...</i>

285
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:40,789
<i>...show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

286
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:43,867
<i>We used the complete DNA of a frog...</i>

287
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:47,877
<i>...to fill in the holes and complete the code.</i>

288
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:52,630
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

289
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:59,508
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

290
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:03,010
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

291
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:04,649
And then, the tour moves on.

292
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:18,740
<i>Well, look here.
Those hard-working cowpokes...</i>

293
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,745
This is overwhelming, John.

294
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,914
Are these characters autoerotica?

295
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,751
No, we have no animatronics here.

296
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:32,085
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

297
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:35,589
<i>...in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs.</i>

298
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,343
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

299
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,139
- Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
- Shortly.

300
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:47,185
<i>Now a whole team of genetic engineers
goes to work on...</i>

301
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:50,644
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

302
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,694
One, two, three.

303
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,736
You can't do that.

304
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:58,073
- What?
- Can they do that?

305
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:04,951
<i>A reminder: the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 19:00.</i>

306
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:09,954
<i>All personnel be at the dock
no later than 18:45. No exceptions.</i>

307
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:13,960
- G'day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.

308
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,518
It's turning the eggs.

309
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:37,240
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

310
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,780
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

311
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:43,908
I insist on being here when they're born.

312
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:47,037
Come on.

313
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:51,540
Come on, little one.

314
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:03,134
Very good. Push.

315
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:07,261
- Very good.
- God.

316
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,762
Push. Come on.

317
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:13,275
Come on. Come on, then.

318
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,404
There you are. There.

319
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:25,496
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

320
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,831
Helps them to trust me.

321
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:33,505
I've been present for the birth
of every creature on this island.

322
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:37,751
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild.

323
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:40,168
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

324
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:43,097
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

325
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,136
There's no unauthorised breeding
in Jurassic Park.

326
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,553
How do you know they can't breed?

327
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:54,141
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

328
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,606
We've engineered them that way.

329
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,321
There you are.

330
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:03,367
Oh, my God. Look at that.

331
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:07,237
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

332
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,077
What?

333
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:09,659
- 91.
- 91.

334
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,991
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?

335
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:13,200
Yes.

336
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,551
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

337
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:24,716
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

338
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:28,306
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

339
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,801
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female.

340
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:34,728
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

341
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,931
...to make them male.

342
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:38,943
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?

343
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:42,611
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

344
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,700
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

345
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:49,997
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...

346
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,873
...and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

347
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,665
...but there it is.

348
00:30:58,214 --> 00:30:59,673
There it is.

349
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:05,173
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed.

350
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,676
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

351
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,732
What species is this?

352
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,445
It's a Velociraptor.

353
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,112
You bred Raptors?

354
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:46,500
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

355
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:49,632
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?

356
00:31:55,938 --> 00:31:57,136
Feeding them.

357
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:07,437
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass.

358
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,398
Shall we?

359
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,738
They should all be destroyed.

360
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:52,942
Robert Muldoon.

361
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:54,828
My game warden from Kenya.

362
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,914
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

363
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,743
What's their growth rate?

364
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:02,504
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

365
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:06,170
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but how these things move...

366
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:08,250
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

367
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:11,380
50, 60 miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

368
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:13,263
And they're astonishing jumpers.

369
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:16,598
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

370
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,427
Do they show intelligence?

371
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:24,223
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

372
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,235
Especially the big one.

373
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:28,900
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

374
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:32,322
...she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

375
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:38,032
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

376
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:41,699
That's why we have to feed them like this.

377
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:44,829
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

378
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:46,665
The fences are electrified, right?

379
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:49,841
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

380
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:53,716
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

381
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,634
They remember.

382
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:10,773
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

383
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,774
<i>More adventurous guests, of course,
can opt for ourjungle river cruise...</i>

384
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:17,074
<i>...or for a close-up look at our majestic...</i>

385
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:20,661
None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open...

386
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:25,078
...with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

387
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:28,788
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

388
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:32,167
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.

389
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,965
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

390
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,925
- And there's the merchandise...
- Donald.

391
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,683
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

392
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,770
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

393
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:45,970
Sure. They will.

394
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:49,516
We'll have a coupon day or something.

395
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:59,201
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

396
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:03,495
I think things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

397
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,160
I know. They're a lot worse.

398
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:08,501
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet...

399
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:13,507
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

400
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:18,053
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

401
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:21,514
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

402
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,471
...but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

403
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:28,061
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...
- Lf I may.

404
00:35:28,232 --> 00:35:31,897
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

405
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:35,770
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

406
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:39,691
You read what others had done
and you took the next step.

407
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,985
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

408
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,831
...so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

409
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:49,663
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could.

410
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:53,833
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

411
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:58,171
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
and now you're selling it.

412
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:01,802
I don't think you're giving us
our due credit.

413
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,306
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

414
00:36:05,394 --> 00:36:08,644
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

415
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,972
...they didn't stop to think if they should.

416
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:14,815
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.

417
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:20,568
If I created condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

418
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:23,364
This isn't some species
that was obliterated...

419
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:26,573
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.

420
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:31,873
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

421
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,877
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

422
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:42,879
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

423
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:46,638
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

424
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:50,309
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

425
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:54,102
...I call the rape of the natural world.

426
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:58,982
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

427
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:02,073
How could you ever assume
that you can control it?

428
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:06,571
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

429
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:10,874
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

430
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,960
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

431
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:21,623
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who
could appreciate what I am trying to do...

432
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:27,966
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

433
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:33,228
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

434
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:37,519
...two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

435
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,061
...have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

436
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:45,533
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

437
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,867
I don't believe it.

438
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:52,240
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

439
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,784
...and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

440
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:57,792
Thank you.

441
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:06,126
They're here.

442
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,766
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

443
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,638
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

444
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:13,807
Grandpa!

445
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:15,309
Kids!

446
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:21,775
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.

447
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:26,105
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?

448
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,869
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

449
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:35,331
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

450
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:39,872
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.

451
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,455
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

452
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:45,254
- No drivers?
- No, drivers. They're electric.

453
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:48,380
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

454
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:51,389
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

455
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:54,257
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

456
00:38:54,353 --> 00:38:57,354
You touch the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

457
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:00,524
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

458
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,518
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

459
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:05,184
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.

460
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,410
I read your book.

461
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,207
That's great.

462
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:25,837
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

463
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:30,173
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

464
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:37,557
They sure don't look like birds to me.

465
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:41,732
I heard that there was this meteor...

466
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,111
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico
and made this big crater.

467
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:47,524
Listen...

468
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,619
...Tim, which car were you planning on?

469
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:55,828
Whichever one you are.

470
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,707
<i>I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.</i>

471
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,329
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

472
00:40:06,424 --> 00:40:08,049
They died because of the weather.

473
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:12,595
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

474
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:18,009
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

475
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:20,144
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

476
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,938
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 19:00 departure.</i>

477
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,273
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

478
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:31,652
...about 75 miles west of us.

479
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,241
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

480
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:38,075
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

481
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,369
Start the tour program.

482
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,803
Hold onto your butts.

483
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:08,056
<i>And why did they put the fibreglass thing?</i>

484
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,113
<i>You want tojoin the future, right?</i>

485
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:23,662
<i>God help us when the hands of engineers...</i>

486
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,621
<i>During your tour,
the appropriate information will be...</i>

487
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:29,381
<i>...automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

488
00:41:29,465 --> 00:41:33,130
<i>Simply touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

489
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,499
Are we gonna hit that?

490
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,671
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

491
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,217
What have they got in there, King Kong?

492
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,453
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

493
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,115
We spared no expense.

494
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:02,663
<i>If you look to the right...</i>

495
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:08,086
<i>...you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

496
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:10,626
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!

497
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:12,714
<i>One of the earliest carnivores...</i>

498
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,884
<i>...we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...</i>

499
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:21,177
<i>...spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...</i>

500
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:24,428
<i>...allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

501
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:28,762
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...</i>

502
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,767
<i>...to Jurassic Park.</i>

503
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,402
Alan?

504
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,454
Damn.

505
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:53,705
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

506
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:56,289
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

507
00:42:56,384 --> 00:42:58,958
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

508
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:02,180
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a zoo...

509
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:05,266
...and the computers
aren't even on theirfeet yet.

510
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:10,971
Our lives are in your hands
and you have butterfingers?

511
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,023
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

512
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:19,068
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

513
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,730
You think that kind of automation is easy?

514
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:23,073
Or cheap?

515
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,830
You know anyone
who can network eight machines...

516
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:29,911
...and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

517
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:34,414
Sorry about yourfinancial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

518
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:36,961
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

519
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,554
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you. I really will not.

520
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:44,840
There's been hardly any debate at all.

521
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:48,017
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

522
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:50,845
But I do ask that they pay for them.

523
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,262
Thanks, Dad.

524
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:54,520
The headlights.

525
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:57,278
I'll de-bug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

526
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:00,612
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

527
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:03,948
There's a small amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

528
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,154
- Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...
- Quiet, all of you!

529
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,996
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

530
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:05,592
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

531
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:10,805
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

532
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:15,933
Dinosaurs eat man.

533
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:19,100
Woman inherits the earth.

534
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,903
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.</i>

535
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:41,920
What's going to happen to the goat?

536
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:47,969
He's going to eat the goat?

537
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:49,680
Excellent.

538
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:54,016
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

539
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:56,886
I happen to be a vegetarian.

540
00:46:05,238 --> 00:46:08,109
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

541
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:14,159
Can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

542
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:41,269
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

543
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:46,977
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

544
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:49,564
I really hate that man.

545
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:59,579
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

546
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:01,582
The essence of chaos.

547
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:05,003
I'm still not clear on chaos.

548
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:10,588
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

549
00:47:12,138 --> 00:47:14,130
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

550
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:16,429
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

551
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:19,352
...and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

552
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:23,807
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

553
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:24,895
I did a fly-by.

554
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:27,735
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

555
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,940
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.

556
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,898
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

557
00:47:34,743 --> 00:47:36,535
A drop of waterfalls on your hand.

558
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,242
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

559
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:41,124
Thumb, I'd say.

560
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:45,544
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

561
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:48,874
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

562
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,425
Which way, now?

563
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:53,463
Let's say back the same way.

564
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:58,220
It changed. Why?

565
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:00,681
Because tiny variations...

566
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,636
...the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

567
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:05,059
Alan, look at this.

568
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:09,016
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

569
00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:11,518
- "Imperfections in the skin"?
- Just microscopic.

570
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:15,196
...never repeat and vastly effect
the outcome. That's...

571
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:17,323
...what?
- Unpredictability.

572
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,200
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

573
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,746
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant
would jump out of a moving vehicle.

574
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:32,337
And there's another example.

575
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:38,304
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

576
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,307
Stop the program.

577
00:48:44,604 --> 00:48:48,472
I told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

578
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,318
<i>Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</i>

579
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:54,067
<i>We're on. Will notify for resume.</i>

580
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:58,567
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

581
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,744
- What about the circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.

582
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:08,159
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go on that and it looks good.

583
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,539
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

584
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,920
...and he says dinosaurs died
from diseases.

585
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:17,342
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.

586
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:19,552
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

587
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,426
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

588
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:25,269
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

589
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:28,100
You okay?

590
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,603
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

591
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,186
Come on. Watch this.

592
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:40,450
Everybody stay here.

593
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,884
- Okay?
- Of course.

594
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:07,640
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised herfor me.

595
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:09,009
She's sick.

596
00:50:17,905 --> 00:50:19,316
Oh, my God.

597
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:44,385
She was always my favourite
when I was a kid...

598
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:47,842
...and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

599
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:53,564
It's okay.

600
00:50:56,694 --> 00:50:59,267
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

601
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:03,570
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

602
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,911
Imbalance, disorientation,
laboured breathing.

603
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,237
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

604
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:10,706
Six weeks.

605
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:25,971
- These are dilated.
- They are?

606
00:51:26,056 --> 00:51:28,725
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.

607
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,308
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

608
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:42,860
Is this West Indian lilac?

609
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:46,858
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

610
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:54,124
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

611
00:51:55,627 --> 00:51:57,869
There's only one way to be positive.

612
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:01,084
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

613
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:05,378
Dino droppings? Droppings?

614
00:52:11,184 --> 00:52:12,975
Yeah, I got that.

615
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:17,599
That storm centre hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

616
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:20,141
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

617
00:52:20,443 --> 00:52:22,235
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

618
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,570
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.

619
00:52:25,657 --> 00:52:29,275
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they get back in the cars.

620
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:34,031
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

621
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:36,449
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

622
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:40,124
Damn.

623
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:49,463
That is one big pile of shit.

624
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:59,434
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

625
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,563
That's so odd, though.

626
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:05,312
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

627
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:09,653
...every six weeks.

628
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:14,820
Let's see, rats.

629
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,577
She's tenacious.

630
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:21,585
You have no idea.

631
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:27,587
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

632
00:53:39,814 --> 00:53:43,728
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

633
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:49,736
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

634
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:52,282
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

635
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:55,119
I'll drop her off at the centre
before I make the boat.

636
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:58,039
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

637
00:53:58,123 --> 00:53:59,072
You sure?

638
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,953
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

639
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:03,455
Okay, then.

640
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:22,266
<i>There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we have to go, we go.</i>

641
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:24,356
You've got to give me time.

642
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:28,106
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...

643
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:30,318
...you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

644
00:54:30,405 --> 00:54:31,734
<i>No promises.</i>

645
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:42,071
Visitor vehicles are returning
to the garage.

646
00:54:44,419 --> 00:54:49,627
So much for ourfirst tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

647
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:52,301
It could've been worse.

648
00:54:53,762 --> 00:54:55,042
A lot worse.

649
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,260
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

650
00:54:59,351 --> 00:55:01,509
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

651
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:05,351
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

652
00:55:06,191 --> 00:55:08,433
I finished de-bugging the phones.

653
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:11,776
I was going to, so I did.

654
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,651
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

655
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:17,910
...I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

656
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:20,865
...for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

657
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:24,574
...they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

658
00:55:46,898 --> 00:55:51,145
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

659
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:55,484
Anything at all can and does happen.

660
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,481
Same with wives, for that matter.

661
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,365
- You're married?
- Occasionally.

662
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:07,791
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

663
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:23,756
Five, four...

664
00:56:35,946 --> 00:56:38,235
- That's odd.
- What?

665
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:40,649
Door security systems are shutting down.

666
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:44,196
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

667
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:42,170
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

668
00:57:43,347 --> 00:57:46,762
...she's not, like, available, is she?
- Why?

669
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:52,473
- I'm sorry. You two are...
- Yeah.

670
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:59,607
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

671
00:58:08,496 --> 00:58:10,204
What the hell?

672
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,291
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.

673
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,868
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

674
00:58:47,785 --> 00:58:49,861
Just look at this work station.

675
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:53,454
- What a complete slob.
- The Raptorfences aren't out, are they?

676
00:59:00,465 --> 00:59:02,208
No, no. They're still on.

677
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:07,382
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

678
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,130
Access main program.

679
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:51,632
Access main security.

680
00:59:52,391 --> 00:59:54,099
Access main program grid.

681
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:05,311
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

682
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:09,272
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

683
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:12,658
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

684
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,622
Phones are out, too.

685
01:00:20,169 --> 01:00:21,829
Where did the vehicles stop?

686
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:44,394
Their radio's out, too.

687
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,268
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

688
01:00:47,446 --> 01:00:49,604
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

689
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:51,406
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

690
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:54,576
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

691
01:00:54,703 --> 01:00:56,742
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.

692
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:02,700
Hey, where did you find those?

693
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:05,541
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?

694
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:08,675
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

695
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:17,426
Don't scare me.

696
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:30,778
Cool. Night vision.

697
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:57,514
Did you feel that?

698
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:34,087
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

699
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:38,001
What is that?

700
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:56,531
Where's the goat?

701
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:20,794
Jesus!

702
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:27,477
He left us.

703
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:43,111
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:02,501
Dr. Grant.

705
01:04:15,402 --> 01:04:17,525
I hate being right all the time.

706
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:31,160
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

707
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,723
Turn the light off.

708
01:04:51,646 --> 01:04:53,105
Turn the light off!

709
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:51,823
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!

710
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:57,994
You're the one who turned it...

711
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:18,327
Ian, freeze!

712
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,244
Get the kids!

713
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:23,536
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!

714
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:26,125
Get rid of the flare!

715
01:07:29,094 --> 01:07:30,920
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be...

716
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:54,613
Dr. Grant!

717
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,822
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

718
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:04,207
I'll get you next. You're okay.

719
01:08:05,588 --> 01:08:06,963
You're all right.

720
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:09,293
Tim. Tim!

721
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:15,930
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

722
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,406
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.

723
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:27,496
Grab the wire.

724
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:51,098
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

725
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:54,438
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

726
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,733
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object. "

727
01:09:57,908 --> 01:10:01,858
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

728
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:05,654
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

729
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,957
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.

730
01:10:09,211 --> 01:10:10,621
- Two million?
- Yeah.

731
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:18,299
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

732
01:10:19,888 --> 01:10:22,130
...and bring back my grandchildren.

733
01:10:23,016 --> 01:10:24,047
Sure.

734
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:28,472
I'm going with him.

735
01:10:31,816 --> 01:10:32,848
John.

736
01:10:38,823 --> 01:10:42,323
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line
without Dennis Nedry.

737
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:03,634
Damn it!

738
01:11:10,355 --> 01:11:11,765
There's the road!

739
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:22,365
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to the that thing there.

740
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,866
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

741
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,621
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

742
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:10,161
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

743
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,619
Hello.

744
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:26,548
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

745
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:39,103
Nice boy.

746
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,605
Nice boy.

747
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:42,819
Nice dinosaur.

748
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:47,071
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

749
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:51,073
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

750
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:54,662
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

751
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,249
Go on. Play fetch?

752
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:01,620
Look, stick.

753
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,458
Look at stick.

754
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:09,053
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

755
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:12,132
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

756
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:14,136
No wonder you're extinct.

757
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,637
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

758
01:14:34,098 --> 01:14:35,676
Timmy!

759
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,810
Now, Lex. Listen.

760
01:14:42,523 --> 01:14:44,183
Lex, I'm right here.

761
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:47,314
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

762
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:49,651
Stay right here and wait for me.

763
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:52,356
He left us.

764
01:14:52,867 --> 01:14:55,358
But that's not what I'm going to do.

765
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:58,444
Okay?

766
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,156
Stay here.

767
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:31,312
You hear me? I'm coming up.

768
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:35,980
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

769
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:05,350
You okay?

770
01:16:08,358 --> 01:16:09,603
I threw up.

771
01:16:12,738 --> 01:16:13,936
That's okay.

772
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:16,614
Just give me your hand.

773
01:16:20,787 --> 01:16:24,832
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

774
01:16:33,884 --> 01:16:35,212
Here, I've got you.

775
01:16:37,012 --> 01:16:38,043
Okay.

776
01:16:38,597 --> 01:16:42,428
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.

777
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,222
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

778
01:16:52,861 --> 01:16:55,565
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

779
01:16:55,655 --> 01:16:58,360
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

780
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,992
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

781
01:17:01,661 --> 01:17:04,448
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

782
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:06,116
This is impossible.

783
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:10,663
- How am I going to do this? It's about...
- I'm going to help you with yourfooting.

784
01:17:16,426 --> 01:17:17,457
Tim, go.

785
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:41,533
Go, Tim, go!

786
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:51,032
Faster, Tim!

787
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:58,873
Tim, jump!

788
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:03,968
Go, Tim.

789
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,847
We're back in the car again.

790
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:19,145
At least you're out of the tree.

791
01:18:24,535 --> 01:18:26,159
Where's the other car?

792
01:18:29,415 --> 01:18:30,577
Alan!

793
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:32,954
Dr. Grant!

794
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:52,517
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.

795
01:18:56,108 --> 01:18:58,646
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.

796
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:02,104
With fences down,
it can wander in and out of any paddock.

797
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:11,113
He's put a tourniquet on. Lan.

798
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,537
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

799
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:22,292
Can we chance moving him?

800
01:19:23,635 --> 01:19:25,094
Please chance it.

801
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,223
Ellie, come on!

802
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:43,858
The other car!

803
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:45,859
Dr. Grant?

804
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,864
They're not here.

805
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,728
Anybody hear that?

806
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:28,730
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

807
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,408
I'm fairly alarmed here.

808
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,540
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!

809
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,454
Let's go.

810
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,209
Must go faster.

811
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,726
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

812
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,187
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!

813
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,630
Think they'll have that on the tour?

814
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,393
Are you hearing this?

815
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,149
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

816
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,826
Let's get up this tree.

817
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:02,541
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

818
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,209
I hate trees.

819
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,500
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

820
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:30,560
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

821
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,524
They're singing.

822
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,596
Don't let the monsters come here.

823
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:08,103
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

824
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:11,727
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

825
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,479
I hate the other kind.

826
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:18,360
The other kind just do what they do.

827
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:39,669
What's that?

828
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:48,678
What are you and Ellie going to do,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

829
01:23:50,274 --> 01:23:51,519
I don't know.

830
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,184
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

831
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:01,072
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

832
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,495
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus. "

833
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:13,286
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

834
01:24:14,131 --> 01:24:15,294
You got me.

835
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,625
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex. "

836
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,338
- Alan?
- Yeah?

837
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:26,349
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

838
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,852
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

839
01:24:33,442 --> 01:24:34,557
All night.

840
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:26,451
They were all melting.

841
01:25:30,165 --> 01:25:33,285
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

842
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:38,714
They'll all be fine.

843
01:25:39,716 --> 01:25:44,010
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

844
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,266
You know, the first...

845
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:54,971
...attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

846
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,141
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

847
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:02,320
Really quite wonderful.

848
01:26:02,906 --> 01:26:06,156
I had a wee trapeze and a...

849
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:10,569
...carousel...

850
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:15,911
...and a seesaw.

851
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:19,251
They all move motorised, of course.

852
01:26:19,589 --> 01:26:22,294
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

853
01:26:22,383 --> 01:26:24,127
"Can't you see the fleas?"

854
01:26:24,886 --> 01:26:29,180
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

855
01:26:35,396 --> 01:26:36,772
With this place...

856
01:26:38,983 --> 01:26:42,352
...I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

857
01:26:43,362 --> 01:26:46,482
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

858
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:51,077
...see and touch.

859
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:58,241
An aim not devoid of merit.

860
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:06,375
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

861
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:10,339
You're absolutely right.

862
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:14,430
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

863
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,265
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.

864
01:27:17,354 --> 01:27:19,976
Next time, everything's correctable.

865
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:23,978
Creation is an act of sheer will.

866
01:27:26,322 --> 01:27:28,279
Next time, it'll be flawless.

867
01:27:28,866 --> 01:27:32,199
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

868
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:33,822
When we have control...

869
01:27:33,913 --> 01:27:36,582
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

870
01:27:36,749 --> 01:27:39,418
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

871
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:42,247
I made a mistake, too.

872
01:27:42,379 --> 01:27:46,163
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

873
01:27:48,802 --> 01:27:51,969
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

874
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:56,264
Alan, Lex, and Tim.

875
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:01,014
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

876
01:28:18,081 --> 01:28:19,196
It's good.

877
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,628
Spared no expense.

878
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:55,157
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

879
01:28:55,827 --> 01:28:58,496
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus. "

880
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:00,070
Veggie.

881
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:02,957
Come on. Come on, girl.

882
01:29:07,172 --> 01:29:08,547
Come on, baby.

883
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:16,465
I'm not letting go.

884
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:31,236
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.

885
01:29:31,613 --> 01:29:33,237
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

886
01:29:33,573 --> 01:29:36,609
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

887
01:29:39,996 --> 01:29:41,194
I like cows.

888
01:29:51,257 --> 01:29:53,582
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

889
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:02,303
God bless you.

890
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:11,608
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.

891
01:30:12,153 --> 01:30:15,189
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

892
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:18,068
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.

893
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,409
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

894
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,735
God.

895
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,334
You know what this is?

896
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:33,248
It's a dinosaur egg.

897
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:37,169
The dinosaurs are breeding.

898
01:30:40,347 --> 01:30:44,427
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

899
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:48,053
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

900
01:30:51,942 --> 01:30:56,984
The film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

901
01:30:57,072 --> 01:31:00,358
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.

902
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,652
And blended it with that of frogs.

903
01:31:06,582 --> 01:31:11,042
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

904
01:31:11,128 --> 01:31:13,167
...in a single sex environment.

905
01:31:15,173 --> 01:31:16,716
Malcolm was right.

906
01:31:18,135 --> 01:31:19,166
Look.

907
01:31:27,936 --> 01:31:29,644
Life found a way.

908
01:31:32,983 --> 01:31:36,980
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.

909
01:31:37,237 --> 01:31:39,443
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

910
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:43,398
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

911
01:31:43,493 --> 01:31:47,906
We'll neverfind the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

912
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:51,292
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

913
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:55,919
- So, shutting down the entire system...
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.

914
01:31:56,006 --> 01:32:01,213
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

915
01:32:02,304 --> 01:32:05,886
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

916
01:32:06,057 --> 01:32:08,762
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?

917
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:12,311
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.

918
01:32:12,397 --> 01:32:15,398
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?

919
01:32:15,483 --> 01:32:17,108
Yes, again, in theory.

920
01:32:17,735 --> 01:32:21,151
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

921
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,074
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.

922
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:26,994
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

923
01:32:27,078 --> 01:32:28,952
...if they ever get off the island.

924
01:32:29,038 --> 01:32:32,703
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

925
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:35,710
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

926
01:32:35,795 --> 01:32:39,544
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

927
01:32:39,632 --> 01:32:42,088
People are dying.

928
01:32:46,305 --> 01:32:48,678
Will you please shut down the system?

929
01:33:10,705 --> 01:33:12,365
Hold on to your butts.

930
01:33:32,268 --> 01:33:33,382
It's okay.

931
01:33:33,519 --> 01:33:36,188
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

932
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:41,063
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

933
01:33:41,151 --> 01:33:45,280
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

934
01:33:45,364 --> 01:33:48,733
Telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

935
01:33:48,826 --> 01:33:51,233
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

936
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:53,036
The shed at end of the compound.

937
01:33:53,122 --> 01:33:55,873
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

938
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:59,042
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

939
01:33:59,128 --> 01:34:02,461
...until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

940
01:34:02,756 --> 01:34:04,879
- I'm tired. I'm hot.
- I'm dirty.

941
01:34:05,884 --> 01:34:09,549
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...

942
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:12,013
...over that rise there.

943
01:34:16,478 --> 01:34:17,509
What is that?

944
01:34:20,274 --> 01:34:22,480
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

945
01:34:29,533 --> 01:34:30,778
Gallimimus.

946
01:34:30,867 --> 01:34:33,358
Are those meat-eating?

947
01:34:34,996 --> 01:34:36,277
"Meat-asauruses"?

948
01:34:41,294 --> 01:34:43,750
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

949
01:34:43,839 --> 01:34:46,543
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

950
01:34:48,051 --> 01:34:51,171
They're flocking this way.

951
01:35:34,138 --> 01:35:36,345
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.

952
01:35:36,432 --> 01:35:37,464
Please.

953
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:40,560
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

954
01:35:40,645 --> 01:35:42,721
- Yes.
- Go now.

955
01:35:44,565 --> 01:35:47,235
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

956
01:35:49,654 --> 01:35:51,445
Look how much blood.

957
01:35:53,658 --> 01:35:55,781
God. Something went wrong.

958
01:35:56,661 --> 01:36:00,195
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

959
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:04,495
This is just a delay.

960
01:36:04,585 --> 01:36:07,670
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

961
01:36:07,922 --> 01:36:12,251
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

962
01:36:12,677 --> 01:36:16,377
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

963
01:36:16,472 --> 01:36:21,348
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

964
01:36:21,644 --> 01:36:24,728
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know.

965
01:36:24,897 --> 01:36:28,183
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone...

966
01:36:30,861 --> 01:36:32,901
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

967
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:49,577
Sorry.

968
01:36:53,592 --> 01:36:57,839
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

969
01:36:57,971 --> 01:37:01,340
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

970
01:37:05,938 --> 01:37:06,933
Right.

971
01:37:12,986 --> 01:37:15,026
It ought to be me, really, going.

972
01:37:15,113 --> 01:37:17,949
- Why?
- I'm a... And you're a...

973
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:21,776
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

974
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:25,120
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

975
01:37:25,207 --> 01:37:28,825
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

976
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:08,582
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

977
01:38:09,209 --> 01:38:12,874
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

978
01:38:18,843 --> 01:38:20,006
Come on, this way.

979
01:38:27,519 --> 01:38:29,476
I can see the shed from here.

980
01:38:29,687 --> 01:38:31,431
We can make it if we run.

981
01:38:31,773 --> 01:38:34,311
No. We can't.

982
01:38:35,235 --> 01:38:36,266
Why not?

983
01:38:37,028 --> 01:38:38,985
Because we're being hunted.

984
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:42,316
In the bushes, straight ahead.

985
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,233
It's all right.

986
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:48,205
Like hell it is.

987
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,707
Run. Towards the shed.

988
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:56,379
I've got her.

989
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:58,834
Go. Now!

990
01:39:18,027 --> 01:39:19,402
Mr. Arnold?

991
01:39:24,742 --> 01:39:25,987
John, I'm in.

992
01:39:26,577 --> 01:39:27,526
<i>Great.</i>

993
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,579
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

994
01:39:33,626 --> 01:39:35,914
<i>Okay. Going down.</i>

995
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:40,752
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

996
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:43,961
- Have herfollow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.

997
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:16,331
I guess that means the power's off.

998
01:40:29,598 --> 01:40:32,219
- That's not funny.
- That was great.

999
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:36,637
Well, maybe we, we could...

1000
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:56,989
Damn it. Dead end.

1001
01:40:57,375 --> 01:40:58,620
Wait a minute.

1002
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:03,455
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1003
01:41:04,424 --> 01:41:05,373
Look above you.

1004
01:41:06,885 --> 01:41:10,752
<i>There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</i>

1005
01:41:10,847 --> 01:41:12,010
Follow that.

1006
01:41:12,682 --> 01:41:14,841
Okay. Following the piping.

1007
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,981
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1008
01:41:22,067 --> 01:41:24,392
- What would you give me?
- Respect.

1009
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:27,401
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1010
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:30,318
I see the box.

1011
01:41:32,076 --> 01:41:33,784
It says, "High Voltage. "

1012
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,162
Okay.

1013
01:41:43,254 --> 01:41:45,923
Good. Here we go.

1014
01:41:46,591 --> 01:41:47,789
Over the top.

1015
01:41:48,426 --> 01:41:50,051
Take your time.

1016
01:41:51,054 --> 01:41:52,049
Good. Come on.

1017
01:41:52,805 --> 01:41:54,714
Find yourfooting.

1018
01:41:56,976 --> 01:41:59,681
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1019
01:41:59,771 --> 01:42:03,186
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1020
01:42:03,274 --> 01:42:05,599
It's large, flat and grey.

1021
01:42:06,402 --> 01:42:08,311
All right, here I go. Okay?

1022
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:15,113
One, two, three, four.

1023
01:42:15,411 --> 01:42:17,036
Okay, charged.

1024
01:42:17,747 --> 01:42:21,531
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1025
01:42:21,834 --> 01:42:24,159
...which says "Push to Close. "

1026
01:42:24,712 --> 01:42:26,539
Push to close.

1027
01:42:30,051 --> 01:42:31,046
Push it.

1028
01:42:46,275 --> 01:42:50,225
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1029
01:42:51,113 --> 01:42:52,276
Switch them on.

1030
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:06,124
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.

1031
01:43:06,211 --> 01:43:07,955
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1032
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:10,751
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.

1033
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:13,249
One, two, three!

1034
01:43:17,347 --> 01:43:19,091
I'm coming up to get you.

1035
01:43:19,183 --> 01:43:20,677
I've got to get Tim.

1036
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:22,845
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1037
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:26,435
One...

1038
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,479
...two...

1039
01:43:40,579 --> 01:43:41,741
He's not breathing.

1040
01:43:47,002 --> 01:43:49,374
I think we're back in business!

1041
01:45:29,186 --> 01:45:30,431
Clever girl.

1042
01:45:54,753 --> 01:45:55,785
No, Tim!

1043
01:45:58,799 --> 01:46:00,673
Good boy.

1044
01:46:05,264 --> 01:46:06,462
Three.

1045
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:12,724
Hello?

1046
01:46:24,575 --> 01:46:26,733
I'm gonna have to find the others.

1047
01:46:27,411 --> 01:46:30,162
Get you to a doctor.

1048
01:46:32,207 --> 01:46:34,496
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1049
01:46:35,794 --> 01:46:37,751
Your hair is all sticking up.

1050
01:46:39,756 --> 01:46:42,045
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1051
01:46:46,346 --> 01:46:48,505
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1052
01:47:15,834 --> 01:47:16,830
Run.

1053
01:48:33,452 --> 01:48:35,362
Just the two Raptors, right?

1054
01:48:36,872 --> 01:48:38,746
You sure the third one's contained?

1055
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:42,415
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1056
01:49:09,029 --> 01:49:12,196
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.

1057
01:49:14,993 --> 01:49:16,488
It's inside.

1058
01:49:42,062 --> 01:49:43,141
Follow me.

1059
01:52:18,717 --> 01:52:19,962
It's in there.

1060
01:52:20,844 --> 01:52:22,089
Control room.

1061
01:52:28,435 --> 01:52:31,721
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.

1062
01:52:34,566 --> 01:52:35,764
The door locks!

1063
01:52:36,777 --> 01:52:38,816
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1064
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:50,157
No, boot up the door locks!

1065
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:55,040
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!

1066
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:06,969
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1067
01:53:07,724 --> 01:53:09,800
It's all the files of the whole park.

1068
01:53:09,893 --> 01:53:13,143
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1069
01:53:13,897 --> 01:53:15,474
Try to reach the gun.

1070
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:25,947
I can't get it unless I move.

1071
01:53:41,758 --> 01:53:44,331
This is it. This might be the right file.

1072
01:53:59,984 --> 01:54:01,562
- You got it!
- Yes!

1073
01:54:12,288 --> 01:54:13,319
What works?

1074
01:54:13,414 --> 01:54:16,119
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!

1075
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:26,875
Grant.

1076
01:54:27,303 --> 01:54:30,220
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1077
01:54:30,723 --> 01:54:33,558
<i>- The children all right?
- The children are fine.</i>

1078
01:54:33,935 --> 01:54:37,304
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.

1079
01:54:38,522 --> 01:54:40,147
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1080
01:55:34,745 --> 01:55:35,610
Move!

1081
01:57:39,035 --> 01:57:43,328
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1082
01:57:44,123 --> 01:57:45,321
So have I.

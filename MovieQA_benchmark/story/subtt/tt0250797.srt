1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,769
Pretty windy out

3
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,423
That better not be the one
where you blow people up

4
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,192
It's not, Mom

5
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,127
Mm-hmm

6
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,334
Dad, look what I can do

7
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,629
I've been practicing

8
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:26,506
That's spectacular, kiddo

9
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,873
Cool

10
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,979
You're inside out

11
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,344
Oh... I knew that

12
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:37,520
Doesn't work for you?

13
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:41,122
Can't believe you taught him that

14
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,119
I didn't... He did it on his own

15
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:48,090
Charlie, did you brush your teeth?

16
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,997
- Yes
- Charlie...

17
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:51,225
I brushed them

18
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:52,233
Let me see

19
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,234
Look at this, Con...

20
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,100
Let's go. I'm serious

21
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,064
You're driving me bonkers, Mom...

22
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:00,266
Let's go

23
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,239
Con, remember when we
were gonna buy Omnidel

24
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,746
you said no?

25
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,411
You remember what
the price was?

26
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,881
Uh, 1.50 $

27
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:10,113
Close. 61 $

28
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,153
I'll do it, Mom

29
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:12,745
No, I'm gonna do it

30
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:14,882
You know what it's
going for now, Con?

31
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,755
- Say, "e"
- Eeeee

32
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,556
Guess, Con

33
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,858
Edward, I don't know, all right?

34
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,092
All right, now rinse

35
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,395
74 $

36
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,667
Really rinse. And pee

37
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,267
I should've bought it. Shit

38
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,901
So buy some

39
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,109
Too late, Con. Too late

40
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,209
Lift the seat, honey

41
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,582
Don't forget to put it down!

42
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,456
When you finish...

43
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,759
Do you really need all that stuff?

44
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:55,495
Mom... no one wears these dorky hats

45
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,729
Well, you do, and you're not a dork

46
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,264
How do I look?

47
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,830
Very handsome

48
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:05,468
Love you... Ok. Come on, let's go!

49
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,645
Whoa. Jesus!

50
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,111
Come on

51
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:11,647
Whoa!

52
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,314
Maybe you shouldn't go in today

53
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,946
I promised I'd do that
stuff for the auction...

54
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,111
And someone's got
a birthday coming up

55
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:19,587
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom

56
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,123
Don't forget

57
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,817
He's on the Yankees, right?

58
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,189
Mom...

59
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,923
You're driving me bonkers

60
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,196
You're driving him bonkers

61
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,069
Jesus...

62
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,134
<i>...it's a holiday there</i>

63
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,367
<i>Well, I'll just keep talking</i>

64
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,774
<i>No, no, that's ok.
But in order to pick up...</i>

65
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,296
Taxi!

66
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,690
Shit!

67
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,795
Taxi!

68
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,605
Taxi. Taxi!

69
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,746
Oh... Shit!

70
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,606
I'm so sorry!

71
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,107
- Oh, putanne! Mes bouquins!
- I'm so sorry

72
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,085
Putanne! Mes bouquins!

73
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:05,618
I'm sorry

74
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,047
I'll get your things

75
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,131
Aw, shit!

76
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:21,127
Taxi! Taxi!

77
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,001
My books! Putanne!...

78
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,147
I need a taxi!
Could you help me get a taxi?

79
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,181
Ok

80
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,388
I'll watch your books

81
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,091
- Thanks
- Thank you

82
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:49,228
Hey. Hey!

83
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,391
Hey!

84
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,742
Bad day for taxis

85
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,852
It's this horrible wind

86
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,453
Yeah. You shot down
there like a bullet!

87
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,355
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home by now

88
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,620
I'll remember that next time

89
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,221
That's not good

90
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:22,356
I know

91
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:26,397
Listen, that's me up there...
the flower pot

92
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,604
I get you a band-aid, ok?

93
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,812
Hold on to something.
Don't blow away

94
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:43,213
Or... you can come on
up and clean it off, no?

95
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,581
Come on!

96
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,221
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise

97
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,136
Oh, shit

98
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,907
Fucking elevator

99
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,008
Ne marche pas jamais cet ascenseur!

100
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,909
Ascenseur de merde!

101
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,042
Allez! One more!

102
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:36,803
Pardon the mess

103
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,702
You a writer?

104
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,945
I'm a book dealer

105
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,938
Oh...

106
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:49,042
Uh... bathroom's right
down there, on the left

107
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:53,488
Go ahead

108
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,390
There's a medicine cabinet

109
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,025
You can sneak a peak
at my prescriptions

110
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,125
Hello

111
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,636
I made you some tea

112
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,038
Thank you

113
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,077
Do you box?

114
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,384
I used to... when I was young

115
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,413
Hmm

116
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:32,480
This is an amazing place

117
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,979
Uh-huh

118
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:35,788
Yeah, but it's not mine

119
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:36,959
No?

120
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,721
The owner is a friend, a sculptor

121
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,755
and he's living in Paris,
so... that's cool

122
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:44,199
We can stay here, me and my books

123
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,829
Hmm

124
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,867
Um, I... can I use your phone?

125
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,008
I have to call home

126
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,734
Oh, sure, sure. There's
a phone just behind you

127
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,276
Thank you

128
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,382
Gloria? Hi, it's me

129
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:06,956
Good, good

130
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,855
How's Charlie?

131
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,356
Hi, honey. How was
your day at school?

132
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,593
Yeah? What was the best part?

133
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,263
Guess what. Can you believe
that mommy missed her train?

134
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,768
Um...

135
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,810
Ice

136
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,544
Uh... about an hour

137
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,815
You should start your homework

138
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,483
No. I promise to tell you
all about it when I see you

139
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,321
I love you. Bye

140
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,655
That was my son Charlie

141
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,096
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week

142
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:50,494
I'm Paul Martel.
I'll be 28 in July

143
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,401
I'm Constance

144
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,035
And I'm late. I have to go

145
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,865
Before you go, take your book... no?

146
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:05,337
Oh, no, I... I couldn't. I don't...

147
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,043
Sure, you can

148
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,911
A souvenir

149
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,616
Go down there

150
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,650
You know, like before

151
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,388
Ok

152
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:24,126
Keep going...

153
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,227
Stop!

154
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,101
Now right

155
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,205
No. Right

156
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,035
Ok, now... the second
shelf from the top...

157
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:38,813
Take the fourth one
from the left

158
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:40,514
Got it?

159
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:42,918
Think so

160
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,283
Open to page 23

161
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,360
<i>"Drink wine</i>

Thank you

172
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:26,258
Can you find your way out?

173
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:27,527
I hope so

174
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,061
That's my bedroom

175
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:38,241
It was nice meeting you, Constance

176
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,736
Hey, come back if you need more
books or... medical attention

177
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:16,704
<i>A perfect 10 there!</i>

178
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:19,577
<i>Oh, my! Did you see that?</i>

179
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,181
Hey, Glo, hey

180
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,987
That wouldn't be
the TV on, would it?

181
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,315
I was just turning it off

182
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:30,993
Sure you were

183
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,167
The wind knocked me down today, Glo

184
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:43,294
Oh, yeah? You all right?
Do you need anything?

185
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,173
Gross!

186
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:50,034
- Were you in a fight?
- No, just fell over

187
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,237
Does it hurt?

188
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,379
A little bit

189
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,872
Cool!

190
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,178
Where are you going?

191
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,919
To get the camera!

192
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,215
- Try this
- Thank you

193
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,616
What do you need a camera for?

194
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,484
It's for school.
We're doing blood and stuff

195
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,958
Ok, now look like it really hurts

196
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,592
- Ready?
- Yep

197
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,431
This'll be great

198
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,330
The wind blew her down...

199
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,608
She bled and everything

200
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,600
Everybody's hats blew off

201
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,335
Look who's the worid photographer

202
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:23,879
You ok?

203
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,541
Yeah... It took me
down like an old lady

204
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,647
- Honey...
- It's humiliating

205
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,146
Dad, look at the pictures

206
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:35,215
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

207
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,385
- Whoa!
- No

208
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:39,353
There was this nice
guy who helped me

209
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,029
It was like this, Dad. It was a twister

210
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,393
Dad, look!

211
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,134
It was like this. This is a tornado

212
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,139
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi

213
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,107
Is he good-looking?

214
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,044
I feel sick

215
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,186
Did you do your homework, Charlie?

216
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,817
I can't. I don't know how to do it

217
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,922
Well, come on. I'll help you

218
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,686
You can help me with mine

219
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,429
Did you get his name? This guy?

220
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:18,096
You can send him a bottle a wine

221
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,929
Cheap wine

222
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,451
Con, stand there a second.
Con, wait a minute...

223
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,282
Just stay there a second. I'm just
trying to figure out how to do the...

224
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,419
The thing I can't
figure out is the, um...

225
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,055
...zoom thing here

226
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,399
There it is. Ok, hold on. Stay there

227
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:55,332
The zooming thingie... zooming in

228
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,603
Stay there. No, come on. I'm just
trying to figure this thing out

229
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,472
I want to see if it focuses...

230
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,372
Hold on. Come here

231
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,641
Cool. Very cool

232
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,684
So beautiful

233
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,623
If you only knew... Look at you

234
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,785
God, what a beauty

235
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,901
Something the matter?

236
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,264
Nothing

237
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,374
Nothing at all

238
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,936
Good

239
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:37,938
Come here

240
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,518
- This is really good
- No, it isn't. Go away

241
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:56,462
- Come here
- This is major

242
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,961
I think it really is zooming in

243
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,364
I found the zoom

244
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,805
Found it

245
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,173
Dad!

246
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:09,928
<i>Mom!</i>

247
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,613
Shit! Ok...

248
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:14,340
<i>I can't sleep!</i>

249
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:17,175
- That camera...
- Jesus!

250
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:22,016
I'll be back. I'll be back...
Don't fall asleep

251
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,625
It works!

252
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,100
Mom, are you nuts?

253
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,335
You forgot my lunch

254
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,529
I did not

255
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,164
It's by the door.
Come with me

256
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,572
What are you chew...
what are you chewing?

257
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,443
Nothing

258
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,277
Spit that out. What is that?

259
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,095
Oh...

260
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,509
That's lovely

261
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,885
- Mom?
- Yes?

262
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,285
I don't want to be a dumb bunny

263
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,118
Honey, it's a play

264
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,885
There's lots of other bunnies

265
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,859
It would be cool
to be a bunny

266
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,760
- You're bonkers, Mom
- That's what you tell me

267
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,628
- Love you
- Love you, too. What's that?

268
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,564
Oh. Thank you

269
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,062
Bye

270
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,445
Shit

271
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,625
<i>Hi, this is Paul Martel</i>

272
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:20,759
<i>Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.</i>

273
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:24,870
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

274
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:25,872
Hello?

275
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,208
- Hello
- Hello!

276
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,934
You're... you're there

277
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,413
This is Connie Sumner

278
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,814
The one from the really windy day

279
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,478
Oh, that one!

280
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:39,187
How's the knee?
Did you ice it?

281
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:42,286
Yes, I iced it and
I elevated it and...

282
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,093
...you name it, I did it,
and it's much better and I...

283
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,961
And I... I just wanted to call and
I wanted to thank you and, um...

284
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,823
I wanted to ask for your address

285
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,199
<i>because I wanted to
send you a bottle of...</i>

286
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,233
- Where are you?
- What?

287
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,901
I said where are you?

288
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:00,675
I'm in Grand Central

289
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,201
It's really hard to hear you

290
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,679
Come and see me

291
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:05,839
<i>What?</i>

292
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:07,641
Yeah, take a break

293
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,984
I'll make you some coffee

294
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,083
Coffee...

295
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,391
Um...

296
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:21,689
Uh... ok

297
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:23,290
Ok

298
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,261
See you. Bye

299
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,794
Fuck

300
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:40,816
Ah, no permanent damage, I see

301
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,853
We take Medicaid, Blue Cross...

302
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,452
I'm uninsured

303
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,826
No, I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases here

304
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,759
It was a joke

305
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:10,236
Oh, look at this...

306
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:11,906
Jack London

307
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:13,979
First edition of "White Fang"

308
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,750
In the original dust jacket.
And you know what?

309
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,780
I got it for a buck & 50

310
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,846
What's it worth?

311
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,758
About 4,000 times more!

312
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:28,890
Those are in French

313
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,526
I took it in school

314
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:35,700
Ah. Uh... "Tu veux
enlever ton manteau?"

315
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:39,568
Do I want to take off something?

316
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:43,112
Um... your coat

317
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:46,044
Would you like to
take off your coat?

318
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,249
Yes, my coat...

319
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,413
Thank you

320
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,326
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run

321
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:06,434
- I'll get the coffee
- Ok

322
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:14,967
Shit

323
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:29,991
It's in Braille

324
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:31,958
Braille

325
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:35,022
No, no. Braille.
He was French

326
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,230
Close your eyes

327
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:39,800
What?

328
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,835
Close your eyes

329
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,688
<i>"My mother makes me chicken"</i>

330
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,250
<i>"Her chicken makes me cough"</i>

331
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:10,630
<i>"I wish that when she made it"</i>

332
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:14,093
<i>"she took the feathers off"</i>

333
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,032
It doesn't say that

334
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,117
I had better go

335
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,020
- Huh?
- I got to go

336
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:43,061
Uh... take care. Don't fall

337
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,196
Thanks for the coffee

338
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:47,894
You didn't drink it

339
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,648
Hi

340
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:05,851
Lindsay, hi

341
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:07,752
Ah, Connie...

342
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,155
- Let me buzz him
- Thanks

343
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,455
Hey, what a surprise

344
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:16,823
Look at you!

345
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,631
- Hi, Bill
Hi, Connie

346
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,633
Am I interrupting?

347
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,363
- No, no
- I was just leaving

348
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:24,003
All right, I'll, uh, I'll get you
the budget for those trucks later

349
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:25,238
All right. Thanks

350
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,535
Would you like a coffee?

351
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,874
No, thank you

352
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,076
Mmm

353
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:38,207
- Ah, that's nice
- Mmm. Mmm

354
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,352
You know, I didn't know
you were coming in today

355
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,914
I could've given you a ride

356
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:44,357
You're freezing. What is that?

357
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,991
Well, I was around the corner,
and I brought you a present

358
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:50,657
Wow. What's the occasión?

359
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,432
Nothing. I don't know

360
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:57,404
It's a medium, but
they said it runs large

361
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,699
Look at that!

362
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,606
You don't have to try it on

363
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,436
I'm the boss. I can do
whatever I want

364
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:14,216
What do you think?

365
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,883
Hold on just a second

366
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,056
Yeah?

367
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:25,527
Oh, all right, but
hold the other calls

368
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:27,999
You're busy. I'll go

369
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,734
- I'll go
- No. Sit. Sit. Sit

370
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:32,100
Hello, Henry...

371
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,809
Yeah, so what is this
suspensión problem?

372
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,207
No, I never received it

373
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:41,315
Well, all right.
Well, get it to me

374
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:44,482
Henry, this... No,
it's not good enough

375
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,911
I'm sitting here with 200
trucks that I can't use

376
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:48,618
All right. Well, set up a meeting

377
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:51,186
Yeah, and I want
Frank Burnbaum there

378
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,227
'Cause I don't feel
good about this guy

379
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,926
When I tell someone to do
something, I want it done

380
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,223
I'm sure you will

381
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:02,571
Anyway...

382
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:06,064
So, what else you up to?

383
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:09,074
- Auction
- Yeah?

384
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,401
Who'd you hit on?

385
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,709
The usual suspects...

386
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,051
Who?

387
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:24,323
- Bob Gaylord
- Bob?

388
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:29,161
You get a pledge out of Bob, they
should send you to the middle east

389
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,503
So, tell me...

390
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:40,706
What?

391
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,443
What do you think?

392
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,275
It's a keeper!

393
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,547
Jeez

394
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,678
Hello

395
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:53,281
Hello

396
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,555
Here I am again

397
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:02,754
I brought muffins

398
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,655
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

399
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,568
What is this music?

400
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,243
You like it?

401
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:22,742
Yes

402
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,510
Do you want to dance?

403
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,081
Now?

404
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,709
Yeah

405
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:33,554
Ok

406
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:39,218
I have to warn you,
I tend to lead

407
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:41,656
Of course. You are American

408
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,036
You've done this before

409
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:56,807
Uh, what?

410
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:02,374
How many girlfriends
have you had?

411
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:07,748
Um... two

412
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:10,382
Really?

413
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,285
Would I lie to you?

414
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,393
I don't know, would you?

415
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,610
Your eyes are amazing,
you know that?

416
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,385
You should never shut them.
Not even at night

417
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:42,755
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open

418
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,595
I'll work on that

419
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:49,994
Will you?

420
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:54,965
Hang on

421
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:01,670
I think this is a mistake

422
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,448
There's no such thing as a mistake

423
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:09,273
There's what you do
and what you don't do

424
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,621
I can't do this

425
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,533
I forgot my coat

426
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,036
I can't. I can't

427
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:47,132
What? What's wrong?

428
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,177
I can't. I don't know
how to do this

429
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,405
- This is wrong
- Hit me

430
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:52,780
I don't want to

431
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:54,409
Hit me

432
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:02,013
Hit me

433
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,883
<i>Say, Ed!</i>

434
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:40,214
<i>- Hey, Bob!
- Haven't seen you in a while</i>

435
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,854
No. No. I've been
working late this week

436
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,993
How's the boy?

437
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,257
He's a pistol of a kid.
He's gonna have a birthday

438
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,295
- Really? How old?
- 9

439
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:51,628
So, uh, any major armed robberies?

440
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,759
No. No, not this week

441
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,496
Speaking of armed robberies...

442
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,001
...you better watch out for Connie

443
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,099
She's gonna get you to
sign over your mortgage

444
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,835
What do you mean?

445
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,705
Did she try to hit
on you for some money?

446
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:04,542
No

447
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,846
I thought she talked
to you about this...

448
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,345
...uh, school auction... or whatever

449
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,649
Not me

450
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,250
But I've been out of town. Maybe
she talked to Maggie about it

451
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,723
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I got it wrong

452
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:20,090
Anyway, we owe you a dinner

453
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:23,195
Yeah

454
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,107
He's out

455
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,975
Mmm

456
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,737
Can I get
you anything?

457
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:41,812
No. No, I'm fine. Thanks

458
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:46,945
Tough day?

459
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,289
Mmm, not really

460
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:52,951
How about you?
How was your day?

461
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,825
It was good

462
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,391
You know, the usual stuff

463
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:07,239
Sure you don't want anything?

464
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,408
No

465
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:11,844
Con?

466
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:13,406
Yeah?

467
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,384
Do you love me?

468
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,487
Of course I love you

469
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,982
What a silly question

470
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:28,593
I guess... I'm just feeling silly

471
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,697
I'll be up in a minute

472
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:37,202
Ok

473
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,838
Sorry

474
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,364
What are we doing here?

475
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,804
Having lunch

476
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,206
I shouldn't be doing this

477
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,576
What, you shouldn't be having lunch?

478
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:58,472
Not with you

479
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,011
I think we should leave

480
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:08,255
Listen...

481
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,649
see those guys over
there paying the check?

482
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,661
- Yes
- Ok

483
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:19,028
If the guy on the right pays,
we'll leave right now

484
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,802
If the guy on the left pays, we stay

485
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,634
And... I kiss you

486
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:30,234
No. No

487
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,939
<i>No. No. No</i>

488
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,448
Ah. Ah...

489
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,814
Hey, you're kidding me, man

490
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:43,281
I win

491
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:48,120
No

492
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,658
- C'est la vie!
- No

493
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:53,098
Don't do it. Don't

494
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,506
Room for two?

495
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,100
Of course

496
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:48,977
Nice music

497
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:50,551
What is it?

498
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:54,121
It's, um...

499
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,914
African, I think

500
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,316
I like it

501
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:28,010
Here

502
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:03,424
Let's go to bed.
Come on

503
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,390
Stay here with me

504
00:46:05,494 --> 00:46:06,292
I'm cold

505
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:07,955
- Stay here
- I'm cold

506
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,829
Stay here with me

507
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:14,833
I'm cold

508
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,961
Come on, let's go

509
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:46,433
How about lunch today?

510
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:48,332
You free?

511
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:53,330
I have all this fund-raiser
stuff Auction things to pick up

512
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,065
We can do an early one, if you want

513
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:56,769
How about 12:00?

514
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:58,573
12:00?

515
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,942
Yeah

516
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:06,081
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

517
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:15,792
We could go in together

518
00:47:15,897 --> 00:47:17,791
I'll wait for you

519
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,830
I'm not gonna be ready
to go for at least an hour

520
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,802
That's all right. I'll wait

521
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,784
- Oh, shit
What?

522
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,618
I just remembered...

523
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:46,486
I have a facial at 12:30
at Georgiana's today

524
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:49,291
Oh, well...

525
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:53,395
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

526
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,830
Georgiana's, huh?

527
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,534
Waste of money

528
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,752
Yeah, Manhattan

529
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:27,355
Uh, beauty salon called, uh, Georgina

530
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:32,900
Uh, yeah, right. Yes. Yes.
Georgiana's. That's right

531
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:36,739
Thank you

532
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,613
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today, 12:30

533
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:52,948
Sumner. Connie Sumner.
S- u-m-n-e-r

534
00:48:57,128 --> 00:49:01,862
Could she... could she
be down for another time?

535
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,495
<i>No, thank you</i>

536
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,493
Connie!

537
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:35,324
Connie! Connie...

538
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,967
- Tracy! Hi!
- Hi

539
00:49:38,002 --> 00:49:39,462
I was gonna call you

540
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,162
That's what they all say when
I call about bunny costumes

541
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:44,532
You know Sally
from Planned Parenthood?

542
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,639
Hi. It's been a while

543
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:47,342
Well, too long. Too long

544
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:48,762
You look amazing

545
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:49,980
So where you headed?

546
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,011
Oh, I was just going to, um...

547
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:54,176
go look at some window
shades for the kitchen

548
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:55,912
Well, we're gonna go
and have coffee

549
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,718
Why don't you join us?

550
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:00,022
Oh, I'm gonna be late

551
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:02,151
For window shades?

552
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,106
Come on!

553
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:06,353
Ok. Ok

554
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,296
Hi, how are you?

555
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,710
I'm just going to make
a phone call

556
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,343
Sure

557
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:27,118
Mmm. She could have
used my cell phone

558
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,350
Hi, it's me

559
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:35,792
You're not gonna believe this...

560
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:37,989
I'm at the cafe
around the corner

561
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,520
Why do you have to introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

562
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,497
What do you mean?

563
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,798
Well, it makes it sound like I'm
in New York handing out condoms

564
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,605
I'm stuck here

565
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:51,834
Will you wait for me?

566
00:50:52,443 --> 00:50:53,740
Wait for me

567
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:57,246
...with the redhead.
Just can't take it

568
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:59,145
She has it the next
morning... all the time

569
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,512
Had to call Gloria, remind her...

570
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:03,086
to pick up the dry cleaning
when she gets Charlie

571
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,383
Never a dull moment

572
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,958
No. Charlie is so adorable

573
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,924
Thank you

574
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,312
I can't eat

575
00:51:30,848 --> 00:51:31,815
I'll have a coffee

576
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,511
Well, I guess I'll have coffee, too

577
00:51:35,653 --> 00:51:38,144
Excuse me again.
Ladies room

578
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:43,921
- God, she looks good
- Mm-hmm

579
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:45,486
Do you think she's had work?

580
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,330
Why would she have work?
She still looks gorgeous

581
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,427
That's when they're having it now

582
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,558
Early, before it all goes to shit

583
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:08,751
I have friends out there

584
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,285
You take me to the best places

585
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,186
Wait

586
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:22,361
Let me...

587
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,934
She's not like that.
She's really nice

588
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,573
Of course she is.
That makes it worse

589
00:52:31,676 --> 00:52:33,971
She is nice, and she's sweet...

590
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:35,945
and her ass is in exactly
the same place it was

591
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:37,812
when she was in college

592
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:45,989
Are you taking tennis?

593
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,985
Oh, I wouldn't call
what I do taking tennis

594
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:53,608
- Ok
- There you are

595
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:55,054
I was beginning to worry

596
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:57,066
No, it's fine. I'm fine

597
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:00,069
We thought you were
abducted by that heartthrob

598
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:02,798
What heartthrob?

599
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:04,670
You didn't see him at the counter?

600
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:05,799
He was gorgeous

601
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:09,140
I miss everything

602
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,704
Your button's undone

603
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:12,975
Oh, thank you

604
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:19,518
That's him

605
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,966
I guess I could see the appeal

606
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,061
Well, if he looked at me twice,
I would be on my back in a second

607
00:53:33,096 --> 00:53:33,836
Oh, you would not

608
00:53:33,938 --> 00:53:35,496
Oh, I would so. Why not?

609
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:38,495
Well, a couple of reasons.
Adam for one, your kids for another

610
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:41,303
Well, you know, Tracy, they
wouldn't have to know about it

611
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:43,976
It could be just something
that I did for myself

612
00:53:43,982 --> 00:53:47,247
You know, to... broaden my horizons

613
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,183
It'd be like taking a pottery class

614
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:52,381
Having an affair is nothing
like taking a pottery class

615
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,788
- Could be
- No. It would start out like that

616
00:53:54,826 --> 00:53:57,294
And then, um, something would happen

617
00:53:57,395 --> 00:54:00,429
Someone, uh, finds out,
or someone falls in love...

618
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:02,422
and it ends disastrously

619
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:06,429
They always end disastrously

620
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,708
Tracy!

621
00:54:18,115 --> 00:54:19,874
No

622
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:21,382
When?

623
00:54:22,285 --> 00:54:24,045
It was a long time ago

624
00:54:24,655 --> 00:54:28,580
And it's the one thing in my
life I would undo if I could

625
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,426
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

626
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:42,163
Mm-hmm, I did

627
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:46,298
You know, we could end this
now, and no one would get hurt

628
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,942
Yeah?

629
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:52,714
I think if we ended
this now... I'd get hurt

630
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:55,919
So, no matter what,
someone get's hurt?

631
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,551
Maybe not

632
00:54:58,055 --> 00:55:00,253
Maybe we'll get tired of each other

633
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:03,018
God, I hope I get tired of you

634
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:09,865
You're in my mind

635
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:15,433
You're the only thing in my
mind when I wake up every morning

636
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,831
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes

637
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:21,672
What do you think of?

638
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:23,406
It depends

639
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:26,015
If it's a day when I don't know
if I'm going to get to see you

640
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:32,152
I'm anxious... thinking of excuses
to come into the city and see you

641
00:55:36,227 --> 00:55:38,319
And the days you know we meet?

642
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:39,993
On those days...

643
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:42,897
I'm...

644
00:55:43,598 --> 00:55:44,968
calm...

645
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:47,430
and... hating myself

646
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,269
Oh, God

647
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,042
This is what we have over here

648
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:03,977
And... I'll have it ready
for you this afternoon

649
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,778
That happens all the time...

650
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:09,086
Ed, what's up? It sounded important

651
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:13,724
I've heard you're talking
with Dunbar and Brinks...

652
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:15,458
a few other companies

653
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:17,727
Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that?

654
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:22,501
Well, look, I mean, I
suppose they could be...

655
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,407
uh, wooing me,
if that's what you mean

656
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:27,676
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you these days

657
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,939
Now, who's wooing who?

658
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:32,507
Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
What are you talking about?

659
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:34,684
So I talked
to some people. So what?

660
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,949
This is about loyalty, Bill

661
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:39,054
I'm letting you go

662
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:42,013
You'll have my
recommendation, if you need it

663
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:46,856
I have a family, Ed

664
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:49,859
You had a family here

665
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:54,013
Wait. Wait a minute. You're
telling me... about family?

666
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:57,560
Well, you don't know the
first goddamn thing about it!

667
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,104
Why don't you take a look at
your own fucking family, Ed?

668
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:07,817
Take a goddamn look at that

669
00:57:26,437 --> 00:57:28,268
- Hi, Ed
- Frank

670
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:33,904
Thanks for coming
on such short notice

671
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:36,813
This is personal.
It's not business...

672
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,014
So you think about it

673
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:41,381
I don't know if you're gonna
want to get involved with this..

674
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:43,786
but I need someone I can trust

675
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:46,082
I want you to follow somebody

676
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:48,388
I...

677
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,621
I want you
to follow my wife

678
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:04,767
It's burning, Mom

679
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,875
What?

680
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,575
It's burning.
The chicken

681
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,175
Oh, shit!

682
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,274
Shit

683
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:24,521
It's boiling, Mom

684
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,089
It's boiling!

685
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,261
Thank you

686
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:33,496
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it. Watch it

687
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,883
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry

688
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:50,219
It's fine

689
00:58:55,459 --> 00:58:57,959
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow

690
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,195
For how long?

691
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:03,225
Not long. Probably
just a night

692
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,995
What time's your flight?

693
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:06,901
8:00

694
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:09,737
A. M.

695
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,009
Diane Dryer's son is
marrying Amy Lynne's daughter

696
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:18,273
I'm never getting married

697
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:19,677
Why not?

698
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:21,811
I hate giris

699
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:26,112
Well, you might change your mind

700
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:28,021
That happens sometimes

701
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,592
I won't

702
00:59:34,298 --> 00:59:35,197
What?

703
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:38,232
I fired Bill Stone today

704
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:40,731
So that's what's
bothering you

705
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:42,633
Nothing's bothering me

706
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,631
Why did you fire him?

707
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:47,975
He's not accountable

708
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,547
What's accountable?

709
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:52,946
Is it, like, people who eat people?

710
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:56,383
No, no... that's a cannibal

711
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:01,713
Anyway, I can't
trust him anymore

712
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:04,961
So if you run into
Dolly, you'll know

713
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,669
<i>Well, how are you gonna clean up the
area so pedestrians can get through?</i>

714
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:42,686
<i>What?!</i>

715
01:01:43,093 --> 01:01:44,488
<i>I can't believe you!</i>

716
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,727
<i>What are you doing?</i>

717
01:02:13,323 --> 01:02:14,586
Shit!

718
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:15,587
Charlie...!

719
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:18,188
Shit!

720
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:34,500
Come on!

721
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:58,597
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry

722
01:02:58,702 --> 01:02:59,999
I', sorry

723
01:03:00,104 --> 01:03:01,696
Honey, are you ok?

724
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:03,734
You must have been so worried, huh?

725
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,022
- Stop, Mom
- What?

726
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,804
- People can we see
- Ok

727
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,534
<i>Hi, this is Paul Martel</i>

728
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:33,432
<i>Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks</i>

729
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:34,629
Mom?

730
01:03:34,738 --> 01:03:36,538
Honey...

731
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:39,106
You're supposed to be in bed

732
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:41,439
You're crying, Mom

733
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:43,243
Oh, honey...

734
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:46,439
mommy's just a little sad,
that's all

735
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,778
Come on, I'll take you to bed

736
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:51,078
Let's get you into bed

737
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:52,553
Don't be sad, Mom

738
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:54,817
Dad will be home tomorrow

739
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,135
His name is Paul Martel

740
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:14,634
He lives at 433 Mercer Street,
apartment 3

741
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:17,669
She sees him during the day

742
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:21,074
Usually goes around lunchtime

743
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:24,416
Stays about 2 hours,maybe 3

744
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:40,201
They go to the movies?

745
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:43,536
They did that day. Otherwise,
they're in his apartment

746
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,942
Pick up!

747
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:23,136
Hey. Hey, lady!

748
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,599
Forgot your keys

749
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,017
Wait!

750
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,744
Who is she?! Who is she?!

751
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:12,722
No!

752
01:07:12,823 --> 01:07:13,721
Calm down!

753
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:16,290
Why are you doing this?

754
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:21,958
How many are there?
5? 10?

755
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:25,528
God, what am I?

756
01:07:25,636 --> 01:07:27,834
The Monday one. What,
did I get my day wrong?

757
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,064
She's just a friend, ok?

758
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:31,664
Just a friend

759
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,673
You're a fuckin' liar

760
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:37,172
Me? I'm the liar?

761
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:39,078
I can't do this anymore

762
01:07:42,352 --> 01:07:44,452
Fine. Go back to
your suburban carpool

763
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:45,685
Your tennis dress on your...

764
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:47,780
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

765
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:49,753
Fuck you!

766
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,588
That'll make you happy

767
01:07:51,595 --> 01:07:53,060
Fuck you!

768
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:00,869
No

769
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:02,632
No, I can't

770
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:04,707
Paul, it's over

771
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:08,444
I can't!

772
01:08:15,118 --> 01:08:17,213
I hate you. I hate you

773
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:17,818
I know

774
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:19,952
Stop it. I can't

775
01:08:40,544 --> 01:08:42,043
You gonna fuck me?

776
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:43,103
- Huh?
- You want it?

777
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:44,339
Yeah, I want you to

778
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:45,380
Say it

779
01:08:45,482 --> 01:08:46,881
- I want you to fuck me
- Say it

780
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,815
I want you to fuck me

781
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:42,764
Oh, thank you

782
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:44,197
Thank you very much

783
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,599
Thank you very much, indeed

784
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:09,186
Yes?

785
01:11:11,394 --> 01:11:12,493
You're Paul Martel?

786
01:11:12,528 --> 01:11:13,791
Yes

787
01:11:14,798 --> 01:11:16,222
How old are you?

788
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:20,500
Who are you?

789
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:23,128
Edward Sumner

790
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:27,072
Connie's husband

791
01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:35,710
May I...

792
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,443
may I come in?

793
01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:41,619
Yeah. Sure

794
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:11,947
Would you like a drink?

795
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:13,923
Yeah. Why not?

796
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:28,501
I have scotch,
vodka... prune juice

797
01:12:28,736 --> 01:12:30,599
Uh... vodka

798
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,602
Is it cold?

799
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:36,003
Yeah

800
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:39,641
I keep it in the freezer

801
01:12:39,749 --> 01:12:42,748
So do I. At home

802
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:02,799
So tell me, how did you...

803
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:04,498
...meet my wife?

804
01:13:06,109 --> 01:13:07,973
By accident

805
01:13:08,378 --> 01:13:10,103
On the street

806
01:13:10,514 --> 01:13:13,043
There was a wind storm,
she hooked her knee...

807
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:15,183
Oh... you're him

808
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:17,945
She told you about that?

809
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:19,082
Yes

810
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:26,259
How's it going?

811
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:29,890
Fine

812
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,300
Fine. I mean, ok

813
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:34,962
This is... this is where you meet?

814
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:36,363
Yes

815
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:38,832
She likes it?

816
01:13:38,842 --> 01:13:41,203
Well, I guess.
She never complained

817
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:48,473
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out, too?

818
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,784
It depends. Sometimes,
yes, we go out

819
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,389
She likes that?

820
01:13:54,424 --> 01:13:55,757
She...

821
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:58,584
...likes this neighborhood?

822
01:13:58,619 --> 01:13:59,923
Oh, yeah

823
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:02,429
More exciting than
the suburbs, I guess

824
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,599
Do you know that we have
been married 11 years?

825
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:13,241
We have a son

826
01:14:14,978 --> 01:14:16,905
Yeah, she told me

827
01:14:19,816 --> 01:14:21,076
More?

828
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:23,579
Yes, please

829
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,362
He's the reason
that we left the city

830
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:43,068
Connie thought it
would be better for him

831
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,198
Oh. She told me it was your idea

832
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:51,241
You... talk about me?

833
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:12,129
Lot of books...

834
01:15:12,435 --> 01:15:15,364
Yeah. Lot of buying and selling

835
01:15:55,712 --> 01:15:57,743
Didn't know it did that

836
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:05,416
Where did you get this?

837
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:06,918
It was a gift

838
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:08,915
From her

839
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:24,102
Why would she do that?

840
01:16:24,137 --> 01:16:25,771
I don't know...

841
01:16:26,676 --> 01:16:30,377
Maybe... maybe she just
wanted to buy me something

842
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:37,779
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her

843
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:47,184
I gave it to her...

844
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:48,793
What?

845
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:51,895
I gave it to her

846
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:54,561
I gave... I'm s...

847
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,742
I'm feeling sick. I can't...

848
01:17:00,844 --> 01:17:02,541
You want some water?

849
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:07,073
I'm feeling sick.
I'm...

850
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:09,146
I don't...

851
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,522
I'm... I'm not well

852
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:17,551
I'm not feeling well

853
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,531
I'm not...

854
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,692
I'm not feeling...

855
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:26,427

It's all right, Jerry. It's ok

913

You'd better check to
see if this is gonna open

No, no, this is... this is fine

915

It's nothing. It's fine

Yeah. Yes, he did. Yes, he did

Can we call
the cops, Dad?

919
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:54,821

wanna check the trunk?

What?

926
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:16,815
His shoes!

927
01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,393
They're different colors

928
01:32:26,902 --> 01:32:28,560
Honey, you look awful

929
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,802
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?

930
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:33,165
I got up and looked for you

931
01:32:33,175 --> 01:32:35,303
Oh, I just, um...

932
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:38,574
got some air

933
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,344
Are you ok?

934
01:32:41,549 --> 01:32:43,183
Yeah

935
01:32:54,897 --> 01:32:57,188
Do you like it here, Connie?

936
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,596
What?

937
01:32:59,597 --> 01:33:00,868
Of course I like it here

938
01:33:00,903 --> 01:33:02,134
'Cause we don't have to stay here

939
01:33:02,137 --> 01:33:04,632
We can... we can
move back to the city

940
01:33:06,141 --> 01:33:09,201
Honey, what has gotten into you?

941
01:33:11,246 --> 01:33:12,844
Are you ok?

942
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:16,114
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine

943
01:33:18,787 --> 01:33:20,245
Are you ok?

944
01:33:20,355 --> 01:33:22,549
I'm fine

945
01:33:23,058 --> 01:33:26,789
Everybody's fine, and
we're not moving anywhere

946
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:11,098
The cops are here, Mom

947
01:34:12,674 --> 01:34:14,141
What do they want?

948
01:34:14,143 --> 01:34:16,108
I'm sure it's nothing

949
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:25,118
N.Y.P.D., Mom

950
01:34:26,889 --> 01:34:27,787
Hello

951
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:29,050
- Mrs. Sumner
- Yes

952
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:30,520
Yeah, I'm detective Dean

953
01:34:30,526 --> 01:34:32,016
This is detective Mirojnick...

954
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:33,592
...New York City
Police Department

955
01:34:33,595 --> 01:34:34,887
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?

956
01:34:34,897 --> 01:34:36,225
Oh, no, no. No. Uh...

957
01:34:36,231 --> 01:34:38,429
do you know a Paul Martel?

958
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:42,868
Yes, um... not very well. Why?

959
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:44,529
Do you know where he is?

960
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:47,843
No. Um...

961
01:34:50,245 --> 01:34:52,444
At home, I would imagine

962
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:54,210
Do you know
where he lives?

963
01:34:54,515 --> 01:34:56,710
Soho, isn't it?

964
01:34:57,619 --> 01:35:00,788
Your name and number
were found on his desk

965
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,315
Has he done
something wrong?

966
01:35:04,326 --> 01:35:07,658
Well, we don't know. He's been
reported missing by his family

967
01:35:07,896 --> 01:35:09,595
His wife doesn't know where he is

968
01:35:13,469 --> 01:35:15,302
I didn't know
he was married

969
01:35:16,471 --> 01:35:17,968
Separated

970
01:35:22,678 --> 01:35:24,338
When did you see him last?

971
01:35:26,546 --> 01:35:29,183
I don't know... It's hard to say

972
01:35:29,584 --> 01:35:30,781
Um...

973
01:35:31,386 --> 01:35:33,150
he's a book dealer. I...

974
01:35:33,255 --> 01:35:36,413
I barely know him at all. I was
going to buy some books from him

975
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:37,385
And did you?

976
01:35:37,493 --> 01:35:39,989
No, not yet

977
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:45,924
Has something happened to him?
I mean, do you think he's all right?

978
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:47,934
It's hard to say at this point

979
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:50,431
We're workin' on it

980
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:54,638
Anyway, thanks, uh...
thanks for your time

981
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:56,235
Thank you

982
01:35:56,345 --> 01:35:59,211
I like these snow glass things

983
01:35:59,214 --> 01:36:00,475
My boy has some of these

984
01:36:00,582 --> 01:36:02,782
If you hear from Mr. Martel,
let us know

985
01:36:02,784 --> 01:36:04,142
Certainly

986
01:36:31,946 --> 01:36:34,615
Dad! The cops came
to our house today

987
01:36:36,718 --> 01:36:38,981
Cops? What did they want?

988
01:36:43,325 --> 01:36:47,391
Someone's missing... and they
have to check everyone, you know

989
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:53,333
Who was it?

990
01:36:54,335 --> 01:36:56,096
Honey, sit up straight

991
01:36:59,307 --> 01:37:00,369
Who was it?

992
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:01,472
I don't think
you know him

993
01:37:01,577 --> 01:37:04,171
He's, uh... he sells books

994
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,946
I forget where I met him

995
01:37:08,049 --> 01:37:09,980
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

996
01:37:12,453 --> 01:37:15,611
So what did they, uh... why
did they wanna talk to you?

997
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:19,350
I guess... he had my name and number

998
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:22,957
Why... why would
he have your number?

999
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:26,627
I think I bought a book from him

1000
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,511
Be careful. Be careful

1001
01:37:40,515 --> 01:37:41,613
Hey, Charlie

1002
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:43,579
Hi, darlin'

1003
01:37:43,685 --> 01:37:45,848
Oh, I wish you lived closer

1004
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:54,215
<i>Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to thy service...</i>

1005
01:37:54,663 --> 01:37:58,690
<i>and help us to be ever
mindful of the needs of others</i>

1006
01:37:58,725 --> 01:37:59,198
Amen

1007
01:37:59,301 --> 01:38:01,667
Amen

1008
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,863
<i>Edward!</i>

1009
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:15,245
<i>All right!</i>

1010
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:26,282
I have a... I have a story
you don't know about Edward

1011
01:38:26,395 --> 01:38:27,885
<i>He was at the club...</i>

1012
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:17,575
Hello, Mrs. Sumner

1013
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,211
Sorry to bother you on the weekend

1014
01:39:20,315 --> 01:39:22,204
- I'm, uh... detective Dean
- Oh

1015
01:39:22,284 --> 01:39:24,074
This is detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

1016
01:39:24,085 --> 01:39:24,783
Ok

1017
01:39:24,886 --> 01:39:27,475
We were hoping to talk
to you for a few minutes

1018
01:39:27,656 --> 01:39:29,786
Uh, sure

1019
01:39:29,891 --> 01:39:32,050
Charlie, we're gonna go up
on the porch for a minute

1020
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,958
Can I come?

1021
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,019
No, sweetheart.
You stay out here

1022
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:37,064
Play with Poppy.
We'll be right back

1023
01:39:38,467 --> 01:39:39,929
I don't know if
your wife mentioned

1024
01:39:39,935 --> 01:39:42,064
we was here about a
week and a half ago...

1025
01:39:42,165 --> 01:39:43,694
about Paul Martel

1026
01:39:43,805 --> 01:39:46,105
Yeah, that was the...
the man who was missing

1027
01:39:46,107 --> 01:39:48,341
Well, he's not missing anymore

1028
01:39:48,476 --> 01:39:51,235
His body was discovered last weekend

1029
01:39:52,145 --> 01:39:54,640
God, that's... that's terrible

1030
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:58,185
Oh, my God

1031
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:02,587
Do you recall where you met
Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

1032
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:06,250
- I told you
- Uh, no, ma'am, you didn't

1033
01:40:06,394 --> 01:40:08,309
I'm sorry, um...

1034
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:10,624
I can't remember

1035
01:40:11,133 --> 01:40:13,081
A fund-raiser, I think

1036
01:40:13,116 --> 01:40:14,729
Can you be more specific?

1037
01:40:15,036 --> 01:40:16,703
Juilliard

1038
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,068
Juilliard

1039
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:21,742
The music school

1040
01:40:22,477 --> 01:40:24,507
Yes, I know what Juilliard is

1041
01:40:24,512 --> 01:40:26,642
Oh, of course you do.
I'm sorry

1042
01:40:26,648 --> 01:40:28,679
Were you there, too, sir?

1043
01:40:30,285 --> 01:40:32,648
Yes, yes... I think I was

1044
01:40:33,054 --> 01:40:35,681
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel

1045
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:39,527
No, no, not that I remember

1046
01:40:39,562 --> 01:40:41,158
Maybe you'd recognize him

1047
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:45,197
No, no. I never met him before

1048
01:40:45,232 --> 01:40:47,764
- Is that him?
- Yes, yes

1049
01:40:48,736 --> 01:40:50,770
You ever been
to his apartment?

1050
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:52,965
No

1051
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:55,074
No, I... I... I hardly knew him

1052
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:57,407
I didn't even know why
he had my phone number

1053
01:40:57,412 --> 01:40:58,772
Maybe he liked you

1054
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,648
Look, I think that's enough

1055
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:06,167
So you've never been
to his apartment

1056
01:41:06,202 --> 01:41:09,483
Well, how 'bout, the neighborhood.
Did you hang out down there?

1057
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:12,257
- No
- No, not often...

1058
01:41:12,258 --> 01:41:15,088
- ...or no, never
- Never

1059
01:41:15,163 --> 01:41:17,561
I can't remember the
last time I was in Soho

1060
01:41:17,565 --> 01:41:19,758
It was 4 weeks ago, actually

1061
01:41:22,203 --> 01:41:24,968
You got a parking ticket right
in front of Martel's apartment...

1062
01:41:24,971 --> 01:41:26,298
...4 weeks ago

1063
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:28,507
Oh, that. Right

1064
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:32,073
I... had coffee with
friends at a little place

1065
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,079
I forgot

1066
01:41:33,114 --> 01:41:36,446
- It was Tracy and Sally
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah

1067
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:49,789
Look...

1068
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:55,293
my wife has told you everything
she knows. So have I. So...

1069
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:58,768
...if you don't mind, we'd
like to get back to our son

1070
01:41:58,803 --> 01:42:01,001
All right. Uh...

1071
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:03,474
why don't I give you my card...

1072
01:42:03,509 --> 01:42:05,042
I have your card

1073
01:42:06,447 --> 01:42:07,610
Right

1074
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:11,314
- Enjoy your weekend
- You, too

1075
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:08,966
Sumner, please

1076
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:49,674
Oh, my God

1077
01:43:51,319 --> 01:43:53,212
Hi, Connie

1078
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:55,785
Hi, Tracy

1079
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:59,155
I'm just picking up my
silk suit for tonight

1080
01:44:01,129 --> 01:44:03,522
I was thinking of wearing the black

1081
01:44:15,877 --> 01:44:17,606
I'm gonna give up the good row

1082
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:20,538
Let someone else be
gorgeous for a change

1083
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:28,017
So what should we bring aside
from our sparkling personalities?

1084
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,819
How we doing?

1085
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:35,452
Fine

1086
01:44:35,563 --> 01:44:36,652
You need help?

1087
01:44:36,664 --> 01:44:38,056
No

1088
01:44:40,235 --> 01:44:44,430
The white is not cold, so I'm
gonna put it in the freezer

1089
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:48,404
Just remind me it's
in there, all right?

1090
01:44:50,745 --> 01:44:52,736
Most people drink red anyway

1091
01:44:57,818 --> 01:44:59,186
Oh, I love these things

1092
01:44:59,287 --> 01:45:01,182
Is there anyplace
you guys haven't been?

1093
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:04,922
Mmm, the Rosenthals
got 795 for their place

1094
01:45:05,026 --> 01:45:06,525
In 2 days, they had 6 offers

1095
01:45:06,528 --> 01:45:08,461
Sealed bids. That's
what everyone's doing now

1096
01:45:08,496 --> 01:45:10,395
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

1097
01:45:10,898 --> 01:45:12,892
Oh, I don't know

1098
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:15,198
You sell your house,
where do you go?

1099
01:45:15,233 --> 01:45:16,966
At those prices, Tahiti

1100
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:18,295
Bangkok

1101
01:45:18,406 --> 01:45:20,767
Connie, where's
this one from?

1102
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,046
Fiji

1103
01:45:33,655 --> 01:45:36,186
<i>Oh, remember, Jeff, I asked
you to take me to Fiji?</i>

1104
01:45:36,191 --> 01:45:36,989
<i>Mmm</i>

1105
01:45:37,092 --> 01:45:38,389
<i>And then you took me to Hawaii?</i>

1106
01:45:38,493 --> 01:45:40,461
<i>We went fishing every single day...</i>

1107
01:46:04,486 --> 01:46:06,249
What happened, Edward?

1108
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:11,157
What did you do?

1109
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:14,184
Did you hurt him?

1110
01:46:15,595 --> 01:46:17,156
Huh?

1111
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:20,096
Edward?

1112
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:23,099
Did you hurt him?

1113
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:27,365
You did, didn't you?

1114
01:46:28,275 --> 01:46:31,842
Oh, Jesus, Edward

1115
01:46:33,547 --> 01:46:35,414
Talk to me

1116
01:46:35,817 --> 01:46:38,217
Tell me what you did

1117
01:46:38,252 --> 01:46:41,812
No, you tell me what you did

1118
01:46:42,323 --> 01:46:45,317
How you fucked him over
and over and over...

1119
01:46:45,426 --> 01:46:47,155
You lied to me...

1120
01:46:47,262 --> 01:46:49,996
over and over and over...

1121
01:46:49,997 --> 01:46:51,291
Edward, please...

1122
01:46:51,299 --> 01:46:53,624
No, you don't talk to me now

1123
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,965
I gave everything...

1124
01:46:56,771 --> 01:46:59,169
...for this family

1125
01:46:59,474 --> 01:47:00,934
Everything...

1126
01:47:02,142 --> 01:47:05,011
Snd what did you do?

1127
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:07,647
You threw it all away...

1128
01:47:07,749 --> 01:47:09,580
...like it was nothing

1129
01:47:09,584 --> 01:47:11,580
For what?

1130
01:47:11,986 --> 01:47:14,117
To a fucking kid!

1131
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:24,755
You didn't think I'd know?

1132
01:47:25,066 --> 01:47:26,566
I wouldn't feel it?

1133
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:28,892
I knew it from
the very first day

1134
01:47:31,172 --> 01:47:33,072
Because I know you, Connie

1135
01:47:33,107 --> 01:47:35,767
I know you, and I fuckin' hate you!

1136
01:47:35,777 --> 01:47:38,935
I didn't want to kill him.
I wanted to kill you!

1137
01:47:41,516 --> 01:47:44,177
Oh, my God

1138
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,685
Edward... Oh, my God

1139
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:10,139
Dear God

1140
01:48:51,486 --> 01:48:55,117
Mom, look what I did

1141
01:48:57,294 --> 01:48:59,685
Honey... that's ok

1142
01:49:00,686 --> 01:49:01,786
That's ok

1143
01:49:02,196 --> 01:49:03,879
I'm sorry, Mom

1144
01:49:03,914 --> 01:49:05,562
It's an accident

1145
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:07,800
Everybody has accidents

1146
01:49:07,835 --> 01:49:10,396
Why aren't you
in bed, Mom?

1147
01:49:13,274 --> 01:49:14,802
I don't know

1148
01:49:18,546 --> 01:49:20,377
Charlie, look at me

1149
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:22,744
I want you to know...

1150
01:49:23,045 --> 01:49:27,008
that I love you... more
than anything in the worid

1151
01:49:29,557 --> 01:49:32,824
And I want you to know
that your daddy and me both...

1152
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,656
will always, always love you

1153
01:49:35,763 --> 01:49:38,561
No matter what, hmm?

1154
01:49:41,268 --> 01:49:43,734
- Ok?
- Ok

1155
01:49:44,539 --> 01:49:45,937
Come on, sweetie

1156
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:50,365
Let's go fix up your bed
all nice and fresh, ok?

1157
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:52,908
All right

1158
01:51:30,709 --> 01:51:33,009
<b>>If you find this DO NOT OPEN

1159
01:51:45,811 --> 01:51:49,611
<b>to my beautiful wife
the best part of every day</b>

1160
01:53:04,505 --> 01:53:06,769
<i>"You can come on up
and clean it off, no?"</i>

1161
01:53:06,874 --> 01:53:11,175
<i>"Come on! I'm not an
ax murderer. I promise"</i>

1162
01:53:45,877 --> 01:53:47,139
<i>"Thank you"</i>

1163
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:16,373
What are we gonna do?

1164
01:54:19,547 --> 01:54:21,614
I'm so scared

1165
01:54:23,817 --> 01:54:25,917
I'll turn myself in

1166
01:54:26,219 --> 01:54:27,578
No

1167
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,981
No

1168
01:54:41,168 --> 01:54:43,766
No, we can get through this

1169
01:54:45,272 --> 01:54:48,240
We'll take it one day at a time

1170
01:54:49,744 --> 01:54:51,880
No one will know

1171
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:55,580
We'll know

1172
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:07,452
31, 3.500, 3.800, 4.000...

1173
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:09,654
42, 45, 4.800...

1174
01:56:36,684 --> 01:56:38,818
We could disappear

1175
01:56:41,021 --> 01:56:43,613
We could raise some
money, sell everything...

1176
01:56:43,724 --> 01:56:46,022
and just leave the country

1177
01:56:47,227 --> 01:56:49,062
<i>"Señorita"</i>

1178
01:56:50,163 --> 01:56:52,155
Mexico

1179
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:55,329
Why not?

1180
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:59,335
We could get a little
house on the beach...

1181
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,037
Take a different name...

1182
01:57:03,244 --> 01:57:05,609
People do it all the time

1183
01:57:06,312 --> 01:57:08,281
What do we tell Charlie?

1184
01:57:10,083 --> 01:57:13,085
Tell him it's an adventure

1185
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:18,180
We could fish all day

1186
01:57:21,762 --> 01:57:24,788
We could learn to play the guitar...

1187
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:30,865
And I would serenade
you to sleep every night

1188
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:34,706
We'd just live the rest of
our lives on that beach...

1189
01:57:35,609 --> 01:57:39,568
...and then when we die, we
could just push out to sea

1190
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,504
What do you think?

1191
01:57:43,684 --> 01:57:45,549
It sounds perfect

1192
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:23,150
POLICE

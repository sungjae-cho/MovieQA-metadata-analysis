00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:51,554
It's every
orphan's fantasy.

521
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,023
My real mom and dad
were rich...

522
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,945
and beautiful.

523
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,673
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

524
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:01,552
and I got switched
with another baby.

525
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:04,148
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

526
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,190
and there they'll be...

527
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:10,665
with open arms, crying,
''My darling.

528
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,871
''My treasure.
We didn't know.

529
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,070
How can we make
it up to you ?''

530
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,622
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

531
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:20,591
It's a crock.

532
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:26,225
I liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

533
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,866
Here it is.
Read it and weep.

534
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:34,264
''Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

535
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:37,187
- ''for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
- Denied, yeah.

536
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:41,347
''According to our files,
his mother did not die...

537
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:43,231
- ''during birth.
- She's not dead.

538
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:45,623
''We have a current
address for her at...

539
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,705
''172 Canyon Glen Drive,
Los Angeles.

540
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:50,513
''Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment...

541
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:53,347
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.''

542
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:56,790
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

543
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:02,864
This letter was written
30 years ago.

544
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,263
We were five years old.

545
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:07,345
Our mother didn't die
when we were born !

546
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,868
You knew all this time
where she was...

547
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:12,024
and you never
contacted her ?

548
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:16,426
I don't know about your mother,
''Miss Perfect, 1952''...

549
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:19,631
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive...

550
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:21,625
I hope she's
in a lot of pain.

551
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,545
She dumped me once.

552
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:26,068
There is no way I'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

553
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:28,952
If they have lied to us about Mama
for all these years...

554
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:32,071
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

555
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,748
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

556
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,790
- I got a cash-flow problem.
- [ Phone Ring ]

557
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:40,423
- Hello.
- Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

558
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:42,823
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

559
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,109
Or else what, you blimp ?

560
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,190
Oh, we're rollin'.

561
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:01,027
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

562
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,945
- Mr Garfield, there's a man--
- Not now.

563
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:12,825
- Who are you ?
- I'm Webster.

564
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:17,832
- It's okay !
- Christ ! You were never
supposed to come here.

565
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,950
We were never
supposed to meet.

566
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:23,185
- You're supposed to be--
- Driving that car down to Texas.

567
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:26,584
I got my driving gloves.
I got my driving glasses.

568
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:28,505
I got my driving hat.

569
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:30,983
But I got no car.

570
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:33,793
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

571
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:35,910
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

572
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,633
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

573
00:38:38,714 --> 00:38:42,263
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

574
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,753
Sit down.

575
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:48,467
I got a reputation
to uphold.

576
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:51,068
People put their trust in me.

577
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,065
They know I always
deliver the goods...

578
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:55,429
and I always come
back with the money.

579
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:58,108
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

580
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,504
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

581
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:04,108
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

582
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:06,503
- The parking attendant ?
- He liked the car.

583
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,983
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

584
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:12,464
You know,
I just realized that...

585
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:15,387
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

586
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:17,271
has ever seen my face.

587
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:20,027
I don't think that's
a problem. Hey !

588
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:23,468
No, please, please !

589
00:39:42,154 --> 00:39:44,907
- Hi.
- Hi.

590
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:49,465
- Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here ?
- Grandpa...

591
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,784
this man wants
to talk to you.

592
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:54,832
Thank you.

593
00:39:57,554 --> 00:39:59,431
Hello ?

594
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,391
Yes, can I help you ?

595
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:03,465
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

596
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:05,385
I know this may
sound strange...

597
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:08,671
but I'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

598
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,587
Mary Ann Benedict.

599
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,069
She was my mother.

600
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:25,069
You're Mary Ann's son ?

601
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:29,784
That looks just
like you, Grandpa.

602
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:31,990
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

603
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:34,907
and help Grandma
with lunch, okay ?

604
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,625
Dad ?

605
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:51,512
Uh... no !

606
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:55,587
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad !

607
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,665
Dad !

608
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,984
- Wait a minute !
- Dad ! It is you !

609
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:02,110
This is a big surprise.

610
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:04,344
Dad, this is incredible.
I don't know what to--

611
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,743
We could use a drink.
Where'd you come from ?

612
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,632
One of my fathers ! You don't know
what this means to me.

613
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:29,709
[ Garfield On Tape ] Uh, Mr Webster,
I hope you are happy with the vehicle...

we chose for
your little journey.

615
00:41:33,234 --> 00:41:37,147
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

616
00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:40,670
and ask for uh, uh,
Beetroot Mckinley.

617
00:41:40,754 --> 00:41:44,542
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

618
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,511
Thank you.

619
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:49,552
Mary Ann Benedict.

620
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:54,025
I haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

621
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:56,628
Your mother was...

622
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,944
an amazing woman.

623
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:03,391
Oh, the times I've wondered what would
have happened if I'd have married her.

624
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,669
Why didn't you ?

625
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:09,303
Oh, I asked her to.
She turned me down.

626
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:12,909
She said she was afraid...

627
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:15,428
to have any more children.

628
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:18,392
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

629
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:20,988
Who told her we died ?

630
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:27,790
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

631
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:30,752
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

632
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:35,032
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

633
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,309
I'll have to pay
him a visit.

634
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,544
Watch out for him.

635
00:42:39,634 --> 00:42:43,183
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what I mean.

636
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:46,789
Dickhead ?

637
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:49,308
No, I don't.

638
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:52,466
But... I'm learning.

00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,113
- I'm concerned about the time frame.

645
00:43:21,514 --> 00:43:24,950
Some merchandise
that you might want.

646

Well, bring it to me, son.

647
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:29,625
Let me enrich you.

00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,184
it's the amount
of enrichment...

650
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:36,344
that I wanted
to talk about.

651
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,790
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

652
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,342
Now look, Beetroot...

653
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,506
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

any damn Cadillac...

that I have...

Twenty ! You little

You're out of your
goddam, greedy mind !

00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:08,225
- I guess that seems
a little high for you.
- Yeah !

661
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:13,542
I'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen ?

662
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:17,946
- The deal is five !
- Five ?

663
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:20,104
I could do better
than five here.

664
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:25,748
If you can do better
than five million dollars...

665
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:29,144
well, then, son,
you take it.

666
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:46,110
Beetroot,
I'll see you in Houston.

667
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:48,264
After all, fair is fair.

668
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:52,029
I'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

Well, good.

Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

680
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:37,468
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- I met one of our fathers.

681
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:39,624
He told me about
a man in New Mexico...

00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:42,990
- who probably knows where Mom is.
- Oh, great ! Yes !

00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,429
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No ?

684
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:47,982
You know what I mean ?
She didn't abandon you.

685
00:45:48,074 --> 00:45:49,985
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh !

686
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:53,271
- They told her that I died.
- No kidding ?

Look, Julius,
i'm in a hurry.

00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:59,265
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car ?
- Yeah.

00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:02,391
You remember Sammy ? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

690
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:05,705
- So I'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston ?

691
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:06,863
Hous--

692
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:09,627
- Hou-- No !
- You know something ?

693
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:12,592
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

694
00:46:12,674 --> 00:46:16,667
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

695
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:19,507
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

696
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:22,472
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

697
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:25,466
We have to see this man, Traven,
in New Mexico.

698
00:46:25,554 --> 00:46:28,387
- No, we don't have to see
this man in New Mexico.
- Yes, we do !

699
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:32,103
And I'm coming with you.

700
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:38,945
We'll go see the man.

701
00:46:39,034 --> 00:46:42,106
- I take a shower. I get my bags.
- Get your bags.

702
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:44,424
Be right out. Oh, boy !

703
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:47,551
I'll be here, bro.
Okay.

704
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:57,144
This place is a zoo !

705
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:00,385
Wait, wait.

706
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,708
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

707
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:08,503
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- God.

708
00:47:08,594 --> 00:47:12,348
- It's not my birthday.
Better late than never.
- Oh.

709
00:47:12,434 --> 00:47:15,392
Look what Marnie
made for Julius.

710
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:18,193
- You baked ?
- Yeah. Is Julius around ?

711
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:22,904
- He's taking a shower.
- I'll go give these to him.

712
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:24,347
So-o-o !

713
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:27,824
- Where'd you get this car ?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

714
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:31,907
- Where you going ?
- Inside. Have some coffee ?

715
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:35,873
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say goodbye.

716
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,387
Marnie !

717
00:47:51,754 --> 00:47:55,383
Excuse me, but I was
just taking a shower.

718
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:57,305
Good singing.

719
00:47:57,394 --> 00:47:59,669
I baked you some cookies.

720
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:02,587
- Cookies ?
- I guess it was a dumb idea.

721
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:06,792
No, not at all. I'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

722
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:13,347
- I should put on some clothes.
- I'm sorry, I'll turn around.

723
00:48:13,434 --> 00:48:16,585
Linda and I just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

724
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:19,393
- for his birthday.
- I had birthday, too.

725
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:21,465
Oh, that's right.

726
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:24,512
You're twins.

727
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:31,030
Huh ?

728
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:32,991
Whoa.

729
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:36,510
What is it ?

730
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:39,427
I don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

731
00:48:39,514 --> 00:48:41,948
- A fortune ? That's great !
- Yeah !

732
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:43,865
Excuse me !

733
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:46,912
Excuse me.

734
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:49,269
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money...

735
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:53,313
never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

736
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:57,307
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince ?

737
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:00,511
I cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

738
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:03,791
Vincent,
I'm comin' with you.

739
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,024
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

740
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:08,184
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not coming.

741
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:11,505
You could get killed and die and
I wouldn't know what happened.

742
00:49:11,594 --> 00:49:13,824
- No !
- You say ''no'' one more time...

743
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:17,509
-I'm gonna tell everybody that there's--
-Shut up ! Shut up !

744
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:23,828
All right. Oh, God.

745
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:25,950
All right, you're coming.

746
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:30,073
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

747
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:32,509
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

748
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,744
Iike in ''Roots'' or something.
All right ?

749
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,870
- Does this one look okay ?
- It looks fine.

750
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:40,310
It's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

751
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,750
- Marnie, guess what ?
- Linda, what ?

752
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:46,712
Vince just asked us to go to New Mexico
and Texas with him.

753
00:49:46,794 --> 00:49:49,024
This is a great idea.

754
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:52,629
- Vincent, is this true ?
We all go together ?
- Yeah.

755
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:55,911
I thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

756
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,825
and spent a few days
on the road together.

757
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,950
Nice shirt.

758
00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:04,983
- Feels great. It's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

759
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:08,828
It's okay. Come out.

760
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:11,553
All right. Here, Linda.

761
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,910
Oh, can I ride
in front with Vincent ?

762
00:50:14,994 --> 00:50:16,950
- Sure.
- Thanks.

763
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:34,225
[ Webster ]
Now, let me see.

764
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:36,669
I'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

765
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:38,790
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

766
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:41,468
Have a nice day.

767
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:48,507
Now, where do I find
this very special person...

768
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:52,109
Mr Vince Benedict ?

769
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:22,392
Well, what have we here ?

770
00:51:22,474 --> 00:51:25,113
What a cute little kitty.

771
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:27,230
Where's Daddy ?

772
00:51:36,274 --> 00:51:40,665
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

773
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:42,710
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

774
00:51:42,794 --> 00:51:45,228
Come on, we just
wanna talk to you.

775
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,192
Howdy !

776
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:53,144
Who are you ?

777
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:55,065
It's not really
important, is it ?

778
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,065
I was just feeding the cat,
then I was gonna leave.

779
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:58,906
I asked you a question.

780
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:02,111
- Well, who are you ?
- We're the klane brothers.

781
00:52:02,194 --> 00:52:04,185
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and I'm Bob.

782
00:52:04,274 --> 00:52:08,631
- Interesting gene pool.
- Don't cast dispersions.

783
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,547
I beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

784
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:13,704
- Right.
- Am I Vince Benedict ?

785
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:17,150
So what difference
does it make who I am ?

786
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,192
- Hit him, Bobby.
- Yeah.

787
00:52:20,274 --> 00:52:22,026
Hey ! All right.

788
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:24,025
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

789
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:27,390
- Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
- Ow ! Ow !

790
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:32,309
Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow !

791
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:37,344
- You want a doctor ?
- Ow !

792
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,187
I'll call a doctor.

793
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:29,949
Sorry I tore your shirt.
I don't know what happened.

794
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,911
It's all right.

795
00:53:31,994 --> 00:53:33,825
- Julius !
- What ?

796
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:37,111
- Are you allergic to something ?
- No.

797
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:40,027
Then why are these bumps
all over your body ?

798
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:43,265
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

799
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:47,108
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

800
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:50,027
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

801
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:53,629
- It's like North Dakota.
- You're so funny, Vincent.

802
00:53:55,674 --> 00:53:57,665
This is for the T-shirt
and the sandwiches.

803
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:04,067
- Born to be bad.
- Yes, we are.

804
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,349
Ooh, you're so scary.

805
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:08,504
Linda.

806
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:10,949
Linda !

807
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:13,184
Well, what do you think ?

808
00:54:13,274 --> 00:54:18,268
- Let's rock and roll.
- It's his first T-shirt.

809
00:54:35,954 --> 00:54:37,910
- Honey, honey.
- Yeah ?

810
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:41,350
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed ?

811
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:44,267
- Right.
- We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

812
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:47,949
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

813
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,583
I don't need a king-size bed.
I always sleep on the floor.

814
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:55,907
[ Vincent ] Uh, I don't know, Jules.
I hope this is a good idea.

815
00:54:55,994 --> 00:54:59,304
Come on.

816
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:02,386
Now, look,
promise me something.

817
00:55:02,474 --> 00:55:06,706
If this Professor Traven
has never heard of...

818
00:55:06,794 --> 00:55:09,228
you know,
Mom or us twins...

819
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:12,067
or all our dads
or the experiment...

820
00:55:12,154 --> 00:55:14,224
you won't be upset.

821
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,112
All I want him to do
is tell us the truth.

822
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,947
I don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

823
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:23,743
Get the hell out of here
before I call security.

824
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:28,305
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

825
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:32,103
- He's lying !
- Take it easy. He said
he was gonna call security.

826
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:35,630
For the first time in my life,
I'm pissed off !

827
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:37,625
Julius, don't do this to me.
I got a car to deliver.

828
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:39,944
The last thing I need is
a detour in the slammer.

829
00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:42,628
- I'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
- No !

830
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:47,988
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

831
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:50,872
That's Werner.
And that is you.

832
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:55,584
- So start talking.
- Everything okay, Dr Traven ?

833
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:00,263
Um, yes. It's okay.

834
00:56:00,354 --> 00:56:02,470
I'll take care of it.

835
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:09,229
Well, Vincent...

836
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:12,950
you turned out just like
I thought you would.

837
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:14,911
What did you do,
escape from prison ?

838
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:21,868
How'd you know my name ?

839
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,745
I named you.

840
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:43,273
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

841
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:01,425
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

842
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:18,704
You came out first,
of course.

843
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:20,625
We weren't expecting...

844
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:22,193
him.

845
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:26,705
This, uh...

846
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:29,069
must be where you
made the milk shake.

847
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,066
We weren't
making milk shakes.

848
00:57:32,154 --> 00:57:35,783
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

849
00:57:35,874 --> 00:57:39,344
But instead of just
one perfect kid...

850
00:57:39,434 --> 00:57:43,632
-Mom had the two of us. Way to go, Mom !
-Wrong !

851
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:47,024
The embryo did split
in two, but...

852
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:49,503
it didn't split equally.

853
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:53,587
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

854
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:55,551
All the crap
that was left over...

855
00:57:55,634 --> 00:57:58,148
went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

856
00:57:58,234 --> 00:58:00,111
Whoa. You telling me
I'm the crap ?

857
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:02,913
- This is not true.
- Wait, Julius.

858
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:06,589
You're telling me that I am
the leftover crap ? I'm no good ?

859
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:09,552
- He's wrong.
- Look at him.

860
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:16,192
Are you saying that
I'm a side effect ?

861
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:19,186
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

862
00:58:19,274 --> 00:58:22,664
and I haven't got the time.
Show's over.

863
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:27,863
Hey, dickhead.

864
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:30,468
Tell us where
our mother is.

865
00:58:30,554 --> 00:58:33,432
Um... Whispering Pines.

866
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:36,870
It's an artists' colony
200 miles north of Santa Fe.

867
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:45,026
If you're lying to me,
I'll be back.

868
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:57,545
Come on.

869
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:15,343
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

870
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:19,950
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

871
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:22,628
I'm genetic garbage.

872
00:59:22,714 --> 00:59:26,343
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

873
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:30,109
Julius, I know this is
a touchy subject for you...

874
00:59:30,194 --> 00:59:32,708
but we don't look the same,
we don't act the same...

875
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:35,786
- we don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.
- I know.

876
00:59:35,874 --> 00:59:39,105
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different ?

877
00:59:39,194 --> 00:59:41,549
We had six fathers.

878
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:44,307
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

879
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:46,828
Yeah ?

880
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:50,827
Don't forget. I was taken
to a beautiful island.

881
00:59:50,914 --> 00:59:53,667
I was loved. I was
protected, educated.

882
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:56,871
You had nobody, Vincent.

883
00:59:56,954 --> 01:00:00,503
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

884
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:03,392
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

885
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,386
could count on was yourself.

886
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:15,308
You see, Vincent...

887
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:18,830
you're the missing part
of my life.

888
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:21,872
And I'm the missing part
of your life.

889
01:00:21,954 --> 01:00:23,990
When we find Mama...

890
01:00:24,074 --> 01:00:26,463
we can fill the
missing part of hers.

891
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:31,987
We won't be alone any more.

892
01:00:32,074 --> 01:00:35,544
We can be a family.

893
01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:43,302
A family ?

894
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:45,225
Yes.

895
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,954
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree...

896
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:52,104
and Thanksgiving dinner ?

897
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:54,025
And a real home...

898
01:00:54,114 --> 01:00:58,312
where you'll
always be welcome.

899
01:00:58,394 --> 01:01:00,430
Always ?

900
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:04,348
Even when you've been bad.

901
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:13,265
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:15,265
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

903
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:18,346
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

904
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:21,506
- Is this really necessary ?
- Yes, of course it's necessary.

905
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:24,950
I'm not going to introduce
you to my mother looking
like a goat herder from Albania.

906
01:01:25,034 --> 01:01:26,911
You need clothes.

907
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:29,633
- But I feel fine the way I am.
- But you look like a--

908
01:01:29,714 --> 01:01:32,865
- Hello, can I help you ?
- Do I look like I need help ?

909
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:35,866
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

910
01:01:45,954 --> 01:01:50,027
-Do I look okay ?
-You look better. Let's put it that way.

911
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:51,991
You know what
we have to do, Jules ?

912
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:54,269
We gotta work on the way
you're walking.

913
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:57,869
You look a little stiff.
You ever see ''Frankenstein'' ?

914
01:01:57,954 --> 01:02:00,343
- I read the book.
- That's not gonna help.

915
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:04,632
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music...

916
01:02:04,714 --> 01:02:06,545
and I don't mean
a military march.

917
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:09,387
Like, you know, Aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

918
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:11,908
and Wilson Pickett,
a couple of white people.

919
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,303
- Like this ?
- Yeah. Bop ! That's it.

920
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:17,067
- Yeah, loose !
- Oh, I like that.

921
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:20,112
I got something for you.
Try these on.

922
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,311
- Sunglasses ?
- Yeah, here you go.

923
01:02:25,794 --> 01:02:28,592
Now, that's it.
There. Yeah !

924
01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:31,586
That's it. Yeah !

925
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,505
- Whoops !
- Whoa !

926
01:02:33,594 --> 01:02:37,507
- Do I look cool now ?
- Mr lce.

927
01:02:37,594 --> 01:02:40,552
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah !

928
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:08,903
Yeah, it's your night, bro !

929
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:15,110
You're making me nervous !

930
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:17,344
- Well, you're nervous.
- You've got to help me.

931
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:19,390
- What ?
- I've never been out on a date before.

932
01:03:19,474 --> 01:03:21,544
- That's okay.
- I don't know what to do.

933
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,910
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

934
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:32,346
You dance ?

935
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:40,426
- Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.
- No.

936
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:42,345
Oh, well, look.

937
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:44,311
All right.

938
01:03:44,394 --> 01:03:47,227
The first thing is,
Jules...

939
01:03:47,314 --> 01:03:49,384
forget about disco.

940
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:52,227
- Right ? No disco.
- No disco.

941
01:03:52,314 --> 01:03:55,704
When I really wanna
romance a girl...

942
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,910
I waltz with her.

943
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:03,669
- You mean, like Strauss ?
- Yeah.

944
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:06,587
It turns 'em into
putty in your hands.

945
01:04:12,994 --> 01:04:15,508
Come on, let's assume
the dance position.

946
01:04:15,594 --> 01:04:17,630
I'll give you
a couple of pointers.

947
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:19,705
- I really appreciate that.
- Come on. Let's go.

948
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:21,864
I hope nobody's
looking in the window.

949
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:23,831
Come on, like this.
Here you go.

950
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:27,429
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

951
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:30,942
By my feet...

952
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,104
not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

953
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:35,833
- Sorry, Vincent.
- Minor oversight.

954
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,984
Grab my hand.
Come on.

955
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,191
Yeow ! Ah ! Ease up !

956
01:04:41,274 --> 01:04:44,949
- Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.
- Oh, like loose ?

957
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:47,264
- See, come on. That's it, relax.
- I'm just nervous.

958
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:50,505
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

959
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:52,903
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

960
01:04:52,994 --> 01:04:54,871
- One, two, three.
- Don't, no.

961
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:56,910
-One, two, three.
-See what you're doing with your teeth ?

962
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:59,827
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

963
01:04:59,914 --> 01:05:02,428
Don't grind your teeth.

964
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:04,744
Relax your jaws, yeah.

965
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,588
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right ?

966
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:12,110
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

967
01:05:12,194 --> 01:05:14,628
See ? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

968
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:17,865
300 miles south,
southwest of Fiji.

969
01:06:25,074 --> 01:06:28,066
Yeah !

970
01:06:54,634 --> 01:06:56,511
Way to go, Jules !

971
01:06:56,594 --> 01:06:58,505
Ahhh !

972
01:07:00,754 --> 01:07:03,109
Did you know they had beer
in Ancient Egypt ?

973
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:05,071
- Oh, yeah ?
- No.

974
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:09,113
It was actually the Assyrians
that developed the beer.

975
01:07:09,194 --> 01:07:12,903
The Egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.

976
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:17,351
- You know a lot about beer.
- He knows about everything.

977
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,902
It's all from books.
Until tonight, I've never had a beer.

978
01:07:21,354 --> 01:07:24,983
All theory, no practise.
The story of my life.

979
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:29,465
- Awww !
- We're gonna change all that.

980
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:31,385
Aren't we, Marnie ?

981
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:34,550
- Marnie.
- What ?

982
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,943
Am I shit-faced yet ?

983
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:43,467
Excuse me, but...
my back teeth are floating.

984
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:49,912
Excuse me, I have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

985
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:51,791
Good shot.

986
01:07:54,714 --> 01:07:57,626
Woo-hoo ! Ooo !

987
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:03,825
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

988
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:08,745
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo !

989
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,792
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

990
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:13,751
Tonight is your lucky night.
I know it.

991
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:17,668
- I don't think Marnie likes me.
- You kidding ? Piece of cake.

992
01:08:17,754 --> 01:08:20,507
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

993
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:22,869
because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

994
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,065
Really.

995
01:08:30,394 --> 01:08:33,352
Were you nervous
the first time ?

996
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,743
I was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

997
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,145
Whoa !

998
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:44,065
Come on, hit 'em.

999
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,985
- What ?
- Hit 'em, hit 'em.

1000
01:08:46,074 --> 01:08:48,349
Oh, hit 'em,
hit 'em.

1001
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:50,345
Julius...

1002
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:54,029
you know...

1003
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:57,584
Julius, I have
to admit this.

1004
01:08:57,674 --> 01:09:00,746
Since you and I
first met, uh...

1005
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:03,064
my life has been just
getting better and better.

1006
01:09:03,154 --> 01:09:06,385
Mine, too.

1007
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:08,305
I'm so happy, Vincent.

1008
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,669
I feel like
sometimes, like...

1009
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:13,063
- picking you up and hug you...
- Whoa !

1010
01:09:13,154 --> 01:09:15,145
and hug you,
hug you, hug you.

1011
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,265
Hey, he's my brother.

1012
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:23,312
Oh, lay off
the beer, Julius.

1013
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:35,630
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe ?

1014
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:38,353
I called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

1015
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:42,504
Oh, I forgot to tell you
we were fired.

1016
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:45,711
- Oh, no.
- You hated that job.

1017
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:48,547
- Nice of your boss to tell us
where we could find you.
- Oh, no.

1018
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:53,833
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

1019
01:09:55,394 --> 01:10:00,229
The klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

1020
01:10:00,314 --> 01:10:03,670
Vince, this has
gone way beyond...

1021
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:06,951
- a case of simple loan delinquency.
- We don't like being shot.

1022
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:10,026

- Ohhh, owww !

Don't you think
that's a little drastic ?

You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you ?

that funny talk, again.

If you choose to bluff...

First we visited
our birthplace...

then we bought
new clothes.

1044
01:11:32,594 --> 01:11:36,143
I got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

- Then we danced the waltz.
- Yes, we did.

- It's too bright.
- Then we got into a fight.

- Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:23,113
But he died at birth.

1189
01:22:28,634 --> 01:22:31,307
[ Linda ]
You should be proud of her.

1190
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:33,510
She donates her house, land...

1191
01:22:33,594 --> 01:22:35,903
and all her paintings
to young artists.

1192
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:38,872
Linda, do I look like
a young artist ?

1193
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,991
- All she meant--
- I know what she meant,
and why she's here.

1194
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:44,463
It's got nothing to do
with finding my mother...

1195
01:22:44,554 --> 01:22:46,545
and everything
to do with money.

1196
01:22:46,634 --> 01:22:50,388
- That's not true and you know it.
- Bullshit !

1197
01:22:50,474 --> 01:22:53,386
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

1198
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:56,193
Look who decided
to chime in !

1199
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:58,105
The creature from
the Black Lagoon.

1200
01:22:58,194 --> 01:23:00,344
I should've had my head
examined listening to you.

1201
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,345
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity...

1202
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:05,028
and I'm out looking
for a dead mother.

1203
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,992
- All I wanted was to
make us into a family.
- Family, my butt !

1204
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:10,190
There's no family here.

1205
01:23:10,274 --> 01:23:13,027
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

1206
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:15,184
I don't know
why I listen to people.

1207
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:17,504
- I don't know why I do it.
- Cut it out.

1208
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:19,471
Vince !

1209
01:23:19,554 --> 01:23:21,385
- I'm leaving.
- No, stop !

1210
01:23:21,474 --> 01:23:23,465
Stop ! What are you doing ?

1211
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:26,148
You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

1212
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,192
Where do you think
you're going ?

1213
01:23:29,274 --> 01:23:32,391
He dumped us in
the middle of New Mexico.

1214
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,669
I can't--

1215
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:36,585
Julius !

1216
01:23:36,674 --> 01:23:38,983
You don't know this...

1217
01:23:39,074 --> 01:23:41,747
and I promised Vince
that I wouldn't tell you...

1218
01:23:41,834 --> 01:23:45,463
but he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

1219
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:50,105
I'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

1220
01:23:54,354 --> 01:23:56,868
[ Vince ]
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr Beetroot.

1221
01:23:56,954 --> 01:24:01,266
Yeah, I'll find it. Yeah.

1222
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:03,231
Yes, I have a map.

1223
01:24:03,314 --> 01:24:05,350
All right.
I'll see you there.

1224
01:24:05,434 --> 01:24:07,504
See you in Houston
in the morning.

1225
01:24:07,594 --> 01:24:09,983
I'll be looking
forward to it.

1226
01:24:10,074 --> 01:24:12,542
What a coincidence.

1227
01:24:12,634 --> 01:24:14,511
That was our friend.

1228
01:24:14,594 --> 01:24:17,791
Looks like I'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

1229
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:19,148
Sorry.

1230
01:24:19,234 --> 01:24:21,464
I would have done
the same thing.

1231
01:24:21,554 --> 01:24:24,830
You want the merchandise.
It's not your problem who delivers.

1232
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:26,666
Precisely.

1233
01:24:32,074 --> 01:24:34,713
But how will
you find him ?

1234
01:24:34,794 --> 01:24:36,625
I have him in my head.

1235
01:24:36,714 --> 01:24:40,309
I found him once,
I'll find him again.

1236
01:24:40,394 --> 01:24:42,624
I hope so. Bye.

1237
01:24:42,714 --> 01:24:44,864
Be careful.

1238
01:26:18,194 --> 01:26:20,025
Sorry I'm late.

1239
01:26:20,114 --> 01:26:24,153
- The directions you gave me weren't--
- Step back.

1240
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,148
Get over here.

1241
01:26:29,234 --> 01:26:31,794
I'm unarmed.

1242
01:26:31,874 --> 01:26:33,865
He's clean.

1243
01:26:33,954 --> 01:26:37,185
Oh, oh.
Isn't that pretty !

1244
01:26:37,274 --> 01:26:39,105
Yeah, it is.

1245
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,311
- Did you come here alone, unarmed ?
- Yeah.

1246
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:44,350
You're just some fool
who stole a car ?

1247
01:26:44,434 --> 01:26:47,870
Yeah, I guess I am.

1248
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:50,707
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you ?

1249
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:53,672
No.

1250
01:26:53,754 --> 01:26:57,190
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

1251
01:26:57,274 --> 01:27:00,072
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

1252
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:04,227
Somebody else developed it,
but I just had to have it.

1253
01:27:04,314 --> 01:27:06,509
Crafty devil, huh ?

1254
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,664
What are you waiting for ?

1255
01:27:10,914 --> 01:27:12,825
Wait a minute, Beetroot !

1256
01:27:12,914 --> 01:27:15,508
- I thought we had a deal.
- We do.

1257
01:27:24,754 --> 01:27:26,790
Five million bucks !

1258
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,832
- You wanna count it ?
- No, no.

1259
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:34,430
- But I could use a lift to town.
- Don't press your luck.

1260
01:27:34,514 --> 01:27:36,345
Okay. That's all right.

1261
01:27:36,434 --> 01:27:40,188
I gassed it up for you,
Beetroot. Thank you !

1262
01:27:40,274 --> 01:27:45,029
Five million dollars !
Five million bucks !

1263
01:27:45,114 --> 01:27:48,265
Ha-ha-ha !
Five million bucks !

1264
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:50,868
- I've gotta look at it !
- [ Crash ]

1265
01:27:52,474 --> 01:27:54,942
Uh-oh.

1266
01:28:33,674 --> 01:28:35,824
Hey, Benedict !

1267
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:38,667
All I want is the money.

1268
01:28:38,754 --> 01:28:42,508
Just give me what's mine
and I'll leave you alone.

1269
01:29:17,954 --> 01:29:20,184
Steps ! Steps !

1270
01:29:31,114 --> 01:29:33,503
Leave my brother alone.

1271
01:29:34,594 --> 01:29:37,062
No.

1272
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:38,985
Julius.

1273
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:42,146
No, no, no.

1274
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:44,953
No, no.

1275
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:50,905
Julius, you're--
you're here ?

1276
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:53,349
No. No, you idiot.

1277
01:29:53,434 --> 01:29:55,550
Don't be nervous.

1278
01:29:55,634 --> 01:29:58,865
I hate violence.
Plus I never carry a gun.

1279
01:29:58,954 --> 01:30:01,422
Who are you ?

1280
01:30:01,514 --> 01:30:03,425
Whoa, whoa, whoa !

1281
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:05,425
Put the gun down.
I got the money.

1282
01:30:05,514 --> 01:30:08,187
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

1283
01:30:08,274 --> 01:30:11,266
Here's the money.

1284
01:30:11,354 --> 01:30:13,743
You're a goddamned millionaire.

1285
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:19,545
You, I am never
gonna forgive... never.

1286
01:30:19,634 --> 01:30:23,104
- Open it.
- Open it ?

1287
01:30:23,194 --> 01:30:26,504
You were going
to get killed.

1288
01:30:26,594 --> 01:30:30,143
- I was trying to distract him
so you could escape.
- I already had escaped !

1289
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:33,590
I was halfway to Brazil
when I felt you !

1290
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,711
- Close it.
- Close it ?

1291
01:30:36,794 --> 01:30:38,830
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

1292
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:42,463
- Why didn't you go ?
- Why didn't I go ?

1293
01:30:42,554 --> 01:30:46,183
Because thanks to you,
I'm not only a goddamned psychic--

1294
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,707
Benedict !

1295
01:30:47,794 --> 01:30:50,262
- I think the case belongs to me.
- Oh, sorry.

1296
01:30:50,354 --> 01:30:54,313
I got this disease
called a conscience.

1297
01:30:54,394 --> 01:30:57,864
- No one ever said being good was easy.
- ''No one ever said--''

1298
01:30:57,954 --> 01:30:59,433
Will you two shut up !

1299
01:30:59,514 --> 01:31:02,153
Butt out, pal !
You got your money.

1300
01:31:02,234 --> 01:31:05,146
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

1301
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:07,350
Try Brazil.

1302
01:31:07,434 --> 01:31:10,665
It doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

1303
01:31:10,754 --> 01:31:12,870
Which one's first ?

1304
01:31:12,954 --> 01:31:16,629
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money ?

1305
01:31:16,714 --> 01:31:18,147
You got it.

1306
01:31:18,234 --> 01:31:21,590
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

1307
01:31:21,674 --> 01:31:24,905
- The third rule ?
- Third rule ?

1308
01:31:24,994 --> 01:31:27,792
Yeah, third rule.

1309
01:31:31,754 --> 01:31:33,551
Oooh !

1310
01:31:33,634 --> 01:31:36,751
- The third rule.
- What's the third rule ?

1311
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:38,347
Duck !

1312
01:32:07,114 --> 01:32:09,309
Yo !

1313
01:32:09,394 --> 01:32:12,227
Holy-shmoly !

1314
01:32:17,434 --> 01:32:20,392
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

1315
01:32:23,274 --> 01:32:25,834
Thanks for coming back,
Vincent.

1316
01:32:25,914 --> 01:32:28,712
We're brothers, right ?

1317
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:30,944
- We're family.
- That's right.

1318
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:36,109
A rich family.

1319
01:32:36,194 --> 01:32:38,503
- A good family.
- What ? What ?

1320
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:41,062
- We're gonna return this money.
- No.

1321
01:32:41,154 --> 01:32:43,270
- We don't have to give it back.
- Yes, we do.

1322
01:32:43,354 --> 01:32:45,310
- Why ? Why ?
- We have to, believe me.

1323
01:32:48,594 --> 01:32:51,586
- Mary Ann ?
- Hmm ?

1324
01:32:51,674 --> 01:32:54,711
I think you'd better come
take a look at this.

1325
01:32:54,794 --> 01:32:57,945
What is it ?

1326
01:33:23,354 --> 01:33:24,867
Mary Ann ?

1327
01:33:24,954 --> 01:33:28,867
What a pleasant surprise.

1328
01:33:31,354 --> 01:33:34,232
You stole my family.

1329
01:33:34,314 --> 01:33:37,306
You lying son of a bitch.

1330
01:33:42,874 --> 01:33:45,183
Linda, I'm sorry.

1331
01:33:45,274 --> 01:33:47,742
I made a terrible mistake
and I apologize.

1332
01:33:47,834 --> 01:33:50,428
I-- All I'm asking for
is another chance.

1333
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:52,391
I know I don't
deserve this--

1334
01:33:52,474 --> 01:33:54,544
That's right,
you don't deserve it.

1335
01:34:09,234 --> 01:34:11,145
Vince ?

1336
01:34:24,834 --> 01:34:28,144
Yes, this is the
Benedict Corporation.

1337
01:34:28,234 --> 01:34:31,271
We are a consulting firm...
a think tank.

1338
01:34:31,354 --> 01:34:34,471
Something like
the Rand Corporation.

1339
01:34:34,554 --> 01:34:36,863
- Only smarter.
- Only smarter.

1340
01:34:36,954 --> 01:34:38,945
Tomorrow at 3:00.

1341
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:42,310
Yes, I'll put you down.

1342
01:34:42,394 --> 01:34:44,191
Good night, Mr Benedicts.

1343
01:34:44,274 --> 01:34:46,265
- Good night.
- Good night.

1344
01:34:46,354 --> 01:34:49,983
That's it.
The last cheque is written.

1345
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:53,305
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward ?

1346
01:34:53,394 --> 01:34:56,147
After we've paid off
all our debts...

1347
01:34:56,234 --> 01:34:59,032
we have exactly $12,278.

1348
01:34:59,114 --> 01:35:02,743
- $12,278. That's terrible.
- What ?

1349
01:35:02,834 --> 01:35:05,587
You're just upset because
I made you return that suitcase.

1350
01:35:08,354 --> 01:35:11,744
Oh, the money.

1351
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:14,143
You mean the
four million dollars.

1352
01:35:15,354 --> 01:35:17,663
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

1353
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,871
Say it...
four million dollars.

1354
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:23,422
It's a lot of money,
Jules.

1355
01:35:23,514 --> 01:35:26,631
Vincent...
I'm very proud of you.

1356
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:30,343
[ Sighs ]
Well...

1357
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:33,983
yeah, I'm kinda
proud of myself.

1358
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:37,305
[ Julius ] lsn't it great to be one
of the good guys for a change ?

1359
01:35:37,394 --> 01:35:40,352
It feels great
to be a good guy !

1360
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,426
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh ?

1361
01:35:43,514 --> 01:35:46,586
- You did steal a car though.
- I borrowed one.

1362
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,905
I brought it back the next day.
I explained it to the man.

1363
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,712
He was a cowboy.

1364
01:35:51,794 --> 01:35:54,672
Excuse me ? I'm--

1365
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:58,303
Oh, my God. I don't even know
which one is which.

1366
01:36:02,634 --> 01:36:04,704
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1367
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:07,945
You see, I didn't
believe your story.

1368
01:36:08,034 --> 01:36:10,946
Who would believe
a crazy story like that ?

1369
01:36:14,754 --> 01:36:17,222
They lied to me
all these years.

1370
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:20,272
They lied to you, too.

1371
01:36:27,034 --> 01:36:30,106
You found each other.

1372
01:36:36,354 --> 01:36:38,470
Now you found me.

1373
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:59,111
Mama ?

1374
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:01,942
Mama !

1375
01:37:03,954 --> 01:37:05,387
Mama !

1376
01:37:05,474 --> 01:37:07,704
Oh, Mama !

1377
01:37:25,274 --> 01:37:27,469
Good.

1378
01:37:27,554 --> 01:37:29,704
Tickets ?

1379
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:31,625
Thanks. This is
gonna be great.

1380
01:37:31,714 --> 01:37:34,433
I just can't get over
how alike they are.

1381
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:37,506
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

1
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,694
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence,

2
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:49,907
they have been regarded
with fear, suspicion, often hatred.

3
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,326
Across the planet debate rages.

4
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,829
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain?

5
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:01,501
Or simply a new species of humanity,
fighting for their share of the world?

6
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:04,629
Either way, it is an historical fact

7
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:10,677
sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

8
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,553
"We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies. "

9
00:01:55,637 --> 00:02:01,017
"Though passion may have strained,
it must not break the bonds of our affection. "

10
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:06,064
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

11
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,691
It's one of my favourites.

12
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:14,155
SO, if you'll please have your tickets ready,
we can begin the tour.

13
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:22,871
Jackie, could you clear my schedule this evening?
I wanna have dinner with my son.

14
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,456
Yes, Mr President.

15
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,153
Excuse me, sir. Are you lost?

16
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:08,373
Perimeter breach at visitors' checkpoint.

17
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,629
Multiple subjects.

18
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:18,550
Mr President, security breach. Jackie, leave.
Let's get him out to the car.

19
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,304
Exits not clear.
We don't know how many they are.

20
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:24,431
Both sides secure.

21
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:36,275
- Something's in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

22
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:37,526
Negative! Not clear.

23
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:48,913
- It's outside the Oval Office.
- Lock this place down.

24
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,720
Don't shoot!

25
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,123
My God.

26
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,956


27
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:44,081


28
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:17,363
Neanderthals. We once believed that
they were wiped out by years of conflict

29
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:21,701
with the much more advanced branch
of humanity called Cro-Magnon man,

30
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:27,999
but recent research into our DNA suggests
that these two species may have interbred,

31
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:31,377
evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?

32
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,962
- Us.
- Us. Right.

33
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,007
Artie.

34
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,592
Not here.

35
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,934
Come on. Pay attention.

36
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:05,034
...makes me insane when she does this...

37
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,371
What are you looking at? Sick...

38
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,793
To the shelter.

39
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,128
They're gonna kill him.

40
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,055
Jean? You OK?

41
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,015
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

42
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,018
It's just uh... just a headache.

43
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,564
It's not just a headache, is it?

44
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:40,485
Listen, uh, I wasn't really sure how to say this,
but you know ever since Liberty Island you've been...

45
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,405
- Scott.
- You've been different.

46
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:48,284
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't focus. I can hear everything.

47
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:53,831
Jean, it's not just your telepathy. A month ago you had to concentrate just to levitate a book or a chair across the room.

48
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:58,460
Now when you have a nightmare
the entire bedroom shakes.

49
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,922
My dreams are getting worse.

50
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:09,763
I keep feeling
something terrible's about to happen.

51
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,771
I would never let anything happen to you.

52
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,108
Hey, have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?

53
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,569
Something's happening in the food court.

54
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:29,282
- My brother asked you a simple question.
- Why are you being such a dick?

55
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,743
Because I can.

56
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:35,621
Can I have a light?

57
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,919
- Sorry. Can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

58
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,755
- Why don't you stop showing off?
- Uh, for her?

59
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:48,425
- I can't help it if your girl friend's getting excited.
- I don't think she's getting excited.

60
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:53,555
- Don't get shook up, We're trying to have a good time here, all right?
- I think you're the only one having a good time.

61
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,684
That's real cute, man.

62
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,770
What are you gonna do?

63
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,149
Suddenly you're not so tough.

64
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,443
Bobby, what did you do?

65
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,529
I didn't do this.

66
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,948
No. I did.

67
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:07,710
And the next time
you feel like showing off, don't.

68
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,633
- Breaking news.
- We're coming to you live from Washington,

69
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,095
where there's been an attack
in the Oval Office of the White House.

70
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:23,600
Details are still coming in, but we have been informed
that the President and vice President were not harmed.

71
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,770
Sources say the attack involved
one or more mutants...

72
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:31,275
- I think it's time to leave, Professor.
- I think you're right.

73
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,576


74
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,913
- In my opinion, Magneto's behind this.
- No, I don't think so, Scott.

75
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,375
While Eric's capable of organizing
something like this from prison,

76
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,421
for him it would be irrational,
it will only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

77
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,258
- You mean superiority.
- You're right, if Eric had his way.

78
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,928
And of course, he knows how the Government will
respond, they will reintroduce the Registration Act.

79
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:09,269
The president could declare a state of emergency,
place every mutant in the country under arrest.

80
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:14,691
- Do you think the assassin is working alone?
- Probably we will only know that if we find him before the authorities do.

81
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:21,406
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro,
but his movements are inexplicably erratic.

82
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,036
When I have exact coordinates, Storm, Jean,
I'll need you to take the jet and try pick him up.

83
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,583
It was close, wasn't it?

84
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,378
Closer than anyone's admitted.

85
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:41,550
- What do you need, William?
- Just your authorisation for a special operation.

86
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,428
No, thank you, Mr President.

87
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:47,348
And somehow I thought you were here
to talk about school reform.

88
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,767
Funny you should say that, Mr President.

89
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:54,521
- Senator.
- Mr President. Thank you for having me.

90
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:58,900
- Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker.
- How do you do?

91
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:03,446
His department has been dealing with the
mutant phenomenon since... before my time.

92
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,699
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act, Senator.

93
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:10,245
But it seems your ideas on
the mutant problem have changed recently.

94
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:15,166
So what are you proposing, Mr Stryker?

95
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,585
May I, Mr President?

96
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:34,518
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility

97
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:38,188
in the Salem region of upstate New York.

98
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,399
Where did you get this information?

99
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:45,821
Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists
from the Liberty Island incident.

100
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:50,241
- Eric? Eric Lehnsherr? - You have access to him?
- Magneto, yes.

101
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:55,663
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

102
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:01,377
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

103
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:07,300
- What the hell is that?
- A jet.

104
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,553
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know.

105
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:15,223
But it comes up out of the basketball court.

106
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:24,608
If we'd been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr President, before this incident...

107
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:27,027
All right, listen.

108
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:33,450
William, you enter, you detain, you question,

109
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:39,997
but the last thing we need to see is the body
of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news.

110
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,715
- Mr Stryker?
- Senator Kelly.

111
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,303
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.

112
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:57,014
- Quite a handshake.
- What can I do for you?

113
00:14:57,098 --> 00:15:00,518
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit if possible.

114
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,770
It isn't a petting zoo, Senator.

115
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:07,774
In this conflict he is the enemy, you're just a
spectator, so why don't you sit this one out, all right?

116
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:13,738
Mr Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

117
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,453
I was piloting black ops missions
in the jungles of north Vietnam

118
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,957
while you were sucking on
your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.

119
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,961
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.

120
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:41,932
- You're dead. You're so dead.
- You're dead.

121
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,481
I don't wanna hurt you.

122
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,027
I'm not afraid.

123
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,629
Logan.

124
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,050
You miss me, kid?

125
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,801
Not really.

126
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,345
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK. How are you?

127
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:23,389
- Who's this?
- This is Bobby. He's my...

128
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:25,475
I'm her boyfriend.

129
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:27,976
Call me Iceman.

130
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:32,981
Right.

131
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,902
Boyfriend? So how do you guys...?

132
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,154
Well, we're still working on that.

133
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:42,991
Look who's come back. Just in time.

134
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:45,035
For what?

135
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:48,163
- We need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?

136
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,915
Nice to see you again, Logan.

137
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:52,792
Hi, Logan.

138
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,294
Hi, Jean.

139
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:58,214
Uh, I should go and get the jet ready.

140
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,841
Yeah, well, it's good to meet you.

141
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:04,512
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Logan. I'll see you later.

142
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:13,771
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.

143
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:17,441
The professor wants us to track down
a mutant who attacked the President.

144
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,484
So it was a mutant.

145
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:25,615
You'll be here when we get back,
unless you plan on running off again.

146
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,286
Well, I could probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

147
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,456
Find what you were looking for, Logan?

148
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,417
More or less.

149
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,128
I'll see you boys later.

150
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:41,506
- Be safe, OK?
- You too. Bye.

151
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,591
See ya.

152
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,887
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

153
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:52,099
Your bike needs gas.

154
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,184
Then fill her up.

155
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,201


156
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,457
Mr Laurio, how long can we keep this up?

157
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,004
- How long is your sentence?
- Forever.

158
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:28,259
Not necessarily forever, Mr Lehnsherr.
Just until I've got all that I need.

159
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,429
Mr Stryker, how kind of you to visit.

160
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:37,977
Have you come back to ensure the taxpayers'
dollars are keeping me comfortable?

161
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,710
Done. You can go.

162
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,297
Now...

163
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,724
Mr Lehnsherr.
I'd like to have one final talk

164
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:24,522
about the house that Xavier built
and the machine called Cerebro.

165
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:36,449
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days

166
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:42,747
under the belief that you're a six-year-old girl.

167
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:46,960
- Can you do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

168
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,212
Welcome back.

169
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,693
- You want me to leave?
- No. Just don't move.

170
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:24,038
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

171
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,916
The white lights are humans.

172
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,796
And these are the mutants.

173
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:41,262
Through Cerebro I'm connected to them,
and they to me.

174
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,476
You see, Logan?

175
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,062
We're not as alone as you think.

176
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,485
I found the base at Alkali Lake.
There was nothing there.

177
00:20:56,568 --> 00:21:01,490
The broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the president.

178
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:05,202
I've been finding it difficult to get a lock on it.

179
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,663
Well, can't you just concentrate harder?

180
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:11,291
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

181
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,879
There.

182
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:19,298
Looks like he's finally stopped running.

183
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:37,066
I need you to read my mind again.

184
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,537
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.
- We had a deal.

185
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,292
The mind is not a box can be simply unlocked
and opened. It's a beehive with a million...

186
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:58,211
Spare me the lectures.

187
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:05,802
I have no doubt that your amnesia, your adamantium
skeleton, the claws are all somehow connected, but...

188
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:11,516
Logan, sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

189
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,643
I promise you we'll talk again when I return.

190
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:19,440
Oh, if you would be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight.

191
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:22,985
Scott and I are going to visit an old friend.

192
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,917
I'm sending the coordinates
of where the mutant's settled.

193
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,962
As soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

194
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:47,508
- Let's hope he cooperates.
- Yes, for his sake. Good luck.

195
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:57,034
Stryker, William.

196
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:59,244


197
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,712


198
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:20,140


199
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:59,010


200
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:06,768


201
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,180
What are you doing in here?

202
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,852
Garbage.

203
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,359
These are the coordinates.

204
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:06,674
He's a teleporter. Must be why
the professor had trouble locking onto him.

205
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,761
We're not here to hurt you.

206
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:13,681
We just wanna talk.

207
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,773
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,568
Sure you don't wanna come down?

209
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,425
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

210
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,886
Are you?

211
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,764
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

212
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:59,058
Why would people
have gotten that impression?

213
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:02,978
- What's your name?
- Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

214
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:12,113
There was so much shooting, such fear.

215
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:15,074
And then there was only pain.

216
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:21,580
I could see it all happening,
but I couldn't stop myself.

217
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:24,000
It was like a bad dream.

218
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,669
Perhaps he is testing me.

219
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:34,926
And before you were in the White House,
what do you remember?

220
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,761
Nothing.

221
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,431
I was here.

222
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:47,981
- I'd rather get him back to the professor.
- The professor?

223
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,654
Did you do these yourself?

224
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:06,248
And what about this?

225
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:30,646
- I need you to read my mind again.
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.

226
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,192
- You'll be indestructible.
- No memory.

227
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:38,821
Sometimes the mind needs
to discover things for itself.

228
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:40,907
Wolverine.

229
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:46,870
No memory. You'll have no memory.

230
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,903
Can't sleep?

231
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,155
How can you tell?

232
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,199
Cos you're awake.

233
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,535
Right. How about you?

234
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,829
I don't sleep.

235
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:42,549
- Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
- Apparently not.

236
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,928
- Got any beer?
- This is a school.

237
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,222
- So that's a no?
- Yeah, that's a no.

238
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:54,144
- Is there anything other than chocolate milk?
- There should be some soda in the small cupboard.

239
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,159
- Thanks.
- No problem.

240
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,628
I'll take him from here.

241
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:24,923
It's all right, Scott.

242
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:27,509
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

243
00:31:57,287 --> 00:32:00,624
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

244
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:03,418
Sorry, Eric, not today.

245
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,171
To what do I owe the pleasure?

246
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:11,259
The assassination attempt on the President.
What do you know about it?

247
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,303
Nothing.

248
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:15,806
Only what I read in the papers.

249
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:19,434
You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles.

250
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:21,478
What's happened to you?

251
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:25,856
I've had frequent visits from William Stryker.

252
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,234
You remember him, don't you?

253
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,992
His son, Jason, was once
a student of yours, wasn't he?

254
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,160
Yes. Years ago.

255
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:41,998
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him.

256
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,542
At least, not in the way that his father wanted.

257
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:50,505
And now you think that taking in Wolverine will
make up for your failure with Stryker's son?

258
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:58,096
- How long you been here?
- A couple of years.

259
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,600
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

260
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:06,813
Actually, my parents think
this is a prep school.

261
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:12,736
Oh I see. Well, I suppose lots of prep
schools have their own dorms, campuses...

262
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,821
Jets.

263
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:19,241
- So you and Rogue, huh?
- Yeah.

264
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:23,620
I mean it's not what you think
I'd like it to be, but it's just...

265
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:30,711
It's just that it's not easy when you
wanna be closer to someone, but you can't.

266
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,093
You know, I've seen how you look at Dr Grey.

267
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:41,513
- Excuse me? - Nothin'.

268
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,642
- You haven't told him about his past, have you?
- I've put him on the path.

269
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,895
Logan's mind is still fragile.

270
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,314
Is it?

271
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:56,736
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men, old friend?

272
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,617
Eric, what have you done?

273
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,788
I'm sorry, Charles.

274
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,332
I couldn't help it.

275
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,460
What have you told Stryker?

276
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:17,673
Everything.

277
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,847
The war has begun.

278
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,187
Scott!

279
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,857
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

280
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:13,810
But now and then
every mother needs to get away.

281
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:16,980
As someone uninvited is coming to dinner.

282
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,436
- What is it?
- Shh.

283
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:34,930
You picked the wrong house, bud.

284
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,845
You all right?

285
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:28,189
Stay here.

286
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,653
- This way.
- Let's go.

287
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,214
John! Where's Rogue?

288
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:41,218
- I don't know.
- I gotta find her.

289
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:46,056
- Open it.
- Here, take her.

290
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:55,107
Go on, get in. Let's go. Come on.

291
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:01,029
Take him. He's stunned.

292
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,823
- I can help you.
- Help them.

293
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:30,223
This way.

294
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:44,738
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.

295
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:51,995
Move.

296
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,921
Come on.

297
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:18,687
Let's go.

298
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,149
Come on, this way.

299
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:29,614
This is it.

300
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:37,038
- You wanna shoot me, shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

301
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:39,874
Not yet.

302
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,961
Wolverine?

303
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:47,840
Well I must admit this is certainly
the last place I'd expect to find you.

304
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,759
How long has it been? 15 years?

305
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,054
You haven't changed one bit.

306
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,391
Me, on the other hand...

307
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:01,812
Nature.

308
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:09,319
Wait, wait, you guys. We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill him.

309
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:13,240
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby.

310
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:15,409
Please.

311
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:20,997
I didn't realise Xavier was taking in animals,
even animals as unique as you.

312
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,082
Who are you?

313
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,295
Don't you remember?

314
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,441
Logan, come on. Let's go.

315
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:08,460
- Go. I'll be fine.
- But we won't.

316
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,011
Go. Keep going.

317
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:47,246
- Now get in, get in.
- I'm driving.

318
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,874
Maybe next time.

319
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:55,463
This is Cyclops's car.

320
00:42:55,546 --> 00:42:57,215
Oh, yeah?

321
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:19,152
What the hell was that back there?

322
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:20,946
Stryker.

323
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:22,990
His name is Stryker.

324
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:26,660
- Who is he?
- I can't remember.

325
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:39,088
Here.
This is yours.

326
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:53,436
- I don't think uncomfortable silences.
- What are you doing?

327
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:02,902
I don't think that's his CD player.

328
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:12,662
- Sit back.
- Where are we going?

329
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:16,333
Storm and Jean are in Boston.
We'll head that way.

330
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,877
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

331
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,518
Sergeant?

332
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:41,482
Most of the mutants escaped through sewerage
tunnels that weren't in our schematics.

333
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:43,776
- We have several in custody.
- How many? - Six, sir

334
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,261
Welcome, Professor.

335
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,575
Take what we need, gentlemen.

336
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:38,495
I just think all this anti-mutant protesting underscores
a genuine growing concern among most Americans.

337
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:45,251
I think Mutant registration...

338
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:49,505
But why stop there? Maybe it would be easier
to round up mutants by the truckload.

339
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:53,050
- Or maybe you'd like an all-out war, Mr Shaw.
- Oh, please.

340
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:57,471
- Turn that shit off, Lou.
- A lot on your mind?

341
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:03,019
Mr Laurio?

342
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,815
I'm Grace.

343
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:19,993
You want another beer?

344
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:23,538
Of course you do.

345
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,799
- You're really aggressive.
- Yes, I am.

346
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:40,679
I've never hooked up with
a girl like you before.

347
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:42,348
I know.

348
00:46:44,516 --> 00:46:48,812
- It's uh, it's kind of dirty in here, don't you think?
- That's the idea.

349
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:51,774
Velcro? Nice.

350
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:54,860
- Bottoms up.
- I certainly hope so.

351
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:14,003
Bottoms up.

352
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:37,109
- William...
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

353
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,490
I call it the neural inhibitor.
It keeps you outta here.

354
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:48,203
- What have you done with Scott?
- Don't worry.

355
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:50,956
I'm just giving him a little re-education.

356
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,709
Of course, you know
all about that, don't you?

357
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:57,878
William, you wanted me to cure your son,
but mutation is not a disease.

358
00:47:57,962 --> 00:48:00,589
You're lying.

359
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,719
You were more frightened of him than I was.

360
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:10,016
You know, just one year after Jason returned
from your school, my wife...

361
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:13,269
You see, he resented us.

362
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:18,232
He blamed us for his condition,
so he would toy with our minds,

363
00:48:18,316 --> 00:48:22,277
projecting visions and scenarios
into our brains.

364
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,739
My wife, in the end,

365
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:33,079
she took a power drill to her left temple
in an attempt to bore the images out.

366
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:36,499
My boy - the great illusionist.

367
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:48,927
For someone who hates mutants,
you certainly keep some strange company.

368
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:54,433
They serve their purpose,
as long as they can be controlled.

369
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:03,067
You arranged the attack on the President.

370
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:08,405
You didn't even have to read my mind.

371
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:13,494
You know, I've been working with mutants
as long as you have, Xavier,

372
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:20,875
but the most frustrating thing I've learned
is that nobody really knows how many even exist

373
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,046
or how to find them.
Except you.

374
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,758
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

375
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,010
You're much too powerful for that.

376
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:34,180
Instead, we'll go right to the source.

377
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:40,186
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

378
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:46,149
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

379
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,653
But that's only where it begins.

380
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,030
Jason?

381
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,075
Oh my God, William. This is your son.

382
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,495
- What have you done to him?
- No, Charles.

383
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,914
My son is dead.

384
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,459
Just like the rest of you.

385
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:29,233
Mom? Dad?

386
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,736
Ronny? Is anybody home?

387
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:39,159
I'll try and find you some clothes.
Don't burn anything.

388
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:54,716
I found some of my mom's old clothes.

389
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:57,886
I think they're from before I was born.

390
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:01,138
Groovy.

391
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:09,688
Hello?

392
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,070
Jean. Where are you?

393
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:50,103
These are my grandmother's.

394
00:51:50,186 --> 00:51:52,522
Thanks.

395
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:56,650
You won't hurt me.

396
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,507
Wow.

397
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,427
I'm - I'm sorry.

398
00:52:51,828 --> 00:52:54,414
Hey, Ronny, next time you...

399
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,501
Who the hell are you?

400
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:05,800
- HoneyÐˆÂ¬aren't you supposed to be at school?
- Bobby, who is this guy?

401
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:10,055
This is Professor Logan.

402
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,811
There's something I need to tell you.

403
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:29,949


404
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:37,873
You're clear.

405
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:40,833
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

406
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:59,811
- There's something different about you.
- Yeah. I was having a good day.

407
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:08,902
No, it's not that.

408
00:54:10,654 --> 00:54:12,823
- Sit down.
- No.

409
00:54:13,991 --> 00:54:16,159
- Sit your ass down.
- What could it be?

410
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:20,872
What are you doin'?

411
00:54:22,082 --> 00:54:24,793
There it is.

412
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:28,964
Too much iron in your blood.

413
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:33,343
Mr Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman,
especially one who's interested in you.

414
00:54:52,945 --> 00:54:58,451


415
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,978
So uh, when did you first know you were a...

416
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:52,252
A mutant?

417
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,254
Would you cut that out?

418
00:55:56,422 --> 00:55:58,591
You have to understand. We thought
Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.

419
00:55:58,675 --> 00:56:02,637
- Bobby is gifted.
- We know that. We just didn't realise...

420
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,556
We still love you, Bobby.
It's just this mutant problem is a little...

421
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,353
What mutant problem?

422
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:12,397
...complicated.

423
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,192
- What exactly are you a professor of, Mr Logan?
- Art.

424
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:19,904
Well you should see what Bobby can do.

425
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:23,657
I can do a lot more than that.

426
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,756
This is all my fault.

427
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:52,101
Actually, they discovered the males are the ones who
carry the mutant gene and pass it on, so it's his fault.

428
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:58,024
911. Please state your emergency.

429
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,156
I need the police. There are people
in our house. They won't let us leave.

430
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,910
But it's believed that a manhunt for several fugitives
from the facility is now under way.

431
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:14,748
Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal.

432
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,254
Why don't you take a break? I'll keep trying.

433
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:24,716
So, what are they?

434
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,165
They're angelic symbols passed on
to mankind by the archangel Gabriel.

435
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:05,130
They're beautiful.

436
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,424
How many do you have?

437
00:58:08,508 --> 00:58:10,885
One for every sin.

438
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:13,972
So quite a few.

439
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:16,224
You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers?

440
00:58:19,352 --> 00:58:22,146
Yes. At a school for people like us,
where we can be safe.

441
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,818
Safe from what?

442
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:29,988
Everyone else.

443
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:32,073
You know outside of the circus
most people were afraid of me.

444
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:38,245
But I didn't hate them. I pitied them.

445
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:41,873
Do you know why?

446
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,836
Because most people will never know anything
beyond what they see with their own two eyes.

447
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:52,175
Well I gave up on pity a long time ago.

448
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:56,763
Someone so beautiful
should not be so angry.

449
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:05,605
Sometimes anger can help you survive.

450
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:12,612
So can faith.

451
00:59:14,447 --> 00:59:16,657
- Storm, I found an active comm device.
- Where?

452
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:20,620
Oh, God. It's for me.

453
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,923
Have you tried not being a mutant?

454
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:42,682
No one's left, Jean. Soldiers came.

455
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:46,019
- What about the children?
- I saw them escape. I'm not sure about the rest.

456
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:50,440
We weren't able to reach the Professor or Scott either.

457
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:53,026
- Where are you, Logan?
- Boston, with Bobby Drake's family.

458
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:56,445
- OK. We're on our way.
- And, Storm, make it fast.

459
00:59:56,528 --> 01:00:01,700
- We have to go now.
- Why? Logan, what's wrong?

460
01:00:07,873 --> 01:00:11,961
Drop the knives and put your hands in the air.

461
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:18,842
What's going on here?

462
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:21,261
- Ronny.
- I said drop the knives.

463
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:24,847
- Open the door.
- Break it.

464
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:28,226
Turn around. Up against the wall.

465
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,063
- This is just a misunderstanding.
- Put the knives down.

466
01:00:33,022 --> 01:00:37,277
I can't.

467
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,779
Look.

468
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,365
The rest of you, on the ground now.

469
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:50,372
Look kid, I said on the ground.

470
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,250
We don't wanna hurt you, kid.

471
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:03,051
You know all those dangerous mutants
you hear about on the news?

472
01:01:07,889 --> 01:01:12,936
I'm the worst one.

473
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:16,564
Get down.
Good attack.

474
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,922
- Who the hell is this?
- Kurt Wagner.

475
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:27,607
But in the Munich circus I was known as
"The Incredible Nightcrawler".

476
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,776
- Ah save it. Storm.
- We're outta here.

477
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,322
Jason, stop it!

478
01:03:55,342 --> 01:03:57,844
It's all right. You can come out.

479
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,994
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

480
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:26,080
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

481
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:33,545
Well, we'll have to find them, won't we?

482
01:04:33,671 --> 01:04:36,423
We'll use Cerebro.

483
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,306
Come on.

484
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,477
How far are we?

485
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:00,488
We're actually coming up
on the mansion now.

486
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:04,742
I've got two signals approaching.

487
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:08,162
Coming in fast.

488
01:05:09,247 --> 01:05:10,331
Unidentified aircraft,
you are ordered to descend to 20,000ft.

489
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:19,548
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force
Base. You have ten seconds to comply.

490
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:24,344
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

491
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:27,306
We are coming up alongside you
to escort you to Hanscom Air Force Base.

492
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:33,228
Repeat: Lower your altitude to 20,000ft.
This is your last warning.

493
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:43,321
They're falling back.

494
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:48,826
They're marking us.
They're gonna fire. Hang on.

495
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,832
I gotta shake 'em.

496
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:07,344
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

497
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:16,144
Don't we have any weapons in this heap?

498
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,816
Warning.

499
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,589
Everybody OK back there?

500
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:31,633
Oh my God. There's two of 'em.

501
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:40,392
There's one more.

502
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,786
Jean?

503
01:08:02,455 --> 01:08:04,081
Oh, God.

504
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,335
- Jean?
- It's not me.

505
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,138
When will these people learn how to fly?

506
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,488
Thank you.

507
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:40,424
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

508
01:09:47,723 --> 01:09:52,519
His name is Colonel William Stryker, and
he invaded your mansion for one purpose.

509
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:58,901
He wanted Cerebro.

510
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:02,029
Or enough of it to build one of his own.

511
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:04,573
That doesn't make sense. Stryker
would need the Professor to operate it.

512
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:09,410
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend's still alive.

513
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:13,039
Oh my God.

514
01:10:13,164 --> 01:10:15,124
What are you all so afraid of?

515
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,252
While Cerebro is working, Charles's mind
is connected to every living person on the planet.

516
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:22,965
If he were forced to concentrate hard enough on a
particular group, that's say mutants, for example -

517
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:28,763
he could kill us all.

518
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:31,973
Wait a minute. How would Stryker even know
where to find Cerebro in the first place?

519
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:36,269
Because I told him.

520
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,275
I helped Charles build it, remember?

521
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,654
Mr Stryker has powerful methods
of persuasion,

522
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:50,158
even against a mutant as strong as Charles.

523
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:53,036
- So who is this Stryker anyway?
- He's a military scientist.

524
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:57,916
He spent his whole life
trying to solve the mutant problem.

525
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:02,002
If you want a more intimate perspective,
why don't you ask Wolverine?

526
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:06,882
You don't remember, do you?

527
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:10,261
William Stryker - the only other man I know
who can manipulate adamantium.

528
01:11:10,386 --> 01:11:14,848
The metal on your bones -
it carries his signature.

529
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:19,395
- But the professor...
- The professor trust that you are smart enough to discover this on your own.

530
01:11:20,938 --> 01:11:26,442
He gives you more credit than I do.

531
01:11:26,568 --> 01:11:29,237
Why do you need us?

532
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,656
Mystique has discovered plans of a base that
Stryker's been operating out of for decades.

533
01:11:31,781 --> 01:11:37,704
We know it's where he's building the second
Cerebro, but we don't know where this base is.

534
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:44,168
And I believe one of you might.

535
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:46,671
The Professor already tried.

536
01:11:46,796 --> 01:11:48,840
Once again, you think it's all about you.

537
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:52,259
Hello.

538
01:11:56,763 --> 01:11:58,557
I didn't mean to snoop.

539
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:05,898
Just try and relax.

540
01:12:05,981 --> 01:12:08,317
I'm sorry.

541
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:26,334
- Stryker's at Alkali Lake.
- That's where the Professor sent me.

542
01:12:28,502 --> 01:12:33,216
- There's nothing left.
- Nothing left on the surface, Logan.

543
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:36,761
The base is underground.

544
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:39,347
You OK?

545
01:12:57,155 --> 01:12:59,115
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- How we doin'?

546
01:13:01,993 --> 01:13:04,663
Not good. It looks like four or five hours
before I can get it off the ground.

547
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:09,918
That's not what I meant.

548
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,336
- I'm just worried about Scott.
- I'm worried about you.

549
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:17,675
That was some display of power up there.

550
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,719
- Obviously it wasn't enough.
- Come on.

551
01:13:20,844 --> 01:13:25,641
I love him.

552
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:31,355
Do you?

553
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:35,568
Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan.
They don't take him home.

554
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:42,740
They marry the good guy.

555
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:45,660
I could be the good guy.

556
01:13:45,785 --> 01:13:48,079
- Jean.
- Please.

557
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:57,338
- Don't make me do this.
- Do what?

558
01:13:58,047 --> 01:14:00,592
This.

559
01:14:01,676 --> 01:14:03,636
Excuse me.

560
01:14:13,395 --> 01:14:15,355
They say you can imitate anybody,
even their voice.

561
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:21,361
Even their voice.

562
01:14:21,486 --> 01:14:24,448
Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know?

563
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:28,535
Look like everyone else?

564
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:31,954
Cos we shouldn't have to.

565
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:34,749
Look...

566
01:15:03,777 --> 01:15:05,570
- No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
- What do you want, an apology?

567
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:34,890
You know what I want.

568
01:15:35,015 --> 01:15:37,351
But what do you want?

569
01:15:39,186 --> 01:15:41,564
What do you really want?

570
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:55,326
I want you to get out.

571
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,540
Jesus.

572
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:06,796
- Why don't we get uniforms?
- Yeah, where's ours?

573
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,096
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

574
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:19,182
We love what you've done with your hair.

575
01:16:27,024 --> 01:16:30,152
Come on, let's go.

576
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:35,449
So, they say you're the bad guy.

577
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,666
Is that what they say?

578
01:16:47,919 --> 01:16:50,421
It's a dorky-looking helmet.
What's it for?

579
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:56,677
This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing
that's gonna protect me from the real bad guys.

580
01:16:56,802 --> 01:17:02,725
What's your name?

581
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:10,191
John.

582
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:12,108
What's your real name, John?

583
01:17:13,026 --> 01:17:15,612
Pyro.

584
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:23,328
Quite a talent you have there, Pyro.

585
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:25,789
I can only manipulate the fire.

586
01:17:25,914 --> 01:17:28,917
I can't create it.

587
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:31,169
You are a god among insects.
Never let anyone tell you different.

588
01:17:31,294 --> 01:17:36,550
Sir, the machine has been completed
to all specifications.

589
01:17:56,569 --> 01:18:01,198
Good.

590
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:02,950
If I may ask, sir,
why are we keeping the children here?

591
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:10,498
I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman.

592
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:14,043
When I build a machine,
I wanna make sure that it's working.

593
01:18:14,168 --> 01:18:18,381
All right, this is a topographic map
of the dam. This is the spillway.

594
01:18:24,971 --> 01:18:29,267
See these density changes in the terrain?
They're tire tracks.

595
01:18:29,392 --> 01:18:32,853
That's the entrance.

596
01:18:32,978 --> 01:18:35,147
And this shows the depth of the ice
covering the ground.

597
01:18:35,272 --> 01:18:38,400
- This is recent water activity.
- If we go in there, Stryker could flood the spillway.

598
01:18:38,525 --> 01:18:44,031
- Can you teleport inside?
- No.

599
01:18:44,156 --> 01:18:46,491
I have to be able to see where I'm going,
otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

600
01:18:46,617 --> 01:18:52,206
I'll go.

601
01:18:52,331 --> 01:18:54,458
I've a hunch he'll want me alive.

602
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:57,335
Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs to be
able to operate the spillway mechanism.

603
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,963
What do you intend to do?

604
01:19:01,088 --> 01:19:03,424
Scratch it with your claws?

605
01:19:03,549 --> 01:19:06,385
- I'll take my chances.
- But I won't.

606
01:19:07,428 --> 01:19:10,389
Sir, there's someone
coming down the spillway.

607
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,872
- I'm flooding it.
- Wait.

608
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,504
Well, look who's come home.

609
01:20:03,774 --> 01:20:06,026
Move, and you're dead.

610
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:21,916
The one thing I know better than anyone
is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it.

611
01:20:52,404 --> 01:20:57,075
Seal the room. Step away.

612
01:20:57,201 --> 01:20:59,453
- We have a metamorph at loose. Could be anybody.
- Anybody?

613
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:19,388
- Can you override the spillway mechanism?
- Everything is controled from inside that room.

614
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:34,403
- That's why the doors are so thick.
- Oh, really?

615
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,947
Get some charges. Blow the doors open.

616
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:40,742
Take out these cameras.

617
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:44,329
I'm in.

618
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,875
- She's good.
- You have no idea.

619
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,504
Fire in the hole.

620
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:06,809
Move. Move. Move.

621
01:22:12,731 --> 01:22:14,692
Seagent, she's opened the spillway doors.
More mutants have entered the base.

622
01:22:31,374 --> 01:22:35,295
- How many?
- We've lost comms. There's some sort of electrical interference.

623
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:39,757
Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of your men
and meet me outside Cerebro.

624
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:46,848
Welcome, Professor.

625
01:22:59,109 --> 01:23:02,112
Don't leave me alone. Please?

626
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:05,032
You can come inside.

627
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:07,784
Have you found it?

628
01:24:02,295 --> 01:24:03,922
A large portion of energy from the dam
has been diverted to this chamber.

629
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:07,842
- Cerebro.
- There it is.

630
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:10,178
- Can you shut it down from here?
- No.

631
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:12,722
- Come. There's little time.
- Not without us.

632
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:16,476
Oh my God. The children.

633
01:24:19,311 --> 01:24:22,231
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.

634
01:24:22,356 --> 01:24:24,900
- Where are they?
- They are being held in the containmant cell one level down.

635
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:28,988
All right, we'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

636
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:34,702
Ok, I'll try to find Scott and the Professor.

637
01:24:34,827 --> 01:24:37,705
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

638
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:41,959
Where's Logan?

639
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:45,461
He's gone.

640
01:24:50,508 --> 01:24:52,385
You. Set up a perimeter.

641
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:56,681
It's time.

642
01:25:45,019 --> 01:25:47,063
Time to find our friends.

643
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:55,446
Is it time to find our friends?

644
01:26:00,785 --> 01:26:02,912
All of them.

645
01:26:04,037 --> 01:26:06,164
All of the mutants.

646
01:26:06,289 --> 01:26:08,959
Everywhere.

647
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:11,086
- Everywhere.
- That's right.

648
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,673
- Every one of them?
- Oh yes.

649
01:26:14,798 --> 01:26:17,801
Good.

650
01:26:17,926 --> 01:26:19,553
It's time to bring it to an end.

651
01:26:20,428 --> 01:26:23,598
Make me proud.

652
01:26:25,976 --> 01:26:27,936
Just don't move.

653
01:26:55,838 --> 01:26:59,299
Kill anyone who approaches.

654
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:03,970
Even if it's me.

655
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:06,472
Go! I'll take care of him.

656
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,957
This is one lovers' quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

657
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:37,669
- Help us, anybody!
- Listen.

658
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:56,521
- Help!
- Get us out of here.

659
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,856
- Kimberly?
- Storm.

660
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:00,733
Ok, we're coming.

661
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,818
Scott, don't do this.

662
01:28:39,312 --> 01:28:41,815
Jean, no no no,
it's OK. It's me.

663
01:29:34,324 --> 01:29:37,409
- Scott.
- I'm so sorry.

664
01:29:38,452 --> 01:29:40,537
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Oh, God.

665
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,500
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself. I tried.

666
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:49,755
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

667
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,175
- My leg.
- Easy, easy.

668
01:29:56,178 --> 01:29:58,430
Scott, something's wrong.

669
01:30:02,475 --> 01:30:04,602
My God.
No.

670
01:30:13,778 --> 01:30:15,738
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

671
01:30:19,825 --> 01:30:24,789
I'm trying. There are so many of them.

672
01:30:24,914 --> 01:30:27,500
Then concentrate.

673
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:30,460
The tricky thing about adamantium is...

674
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:40,503
that if you ever manage
to process its raw, liquid form,

675
01:32:40,628 --> 01:32:46,800
you gotta keep it that way.

676
01:32:46,925 --> 01:32:49,344
Keep it hot.

677
01:32:50,178 --> 01:32:52,848
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

678
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:56,852
But you already know that.

679
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:01,857
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

680
01:33:03,483 --> 01:33:07,320
I was wrong.

681
01:33:10,906 --> 01:33:13,117
Holy shit.

682
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,679
That's it.

683
01:35:18,488 --> 01:35:20,824
- Pal, where do you think you're going?
- I'm sick of this kids' table shit, I'm going in there.

684
01:35:22,825 --> 01:35:26,370
John, they told us to stay here.

685
01:35:26,495 --> 01:35:29,165
You always do as you're told?

686
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:32,251
Find all the mutants.
All of them. Find them.

687
01:36:32,476 --> 01:36:36,855
Find all the mutants.
Everywhere. Each one. All of them.

688
01:36:38,398 --> 01:36:41,901
Good. Kill them.

689
01:36:42,026 --> 01:36:43,903
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.

690
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,452
Now find them all. Find all the mutants.
Concentrate harder. Each and every one.

691
01:37:35,578 --> 01:37:42,084
Find all the mutants.
Kill them all. Find them all. Kill them.

692
01:37:42,209 --> 01:37:47,047
Cerebro...

693
01:37:49,717 --> 01:37:52,011
We're too late.

694
01:37:52,136 --> 01:37:55,139
Eric, hurry.

695
01:38:04,105 --> 01:38:06,191
That's strange.

696
01:38:53,987 --> 01:38:55,947
How does it look from there, Charles?
Still fighting the good fight?

697
01:39:34,109 --> 01:39:38,822
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

698
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:44,953
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

699
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:48,164
There's been a change of plan.

700
01:40:25,158 --> 01:40:27,535
Goodbye, Charles.

701
01:40:46,762 --> 01:40:48,722
There's been a change of plans.

702
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,324
Now find them. Focus. Find them all.
The humans. Find all of them.

703
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:13,120
Every one.

704
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:15,915
How does it feel, bum?

705
01:41:34,516 --> 01:41:36,810
- Why did you come back?
- You cut me open. You took my life.

706
01:41:40,021 --> 01:41:43,400
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

707
01:41:43,525 --> 01:41:47,070
As I recall, it was you
who volunteered for the procedure.

708
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:51,533
Who am I?

709
01:41:51,658 --> 01:41:53,285
You are just a failed experiment.

710
01:41:53,368 --> 01:41:58,081
If you really knew about your past -

711
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:04,211
what kind of person you were,
the work we did together...

712
01:42:04,336 --> 01:42:08,799
People don't change, Wolverine.
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

713
01:42:10,426 --> 01:42:15,848
I just gave you claws.

714
01:42:15,931 --> 01:42:18,601
What the hell is that?

715
01:42:42,248 --> 01:42:44,209
- What is it?
- The dam's ruptured.

716
01:42:44,334 --> 01:42:47,712
It's gonna flood water into this spillway.
It's trying to relieve the pressure.

717
01:42:47,837 --> 01:42:52,592
It's too late. In a few minutes
we'll all be underwater.

718
01:42:52,717 --> 01:42:57,095
Come with me,
and I'll tell you all you wanna know.

719
01:42:57,179 --> 01:42:59,848
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

720
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:04,019
You're a survivor.

721
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,563
Always have been.

722
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,941
I thought I was just an animal with claws.

723
01:43:09,441 --> 01:43:13,195
If we die, you die.

724
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:19,368
There are no answers that way, Wolverine.

725
01:43:28,334 --> 01:43:30,920
Find all the humans. Each and every one.

726
01:43:31,337 --> 01:43:35,049
Find them. Find all the humans. Kill them.

727
01:43:35,174 --> 01:43:38,636
- What is this?
- Cerebro.

728
01:43:41,973 --> 01:43:44,725
- Jean, are you OK?
- I'm fine.

729
01:43:49,312 --> 01:43:52,065
What's happening?

730
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,817
Professor's still in there, with another mutant.
He's trapped in some kind of illusion.

731
01:43:53,942 --> 01:44:00,031
Oh, my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants any more.

732
01:44:00,991 --> 01:44:05,662
- Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

733
01:44:05,787 --> 01:44:09,666
Impossible.

734
01:44:26,682 --> 01:44:28,642
- Everybody stand back.
- Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro.

735
01:44:55,668 --> 01:44:59,088
Opening the door could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

736
01:44:59,214 --> 01:45:02,509
Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside.

737
01:45:02,634 --> 01:45:05,845
Storm, who is this guy? Who are you?

738
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:08,013
My name is Kurt Wagner,
but in the Munich Circus...

739
01:45:08,138 --> 01:45:10,891
He's a teleporter.

740
01:45:11,016 --> 01:45:13,227
I told you. If I can't see where I'm going...

741
01:45:13,352 --> 01:45:17,105
I have faith in you.

742
01:45:17,231 --> 01:45:19,483
Don't believe anything you see in there.

743
01:45:22,653 --> 01:45:25,864
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

744
01:45:30,244 --> 01:45:34,038
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth...

745
01:45:34,163 --> 01:45:37,083
as it is in heaven.

746
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,545
Hello.

747
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,266
What are you looking for?

748
01:45:54,934 --> 01:45:57,603
Professor, can you hear me?

749
01:45:59,272 --> 01:46:02,274
You've got to stop Cerebro now.

750
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:04,651
Who are you talking to?

751
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:08,321
No, don't move.

752
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,533
But she's just a little girl.

753
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:14,327
No, she's not.

754
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:16,371
I've got my eyes on you.

755
01:46:19,124 --> 01:46:21,877
Funny we keep running into each other.

756
01:46:30,468 --> 01:46:33,387
Mark my words, it'll never happen again.

757
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:36,557
Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here.

758
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:43,647
I'm not going anywhere.

759
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:46,859
What are you doing?

760
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,449
Find all the humans.
Kill them. Every single one of them.

761
01:47:32,402 --> 01:47:36,698
Focus. Find all the humans.

762
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:41,578
Stop it!

763
01:47:51,087 --> 01:47:53,256
Jason.

764
01:48:01,931 --> 01:48:03,891
He's gonna be so angry at me.

765
01:48:04,934 --> 01:48:07,103
Logan, where are you?

766
01:48:34,629 --> 01:48:38,425
We have to get out through the spillway.

767
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,914
You don't wanna go that way. Trust me.

768
01:49:49,535 --> 01:49:52,412
Come on, there's another way out of here.

769
01:50:02,505 --> 01:50:05,341


770
01:50:38,248 --> 01:50:40,625


771
01:51:01,061 --> 01:51:02,730


772
01:51:23,833 --> 01:51:26,669
It's OK, Rogue, it's OK.
You can let go, honey. Let go.

773
01:51:53,737 --> 01:51:58,033
- Go. I'll be fine.
- You sure?

774
01:51:58,117 --> 01:52:00,494
Who has the answers, Wolverine?

775
01:52:14,465 --> 01:52:16,676
Those people?

776
01:52:17,552 --> 01:52:19,595
That creature on your arms?

777
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,889
I'll take my chances with him.

778
01:52:37,738 --> 01:52:40,115
One day someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine.

779
01:52:42,075 --> 01:52:46,288
One day!
One day!

780
01:52:46,413 --> 01:52:48,373
Scott, we've got to get to Washington.

781
01:52:58,842 --> 01:53:01,303
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

782
01:53:04,181 --> 01:53:07,266
- Bobby.
- I got him.

783
01:53:09,852 --> 01:53:11,812


784
01:53:13,522 --> 01:53:15,483
You OK?

785
01:53:16,525 --> 01:53:18,486
I am now.

786
01:53:25,493 --> 01:53:27,745
- What's wrong?
- Vertical thrusters off line.

787
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:31,081
- So fix it. - I'm trying.
- Has anyone seen John?

788
01:53:31,207 --> 01:53:33,958
Pyro? Where the hell is he?

789
01:53:34,083 --> 01:53:36,586
He's with Magneto.

790
01:53:42,467 --> 01:53:44,344
Come on.

791
01:53:44,469 --> 01:53:46,930
Oh, no. We've lost the power.

792
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:00,734
There's power in the fuel cells...

793
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,159
- Storm, we need some kind of external power.
- Jean?

794
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:55,120
Wait, here's Jean?

795
01:54:55,745 --> 01:54:57,998
She's outside.

796
01:55:09,593 --> 01:55:10,802


797
01:55:11,845 --> 01:55:14,181
No, we're not leaving.
Lower the ramp.

798
01:55:28,235 --> 01:55:30,821
Storm, lower it.

799
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:32,323
I can't.

800
01:55:54,302 --> 01:55:57,222
She's controlling the jet.

801
01:56:01,976 --> 01:56:05,605
- You, get her, now.
- She's not letting me.

802
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:06,940
Dammit.

803
01:56:14,488 --> 01:56:17,157
I know what I'm doing.

804
01:56:17,282 --> 01:56:19,243
This is...
... the only way.

805
01:56:21,787 --> 01:56:23,455
Jean...

806
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,541
Listen to me.

807
01:56:26,959 --> 01:56:28,627
Don't do this.

808
01:56:28,752 --> 01:56:31,338
- Goodbye.
- Oh, no, no.

809
01:56:59,282 --> 01:57:01,492
She's gone.

810
01:57:04,745 --> 01:57:07,914
Don't say that. We gotta go back.

811
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:10,000
- She's gone.
- No! No!

812
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,563
She's gone.

813
01:57:49,246 --> 01:57:52,541
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want. "

814
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:56,170
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures. "

815
01:57:56,295 --> 01:58:00,006
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of the death,

816
01:58:00,131 --> 01:58:04,177
I will fear no evil,

817
01:58:04,302 --> 01:58:06,763
for thou art with me. "

818
01:58:19,442 --> 01:58:24,364
"Today I I've been given the opportunity to shed light on recent occurrences from the attack that ended in this office... "

819
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:29,243
good morning "... to the unexplained phenomenon that
swept the Earth, nearly annihilating our way of life. "

820
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:31,411
Good morning.
Do we like this word "annihilating"?

821
01:58:33,997 --> 01:58:35,958
Good morning.

822
01:58:38,043 --> 01:58:41,213
- Good morning, Mr President.
- Thank you.

823
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:52,014
Mr President, we're live in five,
four, three, two...

824
01:58:55,017 --> 01:59:01,399
My fellow Americans, in this time of adversity
we are being offered a moment.

825
01:59:01,524 --> 01:59:04,735
A moment to recognise
a growing threat within our own population

826
01:59:04,861 --> 01:59:08,990
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

827
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:17,790
Did we just lose the feed? Are we still live?

828
01:59:52,114 --> 01:59:54,658
Good morning, Mr President.

829
01:59:56,744 --> 02:00:00,498
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

830
02:00:01,082 --> 02:00:03,292
Who are you people?

831
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:06,337
We're mutants.
My name is Charles Xavier.

832
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:09,256
- Please, sit down.
- I'd rather stand.

833
02:00:12,133 --> 02:00:17,138
These files were taken from
the private offices of William Stryker.

834
02:00:26,272 --> 02:00:28,399
How did you get this?

835
02:00:28,525 --> 02:00:34,114
Well, let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

836
02:00:42,287 --> 02:00:44,581
- I've never seen this information.
- I know.

837
02:00:44,706 --> 02:00:50,379
- And you also know I don't respond to threats.
- Mr President, this is not a threat. This is an opportunity.

838
02:00:50,462 --> 02:00:55,968
There are forces in this world, both mutant and
human alike, who believe a war is coming.

839
02:00:57,428 --> 02:01:02,015
You will see from those files
that some have already tried to start one.

840
02:01:02,141 --> 02:01:07,478
And there have been casualties,
losses on both sides.

841
02:01:16,446 --> 02:01:20,199
What you are about to tell the world is true.
This is a moment.

842
02:01:20,324 --> 02:01:26,956
A moment to repeat the mistakes of the past,
or to work together for a better future.

843
02:01:27,874 --> 02:01:30,418
We're here to stay, Mr President.

844
02:01:30,543 --> 02:01:32,711
The next move is yours.

845
02:01:33,712 --> 02:01:36,131
We'll be watching.

846
02:02:24,512 --> 02:02:31,935
You know, even when Jean was a student,
she was always hesitant about her powers.

847
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:34,521
Always looking to others.

848
02:02:36,272 --> 02:02:41,820
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

849
02:02:49,077 --> 02:02:51,578
Could we have done more to save her?

850
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,042
In the past, she may have let us.

851
02:02:58,001 --> 02:03:00,754
There had to be another way.

852
02:03:00,838 --> 02:03:03,215
Why did she leave the plane?

853
02:03:06,427 --> 02:03:09,513
Because she made a choice.

854
02:03:12,099 --> 02:03:14,476
Yes, come on in.

855
02:03:29,282 --> 02:03:30,950
Listen.

856
02:03:31,075 --> 02:03:33,411
She did make a choice.

857
02:03:35,288 --> 02:03:37,248
It was you.

858
02:04:10,322 --> 02:04:12,698
Professor?

859
02:04:12,823 --> 02:04:14,784
Is everything all right?

860
02:04:17,703 --> 02:04:20,456
Yes, I think it will be.

861
02:04:20,581 --> 02:04:27,213
Now, tell me, have any of you read a book
by an English novelist named TH White

862
02:04:27,338 --> 02:04:29,882
called The Once and Future King?

863
02:04:38,807 --> 02:04:42,602
Mutation: It is the key to our evolution.

864
02:04:42,727 --> 02:04:45,688
It is how we have evolved
from a single-celled organism

865
02:04:45,814 --> 02:04:48,817
into the dominant species on the planet.

866
02:04:48,942 --> 02:04:54,280
This process is slow, normally taking
thousands and thousands of years.

867
02:04:54,364 --> 02:05:00,203
But every few hundred millennia
evolution leaps forward.

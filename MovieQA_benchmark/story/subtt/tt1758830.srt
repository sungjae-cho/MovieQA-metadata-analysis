13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,395
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

I thought it
would make it better.

15

It was better.
It takes some of
the pressure off.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,233
Because you can't get
hard without a Viagra?

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,072
Is it because you
don't think I'm sexy?

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,639
I thought you'd
think it was fun

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,313
for me to
super-size it for once.

20

you could ever give someone.

All right, you know what?
I'll be honest with you.

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,472
Lately, my penis hasn't
been getting as hard
as it used to, all right?

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,118
And it's kind of
freaked me out.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,909
I don't know whether or not
it's because I'm getting older
or I'm losing testosterone.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,238
No, it's what I told you.
Your artery to your heart
is clogged

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,359
because you eat so much
junk food, and you have
high cholesterol,

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,670
and that is directly
related to your penis vein.

Where'd you get
my penis vein?

36

There was a whole
Dr. Oz about it.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,037
Cholesterol is not
clogging my penis vein.

Maybe I can't
get a hard-on fully

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,999

I keep my phone
in my front pocket,

40

I'll give you that.
That makes sense.

00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,273
so everything's
just kind of...
(WHISTLES)

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,153
She's numb down there.

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,351
I could sit down
hard on a fire hydrant,

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,353
and I wouldn't even
know that I was sitting.

175
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,831
I could get stung by
a hornet down there,
and I would not feel it.

176
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,957
You could put
anything in there,

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,788
and I would not know
what the object was.

178
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,837
I used to pee
in a nice stream,

179
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,229
and now it just kind of goes
like a shower head.

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,072
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

181
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,556
I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

182
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,594
No, I think
I want to Clooney it.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,393
Clooney it?
Yup.

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,595
He doesn't seem happy.

185
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,349
Yeah, he is.

186
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,998
No, he's lonely.

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,155
No, he's not.

188
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,073
See, I think
he has sad eyes.

189
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,311
You sweet little thing, no.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,597
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
to get the next lady.

191
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,830
Look, I can do it, too.
Watch.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,036
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

193
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,156
Just him and his pig.

194
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,037
You'd fuck him.
I wouldn't.

195
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,235
So would you.
I would.

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,514
I wouldn't feel it,
but I would.

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,158
You'd fuck him
with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,992
Ocean's Thirteen Inches,
that's what you'd find out.
(LAUGHING)

199
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,115
Do you think?

200
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,638
I mean,
that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

201
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,392
That's the one
thing you don't do,

202
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,630
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,517
I think that's even
on the warning label.

204
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,110
We're in one of
those phases where

205
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,636
everything that
the other person says

206
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,597
just annoys
the shit out of each other.

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,478
All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it.

208
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,232
You just gotta
ride that out.

209
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,999
This sounds terrible.

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,672
Okay, I like it.

211
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,028
But...

212
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,591
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like if, say,

213
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,271
you were separated
by something bigger.

214
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,873
Like death? Like her death?

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,431
I have given it
a fair amount of thought.

216
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,076
Not in a painful way,
just quietly slid into death.

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,354
Like a gas leak.

218
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,237
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,197
I mean, this is the mother
of your children.

220
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,958
You want her to die...

221
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,354
No, I'd want it
to be a peaceful...

222
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,714
...gentle, you know.

223
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,679
Yeah, just like drift
into a coma from which
she never awakens.

224
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,637
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

225
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,996
That's just it,
people love widowers.

226
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,870
They love widowers.
It's like the polar
opposite of divorced guys.

227
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,949
It's the best.

228
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,758
It's like,
"Oh, that poor widower.

229
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,552
"If I could only
make him happy."

230
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,150
"Somehow, ease his pain."

231
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,231
"Cock-suck
away his sadness."

Do you know that this song,
Pixies did this song,

235
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,592
it's about a Salvador Dali
short film called
Un Chien Andalusia.

236
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,398
This music doesn't
make people happy.

237
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,711
This song kicks off Doolittle,
one of the best albums
of the last 30 years.

Look how angry you get
while listening to it.

I only watched 11.
But I have eight more,

114.

to pay attention
to the numbers

$12,000 unaccounted for.

I think it's probably Desi.

She's been having
a really hard time
using these simple computers.

278
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,754
It's because she's stupid.

It's all dark up there.

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,356
Why are you looking?

I just said, "Hey, whoa."
And there it was.

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,996
Maybe she's wearing
dark underwear.

294

that has a picture of
a vagina painted on it.

too late for this dump,

You know, when I
first started this label,

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,958
my dream was to work
with musicians and bands

343
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,270

I just admired so much.

The person that I thought,
"My God, wouldn 't it be
incredible to work with, "

was Graham Parker.

listen to a song

about something depressing,

355
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,160
don't you relate to it?
No.

It makes you feel
the same as they...

357

a part of the human race.

358

I don't feel like that.

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,719
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

510
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,319
Frank Black record
did all right.

511
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,833
The Haircut One Hundred,
not so much.

512
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,354
We have to break
this record. Otherwise,
we're not here next year.

513
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,272
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

514
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,475
Hey, guys, how are you?

515
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,549
Good, man.

516
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,358
Aren't cookies the best?
Yeah.

517
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,274
Jewish Journal guy
loves the record.

518
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,395
Great!

519
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,835
Got a bit of
a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

520
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,515
Gout?

521
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,154
My whole family,
they all had gout.

522
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,879
Jesus.
That's very unfortunate.

523
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,111
My auntie Queenie,
she had a foot like this.

524
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,112
It's like a size
of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

525
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,714
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

526
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,438
And a couple of
bunions as well.

527
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,555
Fuck.

528
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,153
I've got to go
to the podiatrist,

529
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,832
and I hope he can
shoot me up with something.

530
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,354
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

531
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,272
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham.

532
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,754
Good luck with your gout.

533
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,193
Rock and roll, baby.

534
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,554
The happiest period
in people's lives
is from age 40 to 60.

535
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,791
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,592
It's true.
Says who?

537
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,353
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that.
Oh!

538
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,468
We have everything
we need right now
to be completely happy.

539
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,748
We're going to blink,
and be 90.
What?

540
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

541
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,279
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,588
Your eyes are
kind of glazing over.

543
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,272
No, I'm processing it all.

544
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,748
Some of these,
I wrote for you.

545
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,797
So, we have to
exercise every day.
Mmm.

546
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,677
Spend more time
alone together.

547
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,870
And we have to go
to the therapist, every week.

548
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,399
It's a little pricey.

549
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,233
No stressing over tiny things.

550
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,112
Yeah, that's good.
You should do that.
Mm-hmm.

551
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,151
We have to get more
involved in school.

552
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,432
Yeah.
Have more
patience with the kids.

553
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,397
And we need to
work on our anger.

554
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,949
Yeah, I think it would be
good if you could take
care of your anger.

555
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,315
No, I said both of us.

556
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,549
That's what I said.
Our anger.

557
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,310
Okay, and no more smoking.

558
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,709
Yeah, you gotta
cut that out.

559
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,479
I don't want to make
this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

560
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,229
Yeah. Sorry.

561
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,232
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

562
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,356
We have to just let that go.

563
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,078
So, you're saying
that if we're arguing,

564
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,878
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

565
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,359
And not throw it
back in my face later?

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,592
Well, I don't do that,

567
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,355
but I will continue
not to do that.

568
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,754
And what did you write?

569
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,911
All of that.
That's plenty.
That's a lot.

570
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,510
And you're going
to eat better?

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,716
Oh, yeah.
I've been doing
a decent job.

572
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,279
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

573
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,919
with having some
fries every now and again.

574
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,473
And then I'll smoke that day.

575
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,916
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.

576
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,115
I like fries.

577
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,431
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

578
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,830
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

579
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,912
because that puts a lot
of pressure on you,
and stress,

580
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,712
and then
the whole family feels it.
(STRUMS INSTRUMENT)

581
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,995
And he is a grown man,
and he's not our
responsibility.

582
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,551
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

583
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,638
No. No, I haven't
been giving him money.

584
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,119
I haven't done that
for years. I told you.

585
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,634
Can you please put that down?

586
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,712
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

587
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,552
You sure you don't want
to just do a joint
birthday party?

588
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,629
No.

589
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,914
We always used to.
No.

590
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,673
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

591
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,548
Are you serious?

592
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,949
How much?
$12,000.

593
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,995
Oh, God.

594
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,235
And Desi's taking it?

595
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,469
Well, I don't know.

596
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,874
That's what Jodi said.

597
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,918
We really need
the store to work.

598
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,673
It is.

599
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,797
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

600
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,631
No, no. It's not
what I mean. I'm just...

601
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,672
Are you nervous
about money?

602
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,433
Are we okay?

603
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,238
Yeah.
All right.

604
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,111
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

605
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,589
earning so much more
than any other
employee we have.

606
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,871
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

607
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,951
We're barely
breaking even with her.

608
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,234
That's why we
have to keep her.

609
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,555
Look at this.
She's making
out with somebody.

610
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,508
(GASPS)

611
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,199
Is she screwing him?

612
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,232
PETE: That might be
like a dry hump.

613
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,470
DEBBIE: Look at the position
of her skirt.

614
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,957
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

615
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,269
(GASPING)

616
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,677
Oh, my God. This is in
the middle of the day.
Customers could be in there.

617
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,113
At least
she's getting some.

618
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,397
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

619
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,959
(LAUGHING) Yes.

620
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,474
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

621
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,913
You gotta give me
a little credit for that.

622
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,157
It's not about credit.
It's about...

623
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,151
We need to have
more passion.

624
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,509
Like this.

625
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,354
That's not passionate.

626
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,112
It looks
passionate to me.

627
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,389
What?

628
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,234
(FARTS)

629
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,075
What is she doing?
(FARTS)
Okay.

630
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,195
Oh, my God.

631
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,994
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.

632
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,709
Don't do that.
What am I doing?

633
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,671
Don't fart in the bed.

634
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,472
I'm not. It's the springs.

635
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,272
This is why
we never have sex.

636
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,391
That's disgusting,
you're gross.

637
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,993
I don't know what
you're talking about.

638
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,678
(FARTS CONTINUOUSLY)
You're so...

639
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,988
God!

Charlotte,
I'm doing my homework.

642
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,239
Okay, watch this.
Watch this.

643
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,318
There's a haunted cow
back here.

644
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,757
I'm pretty sure
it does not have milk.

645

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,348

Moo!

648
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,511
See that?
They took me away.

649
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,553
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

650
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,038
Charlotte, how many times
do I have to tell you?

since your body
got weird.

655
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,039
Close the door.

656
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,712
You're no fun.

657
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,190

just a little bit more.

Oh, shit.

Ah!

No, my boob is in there!

662
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,957
Did I tell you
that my son's
going to Stanford?

663
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,237
No, that's great.
Great for us,
and great for him.

664
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,389
Cough again.
Great school.

through your nose.

turn the gas down.

680
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,395
Turn it up!

681
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,914
No, we're going to
turn it down.

682
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,479
Turn it up!

(WINCES) Ooh!

685
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,153
Do you have to breathe
right on my neck?

686
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,434
Sorry.

687
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,678
What are you all
doing for Christmas?

688
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,028
Um, I don't know.

689
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,510
You have a tree
and everything?
Mm-hmm.

690
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,875
Isn't that fun?
In the spirit?

691
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,473
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

692
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,034
On your form,
you said you
were born in 1974,

693
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,237
but your paper, it said '72.
So I just need to
know which it is.

694
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,514
It's 1974.

695
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,157
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

696
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,390
you said that you
were born in 1975.

697
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,280
Didn't you tell me
you were born in 1976?

698
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,396
No. (LAUGHS)
That's funny.

699
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,716
So, you want to
go with 1974?

700
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,391
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974. (LAUGHS)

701
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,069
Okay.

702
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,794
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

703
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,397
It's okay. It's 1976.

704
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,957
I lie about my age, okay?

705
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,272
Okay.
Okay? Okay? Okay?

706
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,958
Okay.
Okay.

707
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,749
You're tightening up.

708
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,239
Oh, my gosh.

by counting the rings.

play with me.

that's because
of the egg donor.

is more than you need.

of a purchase
when you made it.

I'm going to have
to make some changes.

to cut back.

Can't she get a job?

I can't do it.

Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

811
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,191
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

812
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,550
Because Claire wanted a baby.

813
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,076
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

814
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,596
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

when we're doing in vitro,
is winking at me like...

"Don't worry, don't worry."

817
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,948
We were very unlucky.

818
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,076
And now,
we have these three
beautiful children.

819
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,238

tell you something.

wanted you aborted.

Oh. Jesus Christ.

823
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,116
No, no. It's the truth.

824
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,790
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

825
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,595
That's what everybody did.
You did some blow,
had sex, had an abortion.

826
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,194
Really?
Yes.

827
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,191
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

828
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,953
I said, "Let's stop,
have a pizza, talk about it.

829
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,918
"If you still wanna
do it after lunch,
it's okay."

830
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,110
The pizza saved your life.

831
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,590
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

832
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,559
So, how much
do I owe you
for saving my life?

833
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,313
I don't have a number.

like you're giving.

about his 40th birthday party.

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,359
Whatever I can do to help.

840
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,759
Okay. Did you feed them?

841
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,398
I fed half of one.

842
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,799

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,314
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

848
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,518
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

849
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,953
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

850
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,832
that he's really
passionate about.

851
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,109
Hmm.

852
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,788
How's Sadie doing?

853
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,190
The last time I saw her,
she was throwing her
Cheerios on the floor.

854
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,633
(CHUCKLES) What a mess.

855
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,994
Right.

856
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,673
She just got her period.

857
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,189
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

858
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,157
It would be nice to
see more of each other.

859
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,108
Well, we can
certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

860
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,953
That would be nice.
Mm-hmm. It would.

861
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,637
Do you have a day
that is better...
A good day?

862
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,348
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

863
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,432
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

864
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,750
Right, right.
I mean, we're both so busy.

865
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,435
I have young children,
you have young children.

866
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,149
I don't think we should
judge ourselves too
harshly about that.

867
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,153
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

868
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,358
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

869
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,989
And then, we can spend
more time together,
it'd be nice.

870
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,474
It'd be nice.

871
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,798
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

872
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,553
Oh. Yeah.

873
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,913
This is Kel, my son.

874
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,150
He's handsome. He's 13?
Mm-hmm.

875
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,473
And that's Alexandra,
my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

876
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,512
A lot like you.

877
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,877
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

878
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,437
Excuse me, dear,
I gotta go to the restroom.

879
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,552
Be right back.
Okay.

880
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,878
Daddy and I are
making some changes

881
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,951
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

882
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,359
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

883
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,710
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?

884
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,949
What is that,
grilled cheeses?

885
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,436
No, baked tofu.
Oh.

886
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,193
It's actually really tasty.

887
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,510
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

888
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,036
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

889
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,599
without dressing.

890
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,837
No, dressing always
gets in the way of the
natural taste of the lettuce.

891
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,036
And another
thing we've decided

892
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,750
is to cut back on
all of the electronics we use.

893
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,639
Basically,
what we're going to do,
is get rid of the Wi-Fi

894
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,557
and only use the computer...

895
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,710
What?
...from 8:00
to 8:30 at night.

896
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,153
How are we gonna
go on the computer?

897
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,595
We're gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

898
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,272
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

899
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,033
You can't do this.
You can't take away
the Wi-Fi.

900
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,475
No Wi-Fi!
A-ha-ha.

901
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,278
You don't spend
enough time with the family

902
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,239
when you're constantly
on your iPhone
and your computer.

903
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,756
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

904
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,671
So, you won't see
me after five years?

905
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,149
No, but you won't
be living with us.

906
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,992
And you should get to
know your little sister.

907
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,997
PETE: You've got
the perfect friend,
right here.

908
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,957
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

909
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,316
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

910
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,119
I don't wanna hang out
with her when I'm in my 20s.

911
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,553
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

912
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,438
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

913
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,433
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build
a fort outside.

914
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,795
What?
Yeah, build a fort.

915
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,279
Play with your
friends and have...

916
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,079
Make a fort? Outside?

917
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,475
And do what?

918
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,357
Do what in the fort?

919
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,638
When I was a kid,
we used to build tree houses
and play with sticks.

920
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,315
Nobody plays with sticks.

921
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,074
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

922
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,389
Play kick the can.

923
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,913
Look for dead bodies.

924
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,553
It's fun. That's fun to do.

925
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,308
Get a tire and then
just take a stick and
run down a street with it.

926
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,073
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

927
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,679
You don't need technology.

928
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,398
No technology!

929
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,555
Charlotte, put that down.

930
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,838
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

931
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,279
I don't do anything bad.

932
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,679
Nobody said you were bad.

933
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,318
I don't do things
I'm not supposed to.

934
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,072
I don't illegally
download music.

935
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,991
I don't look at
porn like Wendy.

936
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,152
She is up to no good.
She's not allowed
to come over here anymore.

937
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,229
What's porn?

938
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,355
No, she said "corn."

939
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,749
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

940
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,909
I'm not hungry.

941
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,197
No computer.
Listen to your mom.

942
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,753
I need to use it
for my homework.

943
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,829
(SADIE SLAMS DOOR)

944
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,239
She's outplaying us.

945
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,389
I know. She's tough.

946
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,791
DEBBIE: This is the best
birthday present.

947
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,915
PETE: It's good to get away.

948
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,592
We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

949
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,671
I know.
If we're happy,
they're happy.

950
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,876
Yeah, I mean,
I can't take it.

951
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,150
With the hormones,
and the crying.

952
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,037
Jesus.
And "do my homework."

953
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,269
Them's lil' bitches.

954
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,875
Them's lil' bitches.
Bugging us for
shit all the time.

955
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,190
And they never
appreciate anything.

956
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,192
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

957
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,474
(LAUGHING)

958
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,872
Aw, I feel bad.
I love them.

959
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,995
I know.

960
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,680
DEBBIE: I miss them already.
Should we go home?

961
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,235
PETE: Nah.

962
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,955
Why do we fight?

963
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,393
I don't know,
it makes no sense.

964
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,708
It makes no sense.

965
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,598
When we get in a fight,

966
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,752
Iook at my eyes and let's
remember this moment,
right now,

967
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,398
and know that we
never have to fight.

968
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,598
But you're such
a dick sometimes.

969
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,033
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

970
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,436
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

971
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,831
Thank you for admitting that.

972
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,674
And you get so mad at me,
I feel like you
want to kill me.

973
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,472
I do want to kill you.

974
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,869
How would you do it?

975
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,030
I don't know. I'd poison you.

976
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,154
I'd poison your cupcakes
that you pretend
not to eat every day.

977
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,038
And just put enough in
to just slowly weaken you.

978
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,109
I love it.

979
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,156
I would enjoy our
last few months together.
Me too.

980
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,789
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

981
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,711
And I could
take care of you...

982
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,154
But while killing you.

983
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,271
See, you know
what I love about us?

984
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,793
You can still surprise me.

985
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,997
I figured,
for sure, you'd knock me out
with one fell swoop of poison.

986
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,389
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

987
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,754
(LAUGHS)

988
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,313
Have you ever
thought about killing me?

989
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,435
Oh, yeah.
Really?

990
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,509
Sure.

991
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,874
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.

992
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,473
A wood chipper?
Yeah.

993
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,629
A wood chipper.

994
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,835
Yeah.

995
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,989
Wow.

996
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,399
I know. Did you see Fargo?.

997
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,515
Yeah.

998
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,794
(WHOOSHES)

999
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,229
Ugh.

1000
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,312
That's a bad plan.
The cupcakes is
a way better plan.

1001
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,594
It is. You're right.

1002
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,398
You know what?
I won't murder you.

1003
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,754
Aw!

1004
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,668
I love you.

1005
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,229
I love you, too.

1006
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,428
Do you know what I brought?
What?

1007
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,074
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to
me last Christmas.

1008
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,309
What?

1009
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,395
Yeah. I brought it.
You did?

1010
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,515
Chocolate chip kooky.

1011
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,589
Should we do it?

1012
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,638
Let's eat the cookie
and then we'll order
a bunch of cheeseburgers.

1013
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,472
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

1014
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,036
Just get all of it.
You deserve it,
you really do.

1015
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,719
Wouldn't you
rather have me around

1016
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,872
for less years
and I'm incredibly happy,
than longer and miserable?

1017
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,868
Yes, and I just
realized that right now.

1018
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,109
Go get the cookie.
I'm getting the cookie.

1019
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,633
Go get the cookie.

1020
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,955
Ow!

1021
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,672
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

1022
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,278
Yeah. Should we
get a block of porn?

1023
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,635
I don't think we
need 24 hours of porn.

1024
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,269
But you know, two porns
costs just about as much
as a 24-hour block.

1025
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,959
I think that's
too much porn.

1026
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,670
We don't have to watch it all,
but for the value,
it makes sense.

1027
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,834
How much are we
supposed to eat?

1028
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,990
I don't know.
I think six or
seven cookies, right?

1029
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,788
Plus, it's old,
it probably has
lost some of its...

1030
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,552
Potency.

1031
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,950
We should have sex more.

1032
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,076
I mean,
girls have it so easy.

1033
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,550
You just show up
with your sexual organs
and you're good to go.

1034
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,868
All the pressure
is on the guy.

1035
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,949
It's true.

1036
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,998
And I look at guys...
Like, I look at a guy
like Prince,

1037
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,399
and you know that guy fucks.

1038
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,469
Yeah.

1039
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,909
I know I don't
fuck like Prince.
Uh-uh.

1040
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,274
Prince can fuck.
Uh-huh.

1041
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,072
I fuck like David Schwimmer.

1042
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,918
(BOTH LAUGH)

1043
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,519
You do.

1044
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,514
You know, I fuck
like Ross from Friends.

1045
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,159
Mmm.

1046
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,268
Looks good.

1047
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,674
How does he do it?

1048
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,831
The floating spoon.

1049
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,196
Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

1050
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,353
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

1051
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,234
I ate my dick!

1052
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,917
Kelly, I think
this room has rodents.

1053
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,274
There! Just saw it.

1054
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,551
Have you seen my starfish?

1055
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,036
Where did I put my starfish?

1056
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,189
My God.

1057
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,079
I'm gonna deep
throat this clair.

1058
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,628
I wanna make out
with you so bad.

1059
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,710
I felt like
I was gonna choke!

1060
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,279
(CHUCKLES)

1061
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,633
(SIGHS)

1062
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,073
That was nice.

1063
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,391
Mom, Charlotte's crying

1064
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,072
because she's got
an ear infection again.

1065
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,119
JODI: I didn't know
what to do.

1066
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,108
We're home.

1067
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,032
Are you okay?
(CHARLOTTE CRYING)

1068
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,474
What's the matter?

1069
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,513
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1070
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,111
I told you that pediatrician
didn't know what
he was talking about.

1071
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,276
Come on, you can't
blame it on our doctor.

1072
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,918
Ear infections are
common in little kids.

1073
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,429
Not in kids
over six years old.

1074
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,750
We're going to
the Eastern doctor.

1075
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,956
If she's in this much pain,
then we should
call a real doctor.

1076
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,833
Are you kidding
right now?

1077
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,872
(CHARLOTTE SOBBING)

1078
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,071
I know. Okay. Yup.

1079
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,468
What we should do
is easy and simple.

1080
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,109
No more dairy,
no more wheat,
no more sugar.

1081
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,556
Sugar, wheat
and dairy. Okay.
Yeah.

1082
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,233
What the fuck is left?

1083
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,469
Sorry.

1084
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,036
Isn't everything sugar,
wheat, and dairy?

1085
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,077
She can have
vegetables and fruits.

1086
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,912
(IMITATES DOCTOR)
Oh, but she can eat fruits.

1087
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,479
Fruits. Yeah.

1088
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,868
Any kind of fruit?

1089
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,348
Mangos, pineapple.

1090
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,833
It isn't,
there are safe fruits

1091
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,951
and then there
are unsafe fruits?
No, no.

1092
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,394
What about French fries?

1093
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,159
Could we do
something like that?
Are you okay?

1094
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,197
Would you like to
come on the table?
I'm okay, I'm...

1095
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,674
Why don't you go
on the table?

1096
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,909
PETE: I don't wanna go
on the table.

1097
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,228
No. It looks like you
need to get on the table.

1098
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,469
I don't wanna
get on the table.

1099
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,839
Pete!

1100
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,995
(CAMERA CLICKING)

1101
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,479
PETE: God damn it.

1102
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,389
What are you doing?

1103
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,518
I need you to look at
something. In my butt.

1104
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,352
(CONTINUES CLICKING)

1105
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,389
Why?

1106
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,198
I think I got
something in there,

1107
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,153
and I'm not
limber enough to see.

1108
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,390
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1109
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,718
I think I might have an
anal fissure, or a hemorrhoid,
or a worm or something.

1110
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,113
What are you
doing with your phone?

1111
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,873
I'm trying to take pictures
of it so I can compare it
to something on Google.

1112
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,350
Can we just keep
just a small shred of mystery

1113
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,915
in our relationship, please?

1114
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,156
Look, I saw you
have two babies, okay?

1115
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,873
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1116
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,639
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1117
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,798
Payback time.

1118
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,079
(SIGHS)

1119
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,389
It's a hemorrhoid.

1120
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,548
Thank you.

1121
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,070
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1122
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,830
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1123
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,716
Think. Where do you think?

1124
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,389
I don't want
this to sound harsh,

1125
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,436
but everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1126
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,835
Everything that
goes into it is a dick.

1127
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,752
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1128
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,149
A dick.

1129
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,429
Don't say that.

1130
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,832
I'm sorry.
I'm just being
protective of the store.

1131
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,992
I'm going to go
talk to her.

1132
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,915
Hey, Desi.

1133
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,229
Hi.
Hi.

1134
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,358
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1135
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,869
Uh, yeah.

1136
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,109
It's so nice.

1137
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,315
Do you love it?

1138
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,557
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1139
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,275
Huh.

1140
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,119
Hey, Desi,
would you mind wearing

1141
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,952
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1142
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,076
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1143
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,634
Will that be okay?
Yeah.

1144
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,395
Perfect.

1145
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,879
Good?

1146
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,196
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1147
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,555
Did you?
Yeah.

1148
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,799
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1149
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,753
and then I actually
transferred it to the T-shirt.

1150
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,989
Wow.

1151
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,192
So, you stenciled
on the tiger?

1152
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,191
I drew it on
a piece of paper and then

1153
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,834
I transferred
the drawing to the T-shirt.

1154
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,317
You have an amazing body.

1155
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,595
Really?

1156
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,148
Yes. Are those real?

1157
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,592
My boobs?
Yeah.

1158
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,156
Yeah. Do you wanna
touch them?

1159
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,475
Really?

1160
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,874
Touch them.

1161
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,149
Okay.

1162
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,359
Wow.

1163
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,949
Huh.

1164
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,675
Jesus.

1165
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,432
I mean,
they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1166
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,589
They're like
a memory mattress.

1167
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,391
It's, wow, like
Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1168
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,512
They look amazing.

1169
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,155
My kids just sucked
the meat right out of mine.

1170
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,634
No.
Yeah.

1171
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,789
There's some meat in there.

1172
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,879
My boobs are just gone.
Since I had kids,
my boobs are just gone.

1173
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,713
They didn't even
say goodbye, you know?
They just left.

1174
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,470
By the time I'm 40,
these are gonna
go National Geographic on me.

1175
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,668
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1176
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,754
REALTOR: I think this is
a really good offer
on the house.

1177
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,472
We expected more.

1178
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,073
I know it's a bad market,

1179
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,230
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1180
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,915
I know, but based on what
the market's like, it's like
you're gaining money,

1181
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,558
because it's so much
more than what you deserve.

1182
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,675
But these people are from Iran

1183
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,155
and they don 't really know
that they're offering
too much.

1184
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,913
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?.

1185
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,872
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

inventory out there.

1187
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,751
I mean, what is her problem?.

1188
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,673
She has
unrealistic expectations.

1189

Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1192
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,951
It's Jack.

1193
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,714

crystals before they leave?

1197
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,949
DEBBIE: Yeah, really quick.

1198
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,270
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1199
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,592
Okay. Go play with
your tiny uncles.

1200
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,477
JACK: Let's play murder!
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's go.

1201
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,352
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1202
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,116
I'm getting rid of
everything in the house
that has gluten or sugar.

1203
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,953
Why? What's wrong
with gluten?

1204
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,359
Gluten's really bad for you.

1205
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,074
I don't think so.
It's wheat.

1206
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,389
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?.

1207
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,835
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1208
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,477
Hey, Mom, we were wondering
if we can use
the computer to iChat?

1209
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,871
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1210
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,633
Yeah, but I have
a friend over.

1211
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,759
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1212
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,149
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1213
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,599
LARRY:
Hey, remember the Alamo?

1214
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,199
Have you ever
built a fort, Wendy?

1215
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,469
Like, on Facebook?

1216
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,110
I will take this
if you're gonna
throw it away,

1217
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,475
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1218
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,788
But don't you want
to live long enough
to see your kids grow up?

1219
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,639
That's up to God, honey.

1220
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,876
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1221
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,116
Eh, the kids eat grass,
this is fine.

1222
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,079
Wendy's mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1223
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,798
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1224
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,632
as long as
I finish my homework.

1225
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,109
Yeah.

1226
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,072
Well, I guess
I'm not the cool one,

1227
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,628
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1228
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,111
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1229
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,236
She does. She's so smart.

1230
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,079
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1231
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,679
See, your rules
are ridiculous.

1232
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,035
Don't sass me.

1233
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,358
I'm only sassing you
because you're throwing out
all the food in our house

1234
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,078
and I'm freaking starving.

1235
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,269
You're being stupid.

1236
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,192
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1237
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,555
Yeah.

1238

1240
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,348
I have all my
contacts in there.

00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,272
Okay, if you don't give me
your phone right now,

1242
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,635
then I'm gonna
have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1243
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,956
Jesus Christ, I need
my computer to do homework.

1244
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,712
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1245
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,915
This is B.S.

1246
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,753
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1247
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,832

1248
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,712
You go to your room,
right now.

1249
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,234
You are not allowed to use

1250
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,991
iPhone, iPad,
iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

1251
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,031

just like her mommy.

1253

So, I might have
a job tomorrow.

1254
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,594
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1255
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,352
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1256

00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,549

00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,909
We do?

1262
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,197
It's quality time.

1263
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,833
Then we do.

1264
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,753

What else did they say?

1266
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,432
All right,
some kid named Joseph...

1267
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,158
I know Joseph.
You do?

1268
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,952
He's making
a "hot-or-not" list.

1269
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,469
What?

1270
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,869
Sadie said, "That's so lame
and immature that
you're doing that."

1271
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,839
And then Joseph says,
"Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun.

1272
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,598
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1273
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,072
That is not nice.

1274
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,277
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1275
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,839
And Joseph said,
"I didn't call you a bitch.

1276
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,518
"I said don't
act like a bitch.

1277
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,670
"And by the way,
you're in
the 'Not-Hot' column."

1278
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,236
Who made him
the judge of "hot"?

1279
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,197
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1280
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,956
What a little fuckhead.
I'll kill him.

1281
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,350
Then Sadie said,
"You're in the
jackass column.

1282
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,237
"I gotta go,
I'm bored of you."

1283
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,274
That is cool.
That's taking the high road.

1284
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,833
And then,
for some reason,

1285
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,992
there's an emoticon
of a panda doing push-ups.

1286
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,633
I wonder what that means.

1287
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,675
I don't think it
means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

1288
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,355
AWW.

1289
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,794
Well, she's a good girl.

1290
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,640
She was polite and she
stood up for herself.

1291
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,438
That's pretty cool.

Oh, my God,

are no zeroes after that?

There are zeroes,
but all of them
are before 612.

There are none after.

1352
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,232
I've done
everything I can, Pete.

1353
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,038
You had me
pushing around a corpse.

1354
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,516
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham's.

1355
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,352
What should we do?
I'm out of ideas.

1356
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,232
You fly in The Rumour.

1357
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,512
I can't sell a reunion
concert without the band,
it's ridiculous.

1358
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,831
With what?
I can't afford it.

1359
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,480
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility.

1360
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,154
Take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1361
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,753
What did you call me?

1362
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,955
Chin.

1363
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,829
Pete. Wait, Pete!

1364
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,673
Hey, I have an apartment.

1365
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,591
I have health insurance,
I have car payments.

1366
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,874
I have responsibilities.

1367
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,758
You have responsibilities?
Don't talk to me
about responsibilities.

1368
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,195
I have a life.
I have a family.

1369
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,432
I can't afford to
sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1370
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,193
and then going to
Tommy's Chili Burgers
at 3:00 in the morning.

1371
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,589
That's not even the order
that that happens in!

1372
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,350
I have everything
to lose, here.
Everything.

1373
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,349
Yes, because you spent
thousands of dollars
on shit we don't need.

1374
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,593
You really need
to spend $30,000 on
a fucking neon sign, dude?

1375
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,794
Which is inside,
it's not even outside.
We know where we work.

1376
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,628
If you want to sign a band,
you gotta look like
you're the real deal.

1377
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,071
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1378
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,269
It's 12,000.

1379
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,719
$12,000!

1380
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,472
All right,
you know what? Fine.

1381
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,393
Fly in The Rumour.
Put it on my AmEx.

1382
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,671
No, you said
it was impossible.

1383
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,871
I don't think
I said "impossible."

1384
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,235
Yeah.

1385
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,072
I usually don't
say "impossible."

1386
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,879
I like to leave
some wiggle room.

1387
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,075
You said that my fibroid
was like a giant boulder,

1388
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,835
Iike the one from
the Indiana Jones movies

1389
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,798
blocking up my uterus.
Uterus.

1390
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,029
And I need to stop using
that reference
of Indiana Jones.

1391
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,756
I think that that's not
appropriate when talking about
the reproductive system.

1392
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,274
It's okay.

1393
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,432
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

1394
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,319
and the fibroid
has dissipated.

1395
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,272
That's great!
Yes.

1396
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,549
Wow.
Yes.

1397
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,677
Your fibroid
shrunk and somehow

1398
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,831
it allowed you
to get pregnant.

1399
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,349
What?

1400
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,354
You're gonna have
your third baby.

1401
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,152
Congratulations.

1402
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,149
No.

1403
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,394
Yes.

1404
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,113
Would you like some water?

1405
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,518
That's good news.

1406
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,959
Another baby.

1407
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,189
At 40.

1408
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,515
Debbie?

1409
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,278
I am thrilled.

1410
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,594
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1411
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,791
So, you're okay?

1412
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,155
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1413
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,399
What a relief.

1414
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,598
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1415
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,792
It's been, like...

1416
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,633
(SIGHS)

1417
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,833
It's okay.

1418
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,872
I'm so happy,
though, you know?

1419
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,315
I really am,
because, I mean...

1420
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,029
It's good.

1421
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,189
Great. Great.

1422
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,828
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1423
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,552
Hey.
Hey.

1424
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,235
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

1425
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,630
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1426
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,910
I'm sorry about the record.

1427
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,516
You're going
through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1428
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,518
This is a horrible
time in human history.
What is that?

1429
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,837
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1430
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,350
This is
a drawing by John Lennon.

1431
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,916
I got it 10 years ago
for $5,000.

1432
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,348
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1433
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,674
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1434
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,478
I don't want this.

1435
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,671
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1436
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,474
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1437
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,676
That way, I can give it to you
and you make some money,

1438
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,273
and Debbie won't know
that I'm giving you anything.

1439
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,432
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1440
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,240
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1441
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,908
(STAMMERS) I don't know.
Sell it online.

1442
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,475
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1443
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,115
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1444
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,236
All right.
Don't get snippy.

1445
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,993
Just because you
write a great song
doesn't mean you can draw.

1446
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,794
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1447
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,514
I think it's a Ringo.

1448
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,156
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1449
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,795
Don't take anything
less than $6,500 for that.

1450
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,031
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1451
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,712
I want you to sell
it so I can help you.

1452
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,148
Okay.

1453
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,430
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1454
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,829
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1455
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,476
No, don't buy wine
with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1456
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,675
That's mean.

1457
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,392
I love you. Bye.
All right.

1458
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,797
How do I call eBay?

1459
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,755
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1460
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,276
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1461
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,796
I don't know.
It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1462
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,199
I think he might like you.

1463
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,319
She's so cute.
She's so tall.

1464
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,795
I know.

1465
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,955
How did that happen?

1466
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,956
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1467
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,077
(CLICKS TONGUE) No.
Never for a second.

1468
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,155
Never.

1469
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,799
Never?
Never.

1470
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,474
I love what we have.

1471
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,034
One? A breeze.

1472
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,759
Two? Brutal.

1473
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,475
Three?
Put a bullet in my head.

1474
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,669
Ugh.

1475
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,357
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady
from school,

1476
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,351
and I just feel bad for her.

1477
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,510
And I feel bad
for the kid.

1478
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,233
Can you imagine?

1479
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,476
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1480
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:04,473
"Oh, she's the one
sitting in that scooter,
eating a soft cracker."

1481
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,355
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1482
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,433
You know what?
It would also be nice for
us to spend some time apart.

1483
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,638
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1484
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,440
It'd be so great to not
see you for a chunk of time,

1485
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,078
so that I could
really just miss you.

1486
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,873
Remember when we
used to miss each other?

1487
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,078
Hey! Hey, you.

1488
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,675
Yeah, what's up?

1489
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,228
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1490
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,829
Sadie?

1491
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,831
Sadie, the one you
chat with on the Internet.

1492
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,189
No, man. That ain't me.

1493
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,032
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1494
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,318
Did you make a hot list?
And not put Sadie
on the hot list?

1495
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,874
She was not on my list, no.

1496
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,314
You know
what I'm gonna do?

1497
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,668
I'm gonna make
my own hot list.

1498
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,752
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1499
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,115
How does that feel?

1500
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,710
It doesn't bother me.
I'm comfortable
with the way I am.

1501
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,075
Maybe you shouldn't be
so comfortable with yourself.

1502
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,753
You know why?

1503
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,275
You look like
a miniature Tom Petty.

1504
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,919
How's that feel?

1505
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,877
You think that
haircut's cool? It's not.

1506
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,754
It looks like you
put your Justin
Bieber wig on backwards.

1507
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,912
Are you still
comfortable with yourself?

1508
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,071
Why are you wearing
a tank top? Huh?

1509
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,119
So you can show off
your little bald pits,
you little hairless wonder?

1510
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,709
Cool tank top,
man. Huh?

1511
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,708
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1512
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,917
on my daughter's
Facebook page,
just remember me.

1513
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,115
Remember me.

1514
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,475
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1515
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,789
(SOBS) Okay, I'm sorry.

1516
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,797
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,115
Just let me go.

01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,554
Oh, my...

1520
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,358
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1521
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,029
I'm sorry.

1522
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,390
I'm not in my right head.

1523
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,994
I understand.
My mom's going
through menopause, too.

1524
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,155
It's a hard time.

1525
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,834
What'd you say?

1526
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,273
Are you going
through menopause?

1527
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,549
I'm not going
through menopause.

1528
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,837
I'm not gonna go through
menopause for like 20 years.

1529
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,077
I'm pregnant,
you little bitch.

1530

1532
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,149
I'm going out with Desi
to find out if
she's stealing from us.

1533
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,476
I've got
the Graham Parker concert.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

1534

I don't know.

I kind of just wanted to talk.

I thought maybe we could go
to a coffeehouse or something.

1537
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,074
You want coffee?
This place has coffee.

1538

They have
all kinds of drinks.

But someplace
quiet, maybe.

1541

This place
can be quiet.

1542
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,315
There's a spot in the back.
It's pretty quiet.

1543
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,351
What sport
do you guys play?

1544
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,794
We play hockey.

1545

Oh, I like hockey.

Actually, none of us are.

have all of your teeth?

Well, I got all my
teeth except these ones.

They definitely look
way better on her
than they do on you.

to the quiet area?

No, no, no.

1686
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,350
It's great.
It's good for all of us.

1687
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,189
DEBBIE: Why did you put that
guy's teeth in your mouth?

1688
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,349
(LAUGHS)

1689
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,112
That's so gross.
(SNORTS)

1690
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,392
(MUFFLED) I was drunk.
He was dirty.

1691
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,392
No, he was wearing a tie.

1692
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,593
That's true.
He wasn't dirty.

1693
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,390
When I kissed him,
I felt his little tiny
teeth nubs with my tongue.

1694
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,879
You did?
Yeah.

1695
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,519
It was like kissing a baby.

1696
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,795
French-kissing a baby.

1697
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,558
(BOTH LAUGH)

1698
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,515
Can I ask you
something stupid?
Uh-huh.

1699
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,077
Do you know why we're
missing money at the store?

1700
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,389
Are you guys missing money?

1701
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,795
Yeah. Like, $12,000.

1702
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,714
Do you think
that I took it?

1703
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,757
No. I mean...
Well, no.

1704
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,110
I did and I don't now.

1705
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,509
It's not me.

1706
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,390
Why do you live in
such a nice apartment
and have such a fancy car?

1707
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,593
Yes, you're right.
Um... Look...

1708
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,835
(SIGHS)

1709
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,510
I am an escort.

1710
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,439
I get paid
to go out on dates.

1711
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,109
You...

1712
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,349
Oh.

1713
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,109
But only three to
five times a year.

1714
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,594
Ten times, max.

1715
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,719
But it's not technically
prostitution, because I don't
have to sleep with them.

1716
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,075
Oh, well, that's good.

1717
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,195
But I always do.

1718
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,477
That's why I only do it
four to eight times a year.

1719
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,829
Fifteen times, max.

1720
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,229
Huh.

1721
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,398
One year, I did it 20.

1722
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,353
Well, as long as
you think it's safe.

1723
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,595
It's safe.

1724
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,634
I only do it 10
to 30 times a year.

1725
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,031
So, who do you
think is stealing money?

1726
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,748
It's fucking Jodi.

1727
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,513
No.
Yeah.

1728
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,473
She's a pilled-out whore.

1729
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,795
Huh.

1730
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,794
Since you told me,
I want to tell you something.

1731
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,673
You're pregnant.

1732
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,309
How'd you know?

1733
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,068
Wow.

1734
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,749
Maybe you should tell Pete.

1735
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,075
You didn't tell Pete yet?

1736
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,315
I haven't told Pete.

1737
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,674
Why?
I don't know why.

1738
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,671
I just want him to want me.

1739
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,433
I don't want him to want me
because I'm pregnant.

1740
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,512
Go home and
fucking suck his dick

1741
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,352
and tell him then,
and he will love it.

1742
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,838
You think?
He'll be so excited.

1743
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,350
Or even better yet...
Better yet,

1744
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,916
you should tell him
while you're
sucking his dick, like...

1745
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,109
"I'm pregnant."

1746
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,673
(LAUGHS)

1747
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,438
What are you doing?

1748
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,431
Um, returning some emails.

1749
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,797
What time do you
have to go to work?

1750
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,717
Like, 10 minutes ago.

1751
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,953
Do you wanna be late?

1752
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,748
No, I can't be late,
not today.

1753
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,032
Do you see me standing
here in front of you,

1754
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,349
half-naked?

1755
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,355
(CLEARS THROAT)

1756
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,635
Yeah.

1757
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,798
And does that

1758
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,196
make you feel anything, or...

1759
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,394
(SIGHS) Come on.
Are you trying
to start a fight?

1760
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,319
No, I'm not trying
to start a fight with you.

1761
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,674
I'm trying to fuck you.

1762
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,598
Oh, God, you know what?

1763
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,798
Today, of all days,

1764
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,230
is the day you need to
cut me a break, all right?

1765
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,748
Whatever.

1766
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,519
Oh, God.

1767
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,909
What?

1768
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,800
I didn't realize
it was intentional.

1769
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,676
I didn't say anything
because I didn't want
you to be embarrassed.

1770
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,035
I thought I was being gallant.

1771
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,795
All right, fine.
I'm an asshole.

1772
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,548
God.

1773
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,434
You know
what your problem is?

1774
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,192
You're never,
ever in the moment.

1775
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,750
You're never, ever present.
You're never in your body.

1776
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,032
That's not true.
I am in the moment.
You know how I know?

1777
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,872
I want to get
the fuck out of the moment.

1778
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,949
I swear,
I can't win with you.
I just can't do it.

1779
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,752
You can't just walk away.

1780
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,274
Oh, God.

1781
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,637
Hey! How's the record
company going, Pete?

1782
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,072
What? Not great.

1783
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,952
I'm still waiting
for numbers to come in.

1784
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,798
What have you heard?

1785
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,797
A couple numbers
have trickled in.

1786
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,598
It's lower than we expected.

1787
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,152
Then why are you
giving Larry money?

1788
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,669
What?

1789
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,155
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

1790
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,997
You know what?
I don't wanna get
into some nasty fight

1791
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,593
so can we please
talk to each other

1792
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,318
the way the therapist told us
to talk to each other?

1793
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,112
Fine. Fine.

1794
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,711
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

1795
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,751
I understand it
makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

1796
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,276
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

1797
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,794
and corner me,
and try and
trick me into lying.

1798
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,989
Okay.

1799
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,595
It makes me sad
when it's so easy to
trick you into lying,

1800
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,671
because you're
such a lying shit-bag.

1801
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,831
That's not...
You can't do that,
you can't do that.

1802
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,558
The therapist said you're
not allowed to judge me.

1803
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,871
That's not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

1804
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,073
Fair enough.

1805
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,477
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

1806
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,634
But it's only because
I'm scared to death

1807
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,037
of your crazy-assed,
illogical overreactions.

1808
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,548
Well...

1809
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,628
It hurts me
inside and triggers me

1810
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,676
when you're such
a dishonest shit,

1811
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,399
that you're lending
your father money
without telling me

1812
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,710
while your record
company's going bankrupt

1813
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,792
and we're on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

1814
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,074
(PLAYING)

1815
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,069
What else are you
lying about?

1816
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,828
I've taken
Viagra for two years.

1817
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,395
I ate six muffins
downstairs a while ago

1818
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,909
and my
cholesterol level is 305.

1819
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,431
My heart could
explode at any second.

1820
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,278
These might be my
very last words.

1821
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,111
Oh, and I gave Charlotte
antibiotics when
you weren't looking.

1822
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,756
That's why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

1823
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,917
What are we even doing?
What are we doing?

1824
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,312
This is not
making me happy.
You're not happy.

1825
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,070
You don't like me.
I can feel that.

1826
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,238
I'm not blind.

1827
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,234
Jesus.

1828
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,030
We're like
business associates.

1829
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,278
We're like
brother and sister.

1830
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,674
There's no passion there.

1831
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,717
We're not like
brother and sister.
You know what we're like?

1832
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,199
We're like Simon and Garfunkel

1833
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,191
and, somehow,
you turned me into Garfunkel.

1834
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,548
I don't even know
what that means.

1835
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,675
Art Garfunkel.

1836
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,475
What's wrong
with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

1837
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,870
He's got an amazing voice!
He could put
a harmony to anything!

1838
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,428
But what I'm saying is that
you turned me into him.

1839
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,073
What the hell are
you talking about?

1840
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,754
Simon controls him!

1841
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,635
That's because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

1842
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,833
He's the better one!

1843
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,798
You know what?
I see the way you
look at our kids.

1844
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,070
You have so much
love and compassion for them.

1845
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,310
You never look at
me like that. Ever.

1846
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,551
Would we even
still be together

1847
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,870
if I didn't get
pregnant 14 years ago?

1848
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,277
You know what?
I'm not gonna go
down that road.

1849
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,433
Would we?

1850
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,189
Okay.

1851
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,433
You know what?
I don't want to
have a party here.

1852
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,709
You need to cancel it.

1853
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,875
No, I'm not.

1854

He said it to me.

2021
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,399
No. What I said
was that we need to keep
an extra eye on our kids

2022
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,153
because with all
the technological advances,

2023
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,310
they need to learn to
use them responsibly.

2024
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,750
No. What he said to me was...
He called me an iCunt.

2025
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,234
PETE: A what?
Language, Catherine!
Language.

2026
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,355
CATHERINE: I'm quoting!

2027
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,834
How am I gonna relay

2028
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,593
what these two nutballs
said to me, unless I say it?

2029
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,718
Can you please not
talk like that, Catherine?

2030
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,199
Music Man is
rehearsing next door.

2031
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,316
Sorry, fucking Music Man.

2032
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,871
Maybe if I looked
more like this
fake bullshit couple.

2033
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,552
Looks like they're
in a bank commercial.

2034
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,869
That's what you
look like.

2035
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,230
Like you're a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

2036
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,040
None of this
talk is productive.

2037
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,112
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

2038
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,113
and kick you both
in the fucking jaw
with my foot bone.

2039
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,357
You're just really
scaring me.

2040
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,271
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

2041
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,675
You corner me,
I will fucking
chew through you.

2042
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,159
I'll chew through you.

2043
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,719
Catherine,
you're better than this.

2044
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,394
Fuck you, Jill.
You're a horrible
fucking woman.

2045
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,636
This is why everybody
hates you, Jill.

2046
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,157
This kind of shit.
Ineffective.
Fucking bullshit hair.

2047
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,556
And I'm glad
your husband died.

2048
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,672
Because you're
a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

2049
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,794
Okay, Catherine,
I think we know
what's happening now.

2050
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:41,754
Now you know what
we're dealing with.

2051
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,916
I'm not gonna
eat that chicken.

2052
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,234
Why not?

2053
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,150
Because I feel
like I'm gonna be
a vegetarian.

2054
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,669
Can you become
a vegetarian tomorrow?
Uh-uh.

2055
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,274
(SOBBING) You guys
have been reading my texts?

2056
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,591
No, we haven't.
Yes, we have.

2057
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,432
We're supposed to
keep an eye on you.

2058
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,595
How did you find out?

2059
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,792
Joseph told me
that you flipped out
on him and his mom.

2060
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,036
And you guys are nuts,
and I agree.

2061
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,072
All right, you know what?
Don't be disrespectful.

2062
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,838
You're the ones
who are disrespectful.

2063
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,070
Reading my texts is like
reading my diary.

2064
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,310
And you were really
sweet on your iChats.

2065
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,389
We were really proud of you.

2066
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,675
Yeah, we were going to
give you your computer
and phone back.

2067
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,795
Fuck you!

2068
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,789
Okay, there's the first
official "fuck you."

2069
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,713
Okay, that is not
how we talk to each
other in this house.

2070
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,076
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time.

2071
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,869
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

2072
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,755
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

2073
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,274
Shut up, Charlotte.

2074
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,198
You guys so desperately
want me to be so perfect
and to make no mistakes.

2075
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,111
Well, you two
are fucking insane.

2076
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,355
Okay.

2077
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,432
All you do is fight,
or you don't fight,
which is even worse

2078
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,511
because it looks
like you hate
each other for weeks.

2079
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,155
You obsess over
every little thing I do,

2080
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,516
and you don't trust
in me or believe in me.

2081
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,113
Well, I'm fucking sick of it.

2082
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,798
Yeah, I said "fuck."
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2083
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,715
Ground me forever,
I don't care.
I don't care about anything.

2084
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,949
(SOBS)

2085
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,151
I hate everything.

2086
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:53,189
Everyone's going crazy.
I don't care if I have
no friends.

2087
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,031
Are you still
upset about Lost?.

2088
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,678
Of course I'm
upset about Lost!

2089
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,389
You guys took away my shit
before I could watch
the last two episodes.

2090
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,388
And I don't know
what the fuck happened!

2091
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,471
She's becoming
just like us.

2092
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:15,553
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

2093
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,834
Where did you find this?

2094
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,993
I stole it.

2095
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,039
Thank you.

2096
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,999
No big deal.

2097
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,511
Our kids are fucking crazy.

2098
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,193
And it's our fault.

2099
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,278
Do you think there's anything
we can do to turn
it around, or...

2100
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,393
Sadie's 13.
She might be
a lost cause.

2101
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,631
Where did she learn
that kind of language?

2102
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,113
We don't talk like that.

2103
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,394
I have no fucking idea.

2104
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,793
Do you think Sadie
is this crazy because of us

2105
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,519
or is it hormones
and Lost?.

2106
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,359
J. J. Abrams.

2107
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,030
He's ruining our daughter.
Yeah.

2108
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,078
That fucking geek.

2109
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,033
I feel bad for us.
I feel bad for us.

2110
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,556
All of a sudden,
we're like a magnet
for negativity.

2111
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,195
Why do people
keep attacking us?

2112
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,797
What did we do?
We're just doing our best.

2113
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,794
Should we talk
about our fight?

2114
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,197
I think we're
under enough pressure.

2115
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,113
Let's just let
it go, this time.

2116
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:34,949
Yeah.

2117
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,559
We can give
each other a break.

2118
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,636
All right, great.
Thank you.

2119
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,314
And I'm sorry about my dad.
You're right.

2120
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,719
I'm sorry that he's just
an endless mooch.

2121
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,394
The truth is that
this isn't about us.

2122
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,193
It's about our parents.

2123
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,868
We're not even
mad at each other.
We're mad at them.

2124
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,712
Exactly. Exactly.

2125
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,072
Let's just take away
our parents' power
by loving them.

2126
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,069
Can we do that?

2127
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,758
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

2128
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,115
Thank God.

2129
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,910
I kind of feel
better already, do you?

2130
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,679
Do you?
I do.

2131
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,637
I love you.
I love you, too.

2132
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:18,433
(SIGHS) It's not us,
it's them.

2133
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,108
Totally.

2134
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,712
What are you doing?
We have to get
ready for the party.

2135
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,519
I just watched
the last episode of Lost.

2136
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,355
Okay.

2137
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,678
You know what?
We don't have time
for this right now.

2138
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,153
We have a lot of
people coming over.

2139
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,594
They're all dead.

2140
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,149
What?

2141
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:51,155
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

2142
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,477
I don't care about
the show right now.
Jin, Sun...

2143
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,240
Okay? I need you to
just get in the shower,
get dressed.

2144
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,514
Let's just put it on hold.
Walt, Juliet...

2145
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,432
All those people.

2146
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:01,919
Don't think about Lost today.

2147
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,992
Tomorrow, Lost, all day.
I can't wait to hear about it.

2148
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,476
Jack? No way, really?
Right now, shower.

2149
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,154
I don't make fun of
your stupid Mad Men.

2150
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,715
First of all, I don't get
worked up over Mad Men.

2151
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,433
That's because
Mad Men sucks.

2152
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,431
What Don Draper
has gone through

2153
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,512
beats whatever Jack
is running from on
some fucking island.

2154
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:23,398
Bunch of people
smoking in an office.
It's stupid.

2155
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,195
It's about a lot
more than that.
And you don't have any kind

2156
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,794
of understanding
about what it was like
in the '60s.

2157
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,916
You do cry during Mad Men.

2158
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:35,397
I don't cry over it.
I appreciate it.
Right.

2159
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,436
You're getting me off topic.

2160
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,636
Just, please, get dressed.

2161
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,157
Hello.
Hi.

2162
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,468
I'm glad you're here.

2163
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,471
I need a buffer
in case it gets weird.

2164
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,556
Oh, well,
I'm ready to buff.

2165
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,996
Grab these napkins.
Let's buff. Okay.

2166
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,990
So, that's the girl
who works for you.

2167
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,469
Yeah. That's her.
Works for Debbie.

2168
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,999
She seems nice.

2169
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,515
My wife would
never let me have
a hot employee like that.

2170
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,749
Yeah?
No.

2171
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,598
Every woman
who works for us

2172
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,110
Iooks like they've
been in some kind
of horrible accident.

2173
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,559
I'm taking control,
and now you're my slave.

2174
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,039
Are you comfortable with that
around your husband?

2175
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,512
Oh. Pete wouldn't know
what to do with that.

2176
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,512
Do you think
our wives are looking
at us right now?

2177
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,999
Oh, definitely.
Yeah.

2178
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,436
They look
like pedophiles.

2179
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,309
Thank you.
The girls are so
excited you're here.

2180
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,475
They're all outside.

2181
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,879
Hi.
Hi.

2182
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,037
Hey, how are you?
How are you, man?

2183
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,309
Good to see you.

2184
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,628
Happy birthday, Pete.

2185
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,835
How wonderful to see you.

2186
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,069
Thank you, Grandma Molly.

2187
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,269
You're wonderful.

2188
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:54,149
And look at my gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

2189
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,039
No, I get that.
I'm just wondering
why I should do it.

2190
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,189
Pete, Jason's here.

2191
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,315
Peter, hi.

2192
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,709
Hey, how's it going, Jason?

2193
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,518
You look well.
Thank you.

2194
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,717
How do you like
what I've been
doing to your girl?

2195
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,512
How you like
Debbie's "after" body?

2196
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,955
It's nice.
Come on. Show him.

2197
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,312
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

2198
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,358
Look at that "after" ass.
Now, it starts here.

2199
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,996
But it used to start here.

2200
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,272
And I brought it up.

2201
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,799
You're welcome.

2202
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,837
So, are you a trainer?

2203
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,998
Yes.
Oh.

2204
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:28,590
But not just physical.
Spiritual.
I'm sort of a guide.

2205
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:32,872
Mm-hmm.
You guys should talk.
I think you'll get along.

2206
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,469
Come here, honey.
I gotta tell you something.

2207
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,629
Yeah.

2208
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,598
Who's that in the pool?
Mine.

2209
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,908
(DOORBELL RINGS)

2210
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,957
Hello.
Hello, Debbie.

2211
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,314
How are you?
Good.

2212
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,592
Remember my husband, Pete?

2213
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,991
Oh, right.
I didn't recognize
you with the long hair.

2214
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,514
Oh, yeah.
I've been growing it.

2215
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:03,908
Happy birthday.

2216
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,513
Thank you so much.

2217
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,669
Very old Scotch.

2218
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,478
Wow. You know...

2219
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:09,868
I hope it hasn't expired.

2220
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,115
(LAUGHS)

2221
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,516
No, Scotch doesn't expire.

2222
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,717
It improves with age.

2223
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:20,199
Yeah. No, I know.
Thank you so...

2224
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,390
That's nice.
Come on in.
Sure.

2225
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,515
Sorry.

2226
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,593
So, what do you do
in Chino, Oliver?

2227
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,669
I'm a surgeon.

2228
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,199
Wow. What kind?
That's great.

2229
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,877
Mainly of the spine.

2230
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:38,397
My specialty is
scoliosis surgery.

2231
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,474
My mom used to talk to me
like I had scoliosis

2232
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,154
because I'm a little hunchy,
but that's a different thing.

2233
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,038
Well, you definitely
don't look right.

2234
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,599
Hey!
Hey!

2235
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,399
LARRY: Sorry we're late.

2236
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,391
I was in the lab,
cloning myself.

2237
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,597
We're gonna have
another seven tomorrow.

2238
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,952
We cut their hair differently,
so we can finally
tell who they are.

2239
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,877
You like
the new haircut,
Travis?

2240
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,439
I'm Jack, damn it!

2241
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,112
Oh. Of course.

2242
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,832
Larry, this is my father.

2243
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,197
Really? How are you?

2244
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,999
Oliver.
Oliver?

2245
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,471
"Can I have some more?

2246
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,233
"Please, Oliver?
I need a little more, sir."

2247
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,596
I love that movie.
You must get
that all the time.

2248
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,876
Not really.
JACK: My nose
itches right here.

2249
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,719
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'm Claire and
I'm Larry's wife.

2250
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,678
Very nice to see you,
but I'm gonna go get the kids.

2251
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,594
We won't see her
now for the whole day.

2252
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,069
I'd help, honey,
but you know I got
the blood pressure,

2253
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,275
and I don't want to.

2254
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,589
Can I get you a drink, Dad?

2255
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,159
Yeah, a little white wine.

2256
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,469
White wine?
Yeah.

2257
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,158
Heavy stuff.
Yeah.

2258
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,554
So, who knew that
Debbie had a dad?

2259
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,797
Where have you
been for 15 years?

2260
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,668
Never seen you at Hanukah
or Christmas or Ramadan,
nothing.

2261
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,035
How you get out
of all that stuff?
Do you have a wife?

2262
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,678
Yeah, my wife's at home.

2263
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,994
Why didn't she come?

2264
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,310
Uh, construction.
They're sanding our deck.

2265
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:57,959
You let the woman
sand the deck?

2266
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:59,759
She supervises it. Yes.

2267
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,315
Okay.

2268
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,429
Hey, guys.

2269
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,439
Hey! Look how big
the kids are!

2270
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,199
Sadie!

2271
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,077
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Sadie.

2272
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,393
Mom. Who's Oliver?

2273
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,635
What do you mean?

2274
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,189
Is he your dad?

2275
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,550
Is he my...
He's my biological father.

2276
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,313
What does that mean?

2277
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,917
It means that my mom,
Grandma...

2278
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,157
He and my mom had a baby,
and that was me.

2279
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,152
Oh, so you're
our grandpa?

2280
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,878
Well, why don't
you ask your mother?

2281
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,831
Yeah. I guess so.

2282
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,070
Then that would make him
your grandfather then, yes.

2283
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,474
Do you want him to be?

2284
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,391
Yes, then we get
another grandpa.

2285
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,708
Come on.

2286
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,789
Well...

2287
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,589
Another grandpa.
Trampoline time.

2288
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,835
That was deeply
uncomfortable.

2289
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,995
(SIGHS)

2290
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,709
At least that pretty girl
was here to divert
our attention.

2291
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,114
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

2292
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,992
Me, oh, my.
I did not see you there.

2293
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,559
Hi.
I saw you there.

2294
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,678
Did you guys come together?
Are you a couple?

2295
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,990
No, we didn't come together.
No, absolutely not.

2296
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:28,711
I'm sorry, I thought...
The moustache is a little...

2297
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,990
Mmm. That's fair.
DESI: I just assumed.

2298
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,150
This is
a straight-man moustache.

2299
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,870
What is the difference between
a gay man's moustache

2300
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,713
and a straight
man's moustache?

2301
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,233
The smell.

2302
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,879
Uh, excuse me.

2303
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,912
So, spinal surgery.

2304
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,152
It just seems to me
to be at the top
of the surgery chain.

2305
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,397
(CHUCKLES) Well,
we're not cardio,
we're not neuro,

2306
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:04,515
but I like to think
we're an important
part of the spectrum.

2307
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,637
Do you operate
every single day?
Most days.

2308
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,915
Multiple times a day?

2309
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,309
Three, four times.

2310
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,917
So, what's the price range?
Like, if I wanted a...

2311
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,158
I'd rather not say.

2312
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,114
It's so big,
you're embarrassed to say.

2313
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,919
I wouldn't say "embarrassed."

2314
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,275
Are there hunchbacks today?
Of course.

2315
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,429
I've never seen one.

2316
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,715
Well, that's because
there are spinal surgeons.

2317
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:26,829
That's because of you.

2318
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,717
Each time I don't
see a hunchback,

2319
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,279
you're getting
that much richer.

2320
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,268
You like The Beatles,
don't you?

2321
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,429
(CHUCKLES)

2322
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,675
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
Nobody.

2323
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:36,749
No, nobody.

2324
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,473
RONNIE: (LAUGHS)
So funny. You're so funny.

2325
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,233
What is your sun sign?

2326
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,039
Libra.
Oh, boy.

2327
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,712
That's not good.
No, sir.

2328
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,472
That's not good.
Not for me,
that's not good.

2329
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,397
Sexually, we're
completely incompatible.

2330
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,714
That's not true.
Right?

2331
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,789
That's such a shame.

2332
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,757
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.

2333
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,478
You don't know.
What is yours?

2334
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,115
I'm a Cancer.

2335
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,914
Really?
Is that good?

2336
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,149
Wow.
What does it mean?

2337
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:02,269
That's kind of strange.
Well...

2338
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,996
Taurus and Cancers are,
sort of, soul mates
of the Zodiac.

2339
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,311
We're, like,
perfectly compatible.

2340
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,312
And I balance what
you lack and you
make up for what I lack.

2341
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,155
And a quiet Cancer
almost always
has a huge penis.

2342
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,513
You're making me embarrassed.
Thank you.

2343
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,149
Thank you.

2344
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,469
No. Fantastic.

2345
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,471
Oh, I wanted
to make a toast.

2346
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,998
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you so much.

2347
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,998
Pete's turning 40.

2348
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,115
Weird.

2349
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:35,829
And we're ready to start
this new phase of our
lives with open hearts.

2350
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,948
Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody.

2351
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,552
So, thank you all for coming.

2352
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,352
Wait. Forgive who?

2353
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,355
I think she just
means in a general sense.

2354
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:51,159
You know, just put
the past behind us...

2355
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:52,595
And live without resentment.

2356
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,274
But, specifically,
who are you forgiving?

2357
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,597
I just like to know
the details before
I make a toast.

2358
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:03,351
Right. You and my dad
and, you know, others.

2359
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,035
I see.

2360
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,320
Well, I know you have
some issues with me,

2361
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,436
but I'm curious,
what's he in for?

2362
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,790
Before today,
nobody even knew
he existed.

2363
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,269
Well, my parents divorced
when I was really young

2364
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:20,193
and we don't spend
much time together
and I'd like to work on that.

2365
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:23,716
Just like we
would like to work on

2366
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,872
how you have
financial issues.

2367
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,679
She's talking about
all the lending and
the borrowing and...

2368
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,711
I know what she meant.

2369
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,039
You are a beautiful woman,
but you are not
totally maxed out.

2370
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,311
I would say,
honestly, you're a six.

2371
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,231
BOTH: Oh.
A six-and-a-half.

2372
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,911
I could make you an 11.
Really?

2373
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,036
When I found Deb, she was a 7.

2374
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,514
And now she's a 12.

2375
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,398
I wanna be a 12.

2376
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,358
You can't be lazy.
I don't wanna be lazy.

2377
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,630
Look at me.
You cannot be lazy.

2378
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,949
I won't be lazy.

2379
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,838
Do you know how
she got her body?
How?

2380
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,672
Bodies by Jason.
Wow.

2381
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,432
Say it.
Bodies by Jason.

2382
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,716
Say it again.
Bodies by Jason.

2383
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,512
And now just say, "Jason."
Jason.

2384
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,875
Again.
Jason.

2385
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,075
That sounds right, doesn't it?

2386
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,915
Yeah.

2387
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,674
What the fuck is
happening right now?

2388
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,596
When was the last time
you two saw each other?
I'm curious.

2389
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,995
Actually, we had
lunch together last week.
Uh-huh.

2390
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,235
And before that?

2391
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,959
It's been about seven years.

2392
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,395
Seven years?
That's a joke, right?

2393
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,595
That's like two Olympics.

2394
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,069
But I'm the bad guy.

2395
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,315
All right, Dad.

2396
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,916
What Debbie doesn't
understand is it's not bad
to help out a parent.

2397
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,992
And it's certainly
not bad for a parent
to help out a child.

2398
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,157
I'm sure Oliver would agree.
Well...

2399
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:40,429
Are you really
doing this right now?

2400
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,556
Am I doing what?
I didn't start the toast.

2401
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,796
Are you really
about to hit up
my dad for money?

2402
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,956
What? He does four
operations a day.

2403
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:48,832
It's perfect.
It helps everybody

2404
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,673
and it relieves
his guilt from all
the abandonment issues.

2405
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,314
You can't buy forgiveness.
Right, Pete?

2406
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,309
I don't think anyone
is looking for handouts.
I mean, you know...

2407
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,474
We'd pay him back.

2408
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:02,836
If you two are in a bind,
I'd be more
than happy to help.

2409
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:06,990
No. It's not good
to borrow money
from family members

2410
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,591
because it
causes resentment.
Remember?

2411
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,869
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2412
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,877
What do you
want me to do? Okay.
Admit that my life is shit?

2413
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,678
Is that what you want
me to say? You happy?

2414
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,196
Aren't I allowed a little joy
with these children I never
wanted to have?

2415
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,958
You have never
once stopped
asking us for money.

2416
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,355
Family helps family.

2417
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,158
It's true.
Family helps family.

2418
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:33,152
Look, I don't expect
you to fully understand.

2419
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,631
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.

2420
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,517
It's not your fault
you can't feel love.

2421
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,911
There's something
that you can't...

2422
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,268
This is coming out wrong.

2423
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,673
You know what?
I would rather have
my dad than your dad.

2424
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,277
Because he
doesn't drive me crazy.

2425
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,316
You know what's
the best quality
my father has?

2426
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,112
Is he asks for nothing.

2427
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:57,029
I don't know what the fuck
he's thinking right now.

2428
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,358
Look at that.
Nothing. Nothing.

2429
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,755
I don't even know him.

2430
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,389
And I turned out
perfectly fine
without his input, okay?

2431
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,754
I just figured out
what your problem is.

2432
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,753
You hate Jews.

2433
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:15,310
Which is so odd
because your
children are Jewish.

2434
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,753
Don't play
the Jew card, Larry.

2435
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,309
I'm not playing
any Jew card.
Seriously, it's used up.

2436
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,472
You can't use up a Jew card.
That's the whole
point of a Jew card.

2437
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,069
That's right.
You can't use it up,
it goes forever.

2438
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,390
You know what?
I have to go.

2439
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,511
Yeah, great.
What a big surprise.

2440
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,871
Bye, Oliver. See you later.
See you in
another seven years.

2441
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,230
Make sure and say goodbye
to the grandkids
who you met today.

2442
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,476
You know, nothing I do
is right because of you.

2443
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:41,191
Nothing. No matter
how hard I try,
I'm just the asshole here.

2444
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,872
But you know what?
You know what I realized?

2445
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,632
It's you. You're the asshole.

2446
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,512
Good luck
working that out.

2447
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,228
Happy birthday,
and go fuck yourself.

2448
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,520
Hey, see you when
the Cubs win the pennant.

2449
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:57,312
I'm gonna go
light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

2450
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,436
Maybe we should
try the toast again.
You know, can you be quiet?

2451
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,192
You just threw
me under the bus.

2452
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,157
No, I don't...
You threw me under the...

2453
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,753
You threw me under the bus.

2454
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:08,997
We agreed to let go
and forgive,

2455
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,594
but then you started
ripping into my dad
like a crazy person.

2456
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,631
I'm not ripping into
your dad.

2457
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,036
I'm just saying to him
what you say to me.

2458
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,314
PETE: Don't be
such a ball-buster.

2459
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:21,557
I am not a ball-buster.
You make me one.

2460
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:24,632
I am a fun girl.
I am fun-loving.

2461
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,390
I am a "Good-Time Sally."
I dance hip-hop.

2462
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,632
I cannot believe I
have wasted my whole life

2463
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,479
busting the balls
of people who have
no balls.

2464
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,993
I'm the only one
here who has any balls!

2465
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:42,512
(ALL SINGING)

2466
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,113
God damn it.

2467
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,469
Mom?

2468
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,232
Mom? What are you doing?

2469
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,309
What?

2470
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,709
You're smoking,
and in the front yard?

2471
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:37,752
No! No, they're Barb's.

2472
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,189
Mom!

2473
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,357
Since when have
you been a smoker?

2474
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,509
I'm not a smoker.

2475
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:46,119
I thought you
said smokers die.

2476
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,270
I'm not smoking.
I wasn't smoking.

2477
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,395
I saw you.

2478
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,509
DEBBIE: No, I wasn't.

2479
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:52,033
Mom, you're smoking?

2480
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,994
Deb, you can't smoke,
you're pregnant.
You've been doing so well.

2481
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,229
You're pregnant?

2482
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,120
No effing way.
I don't want
another sister.

2483
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,434
I don't want her
as a sister.

2484
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,315
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out.

2485
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,954
Are you pregnant?
Since when
are you pregnant?

2486
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,799
Since when do you care?
You don't even
want another baby.

2487
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,639
You have no idea
what I want.

2488
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,039
I want an Asian baby.

2489
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,559
We're not gonna
have an Asian baby.

2490
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,629
CHARLOTTE: Yes, we are.

2491
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,119
They're not Asian.
Sadie.

2492
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,031
We'll buy one.
Shut up, Charlotte.

2493
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,553
You shut up.
Shut up, Sadie!

2494
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,239
Shut up, Charlotte!
Shut up!

2495
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:22,396
Okay, Sadie, shut up.
Shut up, Charlotte!

2496
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,112
Shut up!
Okay, stop saying "shut up"!

2497
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:25,918
You're pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2498
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,157
When did you find out?

2499
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:33,036
Will you stop
eating cupcakes, please?

2500
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:37,758
Stop eating cupcakes!
Stop eating cupcakes!

2501
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:45,439
Hey, we just heard.
You're having a baby?

2502
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:47,232
See, it can happen to anybody.

2503
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,276
That is so wonderful.

2504
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:52,352
Let me give you a hug.
Fantastic, congratulations.

2505
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,192
CLAIRE: It's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

2506
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,837
This is too adult for you.
Let's go outside.

2507
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,479
Congratulations.

2508
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:06,360
Well, I guess
we're stuck together
then forever then, right?

2509
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,429
Weren't we always?

2510
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:08,868
You didn't even
want a baby.

2511
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,951
Of course I do.
I never said that.

2512
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,271
I didn't want one
if I could choose.

2513
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,794
I should put that
on a Hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

2514
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,155
Debbie...

2515
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:19,677
Good luck with
the pregnancy, Debbie.

2516
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,637
But please,
take care of yourself.

2517
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,676
It's a much riskier
pregnancy after 40.

2518
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,638
I'm not 40.
Of course you are.

2519
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,753
You were born on
December 5th, 1972.

2520
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,274
I'm not 40.
How do you know?

2521
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,158
I was there. I'm the one
who took your mother
to the hospital.

2522
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,508
Well, that's not
what she said.

2523
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:38,148
Your mother was in labor
for only about 20 minutes.

2524
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:41,039
You couldn't wait to meet me.
Can you imagine that?

2525
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:42,639
I don't even know you.

2526
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,913
You can't just
come into my house
and reminisce.

2527
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:50,197
Look, maybe we're
just not meant to be
in each other's lives.

2528
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,233
I'm not sure this
was such a great idea.

2529
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,835
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute!

2530
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,833
You did leave and
you didn't come back.

2531
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:05,669
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

2532
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,274
So, I ruined your life?
I was eight.

2533
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:10,271
People do better
when I stay out
of their lives!

2534
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:11,634
That's what
my son tells me.

2535
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,518
You think my
life is so perfect?

2536
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,114
I've got a 13-year-old
who's a pothead.

2537
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:20,239
I've got a wife who's
keeping Zoloft alive.

2538
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:21,993
You never said that before.

2539
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:25,118
You don't think I wanna
talk to you about this,
to share it with you?

2540
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,111
It's just not our way.
We don't talk to each other.

2541
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,351
We don't know each other.
And I thought that's
the way you wanted it.

2542
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,678
How do I get out
of this?

2543
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:36,639
How do I get you all
to just help me
down off the cross?

2544
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,153
You sound just like Sadie.

2545
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,395
Who's Sadie?

2546
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,909
No, your daughter.
Your younger?

2547
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:44,995
The big one.

2548
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:48,550
Your older.
I know, I know that.
A wonderful girl.

2549
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:52,193
Hey, guys,
some of us need to leave.

2550
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,239
Would this be a good
moment to sneak out?

2551
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,438
Where is Dad going?

2552
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:12,232
Best birthday ever!

2553
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,319
(TIRES SCREECHING)

2554
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,158
(SCREAMS)
Oh, shit!

2555
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,309
Bike lane, asshole!

2556
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:24,591
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

2557
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,551
Your dad's still here.

2558
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:30,388
DEBBIE: I know.
It's kind of weird.

2559
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,438
Where the hell is Pete?

2560
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,589
Um...

2561
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,510
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

2562
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:39,988
Mm-hmm.

2563
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,235
Hi, Joseph.

2564
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,675
Hi.

2565
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,995
Do you want a piece of cake?

2566
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:48,999
Oh! Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

2567
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,269
All right, then.

2568
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,314
They are so cute.

2569
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,435
So cute.

2570
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,959
He looks exactly
like Tom Petty.

2571
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,239
(HONKING)

2572
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,993
Go around.

2573
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,440
Watch it, watch it!

2574
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:17,629
Hey, Pete! Great party!

2575
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,989
Yeah.

2576
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,474
The best!

2577
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,428
And then we shake it.

2578
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,710
(CHUCKLES)
And then
a restaurant comes up.

2579
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,872
Dad, excuse me.
I'm gonna go look
for Pete right now.

2580
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,759
Would you mind staying
with the girls for
just a little bit?

2581
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,309
Well, if you want me to.

2582
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,992
If you don't mind.
You don't have to.

2583
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,315
Sure.

2584
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,314
Can I let Sadie
show me the last
episode of Lost?.

2585
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,839
She asked me if I'd
seen it and I haven't.

2586
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,229
Yeah, that would be nice.

2587
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,477
Thank you.
Thank you.

2588
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,674
She said we could watch it.
Come on.

2589
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,920
I'm gonna let you
watch Lost. Come on.

2590
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,353
(GIGGLING)

2591
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,195
Is it scary?

2592
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:02,715
I'll cover your eyes
if it gets too scary.

2593
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,636
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

2594
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,994
Shh. Larry, please.

2595
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,595
(YELLS)

2596
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,635
(GROANS)

2597
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,198
Are you fucking kidding me?

2598
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,516
Are you fucking kidding me?

2599
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,318
You opened your door on me.

2600
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,074
I didn't open my
fucking door on you.
I opened my door!

2601
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,750
Aw, fuck.
I was right there!

2602
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,271
You're supposed to look
before you open your door!

2603
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,674
I was in a fucking bike path!

2604
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,830
That's a blind spot.
There's no fucking bike path.

2605
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:14,150
It's a residential section.
Get your head out of your ass.

2606
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:15,269
Pay attention!

2607
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,918
Open your goddamn eyes.
What are you doing,
sleepwalking?

2608
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,556
You're supposed to look
to see if a biker's
coming through.

2609
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,675
You're supposed to look!

2610
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:24,115
It's not my job to
look out for you.
You look out for yourself.

2611
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:25,758
I don't look out for you.
I don't see you.

2612
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:28,076
I don't know
where the fuck you are
or what you're doing.

2613
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,430
No one is ever
looking out for me!

2614
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,950
I need your name
and your number.

2615
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,109
Why?

2616
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,235
Because you're
gonna pay for my door.

2617
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,429
PETE: Fuck you!

2618
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,950
Why don't you pay
for my bike and my face,
you fucking prick?

2619
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,109
(GASPS)

2620
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,959
(GROANS)
Don't disrespect me.

2621
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,634
LARRY: Are you sure
that's him?

2622
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,992
I don't think that's him.

2623
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,469
(GROANS)

2624
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,631
I gotta write down
your license plate.

2625
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:07,279
"Range Rover of Sunland."

2626
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,676
What are you doing?
Ow.

2627
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:22,831
I guess the party
didn't turn out
like you planned.

2628
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,951
It wasn't a good party.

2629
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,195
Hi.
Hi.

2630
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,918
I'll bring you in
as soon as his
X-rays are finished.

2631
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,592
Okay. Is he okay?
Okay.

2632
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,593
Yeah, he has a broken rib
and he's been crying
a little bit.

2633
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:36,352
But he'll be fine.

2634
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,995
You know, Pete was
never a real fighter.

2635
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:46,269
But that's why he married you.
That's why he loves you.

2636
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:48,351
Because you're
the fighter.

2637
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,435
And you need that.

2638
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,478
One person
in a relationship
has got to punch.

2639
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,634
Do you mean
that in a good way?

2640
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:58,877
Oh, it's a high compliment.

2641
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,474
Thanks.

2642
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,558
Listen, I know what
you're worried about.

2643
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,110
You think he's
gonna turn into me,

2644
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,559
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

2645
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,837
He's smarter and
probably a little cuter.

2646
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,837
A little less Jew-y.

2647
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:20,517
Although after 50,
that's all gonna change.

2648
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,558
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a rabbi.

2649
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,829
But the good
news is, you know,

2650
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:29,314
he'll love you forever.

2651
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:31,118
That's in our DNA.

2652
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:33,152
We stick around.

2653
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,676
He worries
about you, you know.

2654
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,478
It puts a lot of
pressure on him.

2655
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,233
I know, I just don't have
anyone else to
talk to about it.

2656
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:42,753
Why don't you
talk to Claire?

2657
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:44,910
If I open up to her,
she'll leave me.

2658
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,309
No, she won't.

2659
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,231
Mmm.
Larry, she loves you.

2660
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:51,676
I know, but there's
a certain point at
which you just can't stay.

2661
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,079
(CHUCKLES)

2662
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,559
I guess it's hard
to forgive somebody

2663
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:00,279
if they don't
formally apologize to you.

2664
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,828
Are you apologizing?

2665
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,115
I'm very close.

2666
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,358
Yes, I'm sorry.

2667
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,516
I'm glad everybody's okay.

2668
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,475
Okay, thanks.

2669
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,551
Oh, thank you.

2670
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,913
All right, I'm off.

2671
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,115
Okay.

2672
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,108
This is awkward.

2673
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,035
What?

2674
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:41,111
I need $40 for a cab.

2675
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:43,997
(LAUGHS) That's funny.

2676
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:45,789
No, I'm not kidding.

2677
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:47,475
Oh, yeah.

2678
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:49,432
You drove me, honey.
I wasn't prepared.

2679
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:51,716
I know.
I only have a hundred.

2680
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:52,835
It's okay.

2681
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,910
I'll bring you the change.

2682
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,074
All right.
Give him a kiss for me.

2683
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,436
(STAMMERS) I don't get it.

2684
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,273
See, it's not sad.

2685
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:26,359
It's happy, because
they helped each other
achieve their destiny.

2686
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:31,229
Great. I'm gonna have
some freaky-ass nightmares.

2687
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,192
Hi.
Hi.

2688
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,515
(SIGHS)

2689
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:56,838
I really liked our
life so much better

2690
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:59,434
before we tried to
change everything.

2691
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:01,473
I'm sorry.

2692
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:05,793
No, I'm sorry.
I don't want to
keep anything from you.

2693
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,752
I love you, you're my wife.

2694
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,749
I just didn't
want to let you down.

2695
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:14,593
Are you mad
that I'm pregnant?

2696
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:17,559
No. I'm not mad,
I'm thrilled.

2697
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:19,189
You don't feel trapped?

2698
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:21,991
I sometimes feel
like I trapped you.

2699
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,559
I don't feel trapped.

2700
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:25,273
Really?
No.

2701
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:27,471
You should,
because I have trapped you.

2702
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,549
You can't go anywhere.

2703
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,154
I'm gonna get you pregnant
every 10 years for
the rest of your life.

2704
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,390
You can never leave me. Ever.

2705
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,232
I never feel trapped
by you.

2706
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:39,596
I'm so happy
to be with you and
I love you so much.

2707
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:42,992
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

2708
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,080
God damn it,
why am I crying
like this?

2709
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,039
Something is wrong
with me.

2710
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,634
You're pregnant.

2711
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:51,074
Oh, yeah.

2712
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,509
Shit.

2713
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:56,312
I was just outside
telling your dad
that I liked him.

2714
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,197
What if he
thinks I like him now?

2715
02:08:58,280 --> 02:08:59,269
No, he won't think that.

2716
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,510
I don't want him to think
I like him that much.

2717
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,113
No, it will never happen.

2718
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:07,793
Can you believe it?
This is the craziest
thing ever.

2719
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:10,155
What are we gonna do
with a third baby?

2720
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,630
I have no idea.
How are we going to afford it?

2721
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:14,714
We'll sell the house.

2722
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,309
We don't have to.

2723
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:18,231
We kind of do.
We kind of do.

2724
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:20,635
We'll make new memories
in a new house.

2725
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:22,755
I love you.

2726
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:27,474
Is there anything
you want to do
for your birthday?

2727
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,710
It's been the worst
birthday ever.

2728
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,836
There is one thing,
but I don't
think you'll like it.

2729
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:34,434
What?

2730
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:37,791
I wouldn't mind
going to see some music.
Would you want to do that?

2731
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:39,109
Yeah.

2732
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:40,235
Really?
Yeah.

2733
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,515
I don't believe you,
but you're sweet
for saying that.

2734
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,592
How do we break
you out of here?

2735
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:47,439
I can just leave
on my own volition.
It's not a mental institution.

2736
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,558
Can you?
Yes.

2737
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:51,312
It's not like
One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest.

2738
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,559
Please don't put
a pillow over my face.

2739
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,795
(LAUGHING)

2740
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,548
Let's get outta here,
McMurphy.

2741
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,629
You got it, Chief.

2742
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,512
Will you carry me?

2743
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,311
You've been carrying me
all this time.

2744
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,674
(GROANS)

2745
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:26,996
(SINGING ALT-COUNTRY SONG)

2746
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,509
Thanks.

2747
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:44,838
I like this song.

2748
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:46,874
Really?

2749
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,669
Why?

2750
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:55,313
Why don't you sign him?

2751
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:59,109
Ryan Adams?
No, he wouldn't sign with me.

2752
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:01,277
Why not? You're the best.

2753
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:02,869
He is in between labels.

2754
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,317
Let's go try and talk
to him after the show.

2755
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,234
(VOCALIZING)

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

2757
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:00,992
RYAN: Thank you.

2758
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,312
I'm sorry if I'm not
all fancy pants
and wealthy

2759
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,910
and showing it all off
with my Vidal
Sassoon haircuts.

2760
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:42,469
Sorry.

2761
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,313
Quit slow-blinking at me.

2762
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:46,159
I'm sorry.
Okay...

2763
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,792
I would like to rear
up and jackknife my legs

2764
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,838
and kick you both
in the fucking jaw
with my foot bone.

(LAUGHING)

2766
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,190
That's what I
would fucking love.

2767
02:12:57,320 --> 02:13:00,835
I wish my fucking foot
would go right
through your skull.

2768
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,275
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

2769
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,509
I will fucking kill you.

2770
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,513
You corner me,
I will fucking
chew through you.

2771
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:09,874
I'll chew through you!

2772
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:13,669
Slow-blinking eyes.
I will chew off
your fucking eyelids.

2773
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:15,678
You won't
slow-blink at me,
will you?

2774
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,512
Did you drink
before you came here?

2775
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,716
No, but I'm gonna
start drinking.

2776
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:23,276
I'm gonna slit somebody
open like a fish
and drink their blood.

2777
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,713
That's what I'm gonna drink

2778
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:27,912
if we don't start
getting to
the fucking point here.

2779
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:30,590
Probably I'm gonna start
with Karen Carpenter's head.

2780
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:34,795
I'm gonna rip her head off
and I'm gonna drink her blood.

2781
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:36,991
And then I'm gonna come back
and light you on fire.

2782
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:39,793
I'm gonna light
you all on fire.

2783
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:41,711
But I'm gonna
start with you, Jill.

2784
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,228
I'm gonna
fucking torch you.

2785
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:46,911
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go buy
a fucking pickup truck.

2786
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,194
And a cord of rope.

2787
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:50,430
And I'm gonna string it
around all three of
your fucking necks

2788
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,351
and then drive
around town, dragging you.

2789
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,674
That's what I'm
gonna fucking do.

2790
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,990
That's completely
uncalled for.

2791
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:58,834
Really, Jill?
Do you think it is?

2792
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:02,271
Fuck off, Jill.
God, everybody
fucking hates you.

2793
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:03,949
God!

2794
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:05,075
That isn't even nice.

2795
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:08,277
Go suck a big
fucking dick, Jill.

02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:10,519
JILL: That's totally
uncalled for, Catherine.

2797
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,875
You're a fucking asshole.
Everybody hates you.

2798
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,149
They hate your fucking bob.

2799
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:17,470
And I'm glad
your husband died.

2800
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:20,877
Because you're
a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

2801
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:23,791
I would. Kill myself.

2802
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,795

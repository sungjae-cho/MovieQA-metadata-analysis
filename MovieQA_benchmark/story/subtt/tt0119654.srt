1
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,797
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,189
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,694
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,707
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,709
Where you coming from?

6
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,752
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,963
Sure. Let's take a look
at your catch.

8
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,173
Come on.

9
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,514
I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,522
What do you get?
100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:15,150
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You'll need it.

12
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,739
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,240
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,741
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,243
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,661
Really?

17
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,163
Who you betting on?

18
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,040
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,779
We've got a winner here.

20
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,280
Oh, I know.

21
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,287
Sir, you can't...

22
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,788
Don't "sir" me, young man.

23
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,666
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

24
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,839
We'll chat with our friend.
You hit the road.

25
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,969
Keep on protecting us from
the dangerous aliens.

26
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:44,807
You ever hear of Division 6?

27
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,809
There is no Division 6.

28
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,310
This is bullshit.

29
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,895
Hell, yeah.

30
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:54,315
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town.

31
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:57,317
I'll bet you're not
from anywhere near here.

32
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,196
Mikey?

33
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,955
Mikey, when they let you out of jail?

34
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,331
Political refugee.

35
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,376
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

36
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,211
- One?
- Try seven.

37
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,882
You hand me that head.

38
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,722
Put up your arms and flippers.

39
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,190
Shit!

40
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,903
Shoot him!

41
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,431
- "That".
- That....

42
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:28,769
Was not human. I know.
You got some entrails on you.

43
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:31,437
What the hell?

44
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,439
The situation's under control.

45
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,941
Give me your attention for a moment.

46
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:38,234
I'll tell you what happened.

47
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,578
This is called a neuralizer.
It's a gift from friends from out of town.

48
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:53,080
This red eye isolates...

49
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:56,959
the brain's impulses,
specifically the ones for memory.

50
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,460
Give me a splay burn on
the perimeter...

51
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,963
with holes at 40, 60,
and 80 metres...

52
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,381
from right here.
Thank you.

53
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:10,970
That's good.

54
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,763
What's going on?

55
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,473
Excellent question.

56
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:17,558
The answer you're looking for
lies right here.

57
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,937
Who are you, really?

58
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,397
Really?

59
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,817
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

60
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,780
Damn, what a gullible breed.

61
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,451
I'm serious. You're lucky
to be alive after that blast.

62
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,493
What blast?

63
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:41,495
The underground gas main.

64
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,998
You should exercise caution
before firing...

65
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,916
I'll tell you that now.
Especially you.

66
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,336
Have yourself checked out with EMS
before you leave.

67
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,515
I'm sorry about back there.

68
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:07,017
It happens.

69
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,767
Didn't used to.

70
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,813
The spirit's willing, Kay...

71
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,190
but the rest of me....

72
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,445
They're beautiful, aren't they?

73
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,071
The stars.

74
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,741
We neverjust look anymore.

75
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:34,039
I'll tell you, Kay...

76
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,708
I will miss the chase.

77
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,588
No, Dee...

78
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,715
you won't.

79
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,384
Freeze!

80
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:50,135
NYPD! Freeze!

81
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,389
All yours, Edwards.

82
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,350
Freeze means stop!

83
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,732
What the hell?!

84
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,991
It just be raining black people
in New York.

85
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,513
Do you see this?

86
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:44,973
N-Y-P-D!

87
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,517
Means I will knock your punk-ass down!

88
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,018
He's coming!

89
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:53,396
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

90
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,526
You trying to catch a beat-down?

91
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,167
What's up?

92
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,127
He's coming.

93
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:14,129
He's coming because I failed.
Now he'll kill me.

94
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,798
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

95
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,134
You don't understand.

96
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,219
Your world's gonna end.

97
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,307
What are you?

98
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,147
Watch that ledge. Watch the ledge.

99
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:38,566
Come on down. We'll get those
eyes fixed, don't worry.

100
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,236
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!

101
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,660
I work my butt off to make a living.

102
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,163
All I want is to come home to
a fat steak on the table...

103
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:56,790
but instead I get this.
It looks like poison.

104
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,543
Don't take that away! I'm eating that!
It is poison, isn't it?

105
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:04,171
I swear, I wouldn't
be surprised if it was...

106
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:08,049
the way you skulk like a dog
been hit too much, or not enough!

107
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:09,676
I can't decide.

108
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,678
You're useless, Beatrice.

109
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:15,722
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck!

110
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,148
Figures.

111
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,157
What the heck is it?

112
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,827
Get your big butt back in the house.

113
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:56,423
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

114
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,216
You can have my gun...

115
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:01,719
when you pry it
from my dead fingers.

116
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:04,013
Your proposal is acceptable.

117
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:48,257
Edgar, what on earth was that?

118
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:49,634
Sugar.

119
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,135
I've never seen sugar do that.

120
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:55,013
Give me sugar.

121
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:01,810
In water.

122
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:09,650
More.

123
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,154
More.

124
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,960
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

125
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,095
Is that better?

126
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,955
"The perpetrator blinked
two sets of eyelids".

127
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,957
Blinked with both eyes?

128
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,959
He blinked one set,
then a completely different set.

129
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,795
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

130
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:28,173
Was that before or after he drew
the weapon that you claim...

131
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,967
evaporated into a million pieces?

132
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,552
After, sir.

133
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:37,139
Why is it that no other officers saw
either of these events?

134
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:40,475
Some of them are
soggy around the midsection.

135
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,976
They weren't able to keep up.

136
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,395
If you were half the man I am...

137
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,898
I am half the man that you are.

138
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,982
What is your problem?

139
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,483
You're in my face.

140
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,485
- I think he threw him off the roof.
- You next.

141
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:54,486
I wanna talk to you.

142
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:57,656
Ten minutes,
you take your best shot, tough guy.

143
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,326
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard!

144
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:10,000
I believe you. Laurel Weaver.
Deputy Medical Examiner.

145
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,001
Find me at the morgue. I'll show you.

146
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,336
Wait.

147
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,213
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:19,508
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's
office working on the John Doe?

149
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,593
- That's right.
- Will you look at this, please?

150
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,017
Some night, huh?

151
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,519
Some night.

152
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,853
They were gills, not eyelids.

153
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,814
Gills. He was out of breath.

154
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,024
Who are you?

155
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,526
Did he say anything to you?

156
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,320
He said the world was
coming to an end.

157
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,821
Did he say when?

158
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,037
Would you recognize his weapon
if you saw it again?

159
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:56,622
Absolutely.

160
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,041
Come on, let's take a ride.

161
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,043
Wait a minute. Look, I got
tons of paperwork...

162
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,545
It's all done.

163
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:05,546
Good work.

164
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:08,549
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough.

165
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,508
That's double tough.

166
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:20,641
So who exactly are you with?

167
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,560
So who exactly are you with?

168
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,061
FBI? NSA?

169
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,274
I'm part of a bureau that licenses,
monitors and polices aliens on Earth.

170
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,067
Yeah, whatever.

171
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,651
We're here.

172
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,780
This is where we're going?

173
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,573
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.

174
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:41,075
He buys from chain-snatchers.
Doesn't sell guns.

175
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,493
Really?

176
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,077
All right, look.

177
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:48,373
I'm gonna go in and put my thing down,
but when I come out, I want answers.

178
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:50,916
Okay, go put your thing down.

179
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,630
Officer Eduardo!

180
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,924
How did these get here?
I thought I turned them in.

181
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,636
I hear you're into something hotter
than stolen Rolexes.

182
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:07,638
I deal crack, but I still work here.
I love the hours.

183
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:10,725
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass!
Weird ones.

184
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,810
Come on!
What you see is what I got.

185
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,439
Show him the imports, Jeebs.

186
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:21,150
Hey, Kay. How are you?

187
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,153
- Show him the imports.
- I got out of that business.

188
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,154
Why do you lie to me?

189
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,655
Hold on a second.

190
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:29,157
I'll count to three.

191
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:32,159
He'll do it, Jeebs.
That man does not look stable.

192
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,162
You know what? He's crazy
when he's like this.

193
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:37,163
He's always crazy.
Get a massage.

194
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:38,915
Take a cruise...

195
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,666
- Drop the weapon.
- I warned him.

196
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,667
Drop the weapon!

197
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,169
- You warned him.
- I'll kill you.

198
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,171
You insensitive jerk!

199
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:53,676
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

200
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:57,055
Show us the merchandise,
or you'll lose another head.

201
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,941
Mr. Edwards....

202
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:17,530
There, the one in the middle.

203
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:24,202
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

204
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:27,205
to an unlicensed cephalopoid!
You piece of...

205
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,705
He looked okay to me.

206
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:30,707
It was for an assassination.
The target?

207
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,209
I don't know.

208
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,502
- Goddamn it!
- I don't know!

209
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,712
All that's confiscated.

210
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:41,049
Be on the next transport off this rock,
or I shoot where it don't grow back.

211
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,430
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

212
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,410
Searching for a handle on the moment?

213
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:16,579
I can't help you.

214
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,747
The only comfort I can offer...

215
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:22,333
is my promise that tomorrow
you won't remember a thing.

216
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,587
That's not exactly
some shit you forget.

217
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,838
Ever seen one of these?

218
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,217
She looks over to her husband...

219
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,137
then sets it down in her lap
and says:

220
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,556
"Honey, this one's eating my popcorn".

221
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,268
Get it?

222
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,270
This one's eating....

223
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,773
Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls.

224
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,275
Wait a minute.

225
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,276
Who are you?

226
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:56,278
See what I mean about tequila?
You're very bright.

227
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,280
But you need to lay off the sauce.

228
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,782
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

229
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,283
Be there...

230
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,076
or be square.

231
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,637
Well, well, well.

232
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,973
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

233
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,308
I got an eviction notice for you.

234
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:35,311
Just what exactly
do you think you're doing here?

235
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:37,813
Taking care of your pest problem.

236
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,481
Pest problem?

237
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:41,149
Pest?

238
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,818
You got a hell of an infestation.

239
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:46,779
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

240
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:49,823
Everywhere I look, nothing but
undeveloped, unevolved...

241
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:52,325
barely conscious pond scum...

242
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:55,369
totally convinced
of their own superiority...

243
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,871
as they scurry about their short...

244
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:59,789
pointless lives.

245
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,377
Don't you wanna get rid of them?

246
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:06,211
In the worst way.

247
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,409
Help you?

248
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,910
This dude gave me this card...

249
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,412
Elevator.

250
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:13,976
You're late. Sit down.

251
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,941
My name is Zed.

252
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,778
You're all here
because you're the best.

253
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:29,238
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs,
Army Rangers, NYPD.

254
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:32,449
We want one of you.

255
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:33,950
Just one.

256
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,953
What will follow is
a series of simple tests...

257
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,955
for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

258
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:42,958
I see we have a question.

259
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:46,169
I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this but...

260
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:48,463
why are we here?

261
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:49,755
Son.

262
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:52,966
Lieutenant Jensen.
West Point graduate with honours.

263
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,886
We're here because you want
the best of the best of the best, sir!

264
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:04,476
What's so funny, Edwards?

265
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:06,937
Your boy, Captain America, here.

266
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,980
"The best of the best
of the best, sir!"

267
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,816
"With honours".

268
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,985
and has no clue why we're here.

269
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:18,321
That's just very funny to me.

270
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:22,324
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

271
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,540
Okay, let's get going.

272
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:58,278
Wanna get down on this?

273
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:25,301
Edwards, what happened?

274
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:27,260
Hesitated.

275
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:33,140
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

276
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:36,227
She was the only one
that seemed dangerous.

277
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:37,728
How'd you figure that?

278
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:40,730
I was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light...

279
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,732
but he's just working out.

280
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:46,235
How'd I feel if somebody bust
my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

281
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,654
Then I saw this snarling beast.

282
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,739
I noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized...

283
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,242
he's not snarling,
he's sneezing.

284
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,742
Ain't no threat there.

285
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,244
Then I saw Tiffany.

286
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,247
8-year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

287
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,249
bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books?

288
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,251
She about to start some shit.

289
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,128
Those books are
way too advanced for her.

290
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,755
If you ask me, she's up to something.

291
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,715
I'd appreciate it if you
eased up about it.

292
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,012
Or do I owe her an apology?

293
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,438
Good shot, though, right?

294
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:36,276
He has a problem with authority.

295
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:37,736
So do I.

296
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,281
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

297
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,615
That's gotta be tough enough.

298
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:46,994
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

299
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,294
Gentlemen, congratulations.

300
00:28:57,294 --> 00:29:01,047
You're everything we expect
from years of government training.

301
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:05,051
If you'll just follow me,
we have one more test to administer.

302
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:06,926
An eye exam.

303
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,773
Where are you going?

304
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,316
What the hell is all this?

305
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:27,819
In the 1950s, the government
started an underfunded agency...

306
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:30,821
with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact...

307
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,823
with a race not of this planet.

308
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:35,241
Look at the end of this device.

309
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,328
Everyone thought the agency
was a joke, except the aliens...

310
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,747
who made contact on March 2, 1961
outside New York.

311
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,918
There were nine of us the first night.
Seven agents, one astronomer...

312
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,336
and a dumb kid who'd gotten lost.

313
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,089
You brought that tall man some flowers.

314
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:53,340
This way.

315
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,843
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

316
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:00,763
Wanted Earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet.

317
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:02,348
You ever see Casablanca?

318
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,349
Same thing, except no Nazis.

319
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,769
We agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing.

320
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:12,898
So these are real flying saucers
and the World's Fair was a cover-up?

321
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:14,358
Why hold it in Queens?

322
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:17,860
More nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret.

323
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,072
Not to change the subject, but when
was the last time you got a CAT scan?

324
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,701
- Six months ago. It's company policy.
- Make another appointment.

325
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,870
Tell your boy Zed I had
an absolutely wonderful time...

326
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,289
and thank you for everything,
but show me the door.

327
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,626
All right. I'm getting some coffee.
You want some?

328
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,002
No, thank you, I'm fine.

329
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,425
How you doing?

330
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:46,884
Hi, Kay.

331
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,429
- That's not decaf, is it?
- Viennese cinnamon.

332
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,182
Don't tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream. I hate it.

333
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,811
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

334
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,938
You guys getting along all right?

335
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,899
Don't work too hard.

336
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:10,404
Sure you don't want some coffee?

337
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,244
Here's the deal.

338
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:21,955
At any given time, there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet.

339
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:24,374
Most of them here in Manhattan.

340
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,460
Most of them are decent.
Just trying to make a living.

341
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,379
- Cab drivers?
- Not as many as you'd think.

342
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:33,465
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue. Don't want one.

343
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:37,051
They're happy. They think
they have a good bead on things.

344
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:41,680
People are smart.
They can handle it.

345
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:42,972
A person is smart.

346
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:46,684
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals, and you know it.

347
00:31:47,477 --> 00:31:50,479
1500 years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was...

348
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,856
the centre of the universe.

349
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,491
Imagine what you'll know...

350
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:06,116
tomorrow.

351
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,412
- What's the catch?
- The catch?

352
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,998
The catch is, you will sever
all human contact.

353
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,959
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere...

354
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:20,462
ever.

355
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,925
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

356
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:32,514
Is it worth it?

357
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,474
Yeah, it's worth it.

358
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,143
If you're strong enough.

359
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,861
What's up, pops?

360
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:51,078
I'm in...

361
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:54,498
because there's some
next-level shit going on here.

362
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:58,084
Before y'all beam me up,
there's a few things to understand.

363
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:01,463
First off, you chose me,
so you recognize the skills.

364
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:06,091
I don't want nobody calling me
"son" or "kid" or "sport". Cool?

365
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,592
Cool. Whatever, slick.

366
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:11,054
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

367
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,222
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

368
00:34:13,222 --> 00:34:15,599
As of right now,
they mean precisely...

369
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,059
dick.

370
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,863
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

371
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,114
Duration of stay?

372
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,491
Lunch.

373
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,784
Any fruits or vegetables?

374
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:52,713
You wanna stay away from that guy.

375
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:55,340
He's grouchy.

376
00:34:55,674 --> 00:34:58,677
Three hours in customs
after a 17-trillion-mile trip...

377
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:00,678
will make anyone cranky.

378
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,680
What government branch
do we report to?

379
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,682
- None. They ask too many questions.
- Who pays for this?

380
00:35:05,682 --> 00:35:09,977
We hold patents on a few gadgets we
confiscated from out-of-state visitors.

381
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:12,688
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

382
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:15,023
This is a fascinating gadget.

383
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,693
It'll replace CDs soon. I'll have to
buy the White Album again.

384
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:22,822
That's fun. A universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it.

385
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:26,199
Human thought is so primitive.
It's looked upon...

386
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,702
as an infectious disease
in some galaxies.

387
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,703
That kind of makes you proud.

388
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,329
What's this?

389
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:37,208
Just be calm!

390
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,584
Relax!

391
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,711
Watch your head!

392
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:42,879
Someone get him some ice!

393
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:46,966
Look out! Move! Just move
when it's coming at you!

394
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,055
Damn!

395
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:56,099
I'll pay for that!

396
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:10,277
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

397
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,739
Practical joke
by the Great Attractor.

398
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,865
He thought it was funny.

399
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,409
Sorry, y'all.

400
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,911
It was a accident. Sorry.

401
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,747
Observation,
the heart of our endeavour.

402
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,166
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

403
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:29,585
This map shows the location
of every alien on Earth.

404
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,254
Some are under constant surveillance.

405
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:34,255
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

406
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:37,759
In public, they're as normal
as you are, but in private....

407
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,718
You'll get the idea.

408
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,720
Oh, man.

409
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:44,139
Doesn't make any sense, right?

410
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,266
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

411
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,269
In third grade, everyone said
I was crazy, but I knew our teacher...

412
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,772
had to be from Venus or something.

413
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:57,232
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

414
00:36:58,275 --> 00:36:59,276
revolve.

415
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,736
Class...

416
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,655
be quiet and pay attention!

417
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,282
If I have to tell you...

418
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,241
one more time....

419
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,079
Let's put it on.

420
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:13,788
Put what on?

421
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:16,207
The last suit you'll ever wear.

422
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,803
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

423
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:34,055
by MiB Special Services.

424
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:37,307
You'll conform to
the identity we give you...

425
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:40,435
eat where we tellyou,
live where we tellyou.

426
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:41,812
From now on...

427
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:44,814
you'll have no identifying
marks ofany kind.

428
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:47,358
You will not stand out in any way.

429
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:49,818
Your entire image is crafted...

430
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:53,113
to leave no lasting memory
with anyone you meet.

431
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:55,823
You are a rumour,
recognizable only as...

432
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:58,701
dej. vu and dismissed
just as quickly.

433
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:01,494
You don't exist.
You were neverborn.

434
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,872
Anonymity is yourname.

435
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,583
Silence, yournative tongue.

436
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,336
You're no longerpart ofthe system.

437
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,838
You are above the system. Over it.

438
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:15,381
Beyond it.

439
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,259
We're "them". We're "they".

440
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,469
We are the Men in Black.

441
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,145
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

442
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,898
I make this look good.

443
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,402
We're gonna go for a little ride.

444
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,323
I'll put you down here for a minute,
and Daddy will be right back.

445
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,434
Okay, now we're ready to go
for a little ride.

446
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:22,895
We'll meet one of Daddy's friends,
and you'll like him.

447
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,732
Okay, let's see.

448
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:32,195
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect
of Singalee...

449
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:35,447
touching down in the forest
outside Portland tonight.

450
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:38,158
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

451
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,953
Here. Red letter from last night.

452
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:45,455
We had an unauthorized landing
in upstate New York.

453
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:47,457
Keep your ears open
on this one.

454
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:50,793
We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger down here.

455
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:54,797
We got a skimmer.

456
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,965
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

457
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:58,424
Redgick.

458
00:39:58,466 --> 00:40:01,469
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's out of town...

459
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,971
stuck on the New Jersey turnpike.

460
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,973
Take junior with you.

461
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:08,849
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

462
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:10,851
Go get him, tiger.

463
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:20,067
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger".

464
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,403
Zed....

465
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,072
He just....

466
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:29,993
Unlimited technology from the
whole universe, and we cruise around...

467
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:31,827
in a Ford POS.

468
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:36,039
Fasten your seat belt.

469
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:38,499
We gotta work on your people skills.

470
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:41,502
You'd get a better reaction
if you were polite.

471
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:43,003
Fasten your seat belt, please.

472
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:45,297
Good. Did you hurt yourself?

473
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:52,136
The red button there, kid.
Don't ever touch the red button.

474
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:05,230
All right, pop,
that'll be $72 there.

475
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:08,608
Okay, sweetie, let me pay
the impolite driver.

476
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:13,620
Six is up!

477
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,080
Where is lvan?

478
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,915
Gave him a break.

479
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:44,104
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

480
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,981
You're right about one thing.

481
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,369
You're not going anywhere.

482
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:22,885
Your licence and registration, please.

483
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,182
Like to see your other licence
and registration, please.

484
00:43:36,188 --> 00:43:39,858
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?

485
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,319
It's my wife. She's....
Well, look.

486
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:49,198
No big deal.

487
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,576
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

488
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:55,662
And you handle this.

489
00:43:56,204 --> 00:43:57,706
What?! Me?

490
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:00,208
- You just catch.
- Does he know what he's doing?

491
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,960
He does it all the time.
Let him work.

492
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:12,760
Damn, man!

493
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,679
Something's peeking!

494
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:18,723
You're headed out of town.

495
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,100
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?

496
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:24,228
- It's a ship.
- I saw no departure clearance.

497
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,729
You didn't?

498
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,606
It's an emergency.

499
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,233
You're doing fine!

500
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:33,986
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet?

501
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,738
We don't like
the neighbourhood anymore.

502
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:39,032
Some of the new arrivals....

503
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,743
New arrivals? Have anything to do
with the crasher last night?

504
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:44,536
Excuse me, miss!

505
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:49,207
Oh, man.

506
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:51,209
Oh, man!

507
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,586
Look.

508
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:56,213
Oh, man!

509
00:44:57,756 --> 00:45:00,299
Congratulations, Redge.
It's a...

510
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:02,260
squid.

511
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:07,597
You know, it's...

512
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:09,808
actually kind of...

513
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,230
cute.

514
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:27,281
Anything about that seem unusual?

515
00:45:29,782 --> 00:45:31,784
What would scare Redgick so badly...

516
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:34,286
that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

517
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:36,538
We'll check the hot sheets.

518
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:43,294
These are "hot sheets"?

519
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:45,795
Best investigative reporting on Earth.

520
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:49,299
Read The New York Times if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.

521
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:53,260
Cannot believe you're looking for tips
in the supermarket tabloids.

522
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,263
Not "looking for".

523
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:58,180
Found.

524
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:14,819
- Wait a minute, slow down.
- Why?

525
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:18,531
Give her time to get the wrong
impression. Makes it smoother.

526
00:46:19,324 --> 00:46:20,824
Can I help you?

527
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:24,328
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim,
this is Agent Black, FBI.

528
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,329
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

529
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,830
Gonna make fun of me too?

530
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,833
No, we do not have a sense of humour
we're aware of. May we come in?

531
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:35,170
Sure.

532
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:36,880
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?

533
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,672
Oh, yes, please.

534
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:45,386
The chief of police came
to the house...

535
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,680
and did an investigation.

536
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,350
Took a police report and writ down
everything I said...

537
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,393
not believing one thing I said.

538
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,394
Sort of poking fun at me.

539
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:57,396
He asked me, "If he was murdered...

540
00:46:57,396 --> 00:47:00,399
how was he able to walk
back in the house?"

541
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:03,401
I gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped.

542
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:06,570
I tell you, I know Edgar,
and that wasn't Edgar.

543
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:10,241
It was like something was
wearing Edgar.

544
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:14,118
Like a suit...

545
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,246
an Edgar suit.

546
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:26,337
Dude was that ugly
before he was an alien.

547
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:30,465
I'm sorry.

548
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:32,801
Go on.

549
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:34,928
Anyway...

550
00:47:34,928 --> 00:47:37,179
I come to and he's gone.

551
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:38,931
He say anything?

552
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:41,391
Yes. He asked me for some water.

553
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:44,269
Some sugar water.

554
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:45,937
Sugar water?

555
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:49,314
I remember that right.
I thought that that was odd...

556
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:53,442
that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water...

557
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:55,444
or regular water...

558
00:47:55,444 --> 00:47:57,113
tap water.

559
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:00,782
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

560
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:03,451
The flash of light was not a U.F.O.

561
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:07,580
Gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from Venus.

562
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,456
Wait a minute.

563
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:12,959
That thing erases her memory,
and you just make up a new one?

564
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:14,961
A standard-issue neuralizer.

565
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:17,963
That weak-ass story is
the best you came up with?

566
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:20,632
All right. On a more personal note...

567
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:24,969
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You'll stay with your mama...

568
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,470
and decide you're better off.

569
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,556
Yeah, because he never
appreciated you anyway.

570
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,976
In fact, you know what?

571
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,978
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone...

572
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:39,397
you'll go in town,
find yourself some nice dresses.

573
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,276
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.

574
00:48:44,986 --> 00:48:48,572
And hire a decorator to come
in here quick because...damn!

575
00:48:56,537 --> 00:48:58,538
When do I get my own flashy...

576
00:48:58,538 --> 00:49:00,040
memory messer-upper?

577
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,875
When you grow up.

578
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:06,921
Please. Not green.

579
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:08,546
Oh, damn!

580
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:13,426
Do you know which alien leaves
a green spectral trail...

581
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:15,636
and craves sugar water?

582
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:19,556
That was on Jeopardy last night.
Damn, Alex said it was....

583
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,849
Zed, we have a bug.

584
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,936
So....
What? We don't like bugs?

585
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:27,812
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

586
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:31,899
They consume, infest, destroy,
live off the death of other species.

587
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:34,944
You were stung as a child, right?

588
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:38,780
lmagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

589
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:42,951
a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

590
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:46,411
is terrorizing Manhattan Island
in a new Edgar suit.

591
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,413
That sound like fun?

592
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:52,750
What's the move?

593
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:56,461
With a bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

594
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,973
Where do you want
contestant number 3?

595
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,933
Just leave it there.

596
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:12,975
What's with the cat?

597
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:15,894
There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

598
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:19,856
- What's the problem with the cat?
- It's your problem.

599
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:24,359
I hate the living.

600
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,487
Shall we?

601
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,638
Oh, my God!

602
00:51:03,058 --> 00:51:05,018
Buddy, what are you?

603
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:17,069
Subject was approximately 112 degrees
at time of autopsy...

604
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,572
indicating a temperature increase.

605
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:23,658
Examiner tried to verify this rectally,
but the subject had no rectum.

606
00:51:24,075 --> 00:51:25,577
Which is really...

607
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:26,953
Weird.

608
00:51:27,078 --> 00:51:31,123
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department
of Public Health. This is Dr. White.

609
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,584
You must not have a home life.

610
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:38,087
We watch the morgues carefully.
You have something unusual?

611
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:40,380
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

612
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:42,841
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

613
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,092
The first body was normal,
except he was broken in half.

614
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:47,094
But when I opened up
the other two, well....

615
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:48,888
Let me show you.

616
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:58,103
There's a skeletal structure
unlike anything I've seen.

617
00:51:58,103 --> 00:52:00,105
I'll have a look at it.

618
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:02,107
You and Dr. Weaver
check the other body.

619
00:52:02,107 --> 00:52:03,942
This way, doctor.

620
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:06,778
This one's even stranger.

621
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:10,113
I did a laparotomy.
I started with the stomach.

622
00:52:10,113 --> 00:52:13,450
But we can start with the
gastroesophageal junction.

623
00:52:14,617 --> 00:52:17,245
Let's start wherever you started at.

624
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,705
Okey-dokey.

625
00:52:28,129 --> 00:52:30,131
- Is this your cat?
- It is now.

626
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:32,632
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.

627
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:34,717
I'm sure he won't mind.

628
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,930
You have really pretty eyes.

629
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:42,182
Thank you.

630
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:46,644
Feel that?

631
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:49,938
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.

632
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:53,400
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs....

633
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,401
Nope, all fine.

634
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:57,611
They're all missing.

635
00:52:58,154 --> 00:52:59,155
Of course.

636
00:52:59,155 --> 00:53:02,115
That's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

637
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:06,161
What I was pointing out
is the fact that there are no...

638
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,287
pieces...

639
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:10,164
of them left.

640
00:53:10,164 --> 00:53:12,540
You know, so they're intact...

641
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,961
wherever they are whole.
That we can be sure of.

642
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,087
Have we met before?

643
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:21,631
I'm having a feeling of deja vu.

644
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:24,800
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

645
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,679
Wanna know what I think?
Don't tell him.

646
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,182
He's under enough stress.
I don't think it's a real body.

647
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:35,684
I think it's some kind of
transport unit for something else.

648
00:53:35,684 --> 00:53:37,728
The question is, what?

649
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,856
Is this freaking you out?

650
00:53:43,191 --> 00:53:44,692
No, girl.

651
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:49,029
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it's late?

652
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,742
Dr. White.

653
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:57,745
Excuse me.

654
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:04,083
What do you think?

655
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:07,711
Interesting. She got
a "Queen of the Undead" thing going...

656
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,213
Of the body.

657
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:10,214
Great body.

658
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:11,923
The dead body.

659
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,717
You have to look at that thing.

660
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:16,593
You recognize him?

661
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,722
He looks like the big guy I saw
at headquarters, only deader.

662
00:54:20,722 --> 00:54:22,515
What killed him?

663
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:24,600
A bug?

664
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:27,144
You're up, slugger.

665
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:32,440
Look at this.

666
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,818
What the hell is that?

667
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,251
Must....

668
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,461
To prevent...

669
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,881
contest.

670
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:05,759
What are you saying?

671
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:07,302
To prevent....

672
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:08,970
To prevent...

673
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:10,930
struggle?

674
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:14,308
To prevent....

675
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:15,308
War?

676
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:16,601
War.

677
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:20,980
The Galaxy...

678
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:23,899
is on...

679
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:25,985
Orion's...

680
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,238
be...

681
00:55:32,823 --> 00:55:34,491
What is word?

682
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,285
The bed?

683
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:38,244
Belt? Orion's belt?

684
00:55:58,845 --> 00:56:02,097
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt".

685
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:04,683
What the hell does that mean?

686
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:09,353
Doctor...

687
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:10,855
whatever, come here.

688
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:14,816
Dr. Whatever? You guys aren't really
from the Department of Health.

689
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,152
Rosenberg. Damn!

690
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,197
The Arquillians won't like this.
He was one of the royal family.

691
00:56:21,864 --> 00:56:23,365
This is an alien...

692
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:26,868
and you're from a government agency
keeping it under wraps.

693
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:30,370
He said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt".

694
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,873
How else do you explain New York?

695
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:35,542
I was in this cab, and this guy was...

696
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:39,378
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
makes no sense.

697
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:43,340
That's what the little dude inside
the big dude's head said, right?

698
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:46,885
Damn, man!
You did the flashy thing already.

699
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,887
Whoever you are,
you'll have to show me I.D.

700
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:52,890
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.

701
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,891
- Would you stop that?
- What?

702
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,393
That thing will give her brain cancer.

703
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:59,895
Never hurt her before.
Close the doors.

704
00:56:59,895 --> 00:57:01,897
Special Services will be here.

705
00:57:01,897 --> 00:57:05,149
How many times have you
flashy-thinged that woman?

706
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:06,400
Couple.

707
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,695
- Don't you worry about long-term damage?
- A little.

708
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:11,905
- Have you flashy-thinged me?
- No.

709
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:14,491
I ain't playing with you! Have you?

710
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:27,168
I think I should be in charge
of the flashy thing.

711
00:57:27,419 --> 00:57:28,919
Not while I'm around.

712
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:31,422
You'll fricassee someone's brain.

713
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:35,299
We got two dead aliens and
a medical examiner needs a new memory.

714
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:40,011
Make it a happy memory.

715
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,124
Where is it?!

716
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,038
Hey, Zed.

717
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:04,540
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

718
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,043
The twins keep us on Centurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

719
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:11,046
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

720
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:13,339
Or have a psychotic episode.

721
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:14,548
Here's Orion.

722
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:18,052
It's a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

723
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:20,553
- Here's Orion's belt.
- The little guy said:

724
00:59:20,553 --> 00:59:23,807
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt".

725
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:27,059
There are no galaxies
on Orion's belt.

726
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:30,478
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

727
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:33,981
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.

728
00:59:35,566 --> 00:59:38,193
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

729
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,725
Pretty lady.

730
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:27,276
That grumpy guy's story's starting to
come into focus a little bit here.

731
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:31,988
So you were the guy in that picture
with the flowers?

732
01:00:32,613 --> 01:00:35,615
And, I take it,
she never got those flowers.

733
01:00:36,616 --> 01:00:39,578
So, what, she ever get married
or anything?

734
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:43,622
They say it's better to have
loved and lost...

735
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:46,124
than never to have loved at all.

736
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:47,542
Try it.

737
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,131
Look at this.

738
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:56,091
They're all leaving.

739
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:59,969
We've had 12 jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.

740
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:03,096
What do they know that we don't?

741
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:04,639
Why does a rat desert a ship?

742
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,393
Give me Lem Sat 4, please,
with a proton induction thermoscan.

743
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:12,438
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat 18.

744
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:16,441
All right, 4000.

745
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:22,154
An Arquillian battle cruiser.

746
01:01:22,154 --> 01:01:24,948
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

747
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:28,576
Speak of the devil.

748
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,161
They sound pissed.

749
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,162
Translate that. Step on it.

750
01:01:32,162 --> 01:01:35,999
Go to Rosenberg's jewellery store,
and see what you can turn up.

751
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,714
Give the kid a weapon.

752
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:56,099
- Series 4 De-atomizer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

753
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:57,892
Noisy Cricket.

754
01:01:59,685 --> 01:02:01,895
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

755
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:04,690
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer...

756
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:07,191
I get a little midget Cricket?

757
01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:13,029
Feel like I'm gonna break it.

758
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,317
Hey, this is my truck!

759
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,488
Make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

760
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:12,203
Please.

761
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:24,797
Who breaks into a jewellery store
and leaves the jewels?

762
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:27,342
Somebody not looking forjewellery.

763
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:32,137
This guy had a serious crush
on his cat.

764
01:03:34,513 --> 01:03:36,015
Get down!

765
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,103
Man!

766
01:03:43,813 --> 01:03:45,814
That's him. That's the bug!

767
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:47,691
In the Edgar suit!

768
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:11,836
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public!

769
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:13,838
We ain't got time for this bullshit!

770
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:16,715
There's a alien battle cruiser
about to...

771
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,843
There's always an alien battle
cruiser or a death ray...

772
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:22,845
or an intergalactic plague
about to wipe out life on Earth.

773
01:04:22,845 --> 01:04:25,848
The only way people get on
with their happy lives...

774
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:28,308
is they do not know about it!

775
01:04:33,354 --> 01:04:35,731
And don't worry about the bug.

776
01:04:35,856 --> 01:04:38,650
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

777
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:48,200
We need a containment crew...

778
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:50,451
on MacDougal Street.

779
01:04:50,868 --> 01:04:54,288
Containment may be a moot point.
The exodus continues.

780
01:04:54,372 --> 01:04:58,375
The party's over, and the last one
to leave gets stuck with the check.

781
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,585
You sorry little ingrates!

782
01:05:09,384 --> 01:05:10,885
What about the Arquillians?

783
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:14,596
We've translated part of the message:
"Deliver the Galaxy".

784
01:05:14,888 --> 01:05:18,225
- They don't want much, do they?
- Oh, it gets better.

785
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:20,560
They hold us responsible.

786
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,693
Where do you keep your dead?

787
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:32,945
I don't have any dead.

788
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:34,405
Where?

789
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:36,073
I don't know.

790
01:05:36,406 --> 01:05:38,199
The city morgue?

791
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,835
That's three for a dollar, sir!

792
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:54,421
It was some light
that refracted off of Venus...

793
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:56,423
into some swamp gas...

794
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:57,924
and that's what made the....

795
01:05:57,924 --> 01:05:59,675
All right, kid!

796
01:06:00,426 --> 01:06:01,927
Excuse me.
What's up?

797
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:04,930
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever that means.

798
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,931
We need help, a professional...

799
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:10,352
with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

800
01:06:10,435 --> 01:06:13,437
I hope the little twerp
hasn't skipped town.

801
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,440
If you'll gather over here....

802
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,693
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

803
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,321
If you look right here,
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

804
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:40,501
The worst disguise ever.
He's definitely an alien.

805
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,587
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry butt.

806
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:45,005
Busy, Frank?

807
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,507
Can't talk now.
My flight's leaving in...

808
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:49,008
Get your paws off!

809
01:06:49,008 --> 01:06:50,510
Call the pound!

810
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,511
The dog owes my friend money.

811
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,513
Arquillians and bugs,
what do you know?

812
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:56,640
- Nothing.
- Not a thing?

813
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:01,018
Stop, stop, stop it!
Okay, okay!

814
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:04,020
Rosenberg wasn't a two-bit Arquillian.

815
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,524
He was the guardian of the Galaxy.
He thought he'd be safe on Earth.

816
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,525
The bug had other plans.

817
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:12,486
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

818
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,030
If the bugs get it,
kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

819
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,031
Ask about the belt.

820
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:20,034
Rosenberg mentioned Orion's belt.
What did he mean?

821
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:22,119
- Beats me.
- Beats you?

822
01:07:22,536 --> 01:07:24,121
Not around.

823
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,708
It's a ventriloquist act.

824
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:30,960
The Galaxy is here!

825
01:07:31,544 --> 01:07:32,544
Here?

826
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,422
A galaxy's millions of stars
and planets.

827
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:38,549
When will you learn
that size doesn't matter?

828
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:42,052
If something's important,
it doesn't mean it's not small.

829
01:07:42,052 --> 01:07:43,053
How small?

830
01:07:43,053 --> 01:07:45,513
The size of a marble or a jewel.

831
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:48,558
Excuse me. I gotta be walked
before my flight.

832
01:07:48,558 --> 01:07:50,350
Get out of here.

833
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,188
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

834
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,832
When you want attention....

835
01:08:19,082 --> 01:08:20,083
Orion.

836
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,085
That's a pretty name.

837
01:08:22,586 --> 01:08:24,212
What's this?

838
01:09:18,674 --> 01:09:20,676
Yes, good, thank you.

839
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:23,552
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

840
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:28,765
What's up, Farmer John?

841
01:09:30,183 --> 01:09:32,435
A man came in here earlier.

842
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:34,187
A dead man.

843
01:09:34,187 --> 01:09:36,397
And that means what to me?

844
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:40,733
It was a very dear friend of mine.

845
01:09:41,693 --> 01:09:44,195
I believe he had an animal with him.

846
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:46,697
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

847
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:48,699
It means worlds to me.

848
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:50,701
I'd like to have it back.

849
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:54,203
I'll need picture I.D.,
proof of ownership of the cat...

850
01:09:54,704 --> 01:09:57,872
notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

851
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:00,917
Don't do that.

852
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:03,669
Do what?

853
01:10:04,211 --> 01:10:05,838
Don't do it.

854
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:10,174
Oh, man.

855
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:28,273
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.

856
01:10:28,273 --> 01:10:31,276
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It's not that hard.

857
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:35,487
But if you go in there, you'll start
flashing your brain ray in her face.

858
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:37,281
She'll wind up with leukemia.

859
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:41,659
The doctor don't need you flashing away
her med-school classes. Five minutes.

860
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:43,411
Two minutes.

861
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,788
Where's the animal?

862
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,290
I said I don't know.

863
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,833
Well, let's see if we can find it.

864
01:10:56,296 --> 01:10:57,672
Hello!

865
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:07,680
Hello!

866
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,810
- How you doing?
- Hello.

867
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,772
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

868
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:19,732
A cat came in with a corpse
the other day.

869
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:22,401
- "Orion" on the nametag?
- Right.

870
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:25,195
Well, this cat is a witness...

871
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,782
in a murder case.
I'll need to take him.

872
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:30,325
I don't know where the cat is.

873
01:11:30,325 --> 01:11:31,867
You don't?

874
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:35,537
No, but maybe you could take me
with you instead.

875
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:39,457
Damn, you do start fast,
don't you?

876
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,335
I'd really like to go with you...

877
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,752
now.

878
01:11:44,336 --> 01:11:46,463
And exactly why is that?

879
01:11:53,844 --> 01:11:56,179
I need to show you something.

880
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:57,847
Slow down.

881
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:01,350
- Girl, don't hit the gas like that!
- You don't understand.

882
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,644
You really need to see this.

883
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:07,480
I will. One thing. I gotta drive.
It's not some macho trip.

884
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:10,775
That's just the way I get down.

885
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:24,869
Look, stud, you're
really not getting this.

886
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:27,914
There's something I need you
to help me with.

887
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:40,383
Freeze it!

888
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:41,883
You are thick!

889
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:42,884
How could I know?

890
01:12:42,884 --> 01:12:44,386
Did I have to sing it?

891
01:12:44,386 --> 01:12:46,387
You were like a drunk prom date.

892
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:50,349
Typical. Anytime a woman shows
even a hint of sexual independence...

893
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:51,392
Shut up!

894
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:52,392
Let her go!

895
01:12:52,392 --> 01:12:54,394
Listen, monkey-boy...

896
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:57,647
I'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

897
01:12:57,896 --> 01:12:59,398
So can it.

898
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:01,900
Show me your face,
and I'll cure your ills.

899
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,403
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?

900
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:07,405
What about your ship?

901
01:13:07,405 --> 01:13:10,407
If that's what you call
that trash we got locked up.

902
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:12,910
- Put your weapons down!
- Won't happen.

903
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:14,411
It's okay.

904
01:13:14,411 --> 01:13:15,912
How is it okay?

905
01:13:15,912 --> 01:13:18,289
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.

906
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:20,666
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

907
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:31,467
Let me go!

908
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:43,810
Go on!

909
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:49,440
Take me here.

910
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,857
No way.

911
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:52,901
Take me!

912
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:12,167
He's in a cab!

913
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:36,646
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

914
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,772
Hey, man, what?

915
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:52,659
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let's go.

916
01:14:57,538 --> 01:15:00,039
Put up a bionet
all the way around Manhattan.

917
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,667
If it's not human, it doesn't leave.

918
01:15:04,043 --> 01:15:05,545
What do we hear from upstairs?

919
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:07,045
"Deliver the Galaxy".

920
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:10,132
The bug's got the Galaxy,
but we got his ship.

921
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,220
Warning..
Plutonic fusion detection.

922
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,723
Warning..
Plutonic fusion detection.

923
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:26,562
- Why are they shooting at us?
- Battle rules.

924
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:30,607
We get an ultimatum, a warning shot,
then a galactic week to respond.

925
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:34,527
A galactic week?
How the hell long is that?

926
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:35,569
One hour.

927
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:37,070
One hour?

928
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:39,114
Then what?

929
01:15:44,076 --> 01:15:45,077
That's bullshit!

930
01:15:45,077 --> 01:15:49,205
To keep the bugs from getting it,
Arquillians will destroy that galaxy.

931
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:51,875
And whatever planet it's on.

932
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,085
You're talking about us.

933
01:15:55,085 --> 01:15:56,670
Sucks, huh?

934
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:02,091
I'll get the location
of every interstellar vehicle.

935
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,092
I already did.
Frank took the last ship.

936
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,595
- Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck.
- Gone.

937
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,597
- What about Atlantic City?
- Gone.

938
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,431
- Bayonne?
- Gone.

939
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:13,100
- There's Three Mile Island.
- Gone.

940
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,602
- Staten Island?
- Gone, thank God.

941
01:16:15,602 --> 01:16:19,606
We're running out of time. If that
bug gets off Earth, we're bug food.

942
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:21,315
Hey, old guys!

943
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:28,071
Do those still work?

944
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:45,544
- You're coming with me.
- What?

945
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:47,712
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

946
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:50,381
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

947
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:55,636
The tunnel?

948
01:16:55,636 --> 01:16:58,930
- You know a better way to Queens?
- It'll be packed!

949
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:14,150
Remember the red button?

950
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,111
Push the red button.

951
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:18,572
Put on a seat belt.

952
01:17:30,164 --> 01:17:33,125
You're much too tense.
You're young. Relax.

953
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,168
Take some joy in your work.

954
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:37,044
Do you like music?

955
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:41,674
That's better.

956
01:17:41,674 --> 01:17:44,676
in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind

957
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:48,679
I straddled that Greyhound
Androde him into Raleigh

958
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:50,681
And on across Caroline

959
01:17:50,681 --> 01:17:53,350
Somebody help me
Get out ofLouisiana

960
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:58,188
There are people there
Who care a little 'bout me

961
01:17:58,188 --> 01:18:01,356
- And won't let the poorboy down
- All right, now!

962
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,202
You do know Elvis is dead?

963
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:18,078
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

964
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:34,760
You don't wanna eat me.

965
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,762
I'm an important person on my planet.
Like a queen!

966
01:18:37,762 --> 01:18:40,764
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

967
01:18:40,764 --> 01:18:42,766
I'm not trying to impress you.

968
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:45,268
I'm just saying it could start a war!

969
01:18:45,268 --> 01:18:47,770
Good, war. That means
more food for my family.

970
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:51,232
All 78 million of them.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

971
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:54,817
You're a wonderful dad,
but I'm staying here!

972
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,379
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

973
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,131
Roaches check in.

974
01:19:23,299 --> 01:19:25,301
They don't check out.

975
01:19:29,304 --> 01:19:32,599
Warning.. Eight minutes
to the destruction ofEarth.

976
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:36,602
Eight minutes...

977
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:38,688
to destruction.

978
01:20:22,849 --> 01:20:26,226
We'll use pulsar level five
with an implosion factor.

979
01:20:26,351 --> 01:20:27,352
What?!

980
01:20:27,352 --> 01:20:30,814
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One...

981
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:32,565
two, three!

982
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:33,991
You idiots!

983
01:21:35,408 --> 01:21:37,244
You don't get it!

984
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,912
I've won.

985
01:21:38,912 --> 01:21:39,496
It's over.

986
01:21:39,496 --> 01:21:41,038
It's over.

987
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:43,374
You're milk-suckers!

988
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,751
You don't matter.

989
01:21:45,918 --> 01:21:48,419
In a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

990
01:21:48,419 --> 01:21:51,422
You're under arrest
for violating the Tycho Treaty.

991
01:21:51,422 --> 01:21:54,424
So hand over whatever galaxy
you might be carrying...

992
01:21:54,424 --> 01:21:57,010
and put your hands on your head.

993
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:04,391
I'll put my hands...

994
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:08,145
on my head.

995
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,983
Like this?

996
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:45,008
That did not go the way I planned.

997
01:22:45,008 --> 01:22:47,010
Don't let him on the second ship.

998
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:50,013
- What are you talking about?
- Keep him on this planet.

999
01:22:50,013 --> 01:22:51,972
Where are you going?

1000
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,725
I'm gonna get my gun back.

1001
01:22:57,518 --> 01:22:58,519
Hey, bug!

1002
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:01,522
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a paper?

1003
01:23:01,522 --> 01:23:04,399
You're just a smear
on the sports page...

1004
01:23:04,524 --> 01:23:07,527
you slimy, gut-sucking,
intestinal parasite!

1005
01:23:07,527 --> 01:23:08,944
Eat me!

1006
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:10,946
Eat me!

1007
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:30,546
What's up?

1008
01:23:30,546 --> 01:23:33,673
You just gonna eat and run?
What about dessert?

1009
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:41,096
That's it?

1010
01:23:41,555 --> 01:23:44,849
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.

1011
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:47,352
Where you going?

1012
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:49,853
Where you going?

1013
01:23:51,063 --> 01:23:52,064
Let me tell you.

1014
01:23:52,064 --> 01:23:55,733
There's only one way off this planet,
and that's through me.

1015
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:40,896
Where you going?

1016
01:24:41,604 --> 01:24:43,606
Why you running, huh?

1017
01:24:43,606 --> 01:24:45,525
I'm still standing.

1018
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:48,402
Come on, bring it. Bring it!

1019
01:25:07,626 --> 01:25:10,129
I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1020
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:14,966
That means that's your uncle.

1021
01:25:17,134 --> 01:25:19,052
You all look alike.

1022
01:25:27,143 --> 01:25:28,727
Well, well.

1023
01:25:29,144 --> 01:25:32,105
Big, bad bug got
a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1024
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:38,652
I can't understand why you gotta...

1025
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:41,154
come down here
bringing all this ruckus...

1026
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:43,990
snatching up galaxies
and everything.

1027
01:25:44,157 --> 01:25:47,576
My attitude is, don't start nothing,
won't be nothing.

1028
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:58,293
Ease up out of my face before
something bad happens to you.

1029
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:01,671
Too late.

1030
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:33,739
Tell the Arquillians
we have the Galaxy.

1031
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:35,658
You got it, friend.

1032
01:26:37,243 --> 01:26:39,702
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1033
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:41,538
I like this gun.

1034
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:45,582
While you was in there playing around,
I was doing all the work.

1035
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,460
I had to bean him in the head
with this big rock.

1036
01:26:49,752 --> 01:26:51,754
I was gonna hit him with a 2-by-4.

1037
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:53,756
He kicked me. It hurt.

1038
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:56,758
But then I got to the fire.
I was like that with it.

1039
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:59,719
Not bad for your second
day of work, is it?

1040
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:03,139
This definitely rates a 9.0
on my weird-shit-o-metre.

1041
01:27:03,764 --> 01:27:07,225
Should've been here for
the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1042
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:12,479
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1043
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:20,653
Interesting job you guys have.

1044
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:39,085
I know we got these rules...

1045
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:41,795
but she did help us bust that bug.

1046
01:27:41,795 --> 01:27:44,673
Maybe we didn't have to
flashy-thing her.

1047
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:49,302
Come on. Who will she tell?
She hang out with dead people.

1048
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:51,137
It's not for her.

1049
01:27:51,304 --> 01:27:52,929
It's for me.

1050
01:27:54,306 --> 01:27:55,640
What?

1051
01:27:57,809 --> 01:27:59,852
Aren't they beautiful?

1052
01:28:00,811 --> 01:28:02,188
Stars.

1053
01:28:02,313 --> 01:28:05,732
I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are...

1054
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:09,486
beautiful.

1055
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,824
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1056
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:19,994
I've been training a replacement,
not a partner.

1057
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:22,746
Wait a minute, Kay.

1058
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:25,248
I cannot do this job by myself.

1059
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:28,334
Guys, my apartment isn't
anywhere near here.

1060
01:28:28,334 --> 01:28:30,836
It's not even on the same island.

1061
01:28:31,837 --> 01:28:33,255
Days...

1062
01:28:33,339 --> 01:28:34,839
months...

1063
01:28:34,839 --> 01:28:36,341
years.

1064
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:38,426
Always face it forward.

1065
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:50,353
I was in an interstellar
cockroach's gullet.

1066
01:28:50,353 --> 01:28:53,188
That's one of 100 memories
I don't want.

1067
01:29:09,868 --> 01:29:11,620
See you around.

1068
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,709
No...

1069
01:29:19,377 --> 01:29:21,044
you won't.

1070
01:29:56,407 --> 01:29:58,909
The high consulate
from Solaxium 9...

1071
01:29:58,909 --> 01:30:01,411
wants seats for the Bulls game.

1072
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:04,330
Call Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1073
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:07,916
Rodman? You're kidding.

1074
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:09,251
Nope.

1075
01:30:09,418 --> 01:30:11,503
Not much of a disguise.

<i>from the French aircraft carrier Foch
somewhere in the Mediterranean.</i>

3
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:16,587
Six days ago, as the rebellion in Chechnya

4
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:19,173
spread to the neighboring
Caucus republics,

5
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:22,969
the Russian president ordered
bombing strikes against rebel positions

6
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:25,888
around Rutul and Belokani.

7
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:30,226
<i>Appalled at the loss of human life,
the president of the United States,</i>

8
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,229
<i>the French president
and the British prime minister,</i>

9
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,815
<i>suspended all foreign aid to Russia.</i>

10
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:40,736
<i>Ultranationalist leader Vladimir
Radchenko denounced the US pressure</i>

11
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,116
<i>as an act of war against the Russian
Republic and Russian sovereignty.</i>

12
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:48,202
Denouncing his own president
as a US puppet,

13
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:52,707
he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.

14
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:56,627
He said, "This brutish and hypocritical
American intervention

15
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,212
will not go unanswered."

16
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,507
<i>On Tuesday at ten o'clock in the morning,
Moscow time,</i>

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,428
<i>the Russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.</i>

18
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,848
<i>With a government in crisis,
the Russian Republic was entering</i>

19
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:12,810
<i>into what can only be described
as a state of civil war.</i>

20
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:16,397
<i>Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces</i>

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,649
<i>seized the region around Vladivostok.</i>

22
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:23,279
<i>including a naval base and a nuclear
missile base housing Russian ICBMs.</i>

23
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:29,160
<i>As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko,</i>

24
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:32,747
<i>Allied military forces are
in a state of high alert.</i>

25
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,999
These French planes taking off behind me

26
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:38,794
have been deployed near the Caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis.

27
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:43,758
And a crisis which started in the Caucasus
has now spread to the Far East

28
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:49,472
and appears to be turning into the worst
standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.

31
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,320
Abracadabra!

32
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,322
I can't hear you.

33
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,741
Abracadabra!

34
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,623
It was worth the 50 bucks, right there.

35
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:19,043
Huh. Where have you been?
This guy's costing me $125.

36
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,253
- Get out.
- Before the tip.

37
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,798
...a volunteer from the audience.
- Me!

38
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,842
Me, me, me!

39
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,928
A brave volunteer.

40
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,180
Me! Me! Me!

41
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:36,811
Preferably... Preferably somebody
who was born on October 18th,

42
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:40,439
nineteen hundred and ninety.

43
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:44,902
- That's Robin!
- That's you, honey. That's you.

44
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,030
Over here? Over here? Ah!

45
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:50,491
You must be the birthday girl.

46
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,493
- What's your name?
- Robin.

47
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:56,247
<i> Russian ultranationalist
leader, backed by his rebel army,</i>

48
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,584
<i>threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.</i>

49
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,629
<i>The threats are a response
to US involvement in Chechnya</i>

50
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:06,465
<i>and are not considered idle.</i>

51
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,262
Now sit on the board. And tell me, Robin,
do you believe in magic?

52
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,264
- Good. Because if...
- Where'd he go?

53
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,975
I'll get him. I'll get him.
Be right back.

54
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:17,685
<i>... a flying carpet.</i>

55
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,145
<i>... emergency session...</i>

56
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,774
<i>- You'll miss your daughter's levitation.
- ... with his joint chiefs of staff.</i>

57
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,282
<i> That footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago,</i>

58
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:34,869
<i>surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...</i>

59
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:39,373

60
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:42,668
<i>... the Russian army, move in on him.</i>

61
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,343
<i>... cannot be viewed as an idle threat.</i>

62
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,261
<i>Sander Vanocur standing by.</i>

63
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,846
It is.

64
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,149
Commander Hunter.

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,511
Annapolis.
Five patrols on fast attacks.

66
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:37,264
Two on boomers. One as XO.

67
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,977
Hm.

68
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,979
A year at...

69
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:45,773
Excuse me. Harvard?

70
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:55,866
I talked to your former CO.
He tells me he tried to adopt you.

71
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:02,957
As you no doubt heard,
my XO has appendicitis.

72
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:07,670
He's the best I ever had.
I need a good man to fill his spot.

73
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:10,506
Your name was at the top of the list.

74
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,968
Well, that's good to know, sir.

75
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,971
It was a short list.

76
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,059
Your interests, Mr. Hunter.
What do you like to do? Do you, uh...

77
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:25,896
Do you paint, play ball, play
an instrument, ride motorcycles? What?

78
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,399
- I ride horses.
- Horses.

79
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:32,486
- What's the best horse you ever rode?
- Arabian, sir.

80
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,072
An Arabian?
That's a powerful animal.

81
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,616
Yes.

82
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,037
- You ever ridden one?
- Me? Are you kidding?

83
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,667
Nah, I couldn't handle an Arabian.
Nah, just give me an old paint.

84
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,589
Yeah, horses are fascinating animals.

85
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:54,383
Dumb as fence posts, but very intuitive.

86
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:57,386
They're not too different
from high school girls.

87
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,850
They might not have a brain in their head,
but they know the boys want to fuck 'em.

88
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,896
<i>You don't have to be able to read Ulysses
to understand them.</i>

89
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:11,192
No, sir.

90
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,989
He approves of you.

91
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:20,493
Jack Russells. Smartest dogs alive.

92
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:23,913
Name's Bear.
Goes everyplace with me.

93
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,548
<i>Well, welcome aboard the Alabama, son.
Do me proud.</i>

94
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:36,300
I will, sir.

95
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:38,886
- Congratulations, Mr. Hunter.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,600
<i>If one Russian citizen is killed...
and I am president,</i>

97
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:50,106
<i>then I will kill 900.000
of the people who are responsible.</i>

98
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,110
<i> You would kill 900.000 people?
Are you aware of the effect...</i>

99
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:56,904
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Play that back.

100
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,115
<i>Are you aware of the effect of this talk...</i>

101
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:03,119
She's got some huge tits under that shirt.

102
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,080
Attention!

103
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,916
At ease. Be seated.

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,378
<i> My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."</i>

105
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:17,133
<i>These are serious threats, which I hope
to be in the position to carry out.</i>

106
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:23,681
I take it you've seen enough?

107
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:27,810
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.

108
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:32,231
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.

109
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:35,484
In the good old days of Cold War,
the Russians could be depended on

110
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:38,529
doing whatever is in
their own best interests.

111
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:43,159
But this Radchenko's playing a whole new
ball game with a whole new set of rules.

112
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,036
Now I've heard people talk,

113
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,331
but I don't think he is talking
to get his picture in the paper.

114
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:51,917
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.

115
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,878
Always a dangerous combination.

116
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:58,466
And I think he's capable of doing every
damn thing he says he's going to do.

117
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:03,387
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.

118
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,350
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.

119
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:12,271
The NSA informs us that an entire rebel
corps of the Russian army is involved.

120
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:15,524
That's four armored divisions,
numbering 60,000 men.

121
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:17,652
There seems to be massive defections.

122
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:21,822
Vladimir seems to be winning the hearts
and minds of the Russian soldiers.

123
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:25,117
- Admiral.
- Thank you, sir.

124
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,877
They've seized the region by
the Chinese and North Korean borders.

125
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,962
That includes a submarine base

126
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:40,383
from which they've surged
four Akula class attack subs.

127
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:43,970
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem,

128
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:48,641
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs,

129
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:52,436
armed with up to ten warheads apiece.

130
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,398
The Russian government
assured us talks are underway.

131
00:09:55,439 --> 00:10:00,027
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.

132
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:02,321
But if Radchenko were to crack them,

133
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,782
they could launch against
our west coast direct,

134
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:09,328
or come in over the pole,
take out Washington and New York.

135
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:16,544
The commander in chief has directed US
military forces to set DEFCON four.

136
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:19,171
We've been ordered
to get underway at 0600 hours

137
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:23,759
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.

138
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:25,261
Keep your men informed.

139
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:28,180
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new XO.

140
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,767
Please bring him up to speed on
ship's personnel and supplies.

141
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,853
Any questions?

142
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,857
- Admiral?
- No, that's it.

143
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,401
On your feet.

144
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:52,496
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.

145
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,333
Hey, Bobby. This is Bobby Dougherty.
He's Supplies.

146
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,793
- Mr. Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.

147
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:59,587
- Mr. Linkletter.
- Commander.

148
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,798
- And you know Darik.
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.

149
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,759
- How's Julia?
- She's excellent.

150
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:07,762
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.

151
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,973
<i>- Thank you.
- We served together on the Baton Rouge.</i>

152
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:13,601
- Twice.
- That's right.

153
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:16,562
And, uh... we're lucky to have him.

154
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:19,190
I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.

155
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:23,361
He's crazy about that dog. Navy looks
the other way 'cause he's Ramsey.

156
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:27,239
Navy looks the other way 'cause
he's a skipper who's actually seen combat.

157
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:30,576
- He took SEALs into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.

158
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,454
- Took out eight or nine XOs in '94.
- Ouch.

159
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:36,832
- Last one caught... What? Appendicitis?
- Yeah, right.

160
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:46,384
Take care of Mom.

161
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,885
And you, sailor.

162
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,929
- You listen to Granny, OK?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:53,432
- Can I have a salute?
- Bye, Dad.

164
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,104
<i>- The Enemy Below.
- Robert Mitchum.</i>

165
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,272
- And?
- And what?

166
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,316
- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.

167
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,152
- The German guy with the white hair?
- What's his name?

168
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:08,280
- Who was it?
- Curt Jürgens.

169
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,837
- Keep my side of the bed warm, babydoll.
- I will.

170
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:25,631
Hurry home.

171
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,758
Don't worry.

172
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,219
- Bye.
- I love you. OK, bye.

173
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:34,015
You listen to Mom.

174
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,850
Be good.

175
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,394
Bye, baby.

176
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,732
- Hardy Krüger.
- No way.

177
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,526
Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.

178
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,696
- Question was invalid.
- We're even.

179
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,907
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

180
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,577
Good. Address me as "sir"
when you speak to me!

181
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,579
Stand at attention, sailor!

182
00:12:57,872 --> 00:13:00,499
Is he gonna fit in the sub?

183
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,501
Doubtful.

184
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:05,129
<i>Who was the German sub commander
in The Enemy Below?</i>

185
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:08,466
- Was it Curt Jürgens or Hardy Krüger?
- Sir, I...

186
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,803
Wrong answer! Drop down
and give me 20! Now! Move! Move!

187
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:15,765
One. Two.

188
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:18,976
<i>- Run Silent, Run Deep.
- Three.</i>

189
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,395
The guy with the ears
and a little moustache.

190
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,688
Cary Grant.

191
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,403
I'm worried about T.

192
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:34,450
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.

193
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:38,496
I think she thinks I'm goin' away forever.

194
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,165
I'll take care of her.

195
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:42,583
- You will?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,293
- You promise?
- I promise.

197
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:50,508
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

198
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,305
OK.

199
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:02,853
- You know I don't know what to say.
- Just say goodbye.

200
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,782
See you in my dreams.

201
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,159
Give me a kiss.

202
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,640
- Davis.
- How you doin', sir?

203
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:05,916
Crew present and accounted for, sir.

204
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:11,255
Little ducks,

205
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,508
there's trouble in Russia.

206
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,844
So they called us.

207
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,348
And we're going over there

208
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:25,603
and bringing the most lethal
killing machine ever devised.

209
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:30,399
We're capable of launching
more firepower

210
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:35,446
than has ever been released
in the history of war.

211
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,740
For one purpose alone -

212
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:42,703
to keep our country safe.

213
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:46,791
We constitute the front line

214
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:49,794
and the last line of defense.

215
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:58,010
I expect and demand

216
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,179
your very best.

217
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:05,351
Anything less,
you should have joined the Air Force.

218
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:13,901
This might be our
commander in chief's navy,

219
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:16,070
but this is my boat.

220
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:19,407
And all I ask is that you keep up with me.

221
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,410
And if you can't,

222
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:26,247
that strange sensation you'll be
feeling in the seat of your pants

223
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,793
will be my boot in your ass.

224
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:47,560
- Mr. Cob?
- Yes, sir.

225
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,855
You're aware of
the name of this ship, Mr. Cob?

226
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,898
Very aware, sir.

227
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:54,984
It bears a proud name, doesn't it, Mr. Cob?

228
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,028
Very proud, sir.

229
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:00,740
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir.

230
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:04,827
- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- Outstanding, sir.

231
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,957
- In the greatest country in the entire world.
- In the entire world, sir.

232
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,669
<i>- And what is that name, Mr. Cob?
- Alabama, sir.</i>

233
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:16,464
- And what do we say?
- Go, 'Bama!

234
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:18,215
Roll tide!

235
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,010
Chief of the Boat, dismiss the crew.

236
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:23,179
Dismiss the crew.
Aye, aye, sir.

237
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:28,267
Crew, department heads,
attend to your departments.

238
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:31,812
Fall out!

239
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,383
Here.

240
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:04,553
Part of your qualification for command.

241
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,769
The last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.

242
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,479
Gonna miss it.

243
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:15,856
I don't trust air I can't see.

244
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,578
This is my favorite part.

245
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:32,289
Right here, right now.

246
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,761
Bravo, Hunter.

247
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:48,431
Sir?

248
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:51,517
You knew to shut up and enjoy the view.

249
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,769
Most eggheads want to talk it away.

250
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:58,190
Your stock just went up
a couple of points.

251
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,775
Thank you, sir.

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,945
Allow me to give you a tiny bit of advice.

253
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,031
If you want your own boat someday,

254
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:10,119
the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.

255
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,789
I can't stand save-asses
and I won't abide kiss-asses.

256
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:18,377
You keep your priorities straight -
your mission and your men.

257
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:24,675
How you like that cigar?

258
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,845
- It's good, sir.
- It's your first.

259
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:31,223
Yeah.

260
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:35,603
Don't like it too much.
They're more expensive than drugs.

261
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:39,857
- XO, take her down.
- Take her down. Aye, sir.

262
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,069
Control, Bridge. Sounding.

263
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:46,739
<i> Bridge. Control.
Sounding 1-2-0 fathoms.</i>

264
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:55,623
- Lookouts, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.

265
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,875
Officer of the Deck, prepare to dive.

266
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,419
- Captain down.
- Captain is down.

267
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:08,594
- XO down.
- XO is down.

268
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,234
Submerge the ship.

269
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,903
Diving Officer, submerge the ship.
Depth 1-5-0 feet.

270
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,155
Make my depth 1-5-0 feet. Aye, sir.

271
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:32,368
Chief of the Watch, on the One MC,
dive, dive!

272
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:55,891
Make your depth 1-5-0 feet.
Five degree down bubble.

273
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,186
- Uh, I don't understand.
- What?

274
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:45,524
Radchenko is a fanatic. He's a potential
Hitler. Somebody should just shoot him.

275
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,610
- I have no problem with that.
- Good.

276
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:52,156
It's fanatics who make history. Colonel
Patton was a fanatic. That made him great.

277
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,408
You think this guy is Patton?

278
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,662
He's a dangerous lunatic
and he's threatening nuclear war.

279
00:21:57,745 --> 00:22:00,873
What's that make us, being the only
nation to drop a nuclear bomb?

280
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:02,917
It makes us a prime target.

281
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,462
Some Third World countries with
atom bombs would love to drop one on us.

282
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:08,547
So we should drop one on them.

283
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:12,301
Are you a communist? You have a problem
with dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?

284
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,053
Shut up, Dougherty.

285
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:18,516
- You think it was a mistake, Mr. Hunter?
- Sir?

286
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,268
Using the bomb on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.

287
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:28,818
If I thought that, sir, I wouldn't be here.

288
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,696
- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?

289
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,825
Very carefully.

290
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,706
You do qualify your remarks.

291
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:45,584
If somebody asked me if we should've
bombed Japan, a simple, "Yes.

292
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,296
"By all means, sir.
Drop that fucker. Twice."

293
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:53,467
I don't mean to suggest
that you're indecisive, Mr. Hunter.

294
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,511
Not at all.

295
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,888
Just, uh...

296
00:22:57,972 --> 00:22:59,598
complicated.

297
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,562
Of course, that's the way
the navy wants you.

298
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:08,065
Me, they wanted simple.

299
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,817
You certainly fooled them, sir.

300
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:14,447
Be careful there, Mr. Hunter.

301
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,200
It's all I got to rely on,
being a simpleminded son of a bitch.

302
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:24,915
Rickhover gave me my command,
a checklist, a target and a button to push.

303
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,211
All I had to know is how to push it.
They'd tell me when.

304
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,589
They seem to want you to know why.

305
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:35,384
I would hope they'd want
us all to know why, sir.

306
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:41,098
At the Naval War College,
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,

307
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:44,226
not 19th-century philosophy.

308
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:48,105
"War is a continuation
of politics by other means."

309
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:51,150
von Clausewitz.

310
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:55,029
I think that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...

311
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,238
Complicated?

312
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:05,456
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end,

313
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:07,917
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.

314
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,253
Ha! I'm very impressed.

315
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:14,757
In other words, the sailor most likely
to win the war is the one most willing

316
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,095
to part with the politicians and ignore
all except the destruction of the enemy.

317
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,098
You'd agree with that.

318
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:26,936
I'd agree that, uh...
that's what Clausewitz was trying to say.

319
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:30,564
- But you wouldn't agree with it?
- No, sir, I do not.

320
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:35,820
No, I just think that in the nuclear world...

321
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:39,448
the true enemy can't be destroyed.

322
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:45,329
Attention on deck.

323
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:50,668
von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.

324
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,169
von?

325
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:04,348
In my humble opinion, in the nuclear world
the true enemy is war itself.

326
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:53,189
So the captain's walking on the bridge,

327
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,901
and he and the dog come across
two sailors fucking each other in the ass.

328
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,778
How can they fuck each other in the ass?

329
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:02,239
- One's fucking the other in the ass, stupid.
- Shut up, Hunsicker.

330
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:05,493
So these two are fucking each other
in the ass, the captain says:

331
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:07,328
"What the fuck is going on here?"

332
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:10,623
The sailor said, "Hunsicker fell
overboard, I'm saving his life."

333
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,583
- Fuck you.
- Captain says:

334
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,835
"Give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation."

335
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,508
Sailor says, "How do you think
this got started in the first place, sir?"

336
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:36,190
Move!

337
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:54,542
Fire in the galley! Chief of the Watch,
sound the general alarm!

338
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:25,489
<i> Damage control,
bring fire extinguishers...</i>

339
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:30,119
- Fire's out of control.
- You hit the kill switch?

340
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:33,039
Couldn't get to it. Too hot.

341
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,102
<i> Attention, all hands.
Fire has been contained.</i>

342
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:59,315
<i>Damage control party,
assess damage and report to Control.</i>

343
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,402
- Initiate weapons system readiness test.
- Aye, sir.

344
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:10,409
Station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.

345
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:22,213
Conn, Radio. We are receiving flash traffic.
Emergency action message.

346
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:25,132
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

347
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,220
Alert one. Man battle stations missile
for weapons systems readiness test.

348
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:32,306
- Spin up all missiles.
- Why is he runnin' a missile drill now?

349
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,891
- You're in charge.
- Aye, sir.

350
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,852
<i> Man battle stations missile
for weapons system readiness test.</i>

351
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:39,563
<i>Spin up all missiles.
This is an exercise.</i>

352
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:43,567
Captain's in Control.

353
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:52,076
I agree. Message is properly formatted.

354
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,079
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

355
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,039
for weapons system readiness test.

356
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:59,333
- I concur, sir.
- Where's the XO?

357
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,880
Sir.

358
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:08,551
Good of you to make it, Mr. Hunter.
Get the authenticator.

359
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:11,053
Get the authenticator.

360
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,526
Let's go.

361
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:36,037
- Sir, request permission to authenticate.
- Permission granted. Authenticate.

362
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,461
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo,
Echo, Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

363
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:48,174
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

364
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:50,426
- Captain, message is authentic.
- I concur.

365
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:53,220
- I agree.
- Message is authentic.

366
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:56,182
Sir, your captain's missile key.

367
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:06,817
Set condition One SQ for WSRT.
This is the captain. This is an exercise.

368
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:11,697
Set condition One SQ for WSRT.
This is the XO. This is an exercise.

369
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,785
- That fire could still flare...
- Now is not the time.

370
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,454
Make your depth 1-5-0 feet. All stop.

371
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:21,540
Make my depth 1-5-0 feet.
All stop. Aye, sir.

372
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:23,834
Weapons, Conn.
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.

373
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:26,921
Weapons, Conn.
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.

374
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:30,466
Conn, Weapons. Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles. Aye, aye, sir.

375
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:35,388
- Simulate pressurizing, all missiles.
- Simulate pressurizing, all missiles. Aye.

376
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:43,062
All stations, proceed to One SQ.
Ready all missiles for launch.

377
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:44,188
Let's go!

378
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:49,902
Weapons, Captain.
Report approximate time for One SQ.

379
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:54,365
Captain, Weapons. Approximate time
to weapons system One SQ -

380
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,742
14 minutes, sir.

381
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:59,787
Ship is at launch depth.
Ready to hover, sir.

382
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,373
- Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

383
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:07,003
Control, Sick Bay. Chief Petty Officer
Marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.

384
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:11,007
<i>- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the Watch, on the One MC.</i>

385
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,092
Gentlemen, may I have your attention?

386
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:16,345
We've received word that a shipmate
has a medical problem.

387
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:20,599
We're terminating the drill. Mr. Mahoney,
take the conn. I'm going below.

388
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:23,477
- XO.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

389
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,192
Clear.

390
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,195
Clear.

391
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:49,920
It's OK, Chief.

392
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:54,258
Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.

393
00:32:19,575 --> 00:32:22,161
Hiya, boy.
Hiya, hiya, hiya.

394
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:25,289
How ya doin'? Oh, boy. Yeah.

395
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:31,712
So, Mr. Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?

396
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:33,673
Not necessarily, sir.

397
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:36,759
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.

398
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,554
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.

399
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:43,265
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I would not.

400
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:45,059
Why not?

401
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,312
The fire could have flared back up.
I would have seen to it first.

402
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,315
I'm sure you would have.

403
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:56,153
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.

404
00:32:56,237 --> 00:33:02,201
Confusion on the ship is nothing to fear.
It should be taken advantage of.

405
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:06,289
Lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.

406
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,626
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.

407
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:16,257
Do you think I'm some crazy old coot
endangering everyone as I yell "yee-haw"?

408
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:21,554
That was not my first thought, sir.
But there's no excuse.

409
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:27,643
At the time I was fighting the fire in the
galley, I did not agree with your call, sir.

410
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,480
Take a seat.

411
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:44,285
Just so we understand each other.

412
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:48,456
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.

413
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:52,627
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.

414
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,880
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.

415
00:33:56,005 --> 00:34:00,968
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.

416
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:05,931
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.

417
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:08,351
Those sailors out there are just boys,

418
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:12,021
boys who are training to do a terrible thing,
and if that ever occurs,

419
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:15,566
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing

420
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,111
will derive from their unqualified belief
in the chain of command.

421
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:23,491
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.

422
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:26,202
It means we don't undermine each other.

423
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:32,208
It means in a missile drill they hear your
voice right after mine, without hesitation.

424
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:39,340
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.

425
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:43,552
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.

426
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:50,726
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.

427
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,937
- Go see to it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

428
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,819
Oh, Hunter. I'd like you to speak to Cob
about his weight.

429
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:02,780
I find it difficult,
I've known him so long.

430
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:03,990
Yes, sir.

431
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,784
Short of the outbreak of World War III,

432
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:10,288
the ship sinking
or being attacked by a giant octopus,

433
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,790
I'd like to be undisturbed for 30 minutes.

434
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:15,418
I'll see to it, sir.

435
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:19,797
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.

436
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:25,928
Not the fire.

437
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:29,807
Dismissed.

438
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:46,907
One, two, three, four.

439
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,538
Back. Back.

440
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:56,125
One, two. One, two.

441
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:13,601
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

442
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:18,105
Does it make sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?

443
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:21,984
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died too.

444
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,904
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?

445
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:29,408
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- Weps.

446
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,790
A fire is a serious threat to the ship.
Where was he? Why not check it out first?

447
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:38,626
That's his style. He's a hard-ass.

448
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:41,379
- So what?
- So you wanna fight him, go ahead.

449
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:44,215
You wanna get along,
understand him a little bit.

450
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:46,717
Two schools of thought here.

451
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:50,513
To him, you're Annapolis, Harvard,
expert on theory,

452
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:52,723
- well-versed in world affairs.
- Ha!

453
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:55,977
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the 25 last years.

454
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,190
He's probably a little paranoid about that.
I mean, navy's all he's got.

455
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:05,861
Navy and that little rat dog of his.
That's why his wife left him.

456
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:09,532
So what are you saying?

457
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,702
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.

458
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:15,371
Let him get to know you.

459
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:19,500
You do pants too?

460
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:37,184
Conn, Radio. Receiving emergency action
message. Recommend alert one.

461
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,103
Alert one. Alert one.

462
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,772
<i> Incoming emergency
action message.</i>

463
00:37:41,856 --> 00:37:45,151
<i>Alert one. Alert one.
Incoming EAM.</i>

464
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,154
Captain.

465
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:05,588
Captain has asked me to brief you on the
emergency action message we received.

466
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:09,342
As you know, before we got underway,

467
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:13,512
the Russian army was in position
encircling the rebel camps,

468
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:18,100
and Radchenko started making threats
should anyone move in on him,

469
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:23,606
that he would launch his land-based
nuclear weapons at the US and at Japan.

470
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:28,402
The safeguard was that the Russian
government controlled the launch codes.

471
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:32,990
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised,

472
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:36,869
and US military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.

473
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:40,414
The last time we hit this state of emergency
was 32½ years ago,

474
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:43,918
during the Cuban missile crisis.

475
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:48,130
So this is what it's all about, gentlemen.
It's what we train for.

476
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:51,342
It's why this ship was built.

477
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:55,930
And it's what our nuclear weapons
will be used for if necessary.

478
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:58,474
Captain.

479
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:02,019
The NCA has determined that

480
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:07,108
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled -

481
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:11,153
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour -

482
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:13,823
we'll be compelled to act.

483
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:20,037
Now, given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts,

484
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:23,916
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon

485
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,296
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.

486
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,299
It's important to remain focused.

487
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:36,012
Keep your men informed.

488
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,809
Any questions?

489
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,939
Dismissed.

490
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:55,906
We lost that frying unit and then...

491
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,834
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Get out! Get...

492
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:10,046
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!

493
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,798
Fuckin' Guinea piece of shit.

494
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:21,349
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir. Just a difference of opinion.

495
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:24,977
- What about?
- It's too silly, sir. I'd rather just forget...

496
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:29,565
I don't give a damn about what you'd rather
forget about. Why were you two fighting?

497
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:32,943
I said the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer,

498
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:37,823
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer was
shit. Bennefield's a big Moebius fan, and...

499
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:42,370
Things got out of hand. I pushed him, he
pushed me. I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.

500
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:44,914
Rivetti, you're a supervisor.

501
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,375
You can get a commission like that.

502
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,002
I know it, sir. You're 100% right.

503
00:40:50,127 --> 00:40:52,588
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not.

504
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:55,758
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'll write you up. Understand?

505
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:57,093
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:59,595
You set an example
even in the face of stupidity.

507
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,556
Every comic book reader
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer

508
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,643
is the only true Silver Surfer.
Now, am I right or wrong?

509
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:08,729
- You're right, sir.
- All right. Get out of here.

510
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:31,502
Captain.

511
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:36,132
- How can I help you?
- Test results from the missile drill.

512
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,680
This the best they can do?

513
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:46,183
- No, sir, but that's what they did.
- I want this down to five minutes.

514
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:48,352
- Train on it.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:52,273
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.

516
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,318
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.

517
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,695
Damn.

518
00:41:57,737 --> 00:42:01,574
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.

519
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:04,035
Or a pat on the back, sir.

520
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:07,455
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal, but...

521
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:12,627
I think the men are... a little on edge
with all we're going through.

522
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,087
Morale seems to be a bit low.

523
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:21,594
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

524
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,807
Thank you, sir.

525
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:36,484
Attention, please.

526
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,074
Mr. Hunter has brought it
to my attention

527
00:42:43,157 --> 00:42:47,578
that morale may be a bit low.

528
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,414
That you may be a bit...

529
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:52,416
On edge, sir.

530
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,585
...on edge.

531
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,005
So I suggest this,

532
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,842
any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation

533
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,637
can leave the ship right now.

534
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:09,642
Gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three.
War is imminent.

535
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,436
<i>This is the captain.</i>

536
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:16,399
That is all.

537
00:43:19,485 --> 00:43:22,071
Very inspiring, sir.

538
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:26,450
Come on, Bear.
Come on. Come on.

539
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:41,173
Come in.

540
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:43,092
Sir.

541
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:51,684
Cob, this is a difficult subject
to talk about. Uh...

542
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:56,314
- I gather from...
- Maybe I can help, sir.

543
00:43:56,397 --> 00:43:59,567
I know I'm overweight,
but this is my last tour.

544
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:01,902
I retire after this.

545
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:05,656
I just... can't seem to stop eating.

546
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:15,291
- Have a seat, Cob.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,795
What did you think of
the captain's speech?

548
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:25,259
Well, the captain seems to know
what his men seem to need.

549
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:27,178
A pat on the back or a kick in the ass?

550
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,056
His speech made sense to me.

551
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:32,516
So why don't you say
what's really on your mind?

552
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,103
With all due respect, this thing between
you and the captain is no good.

553
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:40,024
Somebody's gotta bend, sir,
and he is the skipper.

554
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,193
I'm aware of that, Cob.

555
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:44,487
Yes, sir.

556
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,327
Sir, what I think we have here is
a difference in management styles.

557
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,413
But as unpredictable as he is,
there is a logic to it.

558
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:57,875
He navigates by his own star,
not many men can do that.

559
00:44:57,959 --> 00:45:02,088
Cob's rules of navy leadership.
One, look like you know what you're doing.

560
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:04,715
Two, the men must believe you
know what you're doing.

561
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:07,259
And three, and most important,

562
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:11,889
everybody's got an opinion
but the captain's gotta make a choice.

563
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:16,727
You live and die with that, and that's where
the skipper's earned his stripes, sir.

564
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:20,481
I've seen it time and time again.

565
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:24,402
So when you're right, you're right.

566
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:28,990
That's what my daddy said.
Right's right, and wrong's for nobody.

567
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,576
You hungry?

568
00:45:32,618 --> 00:45:34,620
Always.

569
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:37,623
Let's get something to eat.

570
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:39,792
Yes, sir.

571
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:52,096
Sup? Come here.

572
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:56,559
You hear that?

573
00:45:56,642 --> 00:46:03,482
I've got a broadband contact bearing 0-4-7.
Assigning tracker Sierra in ATF.

574
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:07,737
Conn, Sonar. We have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 0-4-7.

575
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,114
Designate contact Master 2-8.

576
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:14,035
Sonar, Conn, aye. Man battle stations
torpedo. Rig for ultraquiet.

577
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:17,663
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.
- Tubes one and four fully ready. Aye.

578
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,668
<i> Man battle stations torpedo.</i>

579
00:46:27,923 --> 00:46:29,300
What do you got?

580
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:33,679
Sir, a possible submerged submarine,
bearing 0-4-9, designate Master 2-8.

581
00:46:34,847 --> 00:46:40,436
Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 8-3-1 feet to avoid that sub.

582
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:43,648
Mahoney, this is the captain.
Increase your speed to standard.

583
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:45,983
Come left to course 2-7-0.

584
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:49,528
Make your depth 8-3-1 feet, smartly.

585
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:54,200
- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.

586
00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:57,620
Who are you, sweetheart?

587
00:46:57,703 --> 00:47:01,999
Helm, all ahead standard.
Dive, make your depth 8-3-1 feet, smartly.

588
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,084
Aye, sir.

589
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:15,262
Conn, Radio. Receiving emergency
action message. Recommend alert one.

590
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:16,889
Recommend alert one.

591
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:20,017
<i> Alert one. Alert one.
Incoming emergency action message.</i>

592
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:32,113
Captain, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

593
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:35,700
from National Command Authority
for strategic missile launch.

594
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:38,536
- I concur, sir.
- Get the authenticator.

595
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,810
Chief of the Watch,
secure for battle stations torpedo.

596
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:05,771
Man battle stations missile
for strategic launch.

597
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:07,815
Secure for battle stations torpedo.

598
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:11,193
- Man battle stations missile...
- Permission to authenticate.

599
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,571
Permission granted. Authenticate.

"Bravo, Echo, Echo, Charlie,

604
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:35,843
- Message is authentic, sir.
- I concur, sir.

605
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,470
I concur, sir.

606
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:43,434
- Message is authentic.
- Sir, your captain's missile key.

607
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:58,240
This is the captain. Set condition One SQ
for strategic missile launch.

608
00:48:58,324 --> 00:49:01,744
<i>Spin up missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.</i>

609
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:05,122
<i>The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.</i>

610
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,251
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

611
00:49:12,672 --> 00:49:16,801
XO, take the conn. I'm going
to my stateroom for the launch keys.

612
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:19,011
XO has the conn.

613
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:27,979
Set condition One SQ
for strategic missile launch.

614
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:32,274

One, two, three, four, five, six.

618
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:58,843
Go, sailor, go.

619
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:06,434
<i> Set condition One SQ

620

<i>and 20 through 24.</i>

622
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:25,369
- I have the conn.
- The captain has the conn.

623
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:28,956
Passing 5-5-0 feet.

624
00:50:34,128 --> 00:50:38,257
Conn, Radio. Sir, we're out of VLF radio
range. Full message capacity is cut off.

625
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:41,218
Radio, Conn.
Extend extremely low frequency antenna.

626
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:44,305
Passing 600 feet.
Coming to 8-3-1 feet, sir.

627
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:57,985
Jesus. Oh, God. Uh...

628
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:01,405
Conn, Sonar.
Uh, sir, we have his classification.

629
00:51:03,032 --> 00:51:05,910
Mark that tape.
Get the classification on your monitor.

630
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,453
What the hell is going on?

631
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:11,624
Sir, the Master 2-8 is classified as
a Russian Akula class hunter-killer.

632
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:15,628
Bearing 1-9-6, sir. He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.

633
00:51:21,217 --> 00:51:23,219
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.

634
00:51:23,302 --> 00:51:27,473
- Captain has the conn.
- Passing 800 feet, sir.

635
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:30,351
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.

636
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:33,354
- Continue rigging for ultraquiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.

637
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:37,984
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultraquiet, sir.

638
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:55,167
Gentlemen, this is the captain.

639
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:58,045
We have an Akula class submarine
out there.

640
00:51:58,129 --> 00:52:02,466
<i>We know Radchenko controls at least
four submarines. This could be one.</i>

641
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:06,262
<i>Russian rebels have threatened
to launch against our country,</i>

642
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:08,222
<i>and are fueling right now.</i>

643
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:12,268
<i>They will have launch capability
in 60 minutes.</i>

644
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:16,981
<i>We have orders to launch our missiles,
which is exactly what we're going to do.</i>

645
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:20,359
<i>We are rigging for ultraquiet.
All hands, be ready.</i>

646
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:23,321
<i>This is as real as it gets.</i>

647
00:52:23,362 --> 00:52:27,491
<i>We'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.</i>

648
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:33,581
If that sub so much as comes around
or opens up a tube door, we'll take her out.

649
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,792
Passing 900 feet.

650
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,344
He's gone.

651
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:48,929
Like hell he is.

652
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:50,431
He's up there.

653
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:52,224
9-5-0.

654
00:52:52,308 --> 00:52:57,021
Conn, Weapons. Missile systems
ready to launch in 11 minutes.

655
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,119
Conn, Radio. Receiving transmission
on extremely low frequency receiver, sir.

656
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:15,164
Very well.
Mr. Hunter, go to Radio, please.

657
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:20,127
- OK, pull up the code.
- What do you got?

658
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:24,757
XO, incoming EAM, but we're too deep
to receive any radio communication, sir.

659
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,890
<i>- Captain.
- XO.</i>

660
00:53:32,974 --> 00:53:36,435
<i>We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.</i>

661
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,522
<i>We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.</i>

662
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:44,235
With that sub still up there?
Mr. Hunter, it's my inten...

663
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:46,529
<i>- Come up to Conn, Mr. Hunter.
- Yes, sir.</i>

664
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:50,366
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir.

665
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:52,368
1275 feet, sir.

666
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:04,005
<i> Conn. Weapons. Missile systems
ready to launch in ten minutes.</i>

667
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:06,215
<i>- Sir.
- Attention, all hands.</i>

668
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:09,093
<i>- Ship has been rigged for ultraquiet.
- Captain?</i>

669
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:19,895
When our missile system is ready,
Mr. Hunter,

670
00:54:19,979 --> 00:54:22,940
it is my intention
to rise to launch depth,

671
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:27,820
launch our birds and then get
the hell out of there. Not until then.

672
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:30,948
I can't jeopardize
the safety of this ship.

673
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:33,784
Yes, sir.

674
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:37,371
May I suggest that we float the buoy, sir?
We have enough cable.

675
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:42,293
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission. Sir.

676
00:54:44,378 --> 00:54:48,132
Very well, float the buoy.

677
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:52,803
- Chief of the Watch, float the buoy.
- Float the radio buoy. Aye, sir.

678
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:04,523
Radio buoy
deploying, sir. Tension, 2,000 pounds.

679
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:09,236
Very well.

680
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,407
Conn, Weapons. Estimated time
to One SQ, eight minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

681
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,791
The winch!

682
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:24,502
Conn, Sonar. We have a sound short
from the buoy winch!

683
00:55:24,585 --> 00:55:26,462
Stop the goddamn winch!

684
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:31,300
Winch is stopped, sir.

685
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:33,052
Goddamn it.

686
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:50,069
- TSO, is that sound still out there?
- Sonar, TSO. Is that sound still out there?

687
00:55:50,569 --> 00:55:52,613
Sound's gone, sir.

688
00:56:08,212 --> 00:56:11,424
I'm getting something.

689
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:20,308
- Sup, he's comin' around.
- Conn, Sonar. Akula is turning toward!

690
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:23,477
- They're range gating, sir.
- What's range gating?

691
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:25,521
They've got the torpedoes locked on us.

692
00:56:27,315 --> 00:56:30,109
Conn, Sonar.
Torpedo in the water. Bearing 2-4-1.

693
00:56:31,694 --> 00:56:34,780
Conn, Sonar. Second torpedo
in the water. Bearing 2-4-2.

694
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:36,699

696
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:46,917
Maneuvering, Conn. Cavitate.

697
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:55,301
- Sound the collision alarm.
- Aye, sir.

698
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:57,720
<i>- 2500 yards.
- Rig ship for impact.</i>

699
00:56:57,803 --> 00:56:59,764
Hang on to your ass, gentlemen!

700
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:01,265
<i> 2.000 yards.</i>

701
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:09,273
1500 yards.
Bearing 0-7-0-0-7-1.

702
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:11,067
1,200 yards.

703
00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:18,032
1,000 yards and closing fast.

704
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:22,787
Conn, Radio. Receiving emergency
action message. Recommend alert one.

705
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,624
<i>950 yards.</i>

706
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:29,710
Launch a five-inch evasion device.
Launch countermeasures.

707
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:37,176
- Countermeasures away, sir.
- Shift your rudder to left full.

708
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:39,762
<i> 500 yards and closing fast.</i>

709
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:47,853
<i>300 yards and closing, sir.</i>

710
00:57:57,321 --> 00:58:00,241
Sir, the first torpedo's
going after the countermeasures.

711
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:03,327
They missed! They missed!

712
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:08,666
Sonar, Conn. Second torpedo incoming.
It's gonna be close.

713
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,604
<i> Conn. Sonar.
The Akula's disappeared in the thermal.</i>

714
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,107
All ahead standard.
Rudder amid ships.

715
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,069
- All ahead standard. Rudder amid ships.
- All stations.

716
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:39,905
All stations, report damage.
Report damage.

717
00:58:39,947 --> 00:58:43,409
<i> Engine room reports
number one ASW-pump failed.</i>

718
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:48,706
<i>Torpedo room. Water in the bilge.
Request a team with a submersible pump.</i>

719
00:58:48,748 --> 00:58:53,794
<i>Engine room. Request all E-division
personnel to assist in ground isolation.</i>

720
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:56,380
Sonar, Conn.
Report hostile contact.

721
00:58:56,881 --> 00:59:01,761
<i>- Conn. Sonar. We lost him, sir.
- Keep looking. He's looking for us.</i>

722
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:03,012
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

723
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:05,514
Weapons, Conn.
Estimated time to One SQ.

724
00:59:05,598 --> 00:59:09,185
Conn, Weapons. Missile systems
ready to launch in six minutes.

725
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:10,227
<i> Very well.</i>

726
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:12,605
<i> Main seawater pump
is out of commission.</i>

727
00:59:12,647 --> 00:59:15,650
Mr. Zimmer, where's that EAM?

728
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:18,235
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.

729
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:23,407
- That's it?
- Uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.

730
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:26,619
We lost it when
the radio buoy cable got severed.

731
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,120
All right.

732
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:42,885
All right, gentlemen, let's get on with it.
All ahead one-third.

733
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:45,513
Steady as you go.

734
00:59:45,596 --> 00:59:48,641
All ahead one-third.
Steady. Aye, sir.

735
00:59:48,724 --> 00:59:51,227
Make your depth 1-5-0 feet.

736
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:54,188
Zero bubble.
Up slow and silent to launch depth.

737
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:58,401
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye, aye, Captain.

738
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,280
Captain?

739
01:00:02,363 --> 01:00:03,739
Got the EAM.

740
01:00:05,908 --> 01:00:09,120
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.

741
01:00:09,203 --> 01:00:12,123
Yes, sir.
It got cut off during the attack.

742
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:14,875
Then it's meaningless.

743
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,295
Sir, this is an EAM pertaining to nuclear...

744
01:00:17,336 --> 01:00:20,256
No, Mr. Hunter,
that's a message fragment.

745
01:00:20,923 --> 01:00:25,386
Because it got cut off during the attack, sir.
It could be a message to abort...

746
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:29,140
- It could be a fake Russian transmission.
- Which is why we need to confirm.

747
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:31,350
I'm asking for time to get back online.

748
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:33,352
- Calm down, Mr. Hunter.
- I am calm.

749
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:34,520
You don't appear to be.

750
01:00:34,603 --> 01:00:38,316
<i> Conn. Weapons. Missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.</i>

751
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:41,319
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.

752
01:00:45,615 --> 01:00:50,202
We have orders in hand and those
orders are to make a preemptive launch.

753
01:00:50,286 --> 01:00:53,998
Every second we lose increases
the chances that when our missiles arrive,

754
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:57,001
their silos could be empty
'cause they've struck us first.

755
01:00:57,043 --> 01:00:58,628
- Yes.
- You know as well as I do

756
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:02,173
that any launch order received
without authentication is no order.

757
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:03,758
That's our number one rule.

758
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:07,303
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time after time.

759
01:01:07,386 --> 01:01:09,513
It's a rule we follow without exception.

760
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:14,268
Captain, National Military Command
Center knows what sector we're in.

761
01:01:14,393 --> 01:01:17,229
They have satellites
to see if our birds are aloft,

762
01:01:17,313 --> 01:01:20,107
and if they're not,
they give our orders to somebody else.

763
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:22,818
That's why we maintain
more than one sub - redundancy.

764
01:01:22,902 --> 01:01:27,031
- I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter.
- All I'm saying...

765
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:38,334
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.

766
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:43,297
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.

767
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:47,051
You're presuming that we have
other submarines ready to launch.

768
01:01:47,134 --> 01:01:52,014
As captain, I must assume our submarines
could've been taken out by other Akulas.

769
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:55,810
We can play these games, but I don't have
the luxury of your presumptions.

770
01:01:55,893 --> 01:01:56,852
- Sir...
- Mr. Hunter.

771
01:01:56,936 --> 01:02:00,815
We have rules that are not open
to interpretation, personal intuition,

772
01:02:00,898 --> 01:02:04,944
gut feelings, hairs on your neck,
little devils or angels on your shoulders.

773
01:02:05,027 --> 01:02:09,073
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware of our orders.

774
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:12,410
They come from our commander in chief.
They contain no ambiguity.

775
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:14,829
- Captain...
- Mr. Hunter. I've made the decision.

776
01:02:14,912 --> 01:02:19,333
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!

777
01:02:26,382 --> 01:02:28,426
Damn.

778
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:30,720
Weapons, Conn.

779
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:36,350
Shift targeting to target package
SLBM 647412/2.

780
01:02:36,434 --> 01:02:38,561
This is the captain.

781
01:02:43,399 --> 01:02:45,735
- I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.

782
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:49,113
We don't know what this means.
Our target could have changed.

783
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:53,534
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!

784
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:55,995
- You won't.
- You're relieved of your position.

785
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,249
Cob, remove Mr. Hunter from the control
room. Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here!

786
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:03,085
I do not concur.
I do not recognize your authority

787
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:05,421
to relieve me under navy regulations.

788
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:07,840
Cob, arrest this man
and get him out of here!

789
01:03:07,923 --> 01:03:10,593
Operating procedures governing
release of nuclear weapons

790
01:03:10,676 --> 01:03:13,638
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree.

791
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:15,723
Cob, what are you waiting for?

792
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:19,435
This is why your command must be
repeated. It requires my assent.

793
01:03:19,477 --> 01:03:20,936
I do not give it.

794
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:25,191
You continue to insist upon this launch
without confirming this message first,

795
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:27,568
I will be backed by
the rules of precedence...

796
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:29,904
<i>As commanding officer
of the USS Alabama.</i>

797
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:33,908
I order you to place the XO under arrest
on the charge of mutiny!

798
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:39,455
I say again, I order you to place the XO
under arrest on the charge of mutiny!

799
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,125
Cob!

800
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:48,130
Captain, please, the XO is right.
We can't launch unless he concurs.

801
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:53,594
<i>"To the USS Alabama.
Rebel-controlled missiles being fueled.</i>

802
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:57,556
"Launch codes compromised. Dissidents
threaten launch at continental US.

803
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,477
Set DEFCON two. Immediately launch
ten Trident missile sorties."

804
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,897
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!

805
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:10,736
- I think you need time to think this over.
- I don't have to think this over!

806
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:16,993
Captain, I relieve you of your command.
Cob, escort the captain to his stateroom.

807
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:19,495
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not.

808
01:04:19,578 --> 01:04:24,625
Chief of the Boat, Captain Ramsey's
under arrest. Lock him in his stateroom.

809
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:27,295
- Captain, please...
- Now, Cob!

810
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:28,838
Aye, sir.

811
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:32,633
Mitchell, Walker.
Take the captain below.

812
01:05:00,036 --> 01:05:03,247
You're way out of your league, Hunter.

813
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:06,959
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.

814
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,225
What the hell we waitin' for?

815
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,202
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done...

816
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:48,709
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.

817
01:05:53,422 --> 01:05:54,966
Anybody?

818
01:06:05,351 --> 01:06:07,186
All right.

819
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:15,361
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.

820
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,750
<i> This is the executive officer.</i>

821
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:31,877
<i>I have assumed command of this ship</i>

822
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:36,799
<i>under authority granted me
by navy regulations.</i>

823
01:06:36,882 --> 01:06:40,386
<i>I have relieved Captain Ramsey
of his duties for acting in contravention</i>

824
01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:43,973
<i>of the rules and regulations
regarding nuclear weapons release.</i>

825
01:06:44,056 --> 01:06:48,686
<i>It is my intention
to delay the missile launch</i>

826
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:52,398
<i>maintaining our current state of readiness</i>

827
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:58,362
<i>pending confirmation of an emergency
action message cut off during the attack.</i>

828
01:06:58,446 --> 01:07:01,907
<i>Remain at battle stations missile.</i>

829
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:04,076
<i>Carry on.</i>

830
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:10,499
- What the hell are we doin', Fred?
- I'm pissin' my pants.

831
01:07:28,726 --> 01:07:30,770
Come on, boy.

832
01:07:42,198 --> 01:07:48,829
Conn, Weapons. Russians will have
missile launch capability in 39 minutes.

833
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:50,831
Chief of the Boat.

834
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:56,337
Sir?

835
01:07:57,588 --> 01:07:59,298
Thank you, Cob.

836
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:02,385
"Thank you"?
Fuck you.

837
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:05,972
Get it straight, Mr. Hunter.
I'm not on your side.

838
01:08:06,055 --> 01:08:11,102
You could be wrong. But wrong or right,
the captain can't just replace you at will.

839
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:17,775
That was completely improper,
and that's why I did what I did, by the book.

840
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:20,695
I thank you anyway.

841
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,253
Radio, Conn. Mr. Zimmer, get those
communications back online now.

842
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:40,798
We're working on it, sir.

843
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,509
Aye, aye, Captain.

844
01:08:43,592 --> 01:08:46,220
- Are you ready?
- Uh... ready.

845
01:08:46,304 --> 01:08:47,805
Go.

846
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:50,141
Jesus. Fuckin' thing.

847
01:08:50,224 --> 01:08:54,854
This whole system is crashed. Radio buoy
is severed. What does he want us to do?

848
01:08:54,937 --> 01:08:59,066
- Shit electrons?
- Hey, Vossler, we need communications.

849
01:08:59,191 --> 01:09:00,151
Aye, sir.

850
01:09:00,192 --> 01:09:02,820
- All stop, ten degrees up.
- Ten up. Aye, sir.

851
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,864
All stop. Aye, sir. All stop.

852
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:29,180
Conn, Sonar. Holy shit, sir!
He's on top of us! He's turning toward.

853
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:34,810
- Range?
- 600 yards.

854
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:42,360
Conn, Sonar. Torpedoes in the water.
Bearing 0-4-8-0-5-0.

855
01:09:44,487 --> 01:09:46,197
- Left full rudder.
- Aye, sir.

856
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,782
All ahead full. Zero bubble.

857
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,621
- Torpedoes are ready.
- No. Our weapons won't have time to arm.

858
01:09:53,704 --> 01:09:56,874
All ahead flank. Chief of the Watch
to Maneuvering. Max speed.

859
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,209
Maximum speed.

860
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:08,344
Sonar, Conn. Let me know when our range
to that Akula has opened to 1,000 yards.

861
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:09,679
Aye, sir.

862
01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:12,306
Let's shoot the fucker!
What's 1,000 yards for?

863
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:16,477
It takes 1,000 yards for the torpedoes to
arm. Who'd you fuck to get on this ship?

864
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,693
Conn, Sonar. Torpedoes,
150 yards and closing fast, sir.

865
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:28,155
Bearing 0-7-0-0-7-4.

866
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:31,867
Launch port countermeasures.

867
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:36,956
- Countermeasures away, sir.
- Rig ship for impact.

868
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,040
Aye, sir.

869
01:10:51,095 --> 01:10:55,016
They missed! They passed astern.
They were too close to arm, sir.

870
01:10:55,099 --> 01:10:59,020
Conn, Sonar. Range to the Akula
950 yards and opening fast.

871
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:01,522
Go to arming mechanisms,
tubes two and four.

872
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:07,653
- Snapshot, two and four.
- Tubes fired electrically, sir.

873
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:19,999
Give me exact ranging
and speed on our weapons.

874
01:11:20,124 --> 01:11:23,919
Range 300 yards and 50 knots, sir.

875
01:11:26,464 --> 01:11:29,175
200 yards, 50 knots.

876
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:33,554
100 yards, 55 knots.

877
01:11:34,764 --> 01:11:37,308
75 yards.
Weapons ready for arming, sir.

878
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,852
- Steady course 2-3-1.
- Aye, sir. 2-3-1.

879
01:11:40,936 --> 01:11:42,855
Arm torpedoes two and four...

880
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:46,817
- Now.
- Torpedoes armed.

881
01:11:51,656 --> 01:11:54,450
We're locked on the Akula!

882
01:12:05,836 --> 01:12:09,423
You got him, sir! You got him!

883
01:12:17,306 --> 01:12:21,519
Conn, Sonar. Incoming torpedo. They
must have got one off before they got hit.

884
01:12:21,644 --> 01:12:25,189
Right full rudder.
Launch starboard countermeasures.

885
01:12:25,314 --> 01:12:27,775
- Countermeasures away.
- Dive, depth 1200 feet.

886
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:32,113
Down now. Take her deep, take her deep.
Full dive on those planes. Let's go!

887
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,450
Hang on, everybody!

888
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,693
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah!

889
01:13:16,991 --> 01:13:20,036
Open the aft main drain suction!

890
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:23,289
Start the drain pump!
Go, go, go!

891
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:30,129
All stations,
make damage report to Control.

892
01:13:30,212 --> 01:13:35,176
Control, this is Bilge Bay.
We've got out-of-control flooding.

893
01:13:35,217 --> 01:13:37,178
Request damage control.

894
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:40,723
- Get a damage control party down there.
- Aye, sir.

895
01:13:40,806 --> 01:13:44,977
Get Lieutenant Hellerman. Flooding
in the bilge bay. Get him down there now!

896
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:52,944
Conn, Maneuvering.
We've lost propulsion, sir.

897
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:56,739
- Chief of the Boat, how we doin'?
- We are going down. I need propulsion.

898
01:13:56,822 --> 01:14:01,327
Forward ballast tanks are damaged, sir.
Forward air pressure, zero.

899
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:05,081
Maneuvering, Conn.
Restore propulsion as soon as possible.

900
01:14:05,206 --> 01:14:08,751
Restoring propulsion
as soon as possible. Aye, sir.

901
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:27,520
Control, Bilge Bay. Flooding is slowed.
I think we got it under control, sir.

902
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:32,066
Passing 1500 feet.
At 1850, it's all over.

903
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:50,251
Passing 1600 feet.

904
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:05,433
Barnes, get over here.
Help me with this loose valve!

905
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:21,449
Passing 1650 feet.

906
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:34,211
- What the fuck is going on?
- Take it easy.

907
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:50,770
Conn, Bilge Bay. Flooding has
recommenced. Three men are trapped.

908
01:15:51,604 --> 01:15:55,107
Bilge Bay, Conn. Try and get those men
out of there and seal that bay.

909
01:15:55,191 --> 01:15:59,320
Sir, if we don't seal the bilge bay now,
we'll lose the ship.

910
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,824
Bilge Bay, Conn.
Can you get the men out?

911
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:06,911
There's no way.
If I go down there, I'll never get out.

912
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:12,750
Barnes, come on!
You've got to come! Move, move!

913
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,962
<i>Barnes, come on!
You can do it! Move it!</i>

914
01:16:16,712 --> 01:16:18,756
Bilge Bay, Conn.
Seal that bay.

915
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:21,676
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I've got to close the hatch!

916
01:16:23,844 --> 01:16:27,264
What the fuck are we doing here?

917
01:16:27,306 --> 01:16:29,934
Bilge Bay, Conn.
I say again, seal that bay.

918
01:16:30,017 --> 01:16:32,687
Sir, there are men down there.
They're gonna drown.

919
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,564
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders.

920
01:16:35,648 --> 01:16:38,442
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!

921
01:16:38,484 --> 01:16:42,321
Barnes!
Please, get the fuck out!

922
01:16:46,242 --> 01:16:48,411
Barnes!

923
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,040
Come on!

924
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:56,043
Barnes!

925
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:32,163
Conn, Bilge Bay.

926
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:35,458
Seawater hatch is sealed, sir.

927
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:43,633
Very well.

928
01:17:56,687 --> 01:17:58,856
Passing 1800 feet.

929
01:17:58,981 --> 01:18:01,901
Approaching hull crush depth, sir.

930
01:18:25,132 --> 01:18:26,717
1-8-2-5.

931
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:43,734
Conn, Maneuvering.
Turbine power restored.

932
01:18:43,818 --> 01:18:46,904
<i>Main seawater cross valve repaired.</i>

933
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:55,204
And rising.

934
01:18:55,288 --> 01:18:57,915
Propulsion limit. Ahead full, sir.

935
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:01,669
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.

936
01:19:30,906 --> 01:19:34,452
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.

937
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:51,177
- Step aside.
- I'm sorry. The XO ordered...

938
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,387
Fuck the XO!

939
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:58,225
The ship has been hit
and I'm going in to see my captain.

940
01:19:58,267 --> 01:20:01,103
Now stand aside.

941
01:20:01,145 --> 01:20:02,605
Stand aside!

942
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:07,193
Captain?

943
01:20:12,448 --> 01:20:13,908
Sir.

944
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:17,036
- How bad is it, Mr. Dougherty?
- It's bad, sir.

945
01:20:19,038 --> 01:20:21,165
I've just been looking at Hunter's file.

946
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,710
The closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.

947
01:20:24,794 --> 01:20:27,505
Give me an order, sir.

948
01:20:27,588 --> 01:20:33,260
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Westergaurd.

949
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:35,096
How about Linkletter?

950
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:38,557
Nah, you won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.

951
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:42,186
But you can get to Weps.
We got to have Weps. He's the key.

952
01:20:42,311 --> 01:20:46,524
You get me those men, a small security
force, then come back and get me.

953
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:49,443
- Aye, sir.
- Don't try to recruit the whole ship.

954
01:20:50,569 --> 01:20:55,032
- We'll lead from the top down.
- Aye, sir. Right away.

955
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:03,708
The radio's 50%.

956
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:08,587
Can I talk to you in the passageway?

957
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:10,715
Right now, Pete.

958
01:21:10,798 --> 01:21:12,383
Come on.

959
01:21:26,897 --> 01:21:29,442
What's goin' on?

960
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,279
Sir.

961
01:21:35,114 --> 01:21:37,783
We're not gonna let this go down
with the XO at the helm.

962
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:39,243
- We're not?
- No, we're not.

963
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:44,206
I've been with the captain for years and I'm
meant to follow Hunter 'cause he says so?

964
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:48,711
You've been ordered to.
That's what this is about - proper orders.

965
01:21:48,794 --> 01:21:51,547
He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.

966
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:54,300
He's in command now!

967
01:21:54,425 --> 01:21:58,638
If they order him to launch, we'll launch
and we'll blow 'em all to hell.

968
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,223
I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.

969
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:05,519
Look, our procedures are clear.
In the absence of a contravening order,

970
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:08,731
in a situation like this,
we follow the orders in hand.

971
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:12,818
Exactly. Know how many checks we do
to make sure a launch order is authentic?

972
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:17,156
The XO agreed with those orders. Now
he throws them away? They don't count?

973
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,243
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit! I know this guy, Bobby!

974
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:22,828
We've been ordered to launch.

975
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:26,374
Why would we do that
if they weren't prepared to launch at us?

976
01:22:26,457 --> 01:22:31,671
We don't know that. That's the point. That's
why he wants time to confirm the message.

977
01:22:31,712 --> 01:22:35,174
That's the whole fucking point
is we don't have time!

978
01:22:35,257 --> 01:22:40,012
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Why do you think he's doing that? Why?

979
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:43,474
You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck.

980
01:22:44,183 --> 01:22:49,146
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.

981
01:22:50,564 --> 01:22:52,984
Come on, man.

982
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:56,487
Peter, think about your family, man.

983
01:22:57,071 --> 01:23:00,616
I am. I am!

984
01:23:07,707 --> 01:23:09,917
What do you plan to do?

985
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:13,421
Nothing without you.
You're a senior officer, a department head.

986
01:23:13,504 --> 01:23:16,882
- TSO's with Hunter.
- You have keys to the small arms locker.

987
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:21,512
Now, we want to recruit a few more men
and then we're gonna open that arsenal.

988
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:24,307
I just talked to the captain in his room.

989
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:28,728
He specifically asked for you.
He says we cannot go without you.

990
01:23:30,062 --> 01:23:32,690
I don't believe this.

991
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:36,777
This is a mutiny, Peter.

992
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:42,533
There's only two sides to a mutiny.
Now, your captain is asking for your help.

993
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:44,577
What are you gonna do?

994
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:48,164
What are you gonna do?

995
01:24:00,343 --> 01:24:02,345
All right.

996
01:24:05,097 --> 01:24:10,603
Conn, Weapons. Russian missiles
will have launch capability in 24 minutes.

997
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:30,206
You're doing the right thing.

998
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:49,517
<i> Electrical power has been
restored. Prepare to reinitiate the system.</i>

999
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:58,276
Radio, Conn. Mr. Zimmer,
what's the status on that radio repair?

1000
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:02,238
All systems are still down, sir.
Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.

1001
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:04,573
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know.</i>

1002
01:25:06,617 --> 01:25:08,577
Very well.

1003
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:16,002
- Mr. Mahoney has the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

1004
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:17,420
- Cob.
- Sir?

1005
01:25:17,461 --> 01:25:20,089
- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.

1006
01:25:20,172 --> 01:25:23,509
- Get a side arm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1007
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:25,386
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.

1008
01:25:27,847 --> 01:25:29,807
Turn around.

1009
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:33,102
At ease, sailor.

1010
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:42,820
- Sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Ince.

1011
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:45,948
- Mr. Westergaurd.
- Sir.

1012
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,993
- Mr. Zimmer.
- Ready, sir.

1013
01:25:50,036 --> 01:25:52,538
Let's get on with it.

1014
01:25:53,664 --> 01:25:56,751
Stand guard.

1015
01:26:01,547 --> 01:26:04,508
All you people,
return to your stations.

1016
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,385
- Mr. Rivetti.
- Sir?

1017
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:09,013
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:26,614
Is there a problem, sir?

1019
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,912
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.

1020
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:46,676
Conn, Weapons. Russian missiles
will have launch capability in 21 minutes.

1021
01:26:47,176 --> 01:26:48,844
Who's in charge here?

1022
01:26:48,886 --> 01:26:50,846
Shit!

1023
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:53,516
Me, sir. Oh, fuck!

1024
01:26:54,892 --> 01:26:58,521
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.

1025
01:26:58,562 --> 01:27:00,523
- Do you know what's going on?
- Yes.

1026
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:04,318
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.

1027
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,990
If we launch and we're wrong,
what's left of Russia is gonna launch at us.

1028
01:27:09,031 --> 01:27:13,369
There will be a nuclear holocaust beyond
imagination. It's about knowing, Mr...

1029
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:17,373
Vossler. We have to know whether our
order to launch has been recalled or not.

1030
01:27:17,415 --> 01:27:21,210
The only way we're gonna know is
if you fix that radio. You understand?

1031
01:27:21,294 --> 01:27:23,379
Yes, sir.

1032
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,465
<i>- You ever watch Star Trek?
- Yeah...</i>

1033
01:27:26,549 --> 01:27:29,802
<i>Star Trek. You know, Star Trek,
the USS Enterprise. All right.</i>

1034
01:27:29,885 --> 01:27:33,347
<i>Remember when the Klingons were gonna
blow up the Enterprise? Kirk says:</i>

1035
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:37,226
- "Scotty, I gotta have more power."
- He needs more warp speed. Yeah.

1036
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:40,855
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.

1037
01:27:40,896 --> 01:27:44,442
If you don't get this radio up,
a billion people will die. It's up to you.

1038
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:48,904
I know that's a shitty deal, but you got it.
Can you handle it?

1039
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:53,034
Scotty?

1040
01:27:55,411 --> 01:27:57,622
Aye, Captain.

1041
01:27:59,624 --> 01:28:01,584
- You got anything?
- No, Vossler.

1042
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,003
Then get on it.

1043
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:13,137
- I have the conn.
- XO has the conn.

1044
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:17,433
Chief of the Boat, make your depth
7-5 feet. Continue up to periscope depth.

1045
01:28:17,516 --> 01:28:20,436
Delay that order!

1046
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:38,496
Any of you officers or chiefs feel you've
been unjustly caught up in this thing,

1047
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:41,916
you stand with me now.

1048
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,040
Sir, propulsion has been restored.

1049
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:25,584
All flooding has been contained.

1050
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:29,547
All communications are still down.

1051
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:39,515
Take him away.
Lock him up in the officers' mess.

1052
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,137
Of all the people.

1053
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,943
Weps, return to Missile Control.

1054
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:33,903
- Mr. Zimmer, stay with me.
- Aye, sir.

1055
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:39,241
Return to your stations. Inform your men
directly that the captain is in command.

1056
01:30:39,325 --> 01:30:41,661
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

1057
01:30:41,786 --> 01:30:46,499
- Diving officer, make the depth 1-5-0 feet.
- 1-5-0 feet. Aye, sir.

1058
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:50,169
- One MC.
- Aye, sir.

1059
01:30:50,252 --> 01:30:54,840
<i>May I have your attention, please.
Crew of the USS Alabama.</i>

1060
01:30:56,175 --> 01:30:59,887
Attempted mutiny has been put down.

1061
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:05,768
<i>We'll maintain security alert. Authorized
movement only in two-man teams.</i>

1062
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:08,229
<i>In the absence of
further radio communication,</i>

1063
01:31:08,312 --> 01:31:10,815
<i>on orders from
the National Command Center,</i>

1064
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:16,153
<i>we'll achieve launch depth as quickly
as we can for strategic missile launch.</i>

1065
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,072
<i>We all know what this means.</i>

1066
01:31:18,197 --> 01:31:21,117
It's not something one would wish for,

1067
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:25,288
but we have the obligation under
orders issued by our commander in chief

1068
01:31:25,371 --> 01:31:28,249
to prevent the attack on our country.

1069
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:33,212
<i>Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 15 minutes.</i>

1070
01:31:33,296 --> 01:31:35,298
<i>Set condition One SQ.</i>

1071
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:41,012
Spin up missiles one through five and
20 through 24 for strategic missile launch.

1072
01:31:41,053 --> 01:31:44,265
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1073
01:31:44,348 --> 01:31:48,603
This is the captain.
Mr. Zimmer is the new XO.

1074
01:31:50,563 --> 01:31:53,357
Set condition One SQ.

1075
01:31:56,527 --> 01:32:01,866
Spin up missiles one through five
and 20 through 24 for strategic launch.

1076
01:32:01,907 --> 01:32:04,952
<i>The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.</i>

1077
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:06,412
<i>This is the XO.</i>

1078
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,332
Weapons, Conn.

1079
01:32:09,415 --> 01:32:14,670
Confirm target package SLBM 64741/2

1080
01:32:14,754 --> 01:32:17,632
for missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.

1081
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:22,178
<i>- Target package confirmation, sir.
- This is the captain.</i>

1082
01:32:30,394 --> 01:32:36,067
Conn, Weapons.
Confirm target package SLBM 64741/2

1083
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:40,279
for missiles one through five
and 20 through 24. Aye, sir.

1084
01:32:49,914 --> 01:32:52,625
Look, It's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.

1085
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:55,086
It's not about the book.

1086
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:58,714
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we sit here and do nothing,

1087
01:32:58,756 --> 01:33:00,341
who's gonna stop 'em?

1088
01:33:00,424 --> 01:33:05,054
Half of me is glad the captain came back.
He could be right, you know.

1089
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:07,598
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.

1090
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:11,102
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.

1091
01:33:11,143 --> 01:33:14,063
That's why we have to find out first.

1092
01:33:20,945 --> 01:33:24,532
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over? Hm?

1093
01:33:24,615 --> 01:33:26,575
We launch. They see us.

1094
01:33:26,659 --> 01:33:29,870
They launch.

1095
01:33:29,954 --> 01:33:32,748
Our birds pass each other
in the air. Boom!

1096
01:33:32,832 --> 01:33:35,584
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.

1097
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:38,129
Nuclear holocaust.

1098
01:33:44,302 --> 01:33:47,513
I gotta take a wiz.

1099
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:52,143
OK.

1100
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:54,020
Sir?

1101
01:34:07,825 --> 01:34:10,578
- What are you doing here?
- Just going to the bath...

1102
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:12,622
Nobody moves alone.
You know the drill.

1103
01:34:12,663 --> 01:34:15,082
Come on, I need an escort to take a shit?

1104
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:16,959
Shut up.

1105
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:19,962
- I'm gonna call Control. You stay there.
- Fuck that.

1106
01:34:20,046 --> 01:34:22,298
I mean it, man.

1107
01:34:26,844 --> 01:34:29,305
OK, Moebius, open the door.

1108
01:34:29,347 --> 01:34:32,683
- You broke my nose, man.
- Shut up, fat boy.

1109
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:38,230
- Mr. Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him.

1110
01:34:38,314 --> 01:34:41,275
Go to Laundry.
Get four sets of coveralls, and four caps.

1111
01:34:41,317 --> 01:34:42,985
Aye, sir.

1112
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:45,154
Just relax.

1113
01:34:49,492 --> 01:34:52,912
Davis. Can I talk to you a second?

1114
01:34:52,995 --> 01:34:55,331
Come on.

1115
01:34:56,332 --> 01:34:58,834
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.

1116
01:35:08,594 --> 01:35:12,223
- We're with you, sir.
- Let's go.

1117
01:35:21,774 --> 01:35:25,194
- Approaching launch depth.
- Very well.

1118
01:35:25,278 --> 01:35:28,406
Make your depth 1-5-0 feet.

1119
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:32,285
- Zero bubble. Commence hovering.
- Aye, sir.

1120
01:35:32,368 --> 01:35:35,413
Conn, Weapons. Estimated time
to weapons system One SQ,

1121
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:38,666
three minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

1122
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:43,462
Conn, Weapons. Russian missiles
will have launch capability in 12 minutes.

1123
01:35:43,546 --> 01:35:45,172
<i>Opening missile hatches.</i>

1124
01:36:02,898 --> 01:36:04,942
<i>- Weps.
- Weps.</i>

1125
01:36:05,026 --> 01:36:07,903
<i>- This is Hunter. Listen to me.
- Where are you?</i>

1126
01:36:07,987 --> 01:36:12,366
Don't worry about that. You can't proceed.
We got other ships that can handle this.

1127
01:36:12,408 --> 01:36:17,038
You can't be influenced by the captain or
anybody else. Make up your own mind.

1128
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:21,459
Conn, Weapons. Estimated time to
missile launch three minutes and counting.

1129
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:23,544
Weps, Weps, listen.
Don't do this.

1130
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:26,589
<i>Once you launch, they cannot come back,</i>

1131
01:36:26,672 --> 01:36:29,634
<i>and you know the repercussions
if we're wrong, Weps.</i>

1132
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:34,263
If we fire now, we'll be firing while we're
blind and crippled. You understand me?

1133
01:36:34,347 --> 01:36:37,767
<i>- Where the fuck are you?
- Do not remove that firing trigger.</i>

1134
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,769
<i>Do not open the safe.
It's up to you.</i>

1135
01:36:39,852 --> 01:36:43,481
You're the only one that knows
the combination. It's up to you, Weps.

1136
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:45,566
It's up to you.

1137
01:36:48,152 --> 01:36:50,571
Mind your fuckin' panel!

1138
01:36:57,161 --> 01:37:00,081
- You guys ready?
- Just about, sir.

1139
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:04,961
Radio, XO. Vossler?

1140
01:37:05,044 --> 01:37:09,006
XO, Radio. Sir...
I don't know, sir.

1141
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:12,551
Vossler, calm down.
Take a deep breath. Are you calm?

1142
01:37:12,635 --> 01:37:13,803
Yeah, sort of.

1143
01:37:13,886 --> 01:37:17,306
Get the radio fixed, Vossler.
How long is it gonna take you?

1144
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:19,600
I don't know.

1145
01:37:20,643 --> 01:37:23,062
Well, how much time do you need?

1146
01:37:25,273 --> 01:37:26,399
Shit!

1147
01:37:26,482 --> 01:37:28,943
- Let's go.
- OK.

1148
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:37,576
Missile tubes one through five
and 20 through 24 at One SQ, sir.

1149
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:45,793
Ship is hovering on automatic.
Dive is at One SQ, Captain.

1150
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:50,506
Missiles at One SQ.
Ready to launch, sir.

1151
01:37:56,262 --> 01:38:01,309
Sir, weapons system is at One SQ.
Missiles are ready for launch, sir.

1152
01:38:01,434 --> 01:38:03,144
Very well.

1153
01:38:03,644 --> 01:38:06,564
- Weapons.
- Aye, sir.

1154
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:09,567
Weapons, Conn.
Remove the tactical firing trigger.

1155
01:38:21,746 --> 01:38:24,123
- One MC.
- Aye, sir.

1156
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:28,669
Weapons, this is the captain.
Unlock the tactical firing trigger.

1157
01:38:33,341 --> 01:38:34,759
Weps?

1158
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:39,305
Missiles are ready to launch, man.

1159
01:38:41,807 --> 01:38:43,684
Sir.

1160
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:48,397
Shit.

1161
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:51,108
Mr. Zimmer.

1162
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:54,820
No one is to touch this key.
I'm gonna launch from Missile Control.

1163
01:38:54,904 --> 01:38:56,614
Aye, aye, sir.

1164
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:59,158
Westergaurd. Dougherty.
Come with me.

1165
01:38:59,241 --> 01:39:03,204
- Mr. Mahoney, take the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

1166
01:39:05,247 --> 01:39:09,210
What are you doing, man?
We're at One SQ. We're ready.

1167
01:39:10,795 --> 01:39:12,463
- Mr. Dougherty.
- Aye.

1168
01:39:12,505 --> 01:39:15,758
- Station your guards fore and aft.
- Last two, forward hatch.

1169
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:18,177
First two, aft hatch.

1170
01:39:19,512 --> 01:39:22,640
They're gonna fire from Missile Control.

1171
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,273
We gotta get back to the conn,
disarm the system.

1172
01:39:30,356 --> 01:39:33,276
We'll travel in the crawl spaces.

1173
01:39:47,873 --> 01:39:49,959
Mr. Ince!

1174
01:39:51,377 --> 01:39:55,172
Mr. Ince, remove the tactical firing key.

1175
01:39:55,214 --> 01:39:57,174
Sir, it is my duty to...

1176
01:39:57,216 --> 01:40:00,678
Son, don't talk to me about duty.
Open the fucking safe!

1177
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:13,858
I can't do that, sir.

1178
01:40:20,698 --> 01:40:26,120
I'm gonna count to three and then
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off. One.

1179
01:40:28,039 --> 01:40:29,040
Two.

1180
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:35,296
Shit!

1181
01:40:37,048 --> 01:40:42,470
It does me no good to kill you. You're
the only one that knows the combination.

1182
01:40:43,846 --> 01:40:46,223
However...

1183
01:40:46,349 --> 01:40:50,645
Petty Officer Hilaire
doesn't know the combination.

1184
01:40:53,022 --> 01:40:56,692
Millions of lives at stake here, Peter.
Don't make a dumb decision.

1185
01:40:56,776 --> 01:40:57,735
One!

1186
01:40:59,403 --> 01:41:01,822
Two!

1187
01:41:01,906 --> 01:41:03,366
Sir!

1188
01:41:27,807 --> 01:41:29,058
- Cob.
- Yo.

1189
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:31,435
You and Hunsicker
enter the conn from the bow.

1190
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:35,064
We will come in through the aft.
Rivetti, you jump on Zimmer, OK?

1191
01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:56,627
Come on, come on!

1192
01:41:59,588 --> 01:42:01,048
- Fire Control ready?
- Aye.

1193
01:42:01,132 --> 01:42:02,925
<i>- Launcher ready?
- Aye, sir.</i>

1194
01:42:03,801 --> 01:42:04,885
Initiate fire.

1195
01:42:04,927 --> 01:42:06,887
- Freeze!
- Drop the weapon now!

1196
01:42:06,929 --> 01:42:10,725
Move forward! Move, move, move,
move, move! Get his pistol.

1197
01:42:10,766 --> 01:42:12,602
Fire one!

1198
01:42:13,019 --> 01:42:16,063
Number one did not fire, sir.

1199
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:20,234
Sir, the captain's key has been removed.

1200
01:42:20,318 --> 01:42:21,861
Hunter.

1201
01:42:21,944 --> 01:42:24,739
- Come on.
- You're a piece of shit.

1202
01:42:25,948 --> 01:42:27,908
You and you, man the forward hatches.

1203
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:30,036
You, you, man the aft hatches.

1204
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:31,954
We're going up to periscope depth,

1205
01:42:31,996 --> 01:42:35,249
we're gonna reestablish communications
and get that message.

1206
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:38,919
Now, anybody got a problem with that?

1207
01:42:38,961 --> 01:42:43,257
- Chief of the Boat, depth 7-8 feet.
- Aye, aye, sir. Five degree up bubble.

1208
01:42:43,299 --> 01:42:46,552
- Mr. Linkletter, man that periscope.
- Raising number two scope.

1209
01:42:46,636 --> 01:42:49,055
Radio, Conn. Mr. Vossler.

1210
01:42:49,889 --> 01:42:52,934
This is Captain Kirk.
I need warp speed on that radio.

1211
01:42:53,017 --> 01:42:54,477
Yes, sir.

1212
01:42:56,062 --> 01:43:02,318
Conn, Weapons. Russian missiles will
have launch capability in nine minutes.

1213
01:43:03,694 --> 01:43:05,404
Oh, shit!

1214
01:43:05,488 --> 01:43:07,657
- What happened?
- Reattach that lead.

1215
01:43:21,212 --> 01:43:23,506
78 feet.
At periscope depth, sir.

1216
01:43:23,589 --> 01:43:25,758
- Mr. Linkletter.
- No close contact, sir.

1217
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:29,345
Very well. Chief of the Watch,
raise the VLF radio antenna.

1218
01:43:29,428 --> 01:43:31,931
Raise the VLF antenna.
Aye, sir.

1219
01:43:33,015 --> 01:43:36,018
VLF antenna coming up.

1220
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:43,818
Conn, Radio. Sir, I think she's breathing.
We're getting close.

1221
01:43:53,869 --> 01:43:55,413
- Halt, sir!
- Shoot me.

1222
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:57,123
Shit. Shit.

1223
01:43:57,206 --> 01:43:59,500
I got him.

1224
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:01,752
I have the conn.

1225
01:44:03,713 --> 01:44:06,007
Give me my missile key.

1226
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:17,226
Give me the missile key, Mr. Hunter.

1227
01:44:30,865 --> 01:44:36,162
I'm the commander of this fucking ship!
Give me that goddamn key!

1228
01:44:38,706 --> 01:44:44,378
<i>Conn. Weapons. Russian missiles will
have launch capability in seven minutes.</i>

1229
01:44:45,087 --> 01:44:47,173
<i>Conn. Radio. Sir.</i>

1230
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,761
Radio, Conn.

1231
01:44:51,844 --> 01:44:56,182
Captain, Radio. Vossler, sir. She's
breathing again. We are really close.

1232
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:59,644
You got three minutes, Vossler.
Three minutes and counting.

1233
01:44:59,727 --> 01:45:01,896
Yes, sir.

1234
01:45:03,147 --> 01:45:06,192
You got three minutes.

1235
01:45:15,284 --> 01:45:18,746
Come on.

1236
01:45:35,346 --> 01:45:39,433
Come on, Vossler. Come on.
Keep it going, keep it going.

1237
01:45:45,606 --> 01:45:47,692
Speaking of horses...

1238
01:45:49,151 --> 01:45:52,530
did you ever see
those Lippizaner stallions?

1239
01:45:52,613 --> 01:45:54,782
What?

1240
01:45:54,865 --> 01:45:59,287
From Portugal.
The Lippizaner stallions.

1241
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:04,083
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.

1242
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:06,460
Yes, sir.

1243
01:46:07,253 --> 01:46:12,758
"Yes, sir," you're aware they're all white,
or "Yes, sir," you've seen them?

1244
01:46:14,594 --> 01:46:20,766
Yes, sir, I've seen them.
Yes, sir, I'm aware that they're all white.

1245
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:24,895
They're not from Portugal.
They're from Spain.

1246
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:27,273
And at birth, they're not white.

1247
01:46:27,315 --> 01:46:29,775
They're black.

1248
01:46:29,817 --> 01:46:32,028
Sir.

1249
01:46:32,111 --> 01:46:34,363
I didn't know that.

1250
01:46:34,447 --> 01:46:36,699
But they are from Portugal.

1251
01:46:40,578 --> 01:46:43,122
- Come on, Vossler, come on.
- Yes. Yes.

1252
01:46:43,205 --> 01:46:45,833
Come on. Come on. You got it.

1253
01:46:49,045 --> 01:46:53,174
Some of the things they do,
uh, defy belief.

1254
01:46:54,425 --> 01:46:58,095
Their training program is simplicity itself.

1255
01:46:58,179 --> 01:47:03,976
You just stick a cattle prod up their ass
and you can get a horse to deal cards.

1256
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:06,062
Simple matter of voltage.

1257
01:47:14,737 --> 01:47:17,865
You're gonna get it. Come on.

1258
01:47:19,408 --> 01:47:21,118
I almost had it. You saw it.

1259
01:47:21,202 --> 01:47:27,124
Conn, Weapons. Russian missiles will
have launch capability in four minutes.

1260
01:47:30,252 --> 01:47:32,713
- There you go! There you go!
- Ah, shit!

1261
01:47:37,635 --> 01:47:39,387
- Go, go, go.
- Look at it, Vossler.

1262
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:41,347
There we go, there we go!

1263
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:44,183
Yes!

1264
01:47:48,938 --> 01:47:52,024
Conn, Radio. Flash traffic.
Emergency action message.

1265
01:47:52,108 --> 01:47:54,318
<i>Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.</i>

1266
01:47:54,402 --> 01:47:55,528
Fuck, yeah!

1267
01:47:57,029 --> 01:47:58,739
Alert one. Alert one.

1268
01:47:58,823 --> 01:48:00,783
Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.

1269
01:48:00,825 --> 01:48:02,868
- Get that EAM.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1270
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:09,500
God help you if you're wrong.

1271
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:12,920
If I'm wrong, then we're at war.

1272
01:48:13,004 --> 01:48:14,463
God help us all.

1273
01:48:25,933 --> 01:48:29,353
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message

1274
01:48:29,437 --> 01:48:32,565
from the National Command Authority.
Permission to authenticate.

1275
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:35,651
Permission granted.
Authenticate.

1276
01:48:42,366 --> 01:48:46,912
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

1277
01:48:46,996 --> 01:48:51,667
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

1278
01:48:51,751 --> 01:48:55,421
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.

1279
01:49:04,889 --> 01:49:06,933
I concur, sir.

1280
01:49:07,058 --> 01:49:09,268
Message is authentic.

1281
01:49:20,529 --> 01:49:21,781
One MC.

1282
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:27,703
<i>Crew of the Alabama.
this is the captain.</i>

1283
01:49:27,787 --> 01:49:30,039
Set condition Two SQ.

1284
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:34,251
Terminate launch, all missiles.

1285
01:50:18,296 --> 01:50:21,299
Mr. Hunter has the conn.

1286
01:51:21,525 --> 01:51:26,614
In the early hours, Russian army forces
moved in and met little resistance.

1287
01:51:26,697 --> 01:51:31,911
<i>There were some sporadic battles, but
the specter of fighting their countrymen</i>

1288
01:51:31,994 --> 01:51:35,998
<i>proved too much for these rebel troops
and they surrendered quickly.</i>

1289
01:51:36,082 --> 01:51:39,835
<i>So a crisis that seemed to be escalating
beyond the point of no return</i>

1290
01:51:39,919 --> 01:51:43,506
<i>was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead,</i>

1291
01:51:43,589 --> 01:51:48,010
<i>and the nuclear base captured by
Radchenko is back in government hands.</i>

1292
01:51:48,094 --> 01:51:52,723
<i>Reporting live from the French aircraft
carrier Foch in the Mediterranean Sea,</i>

1293
01:51:52,807 --> 01:51:56,143
this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.

1294
01:52:11,367 --> 01:52:14,662
Chief of the Boat.

1295
01:52:41,606 --> 01:52:43,065
Captain Ramsey.

1296
01:53:20,937 --> 01:53:23,064
Lieutenant Commander Hunter.

1297
01:53:31,197 --> 01:53:35,159
Stand there Lieutenant Commander
Hunter. This won't take long.

1298
01:53:35,201 --> 01:53:38,537
This panel has convened
in order to investigate the events

1299
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:43,793
subsequent to the setting of condition
One SQ for strategic missile launch

1300
01:53:43,876 --> 01:53:47,713
<i>on-board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.</i>

1301
01:53:47,755 --> 01:53:52,134
<i>Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on-board the Alabama</i>

1302
01:53:52,218 --> 01:53:57,139
and in no small measure to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey,

1303
01:53:57,223 --> 01:53:59,850
I am prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.

1304
01:53:59,892 --> 01:54:01,894
Without my testimony, sir?

1305
01:54:01,894 --> 01:54:05,856
- You have a problem with that?
- I might, sir.

1306
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:08,901
Are you concerned that
your recollection of the events

1307
01:54:08,985 --> 01:54:11,696
- differs from that of your captain's?
- Well...

1308
01:54:11,779 --> 01:54:16,242
I have known Captain Ramsey
for almost 30 years.

1309
01:54:16,325 --> 01:54:19,453
We served together
on more than a few occasions.

1310
01:54:19,537 --> 01:54:23,207
If he is lying, this will be
the first I've heard of it.

1311
01:54:23,249 --> 01:54:24,709
Yes, sir.

1312
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:29,171
My primary concern here
is the breakdown in the system.

1313
01:54:29,255 --> 01:54:32,174
In this instance, the system failed

1314
01:54:32,258 --> 01:54:37,179
because the two senior officers
did not work to resolve their differences

1315
01:54:37,263 --> 01:54:39,890
while preserving the chain of command.

1316
01:54:39,974 --> 01:54:43,436
Now, you may have been
proven right, Mr. Hunter,

1317
01:54:43,561 --> 01:54:49,317
but insofar as the letter of the law
is concerned, you were both right.

1318
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:53,070
And you were also both wrong.

1319
01:54:53,112 --> 01:54:57,617
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this navy,

1320
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:03,706
and this country's armed forces as a whole
long after you leave this room.

1321
01:55:05,958 --> 01:55:11,422
Off the record, you've both
created one hell of a mess -

1322
01:55:11,464 --> 01:55:15,676
a mutiny aboard
a United States nuclear submarine.

1323
01:55:16,385 --> 01:55:20,681
Violation of nuclear launch protocol.

1324
01:55:23,935 --> 01:55:26,604
For the record,
it is the conclusion of this panel

1325
01:55:26,687 --> 01:55:30,733
<i>that your actions
aboard the Alabama were consistent</i>

1326
01:55:30,816 --> 01:55:34,612
with the best traditions of the navy
and in the interests of the United States.

1327
01:55:34,654 --> 01:55:39,575
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept

1328
01:55:39,617 --> 01:55:44,580
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country

1329
01:55:44,664 --> 01:55:49,126
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.

1330
01:55:49,252 --> 01:55:54,924
And based in no small part
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation,

1331
01:55:54,966 --> 01:55:57,301
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter

1332
01:55:57,343 --> 01:56:02,556
be given his next command
at the earliest possible convenience.

1333
01:56:03,099 --> 01:56:06,978
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.

1334
01:56:07,061 --> 01:56:09,522
No, sir.

1335
01:56:09,605 --> 01:56:12,066
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.

1336
01:56:14,485 --> 01:56:15,444
Dismissed.

1337
01:56:29,166 --> 01:56:31,168
Captain?

1338
01:56:45,766 --> 01:56:48,311
Just wanted to say thank you.

1339
01:56:48,352 --> 01:56:51,689
You were right and I was wrong.

1340
01:56:55,026 --> 01:57:00,573
About the horses, the Lippizaners.
They are from Spain, not Portugal.

1341
01:57:00,698 --> 01:57:02,658
Yes, sir.

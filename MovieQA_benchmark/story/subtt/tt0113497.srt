1
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,306
Don't worry, it's a pack of wolves.
Come on, we're almost rid of it.

2
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,826
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

3
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,204
Run! Run!

4
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,748
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

5
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,250
Come on, help me bury it.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,255
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,512
May God have mercy on his soul.

8
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,714
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

9
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,383
- Afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

10
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,643
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

11
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,701
Get him!

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,460
Prepare to die, Parrish!

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,714
Parrish, what's the rush?

14
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,389
He's going to the factory!

15
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,560
He's going to daddy now.

16
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,743
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

17
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,870
We'll be waiting.

18
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,141
Hi, Carl.

19
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,645
Hey, Alan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

20
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,064
I've been working on
this for almost a year.

21
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,566
I got an appointment with your father...

22
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,028
...to show him this. Go ahead, take it.

23
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,074
What do you think? Think he'll like it?

24
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,743
What is it?

25
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,164
What is it? This is the future. If
Wilt Chamberlain will wear them...

26
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,668
...there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

27
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,837
That will be the height of fashion.

28
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,924
What's wrong?

29
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,845
- Nothing.
- Alan!

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,222
Thanks, Bob.

31
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,852
What are you doing? This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

32
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,603
Dad, can I have a ride home?

33
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,439
Oh, Alan.

34
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,025
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?

35
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,030
Son, you're gonna have to
face him sooner or later.

36
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,201
If you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

37
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,786
Now, run on, son.

38
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,333
You know better than to
let the boy play here.

39
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,168
Sorry, sir.

40
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,714
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

41
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,640
What the devil...?

42
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,407
Who did this?

43
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,993
Well?

44
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,915
I did, sir.

45
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,432
Being a Parrish doesn't mean you
can hang around with my girlfriend.

46
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,351
We're just friends.

47
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,645
Not anymore.

48
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,105
Get him!

49
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,111
I’ve got his bike!

50
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,868
Jerks!

51
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,370
Neat.

52
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,879
Alan?

53
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,423
Are you home?

54
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,184
Alan, not again. Come on.

55
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,065
Hard work, determination,
cheerful outlook...

56
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,984
...attributes that have
exemplified the Brantford spirit...

57
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,488
...since our forefathers
first settled this town.

58
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,076
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and the granite of our soil...

59
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,744
...we have...

60
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,081
- Prospered.
- I knew it all this morning.

61
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,208
You'll know it all tonight.

62
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,504
- Right. Let's go.
- Sam, we have to talk to Alan.

63
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,721
Well, we're on our way.

64
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,014
Okay.

65
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,394
I told your father what you told
me, that it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

66
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,731
- If I'd known that, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, Dad.

67
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:13,362
But I'm proud of you. You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

68
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,950
Since you took it like a man,
your mother and I have decided...

69
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,037
...that you're ready to go to
The Cliffside School for Boys.

70
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,872
Congratulations, sweetheart.

71
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,669
You don't want me living here anymore?

72
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,421
Alan.

73
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,549
It's always been the plan
that you go to Cliffside.

74
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,970
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

75
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,097
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.

76
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,017
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

77
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,727
It's the main dormitory.

78
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:52,317
This is great. Kids are on my
case here because I'm a Parrish.

79
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,988
Just wait till I'm living
in a building named after me.

80
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,490
It was named after my father.

81
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,951
Good. Why don't you live in it?

82
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,122
I did. I wouldn't be who I am
if it weren't for my years there.

83
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,417
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

84
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,337
Maybe I don't even want to be a Parrish.

85
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,841
You won't be. Not till
you start acting like one.

86
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,801
- Sam...
- Get your coat.

87
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,558
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside, then.

88
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:29,480
We're taking you there next Sunday.
I don't want to hear another word!

89
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,650
You won't! I'm never
talking to you again!

90
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,200
- Sam...
- Don't.

91
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,660
- Sam.
- What?

92
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,162
Nothing.

93
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,273
What are you doing here?

94
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,818
I brought your bike.

95
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,988
You didn't have to. I was going
to Billy's to get it myself.

96
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,117
I told Billy to stop picking on you.

97
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,871
You wasted your breath. We'll
talk about it some other time.

98
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,165
What was that?

99
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,878
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.

100
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,299
Come on, I found this really
weird game in the factory.

101
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,010
A game?

102
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,361
"Jumanji.

103
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,033
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

104
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,078
You roll the dice to move your
token. Doubles gets another turn.

105
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,081
The first to reach the end
wins." You want to play?

106
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,918
I quit playing board
games five years ago.

107
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,049
Sarah!

108
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,140
It's gotta be magnetized or something.

109
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,893
Alan, look.

110
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,564
"At night they fly, you better run.

111
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,818
These winged things are not much fun."

112
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,243
What was that?

113
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,912
I don't know.

114
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,915
- Put it away, Alan.
- Okay.

115
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,715
Oh, no.

116
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,425
The game thinks I rolled.

117
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,595
What do you mean, "the game thinks"?

118
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,642
"In the jungle you must wait...

119
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,104
...until the dice read five or eight."

120
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,526
In the jungle you must
wait? What does that mean?

121
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,419
Sarah!

122
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,172
Roll the dice!

123
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,174
Sarah!

124
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,839
A bed-and-breakfast is
just what this town needs.

125
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,676
It was pretty hard to pass up.
Especially full of furniture.

126
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,136
Oh, boy.

127
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,972
I keep forgetting how big this place is.

128
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,516
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

129
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,853
I'm gonna put a reception
area right over here.

130
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,981
And a bar over here in the parlor.

131
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,862
That sounds lovely.

132
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,948
I'm sure you and your kids
will be very happy here.

133
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,034
Well...

134
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,536
Actually, they're my late brother's.

135
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,539
He and his wife passed
away just last winter.

136
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,420
Is this something, or what?

137
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,757
It sure is.

138
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,941
What do you think? Is
it big enough for you?

139
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,747
Peter hasn't spoken a
word since it happened.

140
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:45,629
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

141
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,923
It's okay.

142
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,011
We barely even knew our
parents. They were always away.

143
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,389
Skiing in St. Moritz,
gambling in Monte Carlo...

144
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,184
...safariing in darkest Africa.

145
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,104
We didn't even know if they loved us.

146
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,941
But when the sheik's yacht went down...

147
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,819
...they managed to write
a beautiful goodbye note...

148
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,948
...that was found floating in a
champagne bottle amongst the debris.

149
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,075
Excuse me.

150
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,837
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

151
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,132
- You'll send me the escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

152
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,958
I'll have to get a
locksmith for this one.

153
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,045
Peter, pick up your toys, please.

154
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,805
Peter, take this
suitcase up to the attic.

155
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,392
Then we can all have
ice cream. And bourbon.

156
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,379
What? What is it?

157
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,298
I'm going to Motel 6.

158
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,384
Oh, for heaven's sake.

159
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,163
I don't see any guano.

160
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,918
He said it looked like that.

161
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,007
That's an African bat. Some kid
said she saw some back in the '60s...

162
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,469
...but we don't get bats
like that in New England.

163
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,928
That's what he saw.

164
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,183
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

165
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,979
Bats aren't what I'd worry
about in this house, anyways.

166
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,981
What would you worry about?

167
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,900
Well, personally...

168
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,487
...I wouldn't want to live
where someone was murdered.

169
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,115
- Murdered?
- Yep.

170
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,410
Little Alan Parrish. I
say his father did it.

171
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:08,791
There's 1001 places he could've
hid the body in this house.

172
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,127
Especially if he chopped it up first.

173
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,463
Hey up there!

174
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,758
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.

175
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,431
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Hear that?

176
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,394
There's nothing to be
afraid of in this house.

177
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:58,007
I can't believe I have to see your
principal after your first day.

178
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,842
What am I gonna do?

179
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:06,932
Let's try to relax and finish
dinner. Talk about something else.

180
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,435
We know why you got the house cheap.

181
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,647
Twenty-six years ago, a kid
named Alan Parrish lived here.

182
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,358
One day he just disappeared.

183
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,404
His parents chopped him up
and hid him in the walls.

184
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,408
That's it. I'm sick and tired
of your lies. You're grounded.

185
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,498
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

186
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,544
Just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

187
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,375
Did you hear anything?

188
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,090
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

189
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,468
No.

190
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,428
Liar.

191
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,348
Cut that out, or they'll
send you to a shrink.

192
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,143
Where are they gonna send you
if you don't start talking?

193
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,789
If I get held up at the
permit office, I'll call.

194
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,458
The school bus will be here any minute.

195
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,213
You guys still have your keys?

196
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,299
You guys listening to me?

197
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,930
Hello?

198
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,390
What?

199
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,436
Maybe I should wait till the bus comes.

200
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,772
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

201
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,899
No.

202
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,277
Are you sure?

203
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,029
I could drop you off.

204
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,158
No, don't worry about us. The
bus will be here any minute.

205
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,162
Okay. Please be good today.

206
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,089
You do hear it.

207
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,300
Hear what?

208
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,400
Where's it coming from?

209
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,644
Let's bring it over here.

210
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,033
Weird. They're stuck.

211
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,328
"Jumanji, a game for
those who seek to find...

212
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,372
...a way to leave their worlds behind.

213
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,166
Roll the dice to move your
token. Doubles get another turn.

214
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,460
The first player to reach the end wins."

215
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,678
It's gotta be microchips or something.

216
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,390
You go first.

217
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,727
Okay.

218
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,273
Six.

219
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,540
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

220
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,829
Don't!

221
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:31,173
"This will not be an easy mission.
Monkeys slow the expedition."

222
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,886
What is that?

223
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,847
I bet those monkeys came from the game.

224
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,932
The mosquitoes too.

225
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,563
I didn't see this part.

226
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,568
"Adventurers, beware."

227
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:43,245
"Adventurers, beware. Do not
begin unless you intend to finish.

228
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:47,291
The consequences of the game vanish
when a player has reached Jumanji...

229
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,293
...and called out its name."

230
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,587
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

231
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,756
- Put it away.
- Wait!

232
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,508
If we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

233
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,886
Let's do it, or Aunt
Nora'll pitch a fit.

234
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:03,432
We should get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

235
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,227
No, you rolled doubles.

236
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,731
You get another turn. Roll.

237
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,275
Five.

238
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,741
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

239
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,120
Your party better move posthaste."

240
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,956
I don't like the sound of that.

241
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,919
Someone's in here.

242
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:56,568
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

243
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,032
Run, Peter!

244
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,543
I'm back.

245
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,635
My bike.

246
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:33,559
Somebody roll a five or an eight?

247
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,937
He did.

248
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,780
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

249
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:50,951
Thank you.

250
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,996
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

251
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,164
Thank you.

252
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,832
I'm back!

253
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,418
Mom! Dad!

254
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,255
I'm home!

255
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,050
I'm back!

256
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:10,804
It's me! It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

257
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,308
I'm home! I'm back!

258
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,019
Are you my little sister?

259
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,065
No, I'm Judy and he's Peter.

260
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,776
Where's Mom? Is Dad at the factory?

261
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,195
Are you...

262
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,572
...Alan Parrish?

263
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,784
Yeah. Who are you?

264
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,786
We live here now.

265
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,914
Where's my mom and dad?

266
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:38,957
We don't know.

267
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,087
This house has been empty for years.

268
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,006
Everyone thought you were dead.

269
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,560
Sorry.

270
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,902
- Give me that description again.
- Red fur and tail.

271
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:21,875
Get down off of my car, please,
and get up on the sidewalk.

272
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,964
- What year is it?
- It was brand-new.

273
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,428
- No. What year is it?
- 1995, remember?

274
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,721
Ninety-five...

275
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:37,850
You got some ID? Let me guess,
it's in your other Tarzan outfit.

276
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,769
- Twenty-six years. -
Are you from around here?

277
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,189
I was. But I’ve been in Jumanji.

278
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,109
Indonesia. He was in the Peace Corps.

279
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,370
- Carl Bentley, the sole man.
- Is this man related to you?

280
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,124
- Yes, he's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

281
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,710
Yeah, he's a vegetarian.

282
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,920
Get out of there!

283
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,054
Monkeys. Monkeys.

284
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,223
Is he all right upstairs?

285
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:22,436
He suffered a head
injury a few months ago.

286
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,867
Don't you move!

287
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,538
- Stop!
- Don't move, don't move.

288
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,083
Wait! Where are you going?

289
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,669
To find my parents!

290
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,254
Come on.

291
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,408
Wait!

292
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,548
My dad used to make shoes here.

293
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,302
They were the best shoes in New England.

294
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,098
Hey!

295
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:30,981
Sorry.

296
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,611
Easy, girl.

297
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,659
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

298
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:48,123
Yeah, it folded up. Like
everything else in this town.

299
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,877
It's pretty cold out there.
How about some coffee?

300
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,214
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

301
00:36:56,257 --> 00:37:00,636
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into finding him.

302
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,763
His time, his money...

303
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,890
Everything.

304
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,726
After a while, he
stopped coming to work.

305
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,229
He just quit caring.

306
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:15,651
I don't think anybody loved
his boy more than Sam did.

307
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,196
Here.

308
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:23,367
You're gonna freeze out there.

309
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,747
Thank you. Are the
Parrishes still around?

310
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,543
- I see them now and then.
- Yeah?

311
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,504
They're over on Adams Street.

312
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,358
Our parents are dead too.

313
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,989
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

314
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:10,956
Our dad was in advertising.

315
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,918
I bet you miss him, huh?

316
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,296
Me too.

317
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,052
There he goes again.

318
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,350
I know you're upset, but
we should finish the game.

319
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,810
We? Why do you need me?

320
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,938
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

321
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,691
Plus there's a lion in my aunt's room.

322
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,818
Do I look like a Ringling Brother?

323
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,445
She'll be home soon.

324
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:45,157
Won't she be surprised? I hope
she's not allergic to cats.

325
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,300
Larry, we need the
wheels. Give me a hand.

326
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:07,888
- Did we hit her hard?
- No, it looks like another weird bite.

327
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:19,566
- Yeah, it's another one.
- Jesus, over 50. What's going on?

328
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,777
Easy now, easy.

329
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,987
- Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

330
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,031
- The realtor.
- Quiet.

331
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,616
Listen.

332
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,576
You hear that?

333
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,245
Hear what?

334
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,706
Get in the car.

335
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:43,298
Okay, think. What came
out of the game before me?

336
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,635
There was a lion, a
bunch of monkeys and...

337
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,345
That!

338
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:55,144
It's okay, it's okay. It's
just a bug. We're safe in here.

339
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,021
We're fine.

340
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,985
If we stay low, he can't
get through there too far.

341
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,446
Don't you worry. We're fine.

342
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,116
He can't get through the glass.

343
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,285
We're safe.

344
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,581
Do you know how to drive?

345
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,417
No? That's no problem.

346
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,795
My dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway.

347
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,297
Once.

348
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,466
So, what's the big deal?

349
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,968
- Buckle up.
- Here we go!

350
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:33,932
Wait a minute. What? Wait.

351
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,357
Alan, the top!

352
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,292
Piece of cake.

353
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:03,837
Yeah.

354
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,269
Alan.

355
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,649
Keep that thing away from me!

356
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:29,988
When are you gonna help us
play? Our aunt will be home soon.

357
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:34,326
Good. You can inform her that
she's the ex-owner of this house.

358
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:39,289
I hope you realize with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

359
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:44,712
Oh, thank you.

360
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,840
No more banana leaves.

361
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,591
Yes.

362
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,266
What do you think those monkeys
will do to the ecosystem?

363
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,812
Hello?

364
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,387
What happened to you? Did you
shave with a piece of glass?

365
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,932
What happened to you? Did the
Clampetts have a yard sale?

366
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,685
I’ve never shaved before.

367
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,729
Where are you going?

368
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,734
How about Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

369
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,402
Thanks, I’ve seen it.

370
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:54,531
If you won't help us,
what are you gonna do?

371
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:58,118
I don't know. Pretty much
take up where I left off.

372
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:01,372
I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

373
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,759
Come on, he's not gonna
help us. He's afraid.

374
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,470
What did you say?

375
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:20,724
You're afraid. It's okay to be afraid.

376
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,689
Let's set it up in the living room.

377
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,611
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

378
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:35,948
Whatever it is, we can handle
it. We don't need your help.

379
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:38,367
I don't think so.

380
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:43,539
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

381
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,249
That's just the beginning.

382
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:49,837
I’ve seen things you've
only seen in your nightmares.

383
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,756
Things you can't even imagine.

384
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,343
Things you can't even see.

385
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,681
There are things that
hunt you in the night.

386
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:05,060
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

387
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,814
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

388
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:11,108
Afraid?

389
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:14,445
You don't even know what afraid is.

390
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,948
You will not last five
minutes without me.

391
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,369
So you're gonna help us?

392
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,957
I'll watch...

393
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:33,422
...but I'm not afraid.

394
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,185
Peter, that was very cool.

395
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:50,731
It's reverse psychology. Dad used
to pull it on me all the time.

396
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,400
Ready?

397
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,069
Yeah.

398
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,237
Alan, ready?

399
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,281
There is no "ready."

400
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,626
I'll try it again.

401
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,136
Alan, it's not working.

402
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,522
Oh, no.

403
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,023
It's not your turn.

404
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:36,735
I rolled first. Then Peter
twice because he got doubles.

405
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:38,153
Now it's my turn.

406
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,908
No, look. Two of the
pieces are yours, right?

407
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,576
Who's the other pieces?

408
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,582
The elephant was mine.

409
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:56,005
You're playing the
game I started in 1969.

410
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,758
I'm gonna have to play.

411
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:06,015
It's not my turn.

412
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:08,726
Whose turn is it?

413
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,190
Sarah Whittle.

414
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:24,783
This is where she used to live.

415
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,537
This place gives me the creeps.

416
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,884
We used to play on this porch.

417
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:49,475
I knew she still wouldn't live
here. Probably married Billy Jessup.

418
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:51,185
- Come on.
- Let's at least ask.

419
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:55,439
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
- She'll know. She's a psychic.

420
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,107
Good point.

421
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,404
I remember the porch being a lot bigger.

422
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,114
Hello?

423
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:07,910
- Can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

424
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,122
- No, we're trying to find someone.
- Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

425
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,416
Maybe you can help us.

426
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,546
What is it?

427
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:22,716
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

428
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:24,677
No, I’ve lived here my whole life.

429
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:27,262
Then you must know Sarah Whittle.

430
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:34,019
What do you want with Sarah Whittle?

431
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,147
Sarah?

432
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,527
I don't go by that name anymore.

433
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,238
Sarah Whittle?

434
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:46,949
What do you want?

435
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:53,414
Twenty-six years ago, you played a
game with a little boy down the street.

436
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,043
A game with drums.

437
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,924
How do you know that?

438
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:08,220
I was that little boy, Sarah.

439
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,183
Alan?

440
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:22,860
You killed her.

441
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,822
Leave a message and the
doctor will call you back...

442
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:28,866
...at his earliest convenience.

443
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:33,662
Dr. Boorstein, it's Sarah Whittle.
Please call me as soon as you can.

444
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:36,373
I think I need to
have my dosage checked.

445
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,502
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't really happen?

446
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:45,716
I'm having an episode here with
the boy who didn't really disappear.

447
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:48,719
I'm sitting in his living
room, drinking lemonade.

448
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:54,099
If you could call me, I'd really be
interested in your interpretation.

449
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,102
- He'll call me back.
- While we're waiting...

450
00:48:58,313 --> 00:48:59,938
- God! No, no, no!
- Sarah.

451
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:02,107
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay. Sarah.

452
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:06,236
I’ve spent 2000 hours in therapy
convincing myself that doesn't exist.

453
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,989
What happened to you was so
awful, I made up this thing...

454
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,408
It was awful. It was awful.

455
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:13,035
It really was.

456
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,663
But it was real. Real.

457
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:20,834
No, it wasn't real. Your father
murdered you and chopped you up.

458
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:23,295
Sarah, come on.

459
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,589
My dad did that?

460
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,176
My father could barely hug me...

461
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:32,513
...let alone cut me into little pieces.

462
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:37,685
Twenty-six years ago, we
started playing a little game.

463
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,395
And now...

464
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:44,066
...we're all gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

465
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:45,818
And guess what?

466
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,695
It's your turn.

467
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,535
No.

468
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,036
Here.

469
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,832
Play the game.

470
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,835
- Oh, no, no.
- Fine.

471
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:08,590
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to play.

472
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,634
Thank you, Alan.

473
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,555
Oh, my God! How could you do that?

474
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,766
It's the law of the jungle.
You'll get used to it.

475
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:21,937
When I think of the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit...

476
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:23,814
Go on, read it.

477
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:31,488
"They grow much faster than bamboo.

478
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,533
Take care or they'll come after you."

479
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,454
Oh, great.

480
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,416
Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

481
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,961
It is. Stay away from the
walls. Don't touch anything.

482
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,631
No quick movements.

483
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:57,931
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they're beautiful.

484
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:01,226
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

485
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:05,606
And definitely stay away from
the pods. The big yellow ones.

486
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:07,316
What big yellow ones?

487
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,238
Peter!

488
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:15,282
I got you! Get his arms!

489
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,576
Get it off me! Get it off me!

490
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,212
Oh, my God!

491
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:35,803
Hang on.

492
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,638
Got him? I'll be right back.

493
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,348
Oh, my God.

494
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:41,392
Sorry, Angus.

495
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,816
Harvest time!

496
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,408
Are you okay?

497
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,118
Peter.

498
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,418
Oh, my God!

499
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:11,422
My car. Oh, my car.

500
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,549
Carl, come in, please.

501
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:16,051
Come in please, Carl.
Has anybody seen...?

502
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:20,180
I can't believe this.
Start, start, please. Yes.

503
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,726
- Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Carl here.

504
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,479
Where have you been? We've got
an animal-control situation.

505
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,356
Get Stan and Willy on it.

506
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:33,277
I’ve gotta check out a suspicious
character at the Parrish place.

507
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:36,572
I should've been a fireman.

508
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:45,581
Yeah.

509
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,499
Sarah!

510
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:51,628
Get your hands off me!

511
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,590
- The game is not over yet.
- It is for me.

512
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:56,759
You are not in the jungle anymore.

513
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:59,762
Stop this! You don't
treat people like this.

514
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,187
Okay.

515
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:17,488
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

516
00:53:23,536 --> 00:53:26,872
Please, last time I played
this game it ruined my life.

517
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,168
- It ruined your life?
- Yes.

518
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:35,839
"In the jungle you must wait
till the dice read five or eight."

519
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,967
I was a little girl, Alan.

520
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,470
You disappeared.

521
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:47,309
And a bunch of bats surrounded
me and chased me down the street.

522
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,020
I was afraid.

523
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,523
I'm sorry, Alan.

524
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:55,359
No one believed me. I was alone.

525
00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:00,406
So was l, for 26 years, Sarah.

526
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,409
Me too.

527
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:08,622
It's okay, Sarah. We're scared too.

528
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:12,292
But if we finish the
game, it'll all go away.

529
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,129
What if I get stuck in the game?

530
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:16,755
You won't.

531
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,676
Because I won't stop playing.

532
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,219
And neither will I.

533
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,221
I won't either.

534
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:33,814
Come on, Sarah.

535
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:35,274
Please?

536
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,535
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

537
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:50,039
Come on, we'll be fine.

538
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,249
We just have to keep our heads.

539
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:56,003
And roll with the punches.

540
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:18,859
"A hunter from the darkest wild...

541
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:23,197
...makes you feel just like a child."

542
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:25,032
What is it?

543
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,409
Van Pelt.

544
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:38,003
You miserable coward! Come
back and face me like a man.

545
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:48,514
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

546
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,809
Coming, ready or not.

547
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,453
Hey, you!

548
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,585
Drop your gun and get
your hands in the air!

549
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:47,072
Man, I don't believe this.

550
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:57,333
Even if Alan gets out
of this situation...

551
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,835
...it'll happen over and over again.

552
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:04,715
When you carry repressed anger, it
attracts a lot of negative energy.

553
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:08,844
Things happen, like ending up in
the jungle. That was no accident.

554
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:10,346
There are no accidents.

555
00:57:10,513 --> 00:57:12,306
Whose turn is it?

556
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:15,225
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

557
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:18,187
You might've told us there
was a man who hunts people.

558
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,106
I didn't know. It's just
the roll of the dice.

559
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,984
Is he the reason you
didn't want to play?

560
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:27,988
You didn't want to play, either?

561
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,992
Mr. We-Started-26-Years-Ago-
and-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

562
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:36,330
What's with this guy?

563
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:40,918
He's a hunter. He kills things.
Right now, he wants to kill me.

564
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:42,503
- Why you?
- Why me?

565
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:46,548
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

566
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,884
Maybe he needs something for his wall.

567
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:50,302
It's your turn.

568
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:53,472
Have you ever talked with
him about your differences?

569
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:58,852
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun...
- Don't ever call me crazy. Ever.

570
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:03,065
Everyone's called me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

571
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,485
- Maybe I should roll.
- Yeah.

572
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:08,654
I was the girl who saw you murdered.

573
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,156
Did anyone come to my birthday party?

574
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:14,576
- Hello, I'm rolling now.
- Billy who?

575
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:18,580
Are you an owl? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

576
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:20,666
- Here, just roll.
- Find the memory...

577
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,167
...of your old boyfriend.

578
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:26,588
- The kid who'd steal your bicycle?
- The kid who took you to the movies.

579
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:31,218
"Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."

580
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:33,012
- You're immature.
- You are.

581
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:35,431
- I know you are, but what am l?
- You are.

582
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,267
Do you feel that?

583
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,002
Run!

584
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,421
It's a stampede!

585
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:08,714
Come on.

586
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,341
The game!

587
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,807
Don't look back!

588
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,669
Not the game!

589
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,013
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?

590
00:59:58,223 --> 00:59:59,807
Ignore him. He's a Libra.

591
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,851
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

592
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,436
Here we go. Come on.

593
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:06,855
- Hello?
- It's Aunt Nora.

594
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,107
Where have you been?

595
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:11,026
I'm sorry, dear. You
have the wrong number.

596
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,240
Wait for me!

597
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:36,802
- What can I do for you?
- I'll have a gross of these.

598
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:40,347
They stopped making these in 1903.

599
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:44,101
Damn. Then I shall need
a replacement weapon.

600
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:45,728
There's a waiting period.

601
01:00:46,229 --> 01:00:49,398
And you'll have to fill out these.

602
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:53,193
Or I could fill these out.

603
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:55,654
Louise.

604
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,079
Now, anyone asks, you
didn't get this here.

605
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,420
You're not a postal worker, are you?

606
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:16,133
Alan!

607
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:20,346
Quiet.

608
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,281
Here.

609
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,203
No!

610
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,418
- Peter!
- Peter!

611
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:58,527
- Peter, are you okay?
- That was great.

612
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:01,238
I can't believe you did
that. That was so cool.

613
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:03,991
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

614
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:07,369
Alan.

615
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:10,581
Nice work. Come on, give
me the game. Let's go.

616
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,768
Oh, no.

617
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,312
Act natural.

618
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:38,734
Hey!

619
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:40,652
Hide the game.

620
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,827
Every time there's
trouble, I run into you.

621
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:51,497
I don't know what you're talking about.

622
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:54,375
- I'm taking you in.
- I'm not going anywhere.

623
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,796
All right.

624
01:04:00,131 --> 01:04:02,675
Just a second. You
can't take him, he's...

625
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:05,427
- Her fianc?
- You said he's your uncle.

626
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,807
It's all right. I'll be back soon.

627
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:15,354
Blast.

628
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:18,190
You said you'd never
abandon your friends.

629
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:21,068
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

630
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:23,570
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

631
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,824
I suggest you all go home now.

632
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,159
Okay.

633
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,916
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

634
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,585
We can't. We can't
finish it without him.

635
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,754
Judy.

636
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:42,172
What?

637
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,176
What happened?

638
01:04:46,344 --> 01:04:49,388
I thought I could end the
game. I was only 10 spaces away.

639
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:52,182
"A law of Jumanji, having been broken...

640
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,686
...you will slip back
even more than your token."

641
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,438
You tried to cheat?

642
01:04:57,689 --> 01:05:00,733
No, I tried to drop the
dice so they landed on 12.

643
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:04,028
Okay, honey. Well,
that would be cheating.

644
01:05:05,238 --> 01:05:07,531
Peter, your hands! Look at your hands!

645
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:38,270
Come in, this is Willy. They
cleaned out Larry's Hardware.

646
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:42,316
I can't stop them. Get the
National Guard down here.

647
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:45,027
What is this about? I know you know.

648
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:48,906
Yes, I do. But you wouldn't
believe me even if I told you, Carl.

649
01:05:49,115 --> 01:05:51,992
Wait a minute. How do
you know my name is Carl?

650
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,411
I know a lot more than that.

651
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:57,414
You used to work at Parrish Shoes.

652
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,958
They used to call you "Sole Man."

653
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:03,420
Sole Man, that's right.
I was in there too...

654
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,589
...till old man Parrish fired me.

655
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,841
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

656
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:11,428
And I had something that could've
turned this whole town around.

657
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,931
- Your shoes.
- Right.

658
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,974
Listen, Carl?

659
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:20,145
I know it doesn't mean
much after 26 years...

660
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:22,022
...but I'm sorry.

661
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:23,607
I'm sorry.

662
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,944
Sorry for what?

663
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:28,445
It's me. Alan.

664
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:34,201
Thank you.

665
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:36,912
What's going on?

666
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:39,915
Well, apparently there's a sale, honey.

667
01:06:45,046 --> 01:06:47,673
You saw three monkeys on
a motorcycle, didn't you?

668
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:49,550
- Yes.
- Good girl.

669
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:54,096
Maybe we can bail him out with a check.

670
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:55,889
Thank you.

671
01:06:56,057 --> 01:06:58,851
Tell that sniveling
coward if he wants...

672
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,150
Boy!

673
01:07:06,943 --> 01:07:08,444
Get out of my way!

674
01:08:00,246 --> 01:08:02,539
- Give me that, boy!
- No!

675
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,917
Hey!

676
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,960
- Peter!
- Help me!

677
01:08:07,837 --> 01:08:09,630
Get me out of here!

678
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,174
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter.

679
01:08:24,896 --> 01:08:26,397
All right.

680
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,830
There it is.

681
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:44,581
Wait here.

682
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:54,800
Gotcha, girlie.

683
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:56,719
No.

684
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:59,388
When Alan hears of your
predicament, he'll come.

685
01:08:59,639 --> 01:09:03,183
He doesn't know I'm here. It
won't work. Your plan's ruined.

686
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,647
- Move and I'll blow your brains out!
- Okay.

687
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,566
Call the cops!

688
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:13,610
- That should do the trick.
- Oh, yeah.

689
01:09:18,074 --> 01:09:20,242
Price check!

690
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,623
If you let me go, I can stop all this.

691
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:30,210
It's like The Twilight
Zone, but it's true.

692
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:32,838
Please, you gotta help me on this.

693
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:35,549
I know I'm gonna regret this.

694
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:38,761
Just hold still.

695
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,890
- Okay.
- There, I let you go.

696
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:44,725
Now what are we gonna do?

697
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:47,353
- You're staying here.
- My keys!

698
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:49,021
It's for your own good.

699
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:52,066
- My handcuff keys!
- I have to do this!

700
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:54,526
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

701
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:55,944
Carl, code red.

702
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,365
Hostage situation at Sir
Sav-a-lot. A woman and two children.

703
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:02,993
It sounds like the armed
perpetrator in the pith helmet.

704
01:10:03,244 --> 01:10:05,329
Carl? Come in, Carl.

705
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:07,414
- Lorraine? -
What's Sir Sav-a-lot?

706
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:09,375
- It's a discount store.
- Move over.

707
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:13,087
- Wait. Gently, gently.
- All right, all right.

708
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,130
Don't worry, I’ve done this before.

709
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:16,465
Once.

710
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,533
Where's Sir
Sav-a-lot?

711
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:44,702
- Monroe and Elm.
- The Episcopal church.

712
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:47,121
Not anymore. Now it's a Speedy Burger.

713
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,041
At least it was. I don't know
what's left. People are going loopy.

714
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:52,543
Judy!

715
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:05,681
We got company.

716
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:08,517
It's all right. He'll back us up.

717
01:12:02,113 --> 01:12:04,365
- Here's the game.
- Get out of here.

718
01:12:09,245 --> 01:12:10,496
Rats.

719
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:33,894
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- Okay, I got it.

720
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:44,321
Stop cringing, I could
have shot you at any moment.

721
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:45,823
Why didn't you?

722
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,492
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

723
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:50,869
There it is, there
it is. Hit the brakes!

724
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:54,289
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hitting it. I'm hitting the brakes!

725
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:57,668
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hitting the brakes!

726
01:12:57,877 --> 01:12:59,211
He'll be here.

727
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:22,109
Sarah!

728
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:24,236
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

729
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:27,281
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

730
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,493
Oh, great.

731
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:39,209
So remember, circumstances are
never, ever out of your control.

732
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,504
End of tape three.

733
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,967
Update on the extraordinary
events in Brantford, New Hampshire.

734
01:13:47,218 --> 01:13:49,970
Ninety-eight people have been
hospitalized with symptoms...

735
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:53,807
...ranging from inexplicable
fevers and rashes to seizures.

736
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:56,769
Local resources are strained
to the breaking point.

737
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:02,149
And state officials are now asking
those with such symptoms to dial 911.

738
01:14:48,154 --> 01:14:49,405
I got it.

739
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:54,243
Alan, talk to him, please?

740
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:56,745
What? We don't have time for this, okay?

741
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:59,999
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

742
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,751
- All right, come on.
- Thank you.

743
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:04,628
Judy, come on.

744
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,258
I warned you about this, Peter.

745
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,594
No, you wanted to play the game.

746
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:17,933
What, are you crying? You don't
cry, you keep your chin up.

747
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,810
Come on, keep your chin up.

748
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:23,522
Crying never helped anybody do anything.

749
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:28,027
If you have a problem,
you face it like a man.

750
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,577
Hey. Hey.

751
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:41,832
I'm sorry. Twenty-six years
buried in the deepest jungle...

752
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,959
...and I still became my father.

753
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:48,005
It's okay. Come here, I'm
sorry. Hey, it's all right.

754
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,966
It's all right to be afraid.

755
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,177
It's not that.

756
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:55,471
What is it?

757
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,276
Okay.

758
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,153
Ready?

759
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:18,827
Don't worry, we'll have you back
to your old self in no time flat.

760
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:23,999
Because we'll go in here together,
sit down and finish that game.

761
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,584
No matter...

762
01:16:25,877 --> 01:16:27,211
...what.

763
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:41,809
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

764
01:17:14,884 --> 01:17:16,468
Lorraine, this is Carl.

765
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,973
I'm heading over to the Parrish
place. Give me some backup.

766
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:24,351
Lorraine?

767
01:17:29,232 --> 01:17:30,858
Wait! Wait!

768
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:32,401
Now what?

769
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:33,861
Stop!

770
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:35,988
Wait! Stop!

771
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:40,617
Is there a problem?

772
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:43,412
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

773
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:46,248
Jefferson Street. The old Parrish place.

774
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:49,084
Do you have children? A boy and a girl?

775
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:51,086
- What happened?
- Get in.

776
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:53,130
I'll explain it all on the way.

777
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:24,995
Fine! Take it!

778
01:18:25,288 --> 01:18:27,706
We gotta get to that house.

779
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:35,297
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

780
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:38,717
I grew up in this. It's
out there that scares me.

781
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:44,181
- Okay, it's my turn.
- Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

782
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:48,936
Okay, ready? Here I go.

783
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,275
It's okay.

784
01:18:55,443 --> 01:18:59,988
"Every month at the quarter
moon, there'll be a monsoon...

785
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,367
...in your lagoon." Monsoon.

786
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:05,202
At least we're inside.

787
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:09,456
Yeah, right.

788
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:34,023
Well, a little rain never hurt anybody.

789
01:19:34,357 --> 01:19:35,774
But a lot can kill you.

790
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:38,235
Come on!

791
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,071
This way!

792
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:49,079
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground.

793
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,791
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!

794
01:20:08,308 --> 01:20:09,558
You okay?

795
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,395
- Judy!
- Alan?

796
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:15,939
- What?
- What is that?

797
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:19,276
Swim! Look out! Look out!

798
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,034
- Alan!
- Swim! Go! Move!

799
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:31,413
Keep going!

800
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,501
Stay on the table!

801
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:37,461
Feet out of the water!

802
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:42,257
On the chandelier!

803
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:52,768
Come on, Sarah.

804
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:01,110
Peter!

805
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:08,784
Hang on, Sarah!

806
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:13,664
Are you okay?

807
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,930
Where...?

808
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:33,517
- Alan!
- Alan!

809
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,151
Judy? Peter!

810
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,820
Step back and let me
handle this, please.

811
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:47,990
It's nothing. They probably
left the TV on too loud.

812
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:50,993
Peter? Judy?

813
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:55,914
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

814
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,312
- Alan, give me your hand!
- Alan!

815
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:24,026
- Grab my hand!
- I got it.

816
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:28,489
Alan!

817
01:22:45,715 --> 01:22:46,924
Take the game.

818
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,218
Here you go.

819
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:56,975
- You okay?
- Yeah.

820
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,109
Alan, you wrestled an alligator for me.

821
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:10,531
It was a crocodile.

822
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:14,076
Alligators don't have that
fringe on their hind leg.

823
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:16,245
Come on.

824
01:23:19,749 --> 01:23:21,375
My mistake.

825
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,845
It's okay.

826
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,063
Come on.

827
01:23:48,778 --> 01:23:50,571
Okay, it's my turn.

828
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,656
I've got it.

829
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,410
Colonel Mustard in the
library with the wrench.

830
01:23:58,913 --> 01:24:00,289
Clue.

831
01:24:01,499 --> 01:24:02,791
Okay.

832
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:15,012
"Beware the ground on which you stand.

833
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,182
The floor is quicker than the sand."

834
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:21,560
Alan!

835
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,479
- Okay.
- Sarah.

836
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:26,023
- Help me.
- Okay. Stay calm.

837
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:27,775
Don't struggle. Stay calm.

838
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:29,318
- I'm calm.
- Alan!

839
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,446
- Grab on!
- Pull!

840
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:35,657
Okay. I got it. Pull!

841
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:41,497
Stay calm!

842
01:24:42,415 --> 01:24:44,541
Come on!

843
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:46,293
Oh, good!

844
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,090
I got you...

845
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:54,176
Stop giving me things that come apart!

846
01:24:56,554 --> 01:24:58,180
"There is a lesson..."

847
01:24:58,431 --> 01:24:59,807
All right.

848
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:04,436
"There is lesson you will learn."

849
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:07,564
I got you.

850
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,735
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."

851
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:16,782
- Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.

852
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,575
Oh, dear.

853
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:23,872
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.
That was very quick thinking.

854
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:26,709
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor.

855
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:28,711
It's your turn, Peter.

856
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,629
Okay.

857
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:39,430
I thought I'd lost you again.

858
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:41,849
Thanks for sticking around this time.

859
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:50,065
"Need a hand? Why, you just wait.

860
01:25:50,483 --> 01:25:53,777
We'll help you out. We each have eight."

861
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:04,621
What's that? What is it?

862
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:06,957
- Nothing.
- You don't go... for nothing.

863
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:14,006
Peter, my dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Go get it!

864
01:26:14,257 --> 01:26:16,759
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

865
01:26:27,812 --> 01:26:29,521
Sarah!

866
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:01,387
Judy?

867
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,639
Peter?

868
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:28,580
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

869
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:37,756
Sorry. I can't talk right
now. I'll explain later.

870
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:39,633
- Sarah.
- What?

871
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:42,344
It's your turn. You can
finish if you roll seven.

872
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:46,181
- I can't roll.
- Put the dice in your mouth.

873
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:48,475
Bring the game. Hurry!

874
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:54,481
Judy!

875
01:28:03,074 --> 01:28:04,324
Are you okay?

876
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:06,118
I'm fine. Help them.

877
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:12,166
Come on, Judy.

878
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,376
- Judy!
- Judy.

879
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:16,962
Give me the dice.

880
01:28:26,222 --> 01:28:29,058
"You're almost there with much at stake.

881
01:28:29,225 --> 01:28:31,393
But now the ground begins to quake."

882
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:33,896
Judy!

883
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:36,774
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

884
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:44,990
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

885
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:46,992
So do l.

886
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:01,131
Her only chance is
if we finish the game!

887
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:03,092
It's your turn!

888
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:04,677
Oh, my God!

889
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:19,566
Get the game!

890
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:21,276
I won't let you go!

891
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:32,871
Alan!

892
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:51,890
Don't move.

893
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:58,105
Stand up.

894
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:04,945
What's in your hand?

895
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:09,408
Drop it.

896
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:20,836
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

897
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:23,672
Game's up. Start running.

898
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,092
No.

899
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:30,346
Aren't you afraid?

900
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:32,348
I'm terrified.

901
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:35,184
But my father told me...

902
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:38,854
...you should always face
what you're afraid of.

903
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:47,780
Good lad. You're finally
acting like a man.

904
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,616
Any last words?

905
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:02,544
Jumanji.

906
01:31:05,548 --> 01:31:07,007
It's Jumanji.

907
01:31:09,552 --> 01:31:11,303
No, Alan, no!

908
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:29,405
What...?

909
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:42,102
I forgot my speech notes.

910
01:32:46,066 --> 01:32:48,275
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.

911
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:51,487
I've only been gone five minutes.

912
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:56,075
It seems like a lot longer to me.

913
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:00,662
I thought you were never
going to talk to me again.

914
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:08,671
Whatever I said, Dad, I'm sorry.

915
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:15,511
Look, Alan, I was angry.

916
01:33:16,012 --> 01:33:18,764
I'm sorry too, son.

917
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:27,523
Look, you don't have to go to
Cliffside if you don't want to.

918
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:34,029
Let's talk it over
tomorrow. Man-to-man.

919
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,784
How about father to son?

920
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:41,286
Great.

921
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:46,208
I've gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

922
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,795
Dad?

923
01:33:53,842 --> 01:33:58,178
Back in 196... I mean,
today in the factory...

924
01:33:58,722 --> 01:34:00,514
...it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault.

925
01:34:00,932 --> 01:34:03,350
I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.

926
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:07,938
I'm glad you told me, son.

927
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:10,441
Thanks.

928
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,027
Bye, Dad.

929
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:15,487
Goodbye.

930
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:28,751
- Holy smokes! Judy and Peter!
- Alan.

931
01:34:29,878 --> 01:34:31,545
They're not there.

932
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:34,840
It's 1969.

933
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:37,551
They don't even exist yet.

934
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:10,292
I'm forgetting what it's
like to be a grownup.

935
01:35:10,543 --> 01:35:14,213
That's okay, as long as
we don't forget each other.

936
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:16,131
Or Judy and Peter.

937
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:20,302
There's something I've
been wanting to do.

938
01:35:21,554 --> 01:35:24,890
I better do it before I
feel too much like a kid.

939
01:35:44,327 --> 01:35:48,163
They probably don't teach driver
training in the sixth grade, huh?

940
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:04,680
Merry Christmas.

941
01:36:05,932 --> 01:36:07,433
Do you want these?

942
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:17,192
Dad, the new cross-trainer's
doing fabulous.

943
01:36:17,485 --> 01:36:19,278
No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.

944
01:36:19,446 --> 01:36:20,696
Honey, they're here.

945
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:24,366
Dad, I gotta run. We'll
pick you up tomorrow, okay?

946
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:27,703
You'll be the best Christmas
gift of all. Bye-bye!

947
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,581
- They're here? Come on, let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

948
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:32,916
Lisa, hi.

949
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:34,793
Pardon me.

950
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:36,879
Jim! Glad you could make it.

951
01:36:37,088 --> 01:36:40,007
- Thanks. This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi. This is Sarah.

952
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,217
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

953
01:36:43,386 --> 01:36:45,095
Oh, my God, there they are.

954
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:47,723
How'd you know?

955
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,518
A guess, of course. They're your kids.

956
01:36:51,728 --> 01:36:53,479
Right, these are our children.

957
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:56,857
Judy and Peter. Say hi
to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.

958
01:36:57,067 --> 01:36:59,860
Nice to meet you.

959
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,156
You're just like we remembered you.

960
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,119
I feel like we know so much about them.

961
01:37:09,996 --> 01:37:11,080
Because, you know...

962
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:14,750
- You've told Alan about them.
- And I told her.

963
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:17,753
- I'll get the presents.
- Sure, honey.

964
01:37:18,129 --> 01:37:19,630
Well, we love children.

965
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:22,591
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool.

966
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,012
When can you start?

967
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:31,392
We were going to take a skiing
holiday up in the Canadian Rockies.

968
01:37:31,601 --> 01:37:32,935
No!

969
01:37:35,146 --> 01:37:36,397
Sorry.

970
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:38,607
We just...

971
01:37:38,858 --> 01:37:41,985
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line, pronto.

972
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:45,698
No problem. I could start next week.

973
01:37:45,907 --> 01:37:50,703
Great. Let me introduce you to
the folks you'll be working with.

974
01:37:51,037 --> 01:37:55,874
Come on in. Our house was your
house. Is. Anytime you'd like.

975
01:38:06,469 --> 01:38:07,970
What's that noise?

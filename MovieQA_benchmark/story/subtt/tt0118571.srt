1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,700


3
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,400
Check, check.
Head count. Head cou—

4
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,360
- Two.
- Three.

5
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,990
- Four.
- Five.
- Six.

6
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:04,450
- Demo set.
- Let's move.

7
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,175
Clear.

8
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,530
Low Boy, Low Boy, this is Black Cat.
E.T.A. Romeo LZ, one-niner.

9
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,825
We are hot. Copy.

10
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,540
Come on. Get out there! Go, go!

11
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,210
Come on!

12
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,923
Get in.

13
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,636
Cover, cover. On the roof.

14
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,393
Go!

15
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,195
This is Low Boy.
Package is wrapped.

16
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,629
Ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,631
Three weeks ago...

18
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,843
Russian and American
special forces...

19
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,846
apprehended the self-proclaimed
leader of Kazakhstan...

20
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,182
General Ivan Radek.

21
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:58,690
The forces of Radek were directed
towards the suppression of democracy.

22
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:04,321
His nuclear arsenal could have
brought the world into a new cold war.

23
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,033
But thanks to the support of one
of the world's greatest leaders...

24
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,410
Radek is now in prison.

25
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,836
Today, we are honouring
this brave man.

26
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,547
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend...

27
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,426
the president
of the United States of America.

28
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,569
The dead remember
our indifference.

29
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,905
The dead remember
our silence.

30
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,700
I came here tonight
to be congratulated.

31
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,286
But today, when I visited
the Red Cross camps...

32
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,540
overwhelmed
by the flood of refugees...

33
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,751
fleeing from the horror
of Kazakhstan...

34
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,212
I realized I don't deserve
to be congratulated.

35
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,423
- None of us do.
- What's he doing?

36
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,425
- Let's speak the truth.
- That's not the speech.

37
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,053
The truth is,
we acted too late.

38
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,765
Only when our own national
security was threatened...

39
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,560
did we act.

40
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,939
Radek's regime murdered over
200,000 men, women and children...

41
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,150
and we watched it on TV.

42
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,943
We let it happen.

43
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,155
People were being slaughtered
for over a year...

44
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:33,326
and we issued economic sanctions and hid
behind the rhetoric of diplomacy.

45
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,662
How dare we?

46
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:40,417
The dead remember, real peace
is not just the absence of conflict.

47
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:45,213
It's the presence of justice.

48
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,967
And tonight I come to you with a pledge
to change America's policy.

49
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:54,097
Never again will I allow
our political self-interest...

50
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,309
to deter us from doing what
we know to be morally right.

51
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,854
Atrocity and terror
are not political weapons.

52
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,608
And to those
who would use them:

53
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,693
Your day is over.

54
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,656
We will never negotiate.

55
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,952
We will no longer tolerate,
and we will no longer be afraid.

56
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,082
It's your turn to be afraid.

57
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,115
Good evening. Can I get you
to open the briefcase?

58
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,164
- The Russian was a nice touch.
- Tell my mother. She wanted me to study French.

59
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,418
- You know what you committed us to, sir?
- Yeah, I know exactly what I committed us to.

60
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,511
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Air Force One.

61
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,347
Please present your equipment
for inspection.

62
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,307
W-We were just inspected
at the gate.

63
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,352
Sir, this plane carries the president
of the United States, although we—

64
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,188
I understand.
I'm terribly sorry.

65
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,984
Please place your thumb
on the ID pad.

66
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,286
Access cleared.

67
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,597
Hello there. I'm Melanie Mitchell,
deputy press secretary.

68
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,974
- I'll be takin' you in from here.
- Oh, Miss Mitchell.

69
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,059
It is so nice to finally
meet you in person.

70
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,770
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew.

71
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,773
So, if, uh, you boys
are all clear?

72
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,276
Now, you know the president's
on a very tight schedule.

73
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,446
So, this is how it works: During
the flight, two members of your crew...

74
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,781
will be allowed outside
the press area for filming.

75
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,076
You'll get exactly ten minutes
with the president, 20 with the crew.

76
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,085
Listen, Gary, the president
is ready to take Congress on.

77
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,087
He's not gonna kiss
their ass for each vote.

78
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,466
Let 'em vote us down
and stand on their record.

79
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,843
Yeah, I'm with him now.
I'll call you from the plane.

80
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,555
- What do they say about the speech?
- Your speech is leading the news.

81
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,892
- They're already calling it the "Be Afraid" speech.
- Good.

82
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,936
With all due respect, sir, next time you
want to make a major policy departure...

83
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,566
you might want to discuss it with your
National Security Advisor first.

84
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,237
- We did discuss it, Jack.
- We discussed it in private, which is
where I thought it would remain.

85
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,784
Well, now it's public.
Now it's policy.

86
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,829
- Get behind it.
- The allies are gonna be very upset
they weren't consulted about this.

87
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,624
It might come back and bite us
in the ass in November.

88
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,211
It's the right thing to do,
and you know it.

89
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,757
There goes the neighbourhood.

90
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,010
If you'd like, I think
we have time for a quick tour.

91
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,180
- It would be delightful.
- Good.
- Andrei, Boris.

92
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:27,519
Just follow me. Ahead of this staff
cabin is Secret Service, right here.

93
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,439
Don't ever try to go past 'em without
an escort. You will be very sorry.

94
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,692
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.

95
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,277
Thanks for the warning.

96
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,613
And here we have
our in-flight offices.

97
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,801
Mr President!

98
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,764
Over here!
Over here, Mr President!

99
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:09,185
A lot of the plane's features are classified,
but I can tell you that it's bullet-resistant...

100
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,939
and that it's even protected
against the pulse of a nuclear blast.

101
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,401
I'm not sure
that's very comforting.

102
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,403
Up those stairs is the cockpit...

103
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:23,158
along with the most advanced communications
centre on or above the face of the earth.

104
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,162
We could run the whole country
from here, or even a war if we had to.

105
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,206
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts right from up there.

106
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
- Melanie?
- Yes?
- The president's arriving.

107
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,086
They should all take their seats.
Right away.

108
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,798
I'll get out of here
and let you all get some sleep.

109
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,607
- Mr President, welcome aboard, sir.
- Hey, Danny. How are ya?

110
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,276
- Mr President.
- Mr President.

111
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,113
Change in plan, Danny.
Let's go to Barbados.

112
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,742
- Anything you want. You're the president.
- Boy, I wish.

113
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,952
- Mr President.
- Mr Gibbs, where's my bunch?

114
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,954
The ballet ran late.
They'll be here in five minutes.

115
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,208
- Okay. Lewis, you tape the game?
- Oh, it was a real squeaker, sir.

116
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,629
Lewis, don't brief me on it.
I want to watch it, for Christ's sake.

117
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,215
- We'll be under way in about 30 minutes, sir.
- Okay.

118
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,134
- Mr President-
- Sir?
- Yeah, could you put the game on now, please?

119
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,429
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, Jack.
- The Iraqis have mobilized
two armoured brigades towards—

120
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,934
Just got it. Gimme 15 minutes.
Get the guys together.

121
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,145
Repel them, repel them. Make them relinquish
the ball. Hear about Notre Dame, Jim?

122
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,232
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Don't tell me the score.
- Great game.

123
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,735
- Mr President.
- We need to strategize,
smooth some things out politically.

124
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,905
- What was that?
- Oh, it's not so important.
- It's damage control. Now, what if-

125
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,700
- Gimme a minute alone, will ya?
- What if a quote,
high-ranking White House official—

126
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,870
- Just give me a few moments alone, please.
- A quote, high-ranking White House official...

127
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,956
- unquote, were to qualify what
you said last night, leak it to...
- Stop.

128
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,208
- Drop it. Drop it. Do your self a favour.
- The Washington Post?

129
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,837
It's policy. Drop it, or find yourself
another ride home. Yeah?

130
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,256
Mr President, the Russian news crew's with us.
I told them you'd give 'em a sound bite...

131
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,425
- about life in the White House.
- There is no life in the White House.

132
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,097
- You said it. The president needs some time alone.
- Aha.

133
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,142
Fourteen-thirteen Michigan!
All right, Mr President.

134
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,691
That wasn't you napping during
the performance, was it, Tom?

135
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,527
No, ma'am, it was very enjoyable.

136
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,322
Come on, Alice. You can finish it on the plane.
Let's not keep your father waiting.

137
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,867
- Just try and smile, sweetheart, okay?
- Quick picture, Alice?
- Alice! Alice!

138
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,412
- One picture for me?
- Thank you very much, Alice.

139
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,290
...up over the ball.
Second and five at the Notre Dame 28.

140
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,835
Hudson split wide, Muhammad the l-back. Gives
to Muhammad over the right side, number 25.

141
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,297
He's hit hard by Ron Davis and—

142
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,884
Shh. Daddy's asleep.

143
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,473
How was the ballet?

144
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,642
- It was great!
- Ow!
- Oh!

145
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,353
- Brat. Are you trying to kill me?
- Dad-Daddy!

146
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,148
- Was it really good?
Did you enjoy it? Did you love it?
- It was great!

147
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,067
- Men in tights. Did you hear my speech?
- Yeah.

148
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,653
- "Yeah"?
- You're gonna get yourself re-elected.

149
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,697
That's what I keep tellin' them.

150
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the aircraft commander.

151
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,707
- We'll be taking the runway
in just a few moments.
- So, are you guys comfortable?

152
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,919
- Yes, very.
- I brought you VIP press kits.

153
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,922
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

154
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,019
...he's allowed to jam that receiver-
- Pass interference.

155
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,064
- That's cheating!
- Only if they get caught.

156
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,025
- Dad.
- Way of the world, kiddo.

157
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:49,197
The ball's marked at the 37-yard line.
Let's call it third and a long three.

158
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,992
Why didn't you take me with you when
you went to the refugee camp today?

159
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,831
Well, for one thing,
it's not 100% secure.

160
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:06,798
You got your whole life to live, baby.
You don't need to see that kind of stuff.

161
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,134
Come on, Dad. It's not like
I don't see it on the news.

162
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,388
- It's different on the news.
- All I'm saying is, I'm ready.

163
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,099
You know, for things you
don't think I'm ready for.

164
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,769
- Maybe I'm not ready.
- I'm 12 years old, Dad.

165
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:24,315
In the caveman days,
I'd be having children of my own.

166
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,736
That's what we call progress, young lady.
You're missing the best part of the game.

167
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,072
God.

168
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,868
Well, we're so looking
forward to seeing you.

169
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,581
- I just can't tell you—
- She is so anxious to grow up.
- Oh, I know, she's—

170
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:45,086
Yes. The both of us.
Okay. Bye-bye.

171
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,216
Well, she couldn't stay
your little girl forever, Jim.

172
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,180
Well, I was hoping it would last
till she was 14 or 15 or 50.

173
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,144
They hated your speech,
didn't they?

174
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,688
They're afraid we won't
have the guts to back it up...

175
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,858
and that if we do,
it'll be political suicide.

176
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,653
- Remember our first campaign?
- In the House?

177
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,864
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Downstate, driving around with, uh...

178
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,533
- Who's that kid, our volunteer?
- That— Remember, with the-
- Henry.

179
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,577
- Henry, with the convertible...
- Yeah.

180
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,163
- With the broken top, and the—
- Snow comin' in.

181
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,416
Yeah, and we were the only three people
who thought you could win that.

182
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,920
You didn't give a damn. You knew what
needed to be done, and you did it.

183
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,632
And you spoke from your heart.
And that's what I heard tonight.

184
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,346
Well, it felt good.

185
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,849
Yeah, I'll bet it did.

186
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,939
Sir—

187
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,443
Sorry to interrupt.
Everybody's assembled, sir.

188
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,784
United States Air Force One.

189
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:02,413
It is an honour to clear you for
immediate take-off on runway two-five.

190
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,125
Air Force One clear for take-off.
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow.

191
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,849
In Moscow tonight,
President Marshall defended...

192
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,434
the joint military action
against the Radek regime...

193
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,813
an act the administration had been
calling a one-time intervention.

194
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,524
But, in a rare display of emotion,
the president alluded...

195
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,694
to a major change in U.S.
Foreign policy, when he stated...

196
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,281
that America will no longer tolerate
any terrorist government.

197
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,326
Meanwhile, in Kazakhstan, Radek's ouster
has stalled the neocommunist revolution.

198
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,204
These are two of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard brigades...

199
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,208
- that have been moved north.
- He knows we're watching.
He knows we'll retaliate.

200
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,669
Why the hell is he sending tanks
to the border?

201
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,463
Could be a response to your speech,
Mr President.

202
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,591
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law out there.
- Very funny.

203
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,387
Think there's one or two he hasn't
shot yet. What does State have to say?

204
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,682
The Iraqi ambassador
is claiming it's just an exercise.

205
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,311
Let's not waste any more time.
Send the Nimitz back in.

206
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,648
...we're leaving Berlin's airspace, and—
...and Roger-

207
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,650
- Gibbs.
- Guys.

208
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,871
- Sleepin' on the job?
- No, sir.

209
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,888
Hey, guys. These are
the advance team reports...

210
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,849
from the, uh,
Miami field agent.

211
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,851
- Take a look at 'em.
- Thank you.

212
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,029
Smoke. There's smoke!

213
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,496
Steward!
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin!

214
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,958
Everybody move to the back of the plane.
Now! Please!

215
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,295
Smoke! Smoke!
Notify the cockpit!

216
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,307
Come on! Come on!

217
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,018
Mr President, stay back.

218
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,898
Get down! Everybody down!

219
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,537
- Oh, my God!
- Code Red! We have a Code Red, Jeremy!
Shots fired on board.

220
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,123
Flight deck Code Red acknowledged.
Bridges, lock that door, now.

221
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,834
- Yes, sir.
- Flight control, this is Air Force One
declaring emergency.

222
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,838
- Get down! Get down!
- Cover up! Stay back!

223
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,719
Move up! I'll cover ya!

224
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,513
Go! Go, go!

225
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,308
- What's goin' on?
- Shots fired, sir!
- My family! What about my family?

226
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:37,521
- We're handling it, sir.
- Boy Scout's comin' out!
Cover! Cover! Give him cover!

227
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,815
- Daddy?
- Alice, get back!

228
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,903
- Daddy!
- Alice? Alice, get down!

229
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,530
Around here!
Take him around here! Get down!

230
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,408
Ramstein Tower, this is Air Force One.
We are Code Red.

231
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,205
Shots fired on board. Request emergency
assistance. E.T. A: 15 minutes.

232
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,332
Air Force One, acknowledged.
We are scrambling our fighters.

233
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,334
Emergency equipment
will be standing by.

234
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,891
- Get him to the escape pod.
- Boy Scout is headed to the vault.

235
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,353
- The football! The football!
- There it is.

236
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,318
- Get around here!
- Get him down to the pod!

237
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,738
- Don't move!
- Everybody, head down!

238
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,782
Get the president!

239
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,286
- Move! They're on us!
- Where's my family?

240
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,831
- Get in the pod, sir. Get in!
- What about my family?

241
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,259
Air Force One, landing runway 09.
I repeat, runway 09.

242
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,846
Roger. Turning to heading 185.
Descending to 5,000 feet.

243
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,532
Hurry, he's in the escape pod.

244
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,465
Ramstein. This is Air Force One.
Emergency pod has been deployed.

245
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,593
I repeat.
The emergency pod has been deployed.

246
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,722
Ramstein Tower, acknowledge.
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue.

247
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,898
- Are the scenario options ready to look at?
- Just about, sir.

248
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,025
- Has General Northwood arrived?
- Yes, he has.

249
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,156
- Give me an update.
- Madam Vice-President, this way.
We'll avoid the press.

250
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,868
- Is the president secure?
- Not yet. The recovery team
will have him very soon.

251
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,177
Air Force One, this is Halo Flight Lead.
You are now under escort.

252
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,597
All airspace has been cleared.
Alert forces have been mobilized.

253
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,641
- Is everyone here?
- We're workin' on it.

254
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,519
How the hell did this happen?
How the hell did they get Air Force One?

255
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,021
Gentlemen. Mr Secretary.

256
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,361
Ramstein Tower, we are at ten miles
northwest to final, coming in red hot.

257
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,949
Roger, Air Force One, wind is zero-niner-zero
at one-two. You are clear to land.

258
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,833
They're landing.

259
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,295
- Hey, what are you guys-
- Get down now!

260
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:58,639
Open the door!
Open the door!

261
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,859
Open! Open the door!

262
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,821
No matter what happens, we land
this aircraft. Is that understood?

263
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,951
Come on, come on.
Flaps, 30.

264
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,453
Flaps, 30.

265
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,880
If we land, we're finished.

266
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,903
- No!
- Get the fuck in the air!

267
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,160
Now! Take this plane up!

268
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,247
Up! Up!

269
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,168
- Get us back in the air now!
- Artie!

270
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,172
- Take it up!
- Artie—

271
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,175
Get this plane back in the air now,
or you die!

272
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,054
- Get up now!
- No!

273
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,405
Get him!

274
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,752
No! Jesus!

275
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,024
Come on, come on!

276
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,735
Come on!

277
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,025
Air Force One,
this is Ramstein Tower.

278
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,194
- Contact those F-15s.
- Sir.

279
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,239
I want them to keep Air Force One
in visual contact at all times.

280
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,284
- What are our airborne scenarios?
- There are no airborne scenarios.

281
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:09,121
Well, we'd better start generating them,
hadn't we, General? And they better be
damn good, and they better work.

282
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,081
How long can they stay up there
with the fuel they have?

283
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,792
- That's a question of air speed. Wind.
- Altitude.

284
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,546
We need an Air Force One pilot in here.
Any educated guesses as to where
they might be going?

285
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,758
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria—
- Those are guesses.
I don't know if they're educated.

286
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,261
So we better notify our allies. We'll need
secure airspace. Could we keep that under wraps?

287
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,766
- We'll do our best.
- If you could just try and relax,
Kathryn. I'm in charge here.

288
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,560
Well, I don't know, Walter.
It seems to me that they're in charge.

289
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,944
- Air Force One, this is Ramstein Tower.
Please respond.
- We're heading home.

290
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,033
- Air Force One, this is Ramstein Tower.
- Let's get him.

291
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,619
State your intention.

292
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,621
- Don't hurt me!
- Go.
- Yes, I will.

293
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,623
- Here.
- Go.

294
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,253
The president.

295
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,923
The president is no longer on board.

296
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,966
He made it to the pod and escaped.

297
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,968
Keep moving!

298
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,111
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered—

299
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,323
the same crew that was cleared
to fly on Air Force One.

300
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,909
- Jesus.
- Oh, please tell me it's not that easy.

301
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,329
No. You would have to generate fake ID,
photo, fingerprints-

302
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,833
- Could be with a little help from Moscow.
- How would they get the weapons
on board the plane?

303
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,710
There's no way to get weapons
aboard Air Force One. It's impossible.

304
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,172
Well, there are enough weapons
already on board to take Panama.
But who has access to them?

305
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,844
- You think someone on the plane helped them?
- What if somebody did,
and they're still on the plane?

306
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,930
Who do they trust up there?
Who do we trust?

307
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,185
Madam Vice-President?
Mr Secretary.

308
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,315
All compromised nuclear launch codes
have been cancelled. New codes are active.

309
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,027
Ramstein, the president's
escape pod has been located.

310
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,530
We're homing in at 285 degrees.

311
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,289
There it is.
Ramstein, we have a strong signal.

312
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,624
E.T. A: Two minutes.

313
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,297
Oh, my God!

314
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,969
Where is the wife and daughter?

315
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,640
- Just wait.
- I want to talk to him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

316
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,976
No, let me go.

317
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,105
Let me see him.
Let me—

318
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,483
Where is my husband?

319
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:50,073
He has fled.
The coward chose to save himself.

320
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,075
- Yes!
- Yes!

321
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,705
But one can always
strike a bargain.

322
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,666
No, you listen to me.

323
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,337
I don't know who you are
or what you want...

324
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,381
but you will never get it.

325
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,134
He will not negotiate.

326
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:16,183
Really?
His wife. His daughter.

327
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,520
A man could not live
with himself.

328
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,816
And it would be
such bad politics.

329
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,201
- I think he will negotiate.
- Oh, my God.

330
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,589
Escape pod is visually acquired.

331
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,926
Location off Ramstein
is 284 degrees...

332
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,970
12 miles out.

333
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,025
All the weapons have been collected.

334
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,694
Nevsky, check the plane again.

335
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,696
You have the first watch.

336
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,755
I'll check downstairs.

337
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,185
Ready.

338
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,173
It's Air Force One.
They want to talk to the vice-president.

339
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,022
Hello, can you hear me?

340
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:14,736
This is the vice-president of the
United States. To whom am I speaking?

341
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,740
This is the person
who controls Air Force One...

342
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,535
the world's most secure aircraft.

343
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,164
What is it that you want?

344
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,709
We'll get to that.

345
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,547
- I would like to speak to the First Lady.
- No.

346
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,675
- No. Why?
- I need to know that they're safe.

347
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:41,304
The president is safe.
But then, you must know that.

348
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,225
He ran from here
like a whipped dog.

349
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,645
I'm sure you can't wait for him
to get back to making the decisions...

350
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:53,358
so you can stop sweating
through that silk blouse of yours.

351
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,365
What is the condition
of the people on board?

352
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,077
- Some are dead.
- Jesus.

353
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,247
- What are your intentions?
- What arrogance...

354
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,750
to think you could ever understand
my intentions.

355
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,254
I want to understand
what it is that you want.

356
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,340
What do I want?

357
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:23,180
When Mother Russia becomes
one great nation again...

358
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,641
when the capitalists
are dragged from the Kremlin...

359
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,686
and shot in the street...

360
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,773
when our enemies
run and hide in fear...

361
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,775
at the mention of our name...

362
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,447
and America begs our forgiveness—

363
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,993
on that great day of deliverance...

364
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,454
you will know what I want.

365
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,625
We can give you a forum
for your grievances.

366
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,960
We can contact
the Russian government.

367
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,838
But you must understand
that it will take some time.

368
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:01,343
Oh, really? Well, when you talk to
the president, you might remind him...

369
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,472
that I am holding his wife,
his daughter, his Chief of Staff...

370
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,725
his National Security Advisor,
his classified papers...

371
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,895
and his baseball glove!

372
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:17,150
If he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow...

373
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,487
to release General Radek.

374
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,322
Fifty for one.

375
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,618
It's a good deal.
How's your blouse?

376
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,832
What assurances do I have
that you'll keep your word?

377
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:37,379
I'll wait for confirmation that
General Radek has been released.

378
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,507
Until then...

379
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,011
I will execute a hostage
every half an hour.

380
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,392
You have my word.

381
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,604
You must understand that we—

382
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,982
- Hello?
- They're off!
- Hello?

383
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,903
- Dave's the language expert.
- Damn it.

384
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,698
Nobody does this
to the United States.

385
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,410
The president will get back his baseball glove
and play catch with this guy's balls.

386
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,288
We can't do anything in half an hour.
We need more time.

387
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,708
He's a zealot. Tough to negotiate with.
All you can do is wear them down.

388
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,752
Mr Secretary!
Mr Secretary, sir.

389
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,763
We found the escape pod.
It's empty.

390
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,061
So where's the president?

391
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,860
I think we have
to acknowledge the possibility...

392
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,237
that the president...

393
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,281
may be dead.

394
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,995
Why wouldn't they tell us?

395
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,915
Diversion, trying to buy some time.

396
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,752
Could have happened at a crossfire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate.

397
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,172
Damn right we'll retaliate. We'll release
General Radek into the goddam atmosphere.

398
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,259
It doesn't add up. That terrorist knew
that we'd recover the pod in short order.

399
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,595
He expected
that we'd be talking to Marshall.

400
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,140
Let's not bury him yet.
He could still be alive in that plane.

401
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,809
Let's not forget, this president
is a Medal of Honour winner.

402
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,772
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter rescue
missions than any other man in my command.

403
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,109
- He knows how to fight.
- Then he's taking a terrible chance
with his life.

404
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,988
The element of surprise
is a formidable advantage in combat.

405
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,949
If he's up there,
he's the best chance that we have.

406
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,619
That pod was designed
for a reason, General.

407
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,580
He has no right
to take chances with his life.

408
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,658
Everything is all right.

409
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,415
What does the psych profile say?
How far do they say he'll go?

410
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,461
He's a Radek loyalist. That tells us
all we need to know, doesn't it?

411
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,547
He'll see this thing through
to the last hostage. Or his own death.

412
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,467
You release this bastard and all
of Central Asia will go up in flames.

413
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:57,096
- I'm well aware of that, Walter.
- Bring back the old Soviet Empire
under a flag of genocide?

414
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,475
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

415
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,355
I hate to say this, but 50 people is a small
price to pay to stop that from happening.

416
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,359
- Even if one of them is the president?
- The presidency is bigger than any one man.

417
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:14,030
- Didn't they teach you that at Yale?
- Can't we release him today
and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

418
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:18,117
- We caught him before, we catch him again.
- If Petrov releases Radek,
his government will fall.

419
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,704
I promise you that.
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

420
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,958
You go to catch him again,
you're gonna find him in Moscow.

421
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:29,003
With all respect, Mr Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics. We need options.

422
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,173
- It's not an option.
- We need a decision.
- It's not her decision.

423
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,510
- Oh?
- This is a military situation.
I'm the Secretary of Defence.

424
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:39,389
Check your regs. In the absence
of the president, the buck stops here.

425
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,516
Get the Attorney General
with a copy of the Constitution.

426
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,479
We have— oh, my God—
19 minutes.

427
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,023
I'm gonna consult
with President Petrov.

428
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,371
...37-yard line.
Let's call it third and a long three.

429
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,249
It's gonna be a double tight end set.
Alexander and Brooks.

430
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,460
Malcolm is split wide again
right behind the tailback.

431
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,200
Madam Vice-President, I'm sorry.
I cannot release him.

432
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,703
We would train all our military might
against this one target.

433
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,997
I assure you, though,
he wouldn't stay at large for long.

434
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:20,002
Maybe so, but millions of lives are hanging
in the balance. I am trying to save a nation!

435
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:25,508
As am I. No nation can easily survive the loss
of nor soon replace a great leader.

436
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,762
Now, let us be pragmatic. 50 lives
means nothing in the grand scheme.

437
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,848
Well, then, let me be
equally pragmatic.

438
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,517
Our president took a great risk
to come to your aid...

439
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,395
against strong opposition
in both parties and among our allies.

440
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,730
It would be politically impossible
to do so again.

441
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,900
If it meant saving his life,
I would gladly do it.

442
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,445
But I would have to know for sure,
and you cannot tell me he's alive.

443
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,283
- Can you?
- No, Mr President, I cannot.

444
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,787
Then there is nothing I can do.
I am truly sorry. Goodbye.

445
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,293
Okay, Walter.
You and your generals get to work.

446
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,317
He was in Afghanistan with me
for five years.

447
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,155
Find out who killed him
or you lie down next to him.

448
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,134
Okay. They can't keep the plane
in the air indefinitely.

449
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,553
There are only four possible
landing sites in Kazakhstan...

450
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,390
that are still controlled by Radek's forces;
we have to go in and take all of them.

451
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,644
- Can we do it?
- I'd rather take my chances in the air.

452
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,898
No, I just looked at the airborne scenarios.
They're no good. Can we do this?

453
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,317
In the time we have? Messy.

454
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,986
Three more minutes
before they execute the first hostage.

455
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,531
- You have to buy us some more time.
- All right.

456
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,039
It's time.

457
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,418
Transfer the phone
to the conference room.

458
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,154
You, both. Come here.

459
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,573
No. No.

460
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,661
Now!

461
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,052
They will transfer the call here.

462
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:21,017
So, let's just wait.

463
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,192
Excuse me.

464
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,031
Sir, if you will permit me. I am the
National Security Advisor at the White House.

465
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,283
I'm the man the president
would be listening to.

466
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,286
I believe that you are negotiating
right now with the vice-president?

467
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,040
Unfortunately, in our system of government,
the vice-president is like the Queen of England.

468
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,752
She can't even get airline tickets
without talking to somebody like me.

469
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,048
Therefore, let me speak to
the White House, because I promise you...

470
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,633
I'm the one person who can
make this all work out.

471
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,933
Has he been released?

472
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,896
I've contacted the Russian government.
We've set things in motion...

473
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,273
but at this point
we have to be realistic.

474
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,026
It's going to take more time.

475
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,153
More time?

476
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:24,038
Your National Security Advisor
has just been executed.

477
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,624
He's a very good negotiator.

478
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,251
He bought you another half hour.

479
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:44,058
Mrs Marshall, Alice...

480
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,186
if you please, come with me.

481
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,185
It's the first time you ever
seen a man killed, huh?

482
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,229
Leave her alone.

483
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:36,777
You think I am a monster
that I would kill this man?

484
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,364
Somebody's son?

485
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,741
Somebody's father?

486
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,788
I am somebody's son too.

487
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,541
I have three small children.

488
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,129
Does that surprise you?

489
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,176
- Tell her to answer.
- You leave her alone.

490
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,469
Shut up!

491
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,685
Why did you kill him?

492
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,314
Because I believe.

493
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:17,693
When I shoot this man
I know in that instant...

494
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,863
how deep was my belief...

495
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:25,576
that I would turn my back
on God himself...

496
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,038
for Mother Russia.

497
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:33,584
My doubts, my fears,
my own private morality-

498
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:40,007
it dissolve in this moment...

499
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,468
for this love.

500
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,265
You know, your father
he has also killed.

501
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,560
- Is he a bad man?
- That's not true.

502
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,562
Why?

503
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,943
Because he does it in a tuxedo
with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

504
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,072
You are a monster.

505
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,617
And my father is a great man.

506
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,370
You're nothing like my father.

507
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,650
What's the goddam number?

508
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:48,450
- What city, please?
- Washington, D.C., please. The White House.

509
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,954
- Just a moment. Here's the number.
- Can you connect me to that number?

510
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,707
- There's a connect fee of one dollar, sir.
- Fine.

511
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,933
White House switchboard.
How may I direct your call?

512
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,519
All right, listen.
Listen carefully.

513
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,856
This is an emergency call from Air Force One.
This is the president.

514
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,025
Connect me to the vice-president,
please.

515
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,902
Who did you say is calling?

516
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,157
- This is the president.
- Yeah, right.

517
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,201
- And I'm the first lady.
- Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.

518
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:35,581
Sir, the president doesn't call this particular
phone number. So, whoever you are...

519
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,875
- Trace the call.
- Get a life.

520
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:42,046
Follow your standard
security procedure...

521
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,381
and trace the goddam call.

522
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:48,552
Okay, sir. You wanna make a federal case
out of this, fine by me.

523
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:02,024
- Look- Anyone there?
- Don't move!

524
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,693
- I traced the call, sir.
- Give me the gun.

525
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,488
- Are you there?
- Very slowly.

526
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:11,617
Oh, my God. I'll put you
right through, Mr President.

527
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,581
Good. Go.

528
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,584
The switchboard has a call from someone
claiming to be the president.

529
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,212
She traced it back
to the White House satellite account.

530
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:27,174
- The caller's gone but the line is still active.
- Put it through.

531
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,845
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

532
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,141
You know who I am.
I'm the president of the United States.

533
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,185
Yes!

534
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,229
Don't think that means
I don't shoot you.

535
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,940
Put your hands
behind your head and move.

536
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:56,954
This is your lucky day. What more could my
people do? Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

537
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,748
Even if they tried, we're equipped
with tactical countermeasures.

538
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,084
- He's talking to us.
- What are you telling me? What do you mean?

539
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:06,088
I just want you to feel secure.
That way no one will get hurt.
The computer'll fly circles...

540
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,758
around any missile they fire at us,
and they'll hit just a shock wave.

541
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,386
- He's telling us what to do.
- Believe me...

542
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,305
all that'd happen is we'd get
knocked off our feet, that's all!

543
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,391
Shut up, goddam it!

544
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,811
My God. Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

545
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,147
- If we're going to act we have to act now.
- It's too risky.

546
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,315
The president is up there
with a gun to his head.

547
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,026
He's asking us to do that
to Air Force One?

548
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:33,699
He's not asking. Your commander in chief
has issued a direct order. Do it!

549
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,956
Sir, are you sure that's
what you want me to do?

550
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,835
You heard me, Carlton. And let's pray
it works the way it's supposed to.

551
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:49,882
Okay, boys, give me some room. I've just
been ordered to fire on Air Force One.

552
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:06,398
I'm in position.
Missiles are armed.

553
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,400
All right.

554
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,863
Target is acquired.
I have a good lock.

555
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,533
God, I hope this works.

556
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,619
Fox three!

557
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,434
What's going on?

558
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,396
The Americans fired at us.
I have no control.

559
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,441
The computer is flying.

560
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,128
- Mom!
- Are they crazy?

561
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,279
This is Marshall.
Anyone there?

562
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,574
- We're here, Mr President.
- Where's my family? Are they safe?

563
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,285
Well, the terrorists claim
they're holding them. We can't confirm.

564
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,288
Who are they?
What do they want?

565
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,498
They're Russian
ultranationalist radicals.

566
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:33,128
- They want General Radek released from prison.
- Radek?

567
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,964
- What are our tactical options?
- We're working on that, Mr President...

568
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,508
but the bastards
do have us in a corner.

569
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,261
- There is no rescue attempt?
- I ruled out a midair rescue.

570
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:45,140
- There's nothing we can do while
the plane is still in the air.
- Then we gotta get this plane on the ground.

571
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,852
Take me off the goddam speakerphone.
Where's Bennett?

572
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,522
- Mr President.
- We cannot release Radek.

573
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,567
They're gonna shoot a hostage
every half hour until we do.

574
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,779
I don't want a plane full
of dead people.

575
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,033
Jim, they shot Jack Doherty.

576
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,535
Oh, Christ.

577
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,914
Kathryn, we can't give in
to their demands. It won't end there.

578
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,500
And if you die on that plane,
does it end there?

579
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:15,128
Kathryn, we've got a job to do,
whatever the cost.

580
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,130
- Mr President, l—
- Kathryn...

581
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,301
if you give a mouse a cookie—

582
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:27,015
He's gonna want a glass of milk.

583
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,268
We've gotta get
this plane on the ground.

584
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,322
- Has Bazylev returned?
- No.

585
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,456
Get the plane on the ground.

586
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,771
This man down there evades us.

587
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,690
My patience is running out.

588
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,541
I thought I'd ask you
to come and join us.

589
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,253
It's starting to feel
a little empty up here.

590
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,631
Sit down, please.

591
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,348
Come.

592
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,866
Tell me your name again...

593
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,368
for the record.

594
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:39,040
Melanie.
Melanie Mitchell.

595
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:44,087
You travel often
with the president.

596
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:49,134
- Yes.
- So you, you know everyone on the plane.

597
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:53,179
Yes.

598
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,225
I bet they like you, huh?

599
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,228
You're a nice person, yes?

600
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,568
Okay. I guess so.

601
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,464
You are trembling.

602
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,300
Why are you afraid?

603
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:35,305
Because I don't wanna die.

604
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,224
I don't wanna die.

605
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:44,105
Tell me, what am I doing
at this moment?

606
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,984
You're pointing a gun at me.

607
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,612
Thank you, Melanie.

608
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:54,366
This is to the Secret Service agent
in the baggage deck.

609
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,744
I will count to ten.

610
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,748
And if you do not surrender,
this nice woman will die.

611
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,627
- No.
- One.

612
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,964
- No, please, don't.
- Two.
- Don't do this.

613
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:12,175
- No!
- Three.
- Let me talk to him.

614
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,844
- Four.
- I beg you, please.

615
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,472
- Five.
- Let me talk to the agent!

616
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,600
- Six.
- He might listen to me!

617
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,520
- Seven.
- Please, I beg you. Don't do this.

618
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,939
- Eight.
- Don't do this, please!

619
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,191
- Nine.
- No!

620
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,706
God.

621
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,382
Let's just think about that one
for a moment...

622
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,510
and then we'll start again.

623
01:06:55,594 --> 01:07:00,724
Next time, I'll choose
someone more important.

624
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:24,080
I know what you are thinking,
First Lady.

625
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,374
You want me dead.

626
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:30,420
Well, it may come to that.
In a war, people die.

627
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,089
This isn't war.

628
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,884
You just murdered
an unarmed woman!

629
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:40,346
You, who murdered 100,000 Iraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas...

630
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,892
are going to lecture me
about the rules of war?

631
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,604
Don't!

632
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:53,359
- Mr President. How can I help you?
- Chief, you could help me dump some fuel.

633
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:57,530
Who's down there on the baggage deck?
The Russian said it was a Secret Service agent.
Who?

634
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:01,076
- We have no idea, sir. We lost contact.
- Melanie was shot because one of
your men wouldn't show himself.

635
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,913
- I wanna know who the son of a bitch is.
- We'd like to know ourselves.
- Sir?

636
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,041
It's someone who's smart enough to know
if you're hunting with one bullet...

637
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,294
- you wait for a clean shot.
- What are you saying, Major?

638
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:15,381
I'm saying, sir, whoever that is
down there, he may be our only hope.

639
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:19,385
Our only hope is that Washington
complies with this bastard.

640
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,514
Because, any minute now,
another one of us is dead.

641
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,392
And you know what?

642
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,229
I'm afraid it might be me.

643
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,944
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
- Yeah, I see it.

644
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:39,364
Pop it open. There should be
a red switch. Toggle it up.

645
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,658
Hang on.

646
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,203
Okay, we got some
indicator lights here.

647
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,456
To dump the fuel you have to close
the circuit for the pump.

648
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,085
There's no switch, Mr President,
so you'll have to cross the wires.

649
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,255
- Open the fuel control door.
- Hang on here.

650
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:59,509
There should be five of them.

651
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:02,220
- Do you see them, sir?
- Yeah, I see 'em. Yeah.

652
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:06,099
Jesus. A lot of goddam wires.
All right, is, um—

653
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:10,854
All right, we got five:
Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

654
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:14,566
- Okay, just hang on.
Let me double-check something.
- Come on, man. Oh, for Christ's sake, hurry up!

655
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,443
Sir, if you get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds, and the plane will crash.

656
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,988
Well, then, we don't want
to get the wrong wire, do we?

657
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:24,784
- First, cut the green wire.
- Green wire. Okay. Green.

658
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,708
- Okay, cut.
- And then, cross that with the-

659
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,962
With the, with the what?
Hello? Cross it with the what?

660
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:39,924
Say again. Cross the green wire
with the, with the-

661
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,264
For Christ's sake.

662
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:51,102
Green, yellow,
red, white and blue.

663
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,730
Cross with—
Green—

664
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,611
I'm countin' on ya,
red, white and blue.

665
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:19,923
Sirs, it looks like
Air Force One is losing fuel.

666
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,304
We're losing fuel.

667
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,766
Somebody is pumping it out of avionics.

668
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,067
I'm going downstairs.

669
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,487
Take Sergei.

670
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,830
If it isn't us coming out, shoot.

671
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,994
A magazine, quickly.

672
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,543
Are you okay?

673
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,220
Sergei? Kolchak?
What's happening?

674
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,391
He's dead. Give us a hand.

675
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:08,156
Madam Vice-President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith.

676
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,616
I've been reading
through your press kit.

677
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:16,039
I understand Air Force One
is able to refuel in midair.

678
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:20,835
Well, we need fuel.
And we need it now.

679
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,005
I'm sure we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

680
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:27,175
If you land the plane,
we'll trade fuel for hostages.

681
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:31,012
This is bullshit.
It's simple physics.

682
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,349
Without fuel the plane crashes.
Everybody dies.

683
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,726
We're trying to do
everything that we can.

684
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,853
- Tell me what I want to hear...
- I need—

685
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,189
or I will execute a member
of the senior staff...

686
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:45,068
and continue killing
one hostage every minute...

687
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:49,572
until the plane crash
or refuelling plane arrive.

688
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,412
Well, what do you say?

689
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,958
- Fuel's on its way.
- Thank you.

690
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,465
They'll refuel us.

691
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,845
Ready.

692
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,818
Everything all right?

693
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,403
Yes.

694
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,620
Move.

695
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,014
- Jim. What are you doing here?
- Mr President!
- I never left.

696
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,644
Gibbs.

697
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:07,233
Watch the door.
Where's my family?

698
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,360
They took 'em to another part of
the plane. We haven't seen them since.

699
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,696
We've got weapons now.
We should try to retake the plane.

700
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,157
Not while they've got Grace and Alice.
I can't take that chance.

701
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:17,326
What about trying to disable the plane
and force them to land?

702
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,164
I tried to do that. I dumped some fuel.
And now they're gonna refuel us in midair.

703
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,960
- A refuelling tanker? Jesus.
- Sir?

704
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:29,797
- There may be a way to get
these people off the plane.
- What do you mean?

705
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,134
We have emergency parachutes
in the tail cone, but we're too high.

706
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:36,012
If we could somehow get a message
to the refuelling tanker...

707
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,264
get him to drop to 15,000 feet,
we could jump.

708
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:42,977
- They've disabled the phones.
They control the radios.
- No. M-Mr President?

709
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:46,731
- Sir? The fax machines.
- Told ya the phone lines are out.

710
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:51,068
No, voice lines and faxes are on
two different systems of encryption.

711
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,697
You disable one,
be very easy to overlook the other.

712
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,244
If this works,
you get to be Postmaster General.

713
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,330
- Come with me. Get these people ready to go.
- Yes, sir.

714
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:07,001
Remember: 15,000 feet and 200 knots,
otherwise it's suicide.

715
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,045
I don't need this.

716
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,715
Good luck, people.

717
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,978
- Give me a pen.
- Where are we sending it?
- Situation room.

718
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:31,234
It makes me so proud, Mr President,
that you stuck with us.

719
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,612
- Thanks.
- Whatever happens.

720
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,810
- Yes!
- Come on.

721
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:25,788
Madam Vice-President,
the Attorney General's here.

722
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:33,421
- Thank you for coming, Andrew.
- Hello, Kathryn. Walter.
- It's good that you're here.

723
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,590
I'm told that you want
my interpretation as to what...

724
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,842
- the Constitution says about this situation.
- Yes, yes.

725
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,678
Now, Andrew,
my understanding is that...

726
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,514
if the president is out of contact
in a military situation...

727
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,183
the Secretary of Defence
is in charge as second in command.

728
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,936
- Yes, of course.
- Good. Then that settles it.

729
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,938
It doesn't settle it at all.

730
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:55,318
The president is not merely out of contact,
he is also under duress:

731
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:59,030
His family is held hostage,
possibly himself a hostage.

732
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:03,659
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th Amendment...

733
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,162
uh, surely just as if
he'd had, uh, a stroke.

734
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:09,332
I think the president would dispute
that any incapacity exists.

735
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:14,462
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists.

736
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,799
The president may be alive,
but he may not be the president.

737
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:23,679
- Madam Vice-President,
I think you need to see this.
...CNN breaking news.

738
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,727
We interrupt programming to bring you
this breaking news bulletin.

739
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:35,483
CNN has received unconfirmed reports
that Air Force One has crashed.

740
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,860
- Oh, my God.
- The presidential aircraft...
- How'd they get that?

741
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:41,530
- I don't know.
- Was en route from Moscow
when it began its Mayday hail.

742
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:45,242
- I repeat, we have unconfirmed reports...
- Call the pressroom. We have to issue a statement.

743
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,663
- That the president's plane
has crashed in Eastern Europe.
- Walter. General.

744
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:53,751
This follows an earlier unconfirmed report
of an aborted landing at a U.S. Air base-

745
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,879
These guys have—

746
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,103
- Take this.
- Got it.

747
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,656
- Bruce, has Air Force One crashed?
- Look, as far as I know that is a rumour.

748
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,284
- Where'd the story come from?
- I don't know where that story came from.

749
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:32,957
- Listen, listen!
I cannot confirm anything at this point.
- Anything you can tell us? Anything at all?

750
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,881
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a statement.

751
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:48,848
The president's plane,
Air Force One, has been hijacked.

752
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:52,393
- Who are the hijackers?
- Please—

753
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,479
Ladies and gentlemen,
please let me finish.

754
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,442
For security reasons I cannot divulge
the identity of the hijackers...

755
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,236
or who was on board the plane.

756
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,239
But I am here to assure
the American people...

757
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:08,617
that we are doing everything
we can to resolve the situation.

758
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,164
For the safety of all
the people on the plane...

759
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,416
I cannot tell you any more
than I already have.

760
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,502
- I'm sure you understand that.
- Is James Marshall still the president?

761
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,297
I am coordinating with
the National Security Council...

762
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:24,175
at the White House pending
the president's return...

763
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,343
and, yes, James Marshall
is still the president.

764
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,015
At this time—

765
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:35,936
At this time I would like
to ask all Americans...

766
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,527
to pray for the safety of everyone
on board Air Force One.

767
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,529
Thank you.

768
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,377
Where is the president?

769
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,055
Everything all right down there?

770
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,559
Yes.

771
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,005
Folks, listen up.
Listen up.

772
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,717
This is your main rip cord. As soon as
you clear the plane, give it a yank.

773
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:53,597
If your chute doesn't open, this is the lollipop,
your reserve chute. Pull it down. Clear?

774
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,748
Air Force One.
Air Force One, do you read?

775
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,585
Yes, we read.
Go ahead.

776
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,087
Air Force One,
this is Extender 1-0.

777
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,966
- We have been instructed to refuel you.
- Go ahead.

778
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,470
Drop to 15,000 feet
and slow to 200 knots.

779
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,181
Acknowledged.
Two hundred.

780
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:45,608
- They got the fax.
- Fax.
- Sir, your chute.
- No, no.

781
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:48,444
- Oh, please, sir.
- I'm not leaving without my family.

782
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,198
Okay, Air Force One, you need to open
your receptacle door.

783
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:57,620
Pull the yellow lever
on the upper control panel.

784
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:01,165
- Done.
- Go ahead and close distance, nice and easy.

785
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,837
Almost there.

786
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:13,010
- Where are your chutes, guys?
- We stay with the president, sir.

787
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:16,347
Thank you.

788
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,689
All right. That's close enough.
Here we go!

789
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:36,241
- Go, go!
- Go!
- Go! Come on! Come on!

790
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:39,453
Go check. Do it!

791
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,247
- Go! You, come on!
- Come on, come on!

792
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,550
The hostages are gone!

793
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:23,205
We've got—
Okay, so far 25 chutes.

794
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:49,023
- I can't hold her. I can't hold her!
- What are you doing, Air Force One?

795
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,567
Break away! Break away!

796
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,992
Sir! Can you reach my hand?

797
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,132
Everybody break!
Now, now, now!

798
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,567
- Don't move!
- Let me save him!

799
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,236
He's the president,
for God's sake!

800
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,655
Go get him!

801
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,124
Grab my hand!

802
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,961
Major!

803
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,342
I got ya.

804
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,187
We have the president.

805
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,941
We've lost the tanker?
What else?

806
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:17,236
- They're counting 32 survivors.
- That means they still have hostages.

807
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,571
- What about the first family?
- No word yet.

808
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:21,782
Losing hostages will make
the terrorists even more desperate.

809
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:25,452
Madam Vice-President,
we got Air Force One on the line.

810
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:29,289
This is Vice-President Bennett.
We're listening.

811
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,291
I now hold hostage...

812
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:35,838
the president of
the United States of America.

813
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:40,968
Soon we shall enter
the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan.

814
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:46,306
You will cease your military escort
at the border.

815
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,809
If you violate our airspace...

816
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:53,147
I will execute a member
of the first family.

817
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:56,483
- Tell our fighters to back off.
- Right. Let's get NATO on
the line and make sure they—

818
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,112
- I want that B brief-
- Get me Ops.

819
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,618
You said a presidential incapacity could be
declared by the majority of the cabinet.

820
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:09,454
- Would you sign it?
- Under the circumstances.

821
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,623
See who else would.

822
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,343
Move! Come on. Move!

823
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,307
Move!

824
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:31,518
Dad!

825
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:34,354
Oh, Jim! Jim!

826
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,567
- It'll be all right. It'll be all right.
- I know. If you go, we go.

827
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,424
You've been very busy downstairs...

828
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,803
haven't you?

829
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,973
Killing my men.

830
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:30,410
- No!
- You don't wanna do this.

831
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:36,083
I'm what you came for.
Don't forget that.

832
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,293
Then I kill them.

833
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,297
Just one. You pick.

834
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:46,176
That's what you do in the White House.
You play God.

835
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:58,397
Go ahead.
Which one lives?

836
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,483
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Go ahead.

837
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:13,996
You're not here for this.
You want something.

838
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,667
- What is it?
- Radek.

839
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:22,129
- How can I do that? I can't do that.
- Well, then you die, the three of you.

840
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:25,132
I'll do anything to save my family.
Don't ask me for something I can't give!

841
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:29,011
The most powerful man on the earth and now,
suddenly, there are things you cannot do?

842
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:33,223
This is very curious.
Stop with your fuckin' lies!

843
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,392
No!

844
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:46,153
Petrov will never give up Radek.

845
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,990
Petrov is a dog.
He does what you tell him.

846
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,997
Tell him to do this.

847
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:01,835
Petrov used me.
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed.

848
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:05,505
He wanted a personal victory.
Petrov hates Radek.

849
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:09,134
Of course he hates Radek.
Radek is everything he is not:

850
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:12,137
A great man, a strong man.

851
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:17,059
Are you saying
he would refuse you?

852
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:21,355
You'd be playing right into his hands.
Are you an idiot?

853
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:23,482
You'd make him into a hero:

854
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,318
The man who stopped
the terrorists.

855
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:29,154
Or better yet,
the man who stopped me.

856
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,242
You talk as if you have
nothing to do with this.

857
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,081
This is all your doing.

858
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:42,709
This infection you call freedom—

859
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,379
without meaning,
without purpose.

860
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:50,592
You have given my country
to gangsters and prostitutes.

861
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:55,639
You have taken
everything from us.

862
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:01,269
There is nothing left.

863
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,821
Call him.

864
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:21,331
No. No.

865
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,588
- No.
- No!
- No! Leave her!

866
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,049
- No!
- Leave her!

867
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:33,385
- No.
- I have no choice.

868
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:38,932
- You have the choice.
- Leave her alone. This is between you and me.

869
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:42,102
You lose a child,
it hollows you out.

870
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:46,273
We're soldiers.
You take my life.

871
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,610
Have you no honour?

872
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,696
- I'll count to five.
- No.

873
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,906
- It's gonna be all right, honey.
- One.

874
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,784
- It's gonna be all right.
- Two.

875
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,036
I'll do it.

876
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,331
- Yes.
- I'll do it.

877
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:11,089
You just leave my family alone.

878
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,514
Leave 'em alone.

879
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:41,703
Sir, the president of the United States.

880
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,414
Mr President.

881
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:53,048
We just got an intercept. The president
called Petrov and asked him to release Radek.

882
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,133
- He can't do that.
- He must have no choice.

883
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,844
We have a choice.

884
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,971
I have the signatures
of the majority of the cabinet...

885
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,516
attesting to the president's incapacity.

886
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,311
- Sign it and you can overrule him.
- No, l-I won't do that.

887
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:09,397
The United States does not
negotiate with terrorists.

888
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,983
It's been our bedrock principle
for 25 years.

889
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,362
You can't give in to them now. It'll be
open season on the United States.

890
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:19,241
Many more will die.

891
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:24,788
Jim isn't making this decision as a president,
he's making it as a husband and a father.

892
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:29,751
History will judge you
by what you do right now, Kathryn.

893
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:31,920
For God's sake, sign it.

894
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:50,647
No.

895
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:08,832
You are released.

896
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:15,255
I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released.

897
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:18,842
I repeat: General Radek
is now being released.

898
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:44,576
Yes. Yes. General Radek
has been released.

899
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:52,042
It is confirmed.

900
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:57,464
They are releasing
the general.

901
01:33:57,548 --> 01:34:01,635
- Now what?
- Now we return to our homeland...

902
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,804
where Radek will decide
how best to use you...

903
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:09,351
now that we know you are
willing to negotiate.

904
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,354
Our nation needs so many things.

905
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:16,566
- You said you were gonna release us.
- Forgive me. I lied.

906
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,319
Listen.

907
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:15,977
Honey, stay down. Jim!

908
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,915
Dad!

909
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:39,751
- Sir, are you hit?
- Stay with the major, honey.

910
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:43,171
- Alice, get in the cockpit.
- Don't worry. Come on. Lie down.

911
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:45,215
Grace?

912
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,885
Grace!

913
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:55,099
Jim! Jim!

914
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,227
Grace!

915
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:15,495
- Let her go!
- Not until Radek is safely away.

916
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:20,124
Jim! Call it off!
Don't give up Radek!

917
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:23,503
If anything happens to the general,
your wife will die!

918
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,755
Don't! Jim!

919
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,513
Comrades.

920
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:35,849
Our forces have arrived
for the general.

921
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,059
They'll pick him up any minute.

922
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:40,103
You hear that?

923
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,564
It's almost over, Mr President.

924
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:23,980
Drop the gun!

925
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:34,198
You make one mistake when you killed
my pilot, Mr President.

926
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:37,160
No one left
to fly the plane.

927
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,999
And no parachute.

928
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:48,546
Whatever happens...

929
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:51,341
you lose and I win.

930
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:48,606
Get off my plane.

931
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:11,212
- You all right?
- They're leading the general to the courtyard.

932
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:16,384
Go. Go! Call Petrov!

933
01:40:57,009 --> 01:41:00,094
Stop! Don't move.

934
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,823
They killed him.

935
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:27,371
They killed Radek!
Radek is dead.

936
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:35,088
He almost got away.
Did you hear me, sir? Radek is dead.

937
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:38,549
Yes! It's the president.
We have retaken the plane!

938
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:52,605
- How's he doin'?
- Not good, sir.

939
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,941
- I don't suppose you know how to fly.
- No, sir.

940
01:41:55,025 --> 01:41:57,652
- Come along, Major. I'll need a co-pilot.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:03,116
- How long since you've flown, sir?
- Twenty-five years.

942
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,953
Little planes. Never jets.

943
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:11,457
- Nothin' like this. Anybody there?
- Yes, we're here, sir.

944
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:13,459
All right. You got somebody
that can help me fly this thing?

945
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,670
- Sir, this is Colonel Jackson.
- Bob.

946
01:42:15,754 --> 01:42:18,631
- We need to get you out of hostile territory.
- Good idea, Bob.

947
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:21,384
I need for you to look above
the central video screen.

948
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:26,264
There's a series of L.E.D. Numbers.
Now, one of them should read 110.

949
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,224
- Got it.
- That's your course heading.

950
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:31,185
Now, just below there's a knob
surrounded by hash marks.

951
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:35,481
I want you to turn that knob
counterclockwise to two-niner-zero.

952
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,650
Two-niner-zero.

953
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:40,027
- We're turnin', Bob.
- Good.

954
01:42:42,781 --> 01:42:45,992
- This course'll take you out of Kazakhstan.
- You're okay, baby.

955
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:48,286
Now, sir, we can't land
this plane on autopilot...

956
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,830
so we're gonna need
to go over a few things.

957
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:54,208
- First, let's plan—
- Where's the nearest safe landing site?

958
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:57,503
Incirlik, Turkey.

959
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:01,674
- General Northwood.
- Madam?
- What's that?

960
01:43:01,758 --> 01:43:07,013
- Madam Vice-President,
that red dot represents MiGs.
- On a course to intercept Air Force One.

961
01:43:07,097 --> 01:43:09,265
Christ, they took off
from Aktyubinsk.

962
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,351
The base commander there
is loyal to Radek.

963
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:16,189
General, send our fighters
into Kazakhstan.

964
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:18,733
Order them to use any and all means
to protect the president.

965
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:22,028
When you're on final approach, I want
you to keep the throttles mid-range.

966
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,530
- Right.
- Mr President, can you hear me?

967
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:27,700
- Yes, Kathryn.
- We're tracking six MiGs
closing on your position.

968
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:30,703
I'm sending in our F-15s
to protect you.

969
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,206
- Shit.
- She say MiGs?

970
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:37,710
Yeah, she said MiGs. Honey, get in
that seat and put a seat belt on.

971
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:40,880
We're havin' a little trouble here.

972
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:45,384
Guys, these MiGs get closer,
I'm gonna have to manoeuver this thing.

973
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:50,389
- How do I get it off autopilot?
- Push the button on the yoke by your left thumb.

974
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,558
I'll try a little, uh, right turn.

975
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:56,020
Just keep your moves smooth and steady.
It's all flying, sir.

976
01:43:56,104 --> 01:43:58,648
Just step on the ball, huh?

977
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:00,900
That's right.
Just like riding a bike.

978
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:04,528
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit,
bearing 090.

979
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,989
Jettison tanks and push it up.

980
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:15,164
These MiGs,
how far away are they?

981
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,460
Never mind.

982
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:40,606
We've got one comin' at us.
Countermeasures are activated.

983
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:43,109
Left turn.

984
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:49,240
- Jesus Christ!
- We need some help here.

985
01:44:49,324 --> 01:44:53,119
U.S. Fighters, this is Air Force One.
We are under attack. Where the hell are you?

986
01:44:53,203 --> 01:44:55,955
Air Force One, this is Halo Flight
closing on your position.

987
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:59,041
- E.T. A: Two minutes.
- We may not be here in two minutes.

988
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:09,927
We're hit!

989
01:45:10,012 --> 01:45:13,139
Christ! Um, we're on fire.
We got an engine on fire.

990
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:16,309
- Number four engine is on fire.
- Pull the fire handle overhead.

991
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,394
Okay, I got it. I got it.

992
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:24,859
- Christ, we're rolling right.
- Left rudder. You have to compensate.

993
01:45:24,943 --> 01:45:27,737
- Should I pull back on number one engine?
- Negative. You'll slow down.

994
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:29,864
- You have to trim it out.
- How do I do that?

995
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:33,576
- Knob. Aft pedestal.
- Jesus Christ!

996
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:37,705
We got a red light here. Oh, Christ.
Looks like we're losing fuel.

997
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:43,210
Halo Flight,
everybody lock a bandit.

998
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:47,423
Stand by for max range,
and Fox three!

999
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,026
Kill one! Kill one!

1000
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:15,284
Kill two! Four more bandits
bearing 090. Halo Flight engage.

1001
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,707
Good guys are here.

1002
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:26,587
- Air Force One, bug out west. We'll cover you.
- You got it!

1003
01:46:29,007 --> 01:46:31,967
- Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail!
- Get him off my tail!

1004
01:46:34,137 --> 01:46:36,806
Missile away.
Air Force One, break left and climb!

1005
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,642
Shit!
Sir, we've lost countermeasures.

1006
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:44,271
This is Halo Two. They've lost
countermeasures. I'm goin' in.

1007
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:57,410
Two's down! Halo Two is down!
Air Force One, are you still with us?

1008
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:59,703
Yes, we're still here.

1009
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,837
- Bandit's above us. Bandit's above us!
- Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

1010
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:19,432
The last three MiGs
are bugging out, sir. We're clear!

1011
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,392
Yes!

1012
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:27,648
- Bob, are you still there?
- Yes, sir.
- We've a little problem here.

1013
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:30,484
- My rudder is sluggish.
- Let me take a look, sir.

1014
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:39,285
Oh, man. Sir, you're torn up
pretty bad out here.

1015
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:41,328
Do you have
any elevator control?

1016
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:45,291
Sluggish too.
And we're still losing fuel.

1017
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,501
Okay.

1018
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:52,798
We got a problem up here.
Sirs, Air Force One is badly hit.

1019
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:55,759
With the damage,
there's no way they can land.

1020
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:03,642
I'm sorry, sir.

1021
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:07,062
- Thanks for your help.
- I'll stay on your wing, sir.

1022
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:11,150
Take it straight and steady
until we figure out what to do.

1023
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:13,235
Sir...

1024
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:16,906
you did great.

1025
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:40,179
They can't control the plane. The engines
are failing, and they're losing fuel.

1026
01:48:40,263 --> 01:48:42,223
There must be something
we can do to help them.

1027
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:46,769
- General, is that our airstrip strike team?
- Yeah. Why?

1028
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:49,522
I just had a wild idea.

1029
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:52,066
Time is critical.
Start turning north.

1030
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:55,694
- You'll get more details en route.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,614
Change of orders acknowledged.

1032
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:05,079
Try to hold your heading, sir.

1033
01:49:05,163 --> 01:49:09,041
They'll be rejoining from the south
in about 25 minutes.

1034
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:12,253
- All right.
- We know it's risky.
- Understood.

1035
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,505
But we are all out of options.

1036
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:18,384
- Dad?
- Yeah, baby?

1037
01:49:18,468 --> 01:49:21,887
It'll be okay.
Everything's gonna work.

1038
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:39,572
Concerned Americans have gathered here
at the White House...

1039
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:44,368
to await word on the president and his family,
but CNN has learned that Air Force One...

1040
01:49:44,452 --> 01:49:47,871
is severely crippled
and virtually unlandable.

1041
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:51,250
Sources report that the first family
is still trapped on board...

1042
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:55,254
and a daring midair rescue operation
is said to be under way.

1043
01:49:58,133 --> 01:50:00,467
Air Force One, this is Liberty 2-4,
approaching on your left side.

1044
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:03,429
- Do you read?
- Air Force One, loud and clear.

1045
01:50:03,513 --> 01:50:06,390
Gibbs, they're here.
Get the door.

1046
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:09,268
- Yes, sir.
- We'll need 10,000 feet, 200 knots.

1047
01:50:09,352 --> 01:50:11,729
We gotta get her
slowed down now.

1048
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:16,317
Air Force One and Liberty 2-4,
this is AWACS Blue Star.

1049
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:19,028
We have you on radar contact.

1050
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:34,168
Liberty 2-4,
they're almost out of fuel.

1051
01:50:34,252 --> 01:50:37,838
Roger, Blue Star. Air Force One,
you've got to keep the wings level.

1052
01:50:37,922 --> 01:50:41,717
If the engines fail,
sacrifice altitude to maintain airspeed.

1053
01:50:47,557 --> 01:50:52,478
- Ready!
- Liberty 2-4, ramp leader.
First man is on his way.

1054
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:55,481
Back up. Easy.

1055
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:58,192
Air Force One, come left six.

1056
01:51:01,863 --> 01:51:05,741
- How's my speed?
- It's good. Everything's good.
See if you can hold it.

1057
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:09,536
A little more left, sir.
Three, two, stop.

1058
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:23,676
Take my arm!
Pull me in!

1059
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,136
Come on! Come on!

1060
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,559
- Unhook me!
- I got it! I got it!

1061
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:34,603
Good!

1062
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:39,900
Liberty locked in.
Where's the president?

1063
01:51:39,984 --> 01:51:42,403
Up in the cockpit.

1064
01:51:53,915 --> 01:51:57,042
- Just lost another engine.
- Liberty, we just lost another engine.

1065
01:51:57,127 --> 01:52:02,214
- Liberty 2-4, acknowledged.
- Sir, time to go.

1066
01:52:02,298 --> 01:52:05,467
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- I'll take care of that, sir.

1067
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:08,095
- Got it.
- Go!

1068
01:52:08,179 --> 01:52:11,932
Ramp to pilot.
Second P.J.'s on the way.

1069
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:24,278
- Mr President, this way.
- My family first.

1070
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:27,990
- Sir, I have orders
to take you off this aircraft.
- Them first.

1071
01:52:31,327 --> 01:52:33,746
Blue Star, the third parajumper
is boarding Air Force One.

1072
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:37,332
- Standing by for recovery.
- Roger. Moving into the receiver position.

1073
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:45,257
- Dad?
- You'll be all right, honey.

1074
01:52:45,341 --> 01:52:48,927
- Promise?
- Promise. Close your eyes.

1075
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:52,264
You can do it.
Just hold on tight.

1076
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:55,017
It's okay. Don't worry.

1077
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:03,984
- She's okay.
- Ah, Dad!

1078
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:09,072
- Hang on! Hang on!
- Ramp to pilot. We got her. We got her.

1079
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:12,534
Got her? Here you go.
Yeah. I got you.

1080
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:18,624
I'm right behind you.

1081
01:53:29,093 --> 01:53:31,804
- That's it. Come on.
- There, get your hand!

1082
01:53:31,888 --> 01:53:34,139
Just hang on! Hang on!

1083
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,309
- You're next, sir.
- Him next. He's wounded.
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:40,854
- No, you go.
- Come on, Shep. Come on, pal.

1085
01:53:47,278 --> 01:53:49,863
We've lost another engine.

1086
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:58,413
Air Force One, you're sinking too fast.
We only have time for one more retrieval.

1087
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:04,294
We're passing 3,000 feet.
Impact in less than two minutes.

1088
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:07,005
Get the president out of there!

1089
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:11,844
Right here! Right here!
Easy there. Hurry up!

1090
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:16,181
- He's on.
- Sir, get your harness ready!
It's time to go!

1091
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:19,434
- What about the other team?
- There's no time for the other team.

1092
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,980
- I can only take one more.
- No! We're all going!

1093
01:54:23,064 --> 01:54:26,942
- That's impossible, sir. I have to take you.
- Mr President...

1094
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:29,987
it's time to get you
off this plane.

1095
01:54:30,071 --> 01:54:32,114
Go, sir. Go!

1096
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:36,785
Please, go.

1097
01:54:45,461 --> 01:54:47,629
It was you?

1098
01:55:00,852 --> 01:55:04,062
- Give me the strap.
- I trusted you with my life.

1099
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:08,025
So will the next president.
Now, give it to me!

1100
01:55:10,945 --> 01:55:14,156
You have to release the cable.
We're descending through 1,200 feet.

1101
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:18,827
I'm getting off this plane!

1102
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:35,510
Seven hundred.

1103
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:39,640
Five hundred.
We have to pull up.

1104
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:12,297
Blue Star,
Air Force One is down.

1105
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:15,092
I repeat,
Air Force One is down.

1106
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:17,719
Liberty 2-4,
do you have the president?

1107
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:23,517
Shift your weight around!
You can do it!

1108
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:31,108
- Liberty, do you have the president?
- Stand by.

1109
01:56:31,192 --> 01:56:33,694
Wind him in! Wind him in!

1110
01:56:44,956 --> 01:56:48,834
- That's it!
- Hang on, sir! Hang on!

1111
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:51,878
We got him!

1112
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:56,883
Liberty 2-4 is changing call signs.

1113
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:59,344
Liberty 2-4 is now
Air Force One.

1114
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:12,983
Mr President,
welcome aboard, sir.

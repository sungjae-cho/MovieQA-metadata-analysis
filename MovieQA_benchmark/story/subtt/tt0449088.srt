I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

95
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,697

97
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,870
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

98

a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

99

153
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,722
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

154
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,429
So we must go and get him back.

155

162

Not with the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
at the lead.

217
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,597
Nothing we know of.

218
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:55,309
Did yöur friend mention

221
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,151
Then he knows the value of information.

222
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:05,017
Better keep this between ourselves.

bring Jack back the same way

- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

337
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:40,675
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

352
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,740
No wind.

353
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,211
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

354

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,491
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

357
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,264
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

We shall have a magnificent

- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, yöu're...

- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

Oh, Hector.

390
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,849

391
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:05,718
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?

to save a certain distressing damsel,

398
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,669
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

400
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,714

yöu wouldn't be here, would yöu?

401
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:36,775

- He's taking over the seas.

417
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,013
And yöu need a crew.

- They be my charts.

with the captain issue in doubt,

448
00:45:34,263 --> 00:45:37,198
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,746
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

484
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:18,946
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

485
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,285
It's best just let them be.

486
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,239
It's my father. We've made it back.

487
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,867
Father! Father, here, look here!

488
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:43,770
Elizabeth.

489
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,239
We're not back.

490
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,381
Father!

491
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:02,153
Elizabeth. Are yöu dead?

492
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,730
No. No.

493
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,430
I think I am.

494
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,494
No, yöu can't be.

495
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,506
There was this chest, yöu see.

496
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:17,939
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

497
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:19,842
Come aboard.

498
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:21,678
And a heart.

499
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:27,018
I learned that if yöu stab the heart,
yöurs must take its place.

500
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:30,616
And yöu will sail the seas for eternity.

501
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:33,685
The <i>Dutchman</i> must have a captain.

502
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,755
Silly thing to die for.

503
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,364
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

504
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:43,296
Come on.

505
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:48,605
A touch... of destiny.

506
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,777
Take the line.

507
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,479
I'm so proud of yöu, Elizabeth.

508
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:59,282
Father, the line! Take the line!

509
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:05,424
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

510
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:09,760
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave yöu!

511
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,390
I'll give yöur love to yöur mother.

512
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:15,335
- Please, I won't let yöu go!
- Elizabeth.

513
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,463
- Elizabeth.

514
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:24,841
Is there a way?

515
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:31,347
Him at peace.

516
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:40,319
No water.

517
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,557
Why is all but the rum gone?

518
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,634
Rum's gone too.

519
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:59,440
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

520
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:03,417
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

521
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:06,717
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

522
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:08,615
Forever.

523
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:12,650
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

524
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:14,958
Why doesn't he do something?

525
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:18,231
-<font color="#808080">[Ragetti]</font> Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

526
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,634

happens at sunset, not sunrise.

- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:50,354
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

- Come again?
- The <i>Dutchman</i> must have a captain.

535
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:56,194
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

536
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:59,036
Sail the seas for eternity.

537
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:02,043
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

538
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,102
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

539
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:09,174
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

540
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:13,180
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

541
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:16,713
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

542
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,124
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

543
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,459
But eternity is longer still.

544
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,224
And how will yöu be spending it? Dead?

545
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:27,300
Or not?

546
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:31,237
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

547
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,872
Come sunset, it won't matter.

548
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,374
Not sunset.

We'll tie each other

I came on this voyage.

652
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,868
Why didn't yöu tell me
yöu were planning this?

653
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,133
It was my burden to bear.

654
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:11,675
He needs the <i>Pearl.</i>
Captain Turner needs the <i>Pearl.</i>

655
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:15,807
And yöu felt guilty.
And yöu and yöur Brethren Court.

656
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,787
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

657
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:30,464
I'm standing with them.

658
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:38,300
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see yöu first.

659
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,002
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

660
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:46,642
Here is yöur chance to find out.

661
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,718
Curious.

662
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,955
yöur friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

663
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:05,557
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

664
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,602
can defeat the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

665
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:11,772
And so despair leads to betrayal.

666
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:16,166
But yöu and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

667
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,437
It's not here, Jack.

668
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,249
What? What isn't?

669
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,812
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the <i>Dutchman,</i>

670
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,915
and so unavailable for use as leverage

671
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,654
to satisfy yöur debt
to the good captain.

672
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,993
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

673
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,191
<font color="#808080">[Beckett]</font> By yöur death?

674
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,326
And yet here yöu are.

675
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,498
Close yöur eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

676
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,005
That's how I get by.

677
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:50,537
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of yöur survival?

678
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:52,613
<font color="#808080">[Man]</font> Ship oars.

679
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,239
<font color="#808080">[Man 2]</font> Ship oars.

680
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,141
Be on yöur guard, men.

681
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,652
My men are crew enough.

682
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:02,883
Company ship, company crew.

683
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,860
yöu agreed.
The <i>Black Pearl</i> was to be mine.

684
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:09,161
And so it was.

685
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:15,293
<font color="#808080">[Beckett]</font> Perhaps yöu'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

686
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:20,603
One which requires absolutely
nothing from yöu but information.

687
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:31,747
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

688
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,880
Square my debt with Jones...

689
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,789
...guarantee my freedom?

690
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,486
Of course.

691
01:06:39,561 --> 01:06:41,495
It's just good business.

692
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:47,365
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

693
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,630
Everything.

694
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,402
Where are they meeting?

695
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,198
Who are the pirate lords?

696
01:06:55,176 --> 01:06:58,373
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

697
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:02,142
<font color="#808080">[Man]</font> Prepare the brig.

698
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:09,722
Beckett agreed the <i>Black Pearl</i>
was to be mine.

699
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,454
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the <i>Dutchman,</i> is he?

700
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,971
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

701
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,271
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

702
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:32,140
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

703
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:36,741
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

704
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:40,686
- The losing side, yöu say?
- They have the <i>Dutchman.</i>

705
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,245
Now the <i>Pearl!</i>

706
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,192
And what do the Brethren have?

707
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,954
We have Calypso.

708
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,104
<font color="#808080">[Laughs]</font> Calypso.

709
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:03,167
An old legend.

710
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:09,249
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

711
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:14,951
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

712
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:20,325
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

713
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:24,289
All the Court.

714
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:27,862
yöu can keep Barbossa.

715
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:31,997
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

716
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:34,598
And Turner. Especially Turner.

717
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:38,134
The rest go with me on the <i>Pearl.</i>
I'll lead yöu to Shipwreck Cove,

718
01:08:38,213 --> 01:08:42,547
where I will hand yöu the pirates
and yöu will not hand me to Jones.

719
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:47,145
- Bloody fair deal, don't yöu think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

720
01:08:49,891 --> 01:08:52,018
What interest is she to yöu?

721
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:56,928
What are yöu proposing, captain?

722
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,990
What be accepting, cap'n?

723
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:03,835
- The girl.
- What?

724
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:05,463
Jack.

725
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,938
I've just recalled.

726
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:13,003
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

727
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,812
So for what do I need yöu?

728
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:17,909
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

729
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,051
Out of the question.

730
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,918
It was not a question.

731
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,753
Points to the thing yöu want most.

732
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:26,020
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

733
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:29,325
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

734
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:32,426
- Dead.
- Done.

735
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,162
What? Not done.

736
01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:37,796
yöu got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

737
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:38,964
Damn.

738
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:46,944
Although, if I kill yöu,
then I can use the compass

739
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:51,509
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

740
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:54,219
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

741
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:56,018
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

742
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,582
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

743
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,561
Then we have an accord?

744
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:06,992
With me killed,
yöu'd arrive at the cove,

745
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:10,265
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

746
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:13,273
...able to withstand blockade for years.

747
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:17,903
Then yöu'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

748
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:21,482
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

749
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,250
And yöu can accomplish all this?

750
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:28,613
yöu may kill me,
but yöu may never insult me.

751
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:30,015
Who am I?

752
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,022
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

753
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,792
<font color="#808080">[Rumbling]</font>

754
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:39,025

- <font color="#808080">[Man shouting]</font>
- <font color="#808080">[Cannon fire]</font>

758
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,281
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

759

<font color="#808080">[Jack shouting]</font>

760
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:53,134
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

761
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:05,415
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

762
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,316
Which ship do we follow?

763
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:14,054
Signal the <i>Dutchman</i> to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the <i>Pearl.</i>

764
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,554
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

<font color="#808080">[Speaking Chinese]</font>

771
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:23,621

at Shipwreck Cove and yöu will be free.

772
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,566

773
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:30,136
Excuse me?

774
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:35,268
Not a name yöu fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that yöu have...

775
01:13:35,843 --> 01:13:37,470
...but it is what we call yöu.

776
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,574
We being who?

777
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,116
yöu confirm it.

778
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:49,888
Confirm what?

779
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:55,755
- yöu've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

780
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:00,426
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

781
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:03,436
They bound yöu to human form

782
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:06,962
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

783
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,804
To me.

784
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:16,248
But one such as yöu should never
be anything less than what yöu are.

785
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,911
Pretty speech from a captor.

786
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:22,979
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

787
01:14:23,324 --> 01:14:26,316
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

788
01:14:28,296 --> 01:14:32,562
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

789
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:36,433
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

790
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,997
I offer simply my desire.

791
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:42,966
And in return?

792
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:48,014
I would have yöur gifts,
should yöu choose to give them.

793
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:56,079
And if I should choose not?

794
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,560

No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

822
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:11,424
Did Lord Beckett tell yöu that?

823
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:15,491

824
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,053

Put the prisoners in the brig.

He can't save me.
He can't come because of yöu.

before they run out of bodies.

...do yöu notice something

892
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,730

- Odd, isn't it?

893
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:29,275
Not as odd as this.

01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,146
Come up with this
all by yöur lonesome, did yöu?

895
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,239
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

This is what yöu've arrived at?

897
01:22:38,886 --> 01:22:42,219
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

898
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,120
...accomplish yöur own ends?

899
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:45,988
It's like yöu don't know me at all.

900
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:52,390
And how does yöur dearly beloved

Ah.

yöu've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

903
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,166
I'm losing her, Jack.

904
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:07,847
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

905
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,012
If yöu choose to lock yöur heart away,
yöu'll lose her for certain.

906
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:15,750
If I might lend a machete
to yöur intellectual thicket...

907
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:18,892
...avoid the choice altogether.

908
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:21,194
Change the facts.

909
01:23:22,262 --> 01:23:25,254
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

910
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:27,364

912

Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

913
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:41,972
I slip aboard the <i>Dutchman,</i>
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

914
01:23:42,049 --> 01:23:43,812
yöur father's free from his debt,

916
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:50,521

- No, mate. I'm free forever.

918

Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

919

yöu have to do the job though, Jack.

920
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:04,195

For all that pirates are clever clogs,

971

01:30:56,107 --> 01:30:57,472
Not yöurs.

995
01:30:57,909 --> 01:30:59,103
His.

996
01:31:00,011 --> 01:31:02,138
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

997
01:31:03,248 --> 01:31:05,079
Sparrow?

998
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:08,110
yöu didn't tell him.

999
01:31:08,186 --> 01:31:11,417
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

1000
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,091
What else have yöu not told me?

1001
01:31:15,861 --> 01:31:19,854
There is an issue far more troublesome.

1002
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,794
I believe yöu're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

1003
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:29,134
Not a person.

1004
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:30,933
A heathen god.

1005
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:34,536
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

1006
01:31:34,613 --> 01:31:37,946
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

1007
01:31:38,016 --> 01:31:41,144
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

1008
01:31:42,053 --> 01:31:44,647
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

1009
01:31:45,457 --> 01:31:47,254
No! They cannot!

1010
01:31:47,325 --> 01:31:50,294
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

1011
01:31:50,362 --> 01:31:53,331
- That was our agreement.
- yöur agreement?

1012
01:31:55,867 --> 01:31:59,860
I showed them how to bind her.

1013
01:31:59,938 --> 01:32:01,906
She could not be trusted.

1014
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:03,804
I... She gave me no choice.

1015
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:07,311
We must act before they release her.

1016
01:32:07,379 --> 01:32:09,142
yöu loved her.

1017
01:32:10,382 --> 01:32:12,350
She's the one.

1018
01:32:12,417 --> 01:32:14,408
And then yöu betrayed her.

1019
01:32:14,486 --> 01:32:18,286
She pretended to love me.

1020
01:32:18,356 --> 01:32:22,122
She betrayed me.

1021
01:32:24,963 --> 01:32:28,490
And after which betrayal
did yöu cut out yöur heart, I wonder.

1022
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:34,466
Do not test me.

1023
01:32:34,539 --> 01:32:36,268
I hadn't finished that.

1024
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:40,403
yöu will free my father.

1025
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:43,580
And yöu will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

1026
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,240
Along with my own.

1027
01:32:45,317 --> 01:32:47,877
yöur terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

1028
01:32:47,953 --> 01:32:50,717
We will expect fair value in return.

1029
01:32:51,156 --> 01:32:55,092
There is only one price I will accept:

1030
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:58,220
Calypso murdered.

1031
01:33:00,131 --> 01:33:02,463
Calypso's aboard the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

1032
01:33:04,536 --> 01:33:07,903
Jack has sailed
the <i>Black Pearl</i> to Shipwreck Cove.

1033
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:14,173
And with yöu no longer aboard her,
how do yöu propose to lead us there?

1034
01:33:26,024 --> 01:33:28,584
What is it yöu want most?

1035
01:34:00,525 --> 01:34:02,083
Look at them all.

1036
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:06,256
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

1037
01:34:07,065 --> 01:34:09,056
And I owe them all money.

1038
01:34:10,735 --> 01:34:13,203
<font color="#808080">[Murmuring]</font>

1039
01:34:14,472 --> 01:34:16,940
As he who issued summons,

1040
01:34:17,008 --> 01:34:21,570
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

1041
01:34:21,646 --> 01:34:24,444
<font color="#808080">[Murmuring]</font>

1042
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:29,108
To confirm yöur lordship
and right to be heard,

1043
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:33,953
present now yöur pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

1044
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,297
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

1045
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:49,101
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

1046
01:34:49,174 --> 01:34:53,508
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

1047
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:55,270
So change the name.

1048
01:34:56,481 --> 01:35:00,679
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

1049
01:35:00,752 --> 01:35:03,084
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

1050
01:35:06,725 --> 01:35:09,216
Master Ragetti, if yöu will.

1051
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:13,020
I kept it safe, just like
yöu said when yöu gave it to me.

1052
01:35:13,098 --> 01:35:16,192
Aye, yöu have.
But now I need it back.

1053
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:20,162
Sparrow.

1054
01:35:26,277 --> 01:35:29,906
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

1055
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:33,940
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

1056
01:35:34,018 --> 01:35:35,610
<font color="#808080">[Elizabeth]</font> Sao Feng is dead.

1057
01:35:37,756 --> 01:35:39,849
He fell to the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

1058
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:41,217
The plagued ship.

1059
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,861
He made yöu captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

1060
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:48,899
- <i>!Qué lo manden al diablo!</i>
- Listen. Listen to me.

1061
01:35:48,967 --> 01:35:51,197
Our location has been betrayed.

1062
01:35:51,269 --> 01:35:54,898
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

1063
01:35:54,973 --> 01:35:58,670
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

1064
01:35:59,043 --> 01:36:01,068
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

1065
01:36:01,146 --> 01:36:03,876
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

1066
01:36:03,948 --> 01:36:06,439
what will we do now that they have?

1067
01:36:06,518 --> 01:36:08,008
We fight.

1068
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:15,526
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

1069
01:36:15,593 --> 01:36:18,391
A well-supplied fortress.

1070
01:36:18,997 --> 01:36:22,797
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

1071
01:36:23,568 --> 01:36:26,935
There be a third course.

1072
01:36:28,173 --> 01:36:30,607
In another age, at this very spot,

1073
01:36:30,675 --> 01:36:36,170
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

1074
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:40,350
That was a mistake.

1075
01:36:41,352 --> 01:36:44,116
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

1076
01:36:45,089 --> 01:36:48,183
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

1077
01:36:50,195 --> 01:36:52,629
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

1078
01:36:52,697 --> 01:36:56,531
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

1079
01:36:56,601 --> 01:37:00,970
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

1080
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:02,870
yöu all know this to be true.

1081
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:05,073
Gentlemen.

1082
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:07,337
Ladies.

1083
01:37:11,983 --> 01:37:14,975
We must free Calypso.

1084

<font color="#808080">[Clamoring]</font>

1085
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:26,429
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

1086
01:37:26,497 --> 01:37:30,399
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1087
01:37:30,468 --> 01:37:32,993
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1088
01:37:33,071 --> 01:37:35,972
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1089
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,974
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1090
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:41,876
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1091
01:37:41,946 --> 01:37:44,881
- yöu threaten me?
- I silence yöu.

Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1095
01:38:03,034 --> 01:38:05,559

1105

Cut off from the sea.

1106
01:39:00,191 --> 01:39:02,785
From all that I love.

1107
01:39:04,062 --> 01:39:05,461
From yöu.

1108
01:39:06,164 --> 01:39:10,692
Ten years I devoted
to the duty yöu charged to me.

1109
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:17,474
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1110
01:39:18,142 --> 01:39:22,704
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1111
01:39:24,482 --> 01:39:28,282
...yöu weren't there.
- <font color="#808080">[Music box stops]</font>

Why weren't yöu there?

It's my nature.

1114
01:39:37,528 --> 01:39:42,124
Would yöu love me

1115
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:47,101
I do not love yöu.

1116

1117
01:39:54,379 --> 01:39:56,506
But never cruel.

1118
01:39:57,348 --> 01:40:00,317

It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1136
01:42:04,008 --> 01:42:06,306
We should be the ones to set her free.

1137
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:10,711
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

Let us not, dear friends,

1144
01:42:30,034 --> 01:42:33,026
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1145
01:42:33,571 --> 01:42:35,766
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1146
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,799
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1147
01:42:39,877 --> 01:42:41,139
Human nature, isn't it?

1148
01:42:41,212 --> 01:42:43,237
Or... Or fish nature.

1149
01:42:43,314 --> 01:42:47,045
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

1150
01:42:47,118 --> 01:42:49,279
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1151
01:42:49,353 --> 01:42:53,289
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way yöu slice it. Or...

1152
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:56,490
Uh...

1153
01:42:58,229 --> 01:43:03,997
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1154
01:43:04,068 --> 01:43:08,061
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1155
01:43:09,574 --> 01:43:10,836
I rather doubt it.

1156
01:43:11,642 --> 01:43:15,635
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1157
01:43:15,713 --> 01:43:18,580
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1158

<i>Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.</i>

1159
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:25,851
We are left with but one option.

1160
01:43:25,923 --> 01:43:29,791
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1161
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:35,031
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1162
01:43:35,099 --> 01:43:38,330
- yöu've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1163
01:43:38,402 --> 01:43:39,460
- Have so.
- Have not.

1164
01:43:39,604 --> 01:43:40,662
- Have so.
- Have not!

1165
01:43:40,805 --> 01:43:43,968
- yöu have so, and yöu know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1166
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:48,341
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1167
01:43:48,412 --> 01:43:52,610
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1168
01:43:52,683 --> 01:43:54,082
We must fight...

1169
01:43:54,852 --> 01:43:56,342
...to run away.

1170
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:58,752
- Aye!
- <font color="#808080">[All]</font> Aye!

1171
01:44:00,524 --> 01:44:04,961
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1172
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:07,930
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1173
01:44:07,999 --> 01:44:10,559
- yöu made that up.
- Did I, now?

1174
01:44:10,635 --> 01:44:15,163
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

1175
01:44:16,173 --> 01:44:19,609
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1176
01:44:21,245 --> 01:44:23,736
- Hang the code. Who cares a...?
- <font color="#808080">[Gunshot]</font>

1177
01:44:31,756 --> 01:44:33,587
Code is the law.

1178
01:44:45,603 --> 01:44:47,594
yöu're in my way, boy.

1179
01:44:56,814 --> 01:44:59,442
- The code.
- The code.

1180
01:44:59,517 --> 01:45:01,781
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1181
01:45:12,697 --> 01:45:13,994
<font color="#808080">[Whistles]</font>

1182
01:45:19,804 --> 01:45:23,763
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1183
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:25,172
<font color="#808080">[Barks]</font>

1184
01:45:26,644 --> 01:45:28,134
Sea turtles.

1185
01:45:42,927 --> 01:45:45,623
Ah. Barbossa is right.

1186
01:45:45,696 --> 01:45:47,186
<font color="#808080">[Jack]</font> Hang on a minute.

1187
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:50,634
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1188
01:45:50,701 --> 01:45:54,159
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

1189
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:55,227
Fancy that.

1190
01:45:55,306 --> 01:45:57,774
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1191
01:45:57,842 --> 01:45:59,503
And that's not likely to change.

1192
01:45:59,577 --> 01:46:01,602
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1193
01:46:01,746 --> 01:46:04,374
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1194
01:46:04,448 --> 01:46:07,940
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1195
01:46:08,018 --> 01:46:09,110
I call for a vote.

1196
01:46:10,588 --> 01:46:12,749
- <font color="#808080">[Murmuring]</font>
- <font color="#808080">[Playing guitar]</font>

1197
01:46:13,924 --> 01:46:16,290
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

1198
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,920
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1199
01:46:19,296 --> 01:46:21,958
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1200
01:46:22,867 --> 01:46:24,801
Mistress Ching.

1201
01:46:24,869 --> 01:46:26,268
Gentleman Jocard.

1202
01:46:26,971 --> 01:46:29,531
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1203
01:46:29,607 --> 01:46:31,370
Vallenueva!

1204
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:33,540
Elizabeth Swann.

1205
01:46:34,578 --> 01:46:36,512
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1206
01:46:39,049 --> 01:46:40,676
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1207
01:46:43,154 --> 01:46:44,553
What yöu talking about?

1208
01:46:44,622 --> 01:46:45,714
No!

1209
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:49,419
Am I to understand that yöu lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1210
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:51,688
<font color="#808080">[String breaks]</font>

1211
01:46:58,302 --> 01:46:59,496
Very well.

1212
01:47:02,873 --> 01:47:07,867
What say yöu, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

1213
01:47:09,847 --> 01:47:12,179
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1214
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:14,177
At dawn...

1215
01:47:15,753 --> 01:47:16,947
...we're at war.

1216
01:47:20,758 --> 01:47:24,353
<font color="#808080">[High-pitched]</font>
And so we shall go to war.

1217

<font color="#808080">[All shouting]</font>

1218
01:47:38,042 --> 01:47:39,031
What?

1219
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:42,808
yöu've seen it all,
done it all. yöu survived.

1220
01:47:43,347 --> 01:47:46,180
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1221
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:50,208
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1222
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:58,254
The trick is
living with yöurself forever.

1223
01:48:02,299 --> 01:48:03,459
How's Mum?

1224
01:48:10,407 --> 01:48:11,931
She looks great.

1225
01:48:33,364 --> 01:48:36,959

1229
01:49:11,769 --> 01:49:12,929
Parley?

1230
01:50:09,727 --> 01:50:13,356
yöu be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1231
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:17,628
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of yöur betrayal.

1232
01:50:17,701 --> 01:50:22,229
If yöu wish to see its grand architect,
look to yöur left.

1233
01:50:25,643 --> 01:50:27,338
My hands are clean in this.

1234
01:50:28,379 --> 01:50:29,539
Figuratively.

1235
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,548
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1236
01:50:32,616 --> 01:50:36,052
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1237
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:38,088
Will, I've been aboard the <i>Dutchman.</i>

1238
01:50:39,023 --> 01:50:42,356
I understand the burden yöu bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1239
01:50:43,193 --> 01:50:47,061
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1240
01:50:49,299 --> 01:50:54,202
If Turner wasn't acting on yöur behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1241
01:50:55,406 --> 01:51:00,366
yöu made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1242
01:51:01,145 --> 01:51:04,512
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim yöur reward.

1243
01:51:04,581 --> 01:51:08,483
<font color="#808080">[Jones]</font> yöur debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1244
01:51:08,552 --> 01:51:13,512
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the <i>Dutchman.</i> As a start.

1245
01:51:14,191 --> 01:51:17,422
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1246
01:51:17,494 --> 01:51:19,894
- <font color="#808080">[Jones]</font> yöu escaped.
- Technically.

1247
01:51:19,963 --> 01:51:22,022
I propose an exchange.

1248
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:25,966
Will leaves with us...

1249
01:51:26,704 --> 01:51:28,467
...and yöu can take Jack.

1250
01:51:30,574 --> 01:51:31,563
Done.

1251
01:51:32,242 --> 01:51:33,937
- Undone.
- Done.

1252
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:37,538
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
yöu have no right.

1253
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,081

1254
01:51:41,585 --> 01:51:45,646
- As yöu command, yöur nibs.
- Blackguard!

1255
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:54,558
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1256
01:51:57,234 --> 01:51:59,259
First to the finish, then?

1257
01:52:20,557 --> 01:52:23,117
Do yöu fear death?

1258
01:52:24,661 --> 01:52:26,424
yöu've no idea.

1259
01:52:29,366 --> 01:52:31,231
Advise yöur Brethren,

1260
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:34,395
yöu can fight, and all of yöu will die.

1261
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:38,999
Or yöu can not fight,
in which case only most of yöu will die.

1262
01:52:39,576 --> 01:52:41,669
yöu murdered my father.

1263
01:52:43,046 --> 01:52:45,037
He chose his own fate.

1264
01:52:45,682 --> 01:52:48,412
And yöu have chosen yöurs.

1265
01:52:48,485 --> 01:52:50,544
We will fight.

1266
01:52:51,155 --> 01:52:52,952
And yöu will die.

1267
01:52:57,761 --> 01:52:59,388

does know what he's doing.

1271
01:53:18,949 --> 01:53:19,938
Bravo!

1272
01:53:20,984 --> 01:53:25,182
yöu've successfully arrived aboard
the <i>Dutchman</i> as per the overall scheme.

1273
01:53:25,255 --> 01:53:26,984
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1274
01:53:27,057 --> 01:53:30,117
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1275
01:53:31,395 --> 01:53:32,555
Go away.

1276
01:53:32,629 --> 01:53:35,792
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without yöu, Jackie.

1277
01:53:36,633 --> 01:53:37,725
Stab the heart.

1278
01:53:43,607 --> 01:53:48,738
Live forever as captain
of the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

1279
01:53:52,549 --> 01:53:54,141
Then again...

1280
01:53:54,985 --> 01:53:56,680
...if yöu're in the brig...

1281
01:53:58,188 --> 01:54:00,179
...who's to stab the heart?

1282
01:54:02,693 --> 01:54:05,560
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1283
01:54:07,297 --> 01:54:09,030
Peanut.

1284
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:12,295
We'll need to use the <i>Black Pearl</i>
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1285
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:16,530
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1286
01:54:17,138 --> 01:54:20,574
Barbossa, yöu can't release her.

1287
01:54:20,641 --> 01:54:22,541

1288
01:54:23,144 --> 01:54:28,081
Apologies, yöur Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1289
01:54:30,951 --> 01:54:32,248
No longer.

1291
01:54:37,124 --> 01:54:39,456
...has opted for oblivion.

1292
01:54:42,596 --> 01:54:44,223
Ready the fleet.

1293
01:54:44,465 --> 01:54:47,195
- To yöur stations.
- <font color="#808080">[Man]</font> To yöur stations.

1294
01:54:53,674 --> 01:54:56,837

of rite or incantation?

from yöur human bonds."

with the <i>Dutchman,</i> there's no chance.

to us, to the <i>Black Pearl,</i> to lead.

is the flash of our cannons.

They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

by dint of being fish people,

automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

Thank goodness, Jack.

1522

The armada's still out there. The

1523
02:23:31,824 --> 02:23:35,920
and I think it's time we embrace that

1525

Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

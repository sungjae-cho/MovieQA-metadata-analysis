1
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,966
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:40,077
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:44,654
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:50,022
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,663
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,092
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:57,234
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:59,802
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,498
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,337
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,440
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,675
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:16,082
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,291
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,166
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,642
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,643
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,176
Harry.

19
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,582
Harry!

20
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,688
Are you all right?

21
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:57,486
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:01,029
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,427
Last night.

24
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,830
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,265
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,962
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,436
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:13,941
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:23,451
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:27,187
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,882
Keep up!

32
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,294
Arthur!

33
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,456
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:40,002
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:45,837
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:48,535
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:49,873
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,709
This way.

39
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,818
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,718
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,688
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,991
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,064
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,430
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,734
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:20,074
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:22,736
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:24,279
Time to go!

49
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,041
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:30,244
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:31,513
...three!

52
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,693
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:46,462
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:01,076
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,621
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,555
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:17,325
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,966
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,771
Look!

60
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,942
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,253
Blimey!

62
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:39,287
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,856
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,322
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,188
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,893
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,228
What?

68
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:03,546
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,012
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,674
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,720
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,357
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:15,788
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:19,223
I love magic.

75
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,971
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:41,379
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:42,985
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,950
If it rains...

79
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,489
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,626
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:54,060
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,427
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,694
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,697
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,906
While you can.

86
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:23,988
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,027
Come on!

88
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,234
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,232
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,810
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,246
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,690
Who's that?

93
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:59,487
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:05,059
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,035
Krum!

96
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,938
Yes!

97
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,585
Good evening!

98
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:26,113
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,383
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:33,760
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:39,801
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:41,803
Let the match...

103
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,765
...begin!

104
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:52,075
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,585
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,351
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,588
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:09,665
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,233
He's an artist.

110
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,666
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,237
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,998
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:20,406
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,240
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,143
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,275
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,580
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,056
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:38,593
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,425
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,729
Go!

122
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,732
Harry!

123
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:02,712
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:06,115
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,261
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,523
Harry!

127
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:28,233
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:32,101
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,042
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,837
What is that?

131
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:43,011
Stupefy!

132
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,518
Stop!

133
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,919
That's my son!

134
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,621
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,092
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:54,424
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,590
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,792
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,460
What crime?

140
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,129
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:04,467
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:09,511
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,910
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,981
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:18,746
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,588
There!

147
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,056
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,227
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:26,996
Who?

150
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,194
I don't know.

151
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:33,030
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,278
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:56,519
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,193
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,561
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:06,532
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:10,064
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:14,234
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,913
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,914
Thank you.

161
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,751
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,924
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,854
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,056
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,164
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,099
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:44,070
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:48,200
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,251
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

170
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,079
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:01,023
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:05,151
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:16,801
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,278
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,451
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:35,351
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:39,754
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:43,087
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,089
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,521
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,097
What is it?

182
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:55,769
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:01,912
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,138
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,741
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:10,080
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:12,381
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:16,083
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,955
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:21,063
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,166
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,303
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:30,938
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:35,135
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:39,305
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,420
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,604
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:27,688
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,698
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,701
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,318
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:58,495 --> 00:18:59,962
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,995
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,341
Albus.

205
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,238
Igor.

206
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:31,521
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:34,220
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:37,925
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:40,366
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,237
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,142
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,144
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,652
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:06,454
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:10,924
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:15,299
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:19,431
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:20,866
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:25,277
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,814
To explain all this...

221
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:30,613
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,949
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,101
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,071
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,702
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:01,509
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:17,063
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,326
Thank you.

229
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:26,707
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:30,136
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,055
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:42,124
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:45,261
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,160
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,029
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:54,796
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:58,703
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,529
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:23,999
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:27,069
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:30,331
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,671
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:37,605
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:42,741
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,971
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,543
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:18,687
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:21,289
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:25,918
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:27,859
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,763
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,799
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:42,674
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,545
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,947
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,249
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:56,153
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:59,784
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:02,124
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,767
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:07,233
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,396
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,871
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:18,704
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,110
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:21,615
Stand.

267
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,551
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:30,591
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:32,423
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,895
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,962
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,927
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:50,877
Hello.

274
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,211
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,345
Engorgio.

276
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:01,384
Imperio!

277
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,230
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,065
If she bites...

279
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:18,096
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,441
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,213
Get off!

282
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,414
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:32,987
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,357
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:51,403
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:55,568
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,976
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,082
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,409
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:07,451
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,982
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,718
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,886
Up.

294
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:19,800
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,332
There's the...

296
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,507
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:28,542
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:30,372
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,248
The torture curse.

300
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:38,414
Crucio!

301
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:54,934
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:16,549
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:20,326
No?

304
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,658
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,961
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,235
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,176
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:09,540
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:13,740
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:17,080
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:19,848
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:24,119
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:28,530
Neville?

314
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:30,131
Son?

315
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,127
You all right?

316
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:36,470
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,012
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:08,935
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,045
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,852
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:31,653
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:33,762
Yes!

323
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,866
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:41,094
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,432
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:47,132
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,279
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:52,244
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,848
So?

330
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:59,047
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:02,214
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:06,658
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:10,389
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,398
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,739
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,075
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:22,871
Yes!

338
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,803
Ready?

339
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,245
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,763
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:45,167
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:47,826
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:49,437
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:56,273
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,846
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:32,875
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:39,153
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:41,449
The champion selection.

349
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,689
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:35,042
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,236
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:50,783
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:05,240
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:09,606
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,112
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,442
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,814
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,247
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,983
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:01,557
No. No.

361
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,362
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,290
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,231
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,929
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,030
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,392
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,540
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:19,698
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,070
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,109
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,440
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,946
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:30,017
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:32,683
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,255
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,553
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:40,719
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:43,889
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,230
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:50,497
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,573
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,140
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:03,080
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,816
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,956
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,786
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:43,851
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:47,026
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:49,187
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:52,425
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:54,893
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:57,539
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:57,707 --> 00:37:00,540
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,144
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:07,305
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:11,419
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:15,182
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:18,356
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,689
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,490
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:26,332
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,966
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,373
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,111
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,473
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:42,678
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,612
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,300
How did you do it?

409
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:08,403
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,877
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:14,448
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,509
Okay?

413
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:19,177
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

414
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:22,882
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,564
I didn't put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:32,832
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

417
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:39,064
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:40,470
It just did.

419
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,902
Okay?

420
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,484
Piss off.

421
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:10,972
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,900
Hello.

423
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:17,337
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:20,405
I write for the Daily Prophet.

425
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:25,716
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

426
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,086
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:32,455
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,120
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:39,530
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

430
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:42,728
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:47,539
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,201
So who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,110
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:10,194
This is cozy.

435
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:12,461
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:15,133
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,102
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:19,832
No.

439
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,200
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,279
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

441
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:26,938
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:30,085
- About to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:33,518
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,283
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,791
...in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:41,320
Concerned?

447
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:45,331
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,366
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:50,362
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:53,133
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

451
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,071
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,476
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:01,412
No, I didn't enter.

454
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,176
Of course you didn't.

455
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:07,081
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:10,916
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:15,858
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,829
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,834
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:24,598
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:30,671
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

462
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,311
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

463
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,746
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

464
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:11,148
...and she's too easily recognized.

465
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,187
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

466
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:18,521
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

467
00:42:18,694 --> 00:42:20,457
And make sure you're alone.

468
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:22,119
Sirius.

469
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:23,788
P. S:

470
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,763
The bird bites.

471
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:37,545
Sirius?

472
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,330
Harry Potter, age 12...

473
00:42:56,499 --> 00:42:59,468
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

474
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:02,229
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

475
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:03,963
...and choking back tears...

476
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:22,049
Sirius. How...?

477
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,715
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,829
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:29,464
No!

480
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,328
I had to ask.

481
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,301
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,906
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,566
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

484
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,935
No.

485
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:48,578
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,048
And what was that?

487
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:53,848
He wanted...

488
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:55,684
...me.

489
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:00,592
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:04,025
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,027
Yes.

492
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:07,760
It's just a dream.

493
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:09,937
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,564
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:17,735
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

496
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:19,005
What are you saying?

497
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:23,447
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:28,022
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:33,588
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,493
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:40,669 --> 00:44:42,967
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,098
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:50,768
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

504
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,716
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:01,353
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:04,584
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

507
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,853
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:09,398 --> 00:45:12,731
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,288
Amazing.

510
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:45,961
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,934
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:48,804 --> 00:45:51,796
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

513
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:55,137
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,374
It's already been through enough people.

515
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,640
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,449
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,713
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,220
Go.

519
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,324
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,493
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

521
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:22,102
Is that right? Well, you...

522
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:23,329
What?

523
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:31,379
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

524
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:37,152
Dean was told by Parvati that...

525
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:40,617
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,457
Hagrid's looking for you.

527
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:46,018
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

528
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,836
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

529
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:01,602
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,176
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:05,540
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,750
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,185
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,317
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:17,692
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:27,668
Hagrid?

537
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,473
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

538
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:43,416
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:47,316
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,151
...you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,294
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,759
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:59,663
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,492
...exhilarated.

545
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:04,904
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:15,484 --> 00:48:17,247
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,527
Dragons?

548
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,185
That's the first task?

549
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:30,622
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,926
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,505
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:43,000
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:46,145
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:47,649 --> 00:48:49,674
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

555
00:48:49,852 --> 00:48:53,379
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,988
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:56,925 --> 00:48:58,324
No, he didn't.

558
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,926
He didn't tell me a thing.

559
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:13,967
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:18,139
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

561
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:20,975
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

562
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,711
Like the badge?

563
00:49:24,286 --> 00:49:26,015
Excuse me.

564
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:31,659
Harry.

565
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:34,195
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:35,853
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:38,697
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:41,859
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

569
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:46,933
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,237
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,437
Are you serious?

572
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,241
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

573
00:49:56,418 --> 00:49:58,682
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:58,854 --> 00:50:00,321
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

575
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:02,980
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:06,184
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:08,795
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:10,965
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,193
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:16,200
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:18,635
- You think so?
- I know so.

582
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,138
Anything else?

583
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,801
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

584
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:29,776
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:32,952
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:36,318
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:41,829
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,125
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:50,094
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,600
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

591
00:50:55,777 --> 00:50:58,678
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:02,681
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,580
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

594
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:07,654
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

595
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,820
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

596
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:20,401
Stand still! Stand still!

597
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,575
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

598
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:35,683
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:37,716
Professor!

600
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,447
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:44,319
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

602
00:51:44,493 --> 00:51:48,293
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:50,658
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:55,659
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:58,239
Away!

606
00:52:01,343 --> 00:52:03,538
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,839
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,744
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:48,555
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:52,728 --> 00:52:55,196
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

611
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:57,389
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,361
Now...

613
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:03,869
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:10,074
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

615
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:13,036
Sit.

616
00:53:16,752 --> 00:53:18,151
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,314
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:24,949
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:26,094 --> 00:53:27,356
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:30,493
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,560
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:36,897
...but Karkaroff's is not.

623
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:38,903
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:39,074 --> 00:53:42,601
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

625
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:48,940
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:51,210
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:52,788 --> 00:53:54,153
I don't know.

628
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:57,120
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

629
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:01,319
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:05,125
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:13,040
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,369
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,479
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

634
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:21,514
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:23,173
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:26,248
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:28,689
Your attention, please.

638
00:54:28,924 --> 00:54:31,518
This is a great day for all of us.

639
00:54:34,963 --> 00:54:39,195
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

640
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:42,063
Please keep your seats at all times.

641
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,967
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

642
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,576
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,439
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

644
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:53,672
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

645
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:59,385
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

646
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,385
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:05,694 --> 00:55:08,185
Young love.

648
00:55:08,897 --> 00:55:10,159
How...

649
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:13,931
...stirring.

650
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,768
If everything goes unfortunately today...

651
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,705
...you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:25,108
You have no business here.

653
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,305
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:29,344
...and friends.

655
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:36,318
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,259
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,628
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:50,033
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:52,332
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,303
Sorry, I'll just go.

661
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,069
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:57,445 --> 00:55:59,675
Champions, in a circle around me.

663
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:02,942
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:03,118 --> 00:56:07,054
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:09,656
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:15,389
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:21,366
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,239
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:35,114
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:37,575
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

671
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:40,016
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

672
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:45,825
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:47,996 --> 00:56:51,124
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:54,359
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,004
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:58,662
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,832
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,502
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,011
Any questions?

680
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,711
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,719
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

682
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,164
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

683
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,113
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

684
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:44,775
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

685
00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:48,447
And now our fourth and final contestant.

686
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,986
Harry! Harry! Harry!

687
00:59:01,096 --> 00:59:04,031
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:04,532 --> 00:59:06,557
Accio Firebolt!

689
00:59:35,563 --> 00:59:37,724
- Yeah!
- Yes!

690
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:48,074
Oh, my God.

691
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,018
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,168
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,095
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:03,203
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:05,134
- Never!
- Never!

696
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,573
Shush!

697
01:03:09,043 --> 01:03:11,705
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

698
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,580
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

699
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:18,909
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,498
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:39,368
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:43,567
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:46,748 --> 01:03:50,741
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:53,815
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,049
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:57,225 --> 01:03:59,489
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:04,927
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:09,268
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:10,904
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:14,098
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:18,336
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:18,513 --> 01:04:22,449
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:23,451 --> 01:04:26,443
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:26,688 --> 01:04:28,679
...after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:31,719
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:33,826
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:37,021
Yeah. Isn't it?

718
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:39,223
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,531
Boys.

720
01:05:07,995 --> 01:05:09,428
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:15,661
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

722
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:21,302
Shush.

723
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:23,374
Look at this!

724
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,871
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

725
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:31,146
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

726
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:34,083
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:34,255 --> 01:05:36,519
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:40,320
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:44,564
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

730
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:47,867
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:49,525
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:54,342 --> 01:05:57,175
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:59,013 --> 01:06:00,537
Go on.

734
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:08,651
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

735
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,621
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

736
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,599
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,570
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:28,872
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:33,369
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

740
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,947
What are you on about?

741
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,052
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,619
They're for you.

743
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:45,355
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:48,755
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:54,266
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:57,061
...since its inception.

747
01:06:57,738 --> 01:07:01,606
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:03,437
...gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:07,672
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:11,481
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:16,749
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:17,058 --> 01:07:19,686
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:24,298
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,656
...a dance.

755
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:32,702
Silence!

756
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:35,899
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:36,077 --> 01:07:38,705
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,941
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:43,117 --> 01:07:47,315
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:48,055 --> 01:07:50,023
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,681
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:55,556
...is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,063
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:07:59,233 --> 01:08:01,599
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:05,762
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

766
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,068
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:09,243 --> 01:08:11,473
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

768
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:14,080
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:22,213
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,950
- Where?
- My waist.

771
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:27,686
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:30,097
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,158
One, two, three.

774
01:08:35,336 --> 01:08:38,828
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:44,670
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:44,845 --> 01:08:46,005
- Never.
- Never.

777
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:50,048
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,074
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:15,242 --> 01:09:17,904
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:29,245
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

781
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:31,687
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:39,456
I take after my mum.

783
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:43,570
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:45,672
No, not the maternal sort, her.

785
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,401
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:54,105
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:56,613
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:58,686 --> 01:10:00,551
Very funny.

789
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:10,225
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

790
01:10:10,398 --> 01:10:13,424
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:16,098
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:33,287 --> 01:10:38,384
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:43,391
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:46,226
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:50,300
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

796
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:54,536
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,839
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

798
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,854
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,286
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

800
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:17,762
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:19,828
To the ball?

802
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,467
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:26,730
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,534
You're a girl.

805
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,040
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:32,145
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:36,784 --> 01:11:39,685
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:39,854 --> 01:11:41,344
For a girl, it's just sad.

809
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:45,288
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:54,224
And I said yes!

811
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,662
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:57,838 --> 01:11:59,499
She's lying, right?

813
01:11:59,673 --> 01:12:00,901
If you say so.

814
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,908
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:08,981
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,708
Agreed.

817
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:36,406
- Cho!
- Harry!

818
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,710
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,475
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:49,981
Cho?

821
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:52,483
Yes?

822
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:56,091
Well, I just wondered if you...

823
01:12:56,263 --> 01:12:58,925
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:00,734 --> 01:13:02,998
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:03,904 --> 01:13:08,807
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,407
Harry...

827
01:13:16,584 --> 01:13:19,417
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:20,421 --> 01:13:21,854
And...

829
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,754
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

830
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:29,988
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:34,028
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:35,927
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,933
Harry?

834
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:41,370
I really am...

835
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,169
...sorry.

836
01:13:52,953 --> 01:13:54,443
It's all right, Ron.

837
01:13:54,622 --> 01:13:57,819
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

838
01:13:57,992 --> 01:13:59,857
What happened to you?

839
01:14:00,127 --> 01:14:02,288
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:02,463 --> 01:14:04,954
- What?
- What did she say?

841
01:14:05,132 --> 01:14:06,497
No, of course.

842
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:11,401
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

843
01:14:11,805 --> 01:14:16,242
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:20,606
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:20,781 --> 01:14:24,239
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:29,014
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:32,920
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

848
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,321
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:37,555
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:41,459
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,091
Hey!

852
01:15:00,187 --> 01:15:01,882
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,887
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:09,396 --> 01:15:10,693
Bloody...

855
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:12,092
Oh, bloody...

856
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,499
What are those? What are those?

857
01:15:18,672 --> 01:15:21,698
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

858
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:24,810
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

859
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,913
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

860
01:15:27,081 --> 01:15:32,109
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

861
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:37,548
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

862
01:15:42,296 --> 01:15:44,127
Murder me, Harry.

863
01:15:45,532 --> 01:15:47,090
Leave it alone!

864
01:15:48,068 --> 01:15:51,504
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

865
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,140
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

866
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:57,903
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

867
01:15:58,078 --> 01:16:00,273
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

868
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:05,544
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

869
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,919
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

870
01:16:08,088 --> 01:16:09,919
Don't you look...

871
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:11,685
...dashing.

872
01:16:12,259 --> 01:16:15,422
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

873
01:16:15,596 --> 01:16:17,427
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

874
01:16:17,598 --> 01:16:20,624
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

875
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:21,859
- Are the first to dance.

876
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,830
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

877
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:27,135
Well, now you know.

878
01:16:28,642 --> 01:16:32,942
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

879
01:16:33,113 --> 01:16:35,513
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

880
01:16:35,682 --> 01:16:37,172
Come along this way.

881
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,887
Oh, come on.

882
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,716
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

883
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,261
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

884
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:54,866
This way. This way. Come along.

885
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,800
She looks beautiful!

886
01:16:58,972 --> 01:17:00,564
Yeah, she does.

887
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:51,516
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

888
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,719
No. Absolutely not.

889
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:00,991
Hi!

890
01:18:09,743 --> 01:18:11,734
Harry, take my waist.

891
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:14,046
- What?
- Now!

892
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:22,479
Are you ready?

893
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,314
Move your body like a hairy troll

894
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:28,554
Learning to rock and roll

895
01:19:28,956 --> 01:19:31,550
Spin around like a crazy elf

896
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:34,289
Dancing by himself

897
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:37,928
Boogie down like a unicorn

898
01:19:38,098 --> 01:19:40,532
No stopping till the break of dawn

899
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:43,534
Put your hands up in the air

900
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,501
Like an ogre who just don't care

901
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:49,869
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

902
01:19:52,212 --> 01:19:54,407
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

903
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:59,984
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

904
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,446
May I have your arm?

905
01:20:03,624 --> 01:20:06,354
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

906
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:33,844
Hot, isn't it?

907
01:20:34,521 --> 01:20:37,854
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

908
01:20:38,025 --> 01:20:41,722
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

909
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:45,729
What's got your wand in a knot?

910
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:49,730
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

911
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:53,464
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

912
01:20:54,174 --> 01:20:56,608
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

913
01:20:56,777 --> 01:21:00,304
...is international
magical cooperation...

914
01:21:00,881 --> 01:21:02,439
...to make friends.

915
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:06,279
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

916
01:21:16,263 --> 01:21:18,595
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

917
01:21:18,765 --> 01:21:20,198
No.

918
01:21:28,442 --> 01:21:30,876
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

919
01:21:31,044 --> 01:21:35,242
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

920
01:21:35,415 --> 01:21:39,078
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

921
01:21:39,252 --> 01:21:41,379
You know the solution then, don't you?

922
01:21:41,555 --> 01:21:43,546
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

923
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:46,852
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

924
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,052
And not as a last resort.

925
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:53,427
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

926
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,931
Harry.

927
01:21:55,402 --> 01:21:56,699
Where have you been?

928
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,361
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

929
01:22:02,175 --> 01:22:06,202
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

930
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,245
What's this about?

931
01:22:12,519 --> 01:22:15,511
No, don't let

932
01:22:17,324 --> 01:22:21,658
This magic die

933
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:26,194
The answer's there

934
01:23:24,524 --> 01:23:26,617
Let me see it again.

935
01:23:27,928 --> 01:23:30,863
Yes, the time is close now.

936
01:23:35,535 --> 01:23:37,400
Harry, at last!

937
01:23:38,705 --> 01:23:44,041
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

938
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:56,053
You all right, Harry?

939
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,254
I just got in.

940
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,088
Me.

941
01:24:12,372 --> 01:24:15,637
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

942
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:20,007
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

943
01:24:21,548 --> 01:24:23,345
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

944
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,350
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

945
01:24:27,554 --> 01:24:32,150
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

946
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:39,093
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

947
01:24:39,566 --> 01:24:41,796
Mostly, he watches me study.

948
01:24:42,602 --> 01:24:44,695
It's a bit annoying, actually.

949
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:48,768
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

950
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:51,133
What's that supposed to mean?

951
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,680
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

952
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:58,044
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

953
01:24:59,185 --> 01:25:00,812
And...

954
01:25:03,156 --> 01:25:05,056
...I'm scared for you.

955
01:25:05,992 --> 01:25:08,586
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

956
01:25:09,195 --> 01:25:11,686
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

957
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:13,560
Hey, Potter!

958
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:20,796
- Potter!
- Cedric.

959
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:25,171
How...? How are you?

960
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,645
Spectacular.

961
01:25:29,182 --> 01:25:33,016
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

962
01:25:33,186 --> 01:25:35,518
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

963
01:25:35,822 --> 01:25:37,380
Exactly.

964
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:41,051
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

965
01:25:44,898 --> 01:25:47,492
It's not a bad place for a bath.

966
01:25:49,869 --> 01:25:51,769
Just take your egg...

967
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:55,235
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

968
01:26:30,443 --> 01:26:32,604
I must be out of my mind.

969
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,983
I'm definitely out of my mind.

970
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,926
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

971
01:26:51,097 --> 01:26:52,997
Myrtle!

972
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,895
Hello, Harry.

973
01:26:55,635 --> 01:26:58,900
Long time no see.

974
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:06,839
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

975
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:10,449
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

976
01:27:10,617 --> 01:27:12,949
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

977
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:14,882
Polyjuice Potion?

978
01:27:15,655 --> 01:27:19,682
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

979
01:27:26,499 --> 01:27:28,194
That's what he did.

980
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,696
The other boy...

981
01:27:32,105 --> 01:27:34,164
...the handsome one...

982
01:27:35,475 --> 01:27:36,703
...Cedric.

983
01:27:40,113 --> 01:27:42,775
Well, go on. Open it.

984
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:55,884
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

985
01:27:56,062 --> 01:28:00,726
We cannot sing
Above the ground

986
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:05,269
An hour long you'll have to look

987
01:28:06,005 --> 01:28:10,669
To recover what we took

988
01:28:18,852 --> 01:28:20,080
Myrtle...

989
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,191
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

990
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,753
Very good.

991
01:28:28,628 --> 01:28:32,997
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

992
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,266
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

993
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:56,889
Harry, tell me again.

994
01:28:58,591 --> 01:29:01,424
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

995
01:29:01,594 --> 01:29:04,154
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

996
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,656
"An hour long you'll have to look."

997
01:29:07,834 --> 01:29:11,292
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

998
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:14,537
"Potentially problematic"?

999
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:17,972
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1000
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:22,845
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1001
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:25,507
Hate to break up the skull session.

1002
01:29:25,685 --> 01:29:27,676
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1003
01:29:27,921 --> 01:29:30,321
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1004
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,152
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1005
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,920
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1006
01:29:36,095 --> 01:29:37,960
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1007
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:40,622
Go. Now!

1008
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,407
Longbottom!

1009
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:54,604
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1010
01:30:03,256 --> 01:30:05,451
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1011
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:08,219
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1012
01:30:08,828 --> 01:30:13,162
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1013
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:17,064
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1014
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,399
...about plants.

1015
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,434
Now, if there's...

1016
01:30:21,608 --> 01:30:26,409
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1017
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:29,070
...then great. But otherwise...

1018
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:33,049
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1019
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,121
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1020
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,757
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1021
01:30:38,925 --> 01:30:40,358
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1022
01:30:40,526 --> 01:30:42,687
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1023
01:30:42,862 --> 01:30:44,386
Don't be so mean.

1024
01:30:44,998 --> 01:30:46,829
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1025
01:30:49,002 --> 01:30:50,993
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1026
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,104
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1027
01:30:53,273 --> 01:30:54,763
Most likely?

1028
01:30:54,941 --> 01:30:57,136
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1029
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:59,778
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1030
01:30:59,946 --> 01:31:02,608
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1031
01:31:02,782 --> 01:31:04,750
I just wanted to help.

1032
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:08,012
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1033
01:31:08,187 --> 01:31:09,950
Where are they anyway?

1034
01:31:10,123 --> 01:31:13,149
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1035
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:22,396
Welcome to the second task.

1036
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:26,265
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1037
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:27,804
A treasure of sorts.

1038
01:31:27,974 --> 01:31:30,602
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1039
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,473
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1040
01:31:33,646 --> 01:31:35,204
In order to win...

1041
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:39,215
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1042
01:31:39,385 --> 01:31:42,013
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1043
01:31:42,188 --> 01:31:45,817
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1044
01:31:45,992 --> 01:31:49,928
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1045
01:31:50,396 --> 01:31:52,660
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1046
01:32:19,192 --> 01:32:22,127
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1047
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:26,455
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1048
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:30,201
Yeah!

1049
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:32,998
What?

1050
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,712
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1051
01:33:54,887 --> 01:33:57,412
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1052
01:33:58,057 --> 01:34:01,151
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1053
01:35:18,938 --> 01:35:20,803
But she's my friend too!

1054
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:24,104
Only one!

1055
01:36:15,461 --> 01:36:17,326
Let's get down below.

1056
01:36:27,306 --> 01:36:30,173
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1057
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,429
Yes!

1058
01:37:47,553 --> 01:37:49,612
Ascendio!

1059
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,555
Harry!

1060
01:37:58,864 --> 01:38:00,331
He's all right.

1061
01:38:01,534 --> 01:38:02,967
He's all right. Barty!

1062
01:38:03,135 --> 01:38:06,571
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1063
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:10,665
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1064
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,005
My little sister.

1065
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:14,970
Thank you.

1066
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:18,511
And you! You helped.

1067
01:38:19,151 --> 01:38:22,177
Well, yeah, a bit.

1068
01:38:29,395 --> 01:38:30,555
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1069
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,392
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1070
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:36,567
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1071
01:38:36,736 --> 01:38:38,761
I finished last, Hermione.

1072
01:38:39,605 --> 01:38:43,735
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1073
01:38:43,909 --> 01:38:47,140
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1074
01:38:47,313 --> 01:38:50,214
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1075
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:55,145
Attention!

1076
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:59,489
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1077
01:38:59,925 --> 01:39:03,417
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1078
01:39:03,596 --> 01:39:06,258
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1079
01:39:06,432 --> 01:39:11,392
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1080
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:15,836
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1081
01:39:16,008 --> 01:39:17,999
...second place...

1082
01:39:18,177 --> 01:39:19,667
- Second place!
- Well done!

1083
01:39:19,845 --> 01:39:22,473
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1084
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,273
Yes!

1085
01:39:28,788 --> 01:39:30,585
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1086
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,383
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1087
01:39:32,558 --> 01:39:34,924
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1088
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:37,756
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1089
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,591
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1090
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,289
Well done, boy.

1091
01:39:41,467 --> 01:39:44,698
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1092
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:48,863
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1093
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:53,333
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1094
01:39:53,512 --> 01:39:55,503
...to lose one's family.

1095
01:39:57,516 --> 01:39:59,677
Never whole again, are we?

1096
01:40:01,921 --> 01:40:04,014
Still, life goes on...

1097
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:06,351
...and here we stand.

1098
01:40:09,228 --> 01:40:11,958
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1099
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,598
Bartemius!

1100
01:40:13,766 --> 01:40:17,896
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1101
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:21,267
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1102
01:40:33,752 --> 01:40:35,652
And they say I'm mad.

1103
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:48,661
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1104
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:51,860
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1105
01:40:52,371 --> 01:40:54,931
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1106
01:40:55,107 --> 01:40:59,134
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1107
01:40:59,311 --> 01:41:02,644
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1108
01:41:02,815 --> 01:41:04,373
And Harry, of course.

1109
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:09,920
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1110
01:41:10,122 --> 01:41:12,147
Hooray!

1111
01:41:13,592 --> 01:41:16,083
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1112
01:41:16,262 --> 01:41:18,890
Teach us something, please

1113
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,364
Mr. Crouch?

1114
01:41:37,449 --> 01:41:41,044
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1115
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,778
I will not.

1116
01:41:42,955 --> 01:41:47,016
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1117
01:41:47,192 --> 01:41:48,523
Then for once show them some!

1118
01:41:48,694 --> 01:41:52,790
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1119
01:41:52,965 --> 01:41:56,162
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1120
01:41:56,335 --> 01:41:59,133
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1121
01:41:59,305 --> 01:42:02,968
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1122
01:42:07,313 --> 01:42:08,871
Oh, Harry!

1123
01:42:09,048 --> 01:42:11,346
Harry, how good to see you again.

1124
01:42:12,184 --> 01:42:13,708
I can come back later, professor.

1125
01:42:13,886 --> 01:42:17,219
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1126
01:42:17,389 --> 01:42:19,949
Minister, after you.

1127
01:42:20,492 --> 01:42:22,483
There you are. Your hat.

1128
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:26,324
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1129
01:42:26,498 --> 01:42:29,729
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1130
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,752
Professor?

1131
01:44:02,928 --> 01:44:05,453
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1132
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:20,141
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1133
01:44:20,312 --> 01:44:22,246
...to present evidence to this council.

1134
01:44:22,414 --> 01:44:25,110
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1135
01:44:25,284 --> 01:44:29,345
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1136
01:44:29,521 --> 01:44:34,117
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1137
01:44:34,293 --> 01:44:35,988
Do you accept these terms?

1138
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:39,258
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1139
01:44:39,598 --> 01:44:42,066
I have names, sir.

1140
01:44:42,601 --> 01:44:46,196
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1141
01:44:48,874 --> 01:44:51,399
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1142
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:53,704
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1143
01:44:53,879 --> 01:44:56,507
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1144
01:44:56,682 --> 01:44:59,981
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1145
01:45:00,152 --> 01:45:02,518
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1146
01:45:02,688 --> 01:45:03,882
Yeah, the same.

1147
01:45:04,056 --> 01:45:07,719
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1148
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:12,226
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1149
01:45:12,397 --> 01:45:14,365
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1150
01:45:14,533 --> 01:45:19,266
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1151
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:22,407
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1152
01:45:22,574 --> 01:45:26,533
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1153
01:45:26,712 --> 01:45:29,704
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1154
01:45:29,882 --> 01:45:33,318
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1155
01:45:33,485 --> 01:45:35,783
Silence!

1156
01:45:36,388 --> 01:45:39,824
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1157
01:45:39,992 --> 01:45:42,119
...this session is now concluded.

1158
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:44,387
Oh, no, no, no.

1159
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:46,764
I've heard about one more.

1160
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:49,492
- What's that?
- The name.

1161
01:45:49,668 --> 01:45:51,135
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1162
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:53,328
...this person took part
in the capture...

1163
01:45:53,505 --> 01:45:55,666
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1164
01:45:55,841 --> 01:45:59,333
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1165
01:45:59,511 --> 01:46:01,843
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1166
01:46:02,014 --> 01:46:04,539
Barty Crouch...

1167
01:46:07,252 --> 01:46:08,276
...Junior.

1168
01:46:17,763 --> 01:46:19,458
Hold him down!

1169
01:46:23,101 --> 01:46:26,730
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1170
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,032
Hello, Father.

1171
01:46:31,443 --> 01:46:33,502
You are no son of mine.

1172
01:46:44,823 --> 01:46:49,283
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1173
01:46:50,662 --> 01:46:52,061
It's a Pensieve.

1174
01:46:52,231 --> 01:46:56,895
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1175
01:46:57,069 --> 01:47:00,596
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1176
01:47:01,073 --> 01:47:04,042
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1177
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:05,767
...some small detail...

1178
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:09,306
...something I might have overlooked...

1179
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:13,679
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1180
01:47:14,486 --> 01:47:18,354
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1181
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,016
It's maddening.

1182
01:47:23,362 --> 01:47:25,125
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1183
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:27,957
What exactly happened to him?

1184
01:47:28,133 --> 01:47:32,934
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1185
01:47:33,605 --> 01:47:37,200
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1186
01:47:38,677 --> 01:47:41,669
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1187
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:44,507
I had a dream about him.

1188
01:47:46,785 --> 01:47:49,583
It was in the summer, before school.

1189
01:47:51,723 --> 01:47:54,715
In the dream, I was in a house.

1190
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:59,694
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1191
01:47:59,865 --> 01:48:03,494
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1192
01:48:03,869 --> 01:48:06,702
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1193
01:48:07,539 --> 01:48:09,166
Always the same one.

1194
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:14,542
Sir, these dreams...

1195
01:48:14,713 --> 01:48:19,912
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1196
01:48:21,553 --> 01:48:24,522
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1197
01:48:25,023 --> 01:48:26,991
I think it's best if you simply...

1198
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,394
...cast them away.

1199
01:48:43,675 --> 01:48:47,634
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1200
01:48:56,355 --> 01:48:57,549
Potter!

1201
01:48:57,723 --> 01:49:00,248
What's your hurry?

1202
01:49:05,364 --> 01:49:09,130
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1203
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:11,565
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1204
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:13,861
Yes, sir.

1205
01:49:14,806 --> 01:49:16,205
Ingenious.

1206
01:49:18,043 --> 01:49:22,002
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1207
01:49:22,814 --> 01:49:26,306
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1208
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,954
Nor is this.

1209
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,820
Know what it is?

1210
01:49:37,129 --> 01:49:38,562
Bubble juice, sir?

1211
01:49:39,131 --> 01:49:41,031
Veritaserum.

1212
01:49:41,767 --> 01:49:45,464
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1213
01:49:45,637 --> 01:49:50,802
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1214
01:49:51,476 --> 01:49:54,502
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1215
01:49:54,679 --> 01:49:59,548
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1216
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:04,121
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1217
01:50:05,257 --> 01:50:10,957
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1218
01:50:11,663 --> 01:50:14,996
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1219
01:50:15,167 --> 01:50:17,362
...I'm going to find out why!

1220
01:50:44,196 --> 01:50:45,788
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1221
01:51:04,983 --> 01:51:06,507
Sonorus!

1222
01:51:10,755 --> 01:51:16,091
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1223
01:51:16,261 --> 01:51:21,221
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1224
01:51:23,335 --> 01:51:25,132
...and Mr. Potter...

1225
01:51:27,005 --> 01:51:28,734
...are tied for first position...

1226
01:51:28,907 --> 01:51:33,037
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1227
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:37,737
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1228
01:51:38,617 --> 01:51:41,711
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1229
01:51:46,057 --> 01:51:48,787
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1230
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,895
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1231
01:51:52,063 --> 01:51:56,557
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1232
01:51:56,902 --> 01:52:00,804
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1233
01:52:03,942 --> 01:52:08,276
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1234
01:52:08,446 --> 01:52:11,813
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1235
01:52:11,983 --> 01:52:15,009
You see, people change in the maze.

1236
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:16,882
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1237
01:52:17,055 --> 01:52:21,822
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1238
01:52:23,295 --> 01:52:26,287
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1239
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:36,807
Good luck.

1240
01:52:37,209 --> 01:52:39,143
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1241
01:52:41,513 --> 01:52:44,107
On the count of three. One...

1242
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:13,118
Fleur?

1243
01:56:14,793 --> 01:56:16,226
Fleur.

1244
01:56:19,798 --> 01:56:21,629
Periculum!

1245
01:57:00,305 --> 01:57:01,772
Get down!

1246
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,069
Get down!

1247
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:05,937
Expelliarmus!

1248
01:57:15,553 --> 01:57:18,750
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1249
01:57:18,923 --> 01:57:20,982
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1250
01:57:32,604 --> 01:57:34,299
Yes.

1251
01:57:55,193 --> 01:57:56,956
Harry!

1252
01:57:59,264 --> 01:58:00,925
Harry!

1253
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,734
Harry!

1254
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,763
Harry!

1255
01:58:10,742 --> 01:58:12,539
Reducto!

1256
01:58:29,327 --> 01:58:31,818
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1257
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:36,929
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1258
01:58:37,101 --> 01:58:38,830
For a moment, so did I.

1259
01:58:40,705 --> 01:58:41,865
Some game, huh?

1260
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,306
Some game.

1261
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:51,374
Go!

1262
01:59:01,526 --> 01:59:04,552
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1263
01:59:04,729 --> 01:59:06,720
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1264
01:59:06,898 --> 01:59:08,126
...three!
...three!

1265
01:59:20,578 --> 01:59:23,513
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1266
01:59:30,588 --> 01:59:31,919
Where are we?

1267
01:59:37,629 --> 01:59:39,256
I've been here before.

1268
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,492
It's a Portkey.

1269
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:50,536
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1270
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:56,011
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1271
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,148
What are you talking about?

1272
02:00:03,388 --> 02:00:06,289
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1273
02:00:13,931 --> 02:00:16,263
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1274
02:00:16,434 --> 02:00:19,198
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1275
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:32,380
Do it! Now!

1276
02:00:44,328 --> 02:00:46,819
Bone of the father...

1277
02:00:46,998 --> 02:00:49,296
...unwillingly given.

1278
02:00:56,774 --> 02:00:59,800
Flesh of the servant...

1279
02:01:01,846 --> 02:01:05,009
...willingly sacrificed.

1280
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:12,851
And blood of the enemy...

1281
02:01:18,663 --> 02:01:21,154
...forcibly taken.

1282
02:01:27,205 --> 02:01:30,174
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1283
02:01:30,942 --> 02:01:32,876
...again.

1284
02:02:36,274 --> 02:02:39,675
My wand, Wormtail.

1285
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,188
Hold out your arm.

1286
02:02:51,355 --> 02:02:52,947
Master.

1287
02:02:53,124 --> 02:02:55,752
Thank you, master.

1288
02:02:55,927 --> 02:02:57,394
The other arm, Wormtail.

1289
02:03:38,035 --> 02:03:39,935
Welcome, my friends.

1290
02:03:41,339 --> 02:03:44,103
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1291
02:03:44,742 --> 02:03:50,237
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1292
02:03:51,182 --> 02:03:54,117
I confess myself...

1293
02:03:54,585 --> 02:03:56,143
...disappointed.

1294
02:03:56,821 --> 02:03:58,914
Not one of you tried to find me.

1295
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:02,457
Crabbe! Macnair!

1296
02:04:03,361 --> 02:04:04,692
Goyle!

1297
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:08,825
Not even you...

1298
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:14,637
...Lucius.

1299
02:04:16,474 --> 02:04:21,309
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1300
02:04:21,479 --> 02:04:24,471
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1301
02:04:24,649 --> 02:04:29,814
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1302
02:04:31,522 --> 02:04:37,154
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1303
02:04:39,163 --> 02:04:41,791
...that is my true mask.

1304
02:04:42,166 --> 02:04:43,724
I returned.

1305
02:04:46,203 --> 02:04:50,105
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1306
02:04:51,242 --> 02:04:57,010
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1307
02:05:02,219 --> 02:05:04,551
Thank you, master.

1308
02:05:05,156 --> 02:05:06,885
Thank you.

1309
02:05:09,994 --> 02:05:12,360
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1310
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:15,321
Harry.

1311
02:05:15,499 --> 02:05:18,297
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1312
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:22,872
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1313
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,405
I'd introduce you...

1314
02:05:24,575 --> 02:05:28,875
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1315
02:05:31,549 --> 02:05:34,211
The boy who lived.

1316
02:05:34,385 --> 02:05:37,286
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1317
02:05:37,455 --> 02:05:41,448
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1318
02:05:41,625 --> 02:05:46,358
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1319
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:48,122
Yes, shall I?

1320
02:05:48,466 --> 02:05:49,797
It was love.

1321
02:05:49,967 --> 02:05:54,461
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1322
02:05:54,638 --> 02:05:57,232
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1323
02:05:57,641 --> 02:05:59,438
I could not touch him.

1324
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:02,805
It was old magic.

1325
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,244
Something I should have foreseen.

1326
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:07,213
But no matter, no matter.

1327
02:06:07,385 --> 02:06:09,580
Things have changed.

1328
02:06:10,354 --> 02:06:13,846
I can touch you...

1329
02:06:14,458 --> 02:06:16,187
...now.

1330
02:06:24,335 --> 02:06:25,666
Yeah.

1331
02:06:32,009 --> 02:06:35,706
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1332
02:06:36,847 --> 02:06:38,576
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1333
02:06:40,184 --> 02:06:42,414
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1334
02:06:43,988 --> 02:06:46,320
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1335
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:48,924
First, we bow to each other.

1336
02:06:49,093 --> 02:06:51,459
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1337
02:06:51,629 --> 02:06:54,860
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1338
02:06:55,032 --> 02:06:56,363
I said, bow.

1339
02:06:58,235 --> 02:07:02,569
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1340
02:07:02,973 --> 02:07:04,838
Crucio!

1341
02:07:07,311 --> 02:07:09,040
Crucio!

1342
02:07:10,114 --> 02:07:12,048
Attaboy, Harry.

1343
02:07:12,216 --> 02:07:14,343
Your parents would be proud.

1344
02:07:14,652 --> 02:07:18,053
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1345
02:07:18,222 --> 02:07:19,814
Expelliar...

1346
02:07:22,827 --> 02:07:25,227
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1347
02:07:25,396 --> 02:07:27,387
I'm going to destroy you.

1348
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:35,163
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1349
02:07:35,806 --> 02:07:38,366
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1350
02:07:38,542 --> 02:07:41,204
...they'll speak only of how you...

1351
02:07:41,512 --> 02:07:43,343
...begged for death.

1352
02:07:43,514 --> 02:07:47,280
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1353
02:07:47,818 --> 02:07:49,410
...obliged.

1354
02:07:49,753 --> 02:07:51,243
Get up!

1355
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,228
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1356
02:07:58,395 --> 02:08:00,659
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1357
02:08:00,831 --> 02:08:04,028
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1358
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:19,711
Have it your way.

1359
02:08:20,751 --> 02:08:23,151
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1360
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:43,333
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1361
02:08:47,912 --> 02:08:49,607
He's mine!

1362
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:26,673
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1363
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:28,909
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1364
02:09:29,086 --> 02:09:30,849
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1365
02:09:32,056 --> 02:09:35,082
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1366
02:09:35,259 --> 02:09:37,784
Take my body back to my father.

1367
02:09:38,829 --> 02:09:40,160
Let go.

1368
02:09:40,631 --> 02:09:42,599
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1369
02:09:43,434 --> 02:09:46,062
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:09:51,809 --> 02:09:53,174
Accio!

1371
02:09:58,882 --> 02:10:00,873
No!

1372
02:10:13,631 --> 02:10:15,223
He did it!

1373
02:10:16,467 --> 02:10:18,128
Harry!

1374
02:10:20,904 --> 02:10:22,394
Harry!

1375
02:10:23,607 --> 02:10:26,838
No! No! No, don't!

1376
02:10:27,144 --> 02:10:29,009
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1377
02:10:29,313 --> 02:10:31,873
He's back. He's back.

1378
02:10:32,049 --> 02:10:34,074
Voldemort's back.

1379
02:10:34,251 --> 02:10:36,651
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1380
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:39,152
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1381
02:10:39,323 --> 02:10:42,121
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1382
02:10:42,293 --> 02:10:44,591
He's home. You both are.

1383
02:10:44,762 --> 02:10:48,391
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1384
02:10:51,468 --> 02:10:55,131
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1385
02:10:55,406 --> 02:10:57,101
Let me through.

1386
02:10:57,274 --> 02:10:58,798
Let me through!

1387
02:11:00,711 --> 02:11:01,973
Let me through!

1388
02:11:02,146 --> 02:11:03,545
That's my son!

1389
02:11:04,848 --> 02:11:06,281
That's my boy!

1390
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,849
It's my boy!

1391
02:11:14,658 --> 02:11:18,219
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1392
02:11:18,395 --> 02:11:21,364
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1393
02:11:22,032 --> 02:11:24,227
No!

1394
02:11:27,304 --> 02:11:29,704
It's all right, I got you.

1395
02:11:29,873 --> 02:11:33,206
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1396
02:11:37,214 --> 02:11:39,011
No!

1397
02:11:40,117 --> 02:11:41,982
No!

1398
02:12:24,395 --> 02:12:26,090
Are you all right, Potter?

1399
02:12:26,663 --> 02:12:28,597
Does it hurt? That?

1400
02:12:28,766 --> 02:12:30,563
Not so much now.

1401
02:12:31,502 --> 02:12:33,595
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1402
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,731
The cup was a Portkey.

1403
02:12:41,445 --> 02:12:43,276
Someone had bewitched it.

1404
02:12:43,547 --> 02:12:45,640
What was it like?

1405
02:12:45,983 --> 02:12:47,644
- What was he like?
- Who?

1406
02:12:47,818 --> 02:12:49,581
The Dark Lord.

1407
02:12:51,889 --> 02:12:54,983
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1408
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:58,057
I don't know.

1409
02:13:00,898 --> 02:13:03,833
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1410
02:13:06,804 --> 02:13:08,795
...into one of my nightmares.

1411
02:13:27,524 --> 02:13:29,082
Were there others?

1412
02:13:29,259 --> 02:13:31,523
In the graveyard, were there others?

1413
02:13:35,466 --> 02:13:36,865
I...

1414
02:13:37,568 --> 02:13:41,504
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1415
02:13:48,946 --> 02:13:52,211
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1416
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:59,680
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1417
02:13:59,857 --> 02:14:01,757
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1418
02:14:05,295 --> 02:14:08,992
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1419
02:14:09,166 --> 02:14:11,657
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1420
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:15,932
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1421
02:14:16,106 --> 02:14:19,303
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1422
02:14:19,476 --> 02:14:21,034
...that led him straight to it?

1423
02:14:29,453 --> 02:14:33,446
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1424
02:14:34,024 --> 02:14:37,653
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1425
02:14:37,828 --> 02:14:39,989
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1426
02:14:40,631 --> 02:14:44,123
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1427
02:14:44,301 --> 02:14:45,598
And now the deed is done.

1428
02:14:47,271 --> 02:14:51,605
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1429
02:15:00,117 --> 02:15:03,609
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1430
02:15:04,555 --> 02:15:07,046
...that I have once and for all...

1431
02:15:07,658 --> 02:15:11,992
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1432
02:15:12,162 --> 02:15:13,424
Expelliarmus!

1433
02:15:18,135 --> 02:15:19,397
Severus.

1434
02:15:21,872 --> 02:15:23,362
That's it, take it.

1435
02:15:25,342 --> 02:15:28,800
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1436
02:15:28,979 --> 02:15:31,675
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1437
02:15:31,848 --> 02:15:34,942
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1438
02:15:37,988 --> 02:15:39,512
Harry, away from there!

1439
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:03,843
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1440
02:16:04,815 --> 02:16:06,874
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1441
02:16:08,685 --> 02:16:09,777
Polyjuice Potion.

1442
02:16:09,953 --> 02:16:13,184
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1443
02:16:13,423 --> 02:16:15,357
We'll get you up in a minute.

1444
02:16:49,793 --> 02:16:51,192
Harry!

1445
02:16:54,865 --> 02:16:57,060
Barty Crouch Junior.

1446
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,235
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1447
02:17:02,606 --> 02:17:03,800
Your arm, Harry.

1448
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:10,408
You know what this means, don't you?

1449
02:17:11,314 --> 02:17:12,645
He's back.

1450
02:17:13,850 --> 02:17:15,977
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1451
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:19,252
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1452
02:17:19,456 --> 02:17:23,984
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1453
02:17:24,461 --> 02:17:26,952
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1454
02:17:27,531 --> 02:17:30,398
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1455
02:17:50,287 --> 02:17:52,949
Today, we acknowledge...

1456
02:17:53,657 --> 02:17:56,421
...a really terrible loss.

1457
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:01,292
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1458
02:18:01,465 --> 02:18:03,797
...exceptionally hard-working...

1459
02:18:04,701 --> 02:18:07,067
...infinitely fair-minded...

1460
02:18:07,637 --> 02:18:09,935
...and, most importantly...

1461
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:14,802
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1462
02:18:15,946 --> 02:18:20,315
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1463
02:18:23,353 --> 02:18:24,877
You see...

1464
02:18:25,722 --> 02:18:27,815
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1465
02:18:28,725 --> 02:18:30,716
...by Lord Voldemort!

1466
02:18:32,629 --> 02:18:36,190
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1467
02:18:36,833 --> 02:18:40,530
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1468
02:18:42,706 --> 02:18:44,367
Now, the pain...

1469
02:18:44,541 --> 02:18:48,204
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1470
02:18:48,378 --> 02:18:49,709
...and reminds us...

1471
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:53,577
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1472
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:57,186
...our hearts beat as one.

1473
02:18:57,687 --> 02:18:59,712
In light of recent events...

1474
02:19:00,056 --> 02:19:04,993
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1475
02:19:05,862 --> 02:19:11,198
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1476
02:19:11,635 --> 02:19:13,762
You remember that...

1477
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:17,397
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1478
02:19:17,941 --> 02:19:20,409
...kind and honest...

1479
02:19:20,911 --> 02:19:25,507
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1480
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,765
I never liked these curtains.

1481
02:19:53,376 --> 02:19:56,038
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1482
02:19:56,379 --> 02:19:58,210
By accident, of course.

1483
02:20:03,887 --> 02:20:08,256
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1484
02:20:11,661 --> 02:20:13,356
Professor...

1485
02:20:13,563 --> 02:20:16,555
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1486
02:20:17,367 --> 02:20:21,770
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1487
02:20:23,340 --> 02:20:25,672
Priori Incantatem.

1488
02:20:29,813 --> 02:20:32,543
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1489
02:20:33,116 --> 02:20:34,947
They reappeared.

1490
02:20:36,419 --> 02:20:40,185
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1491
02:20:42,759 --> 02:20:45,353
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1492
02:20:45,829 --> 02:20:50,664
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1493
02:20:54,037 --> 02:20:55,698
But remember this:

1494
02:20:55,872 --> 02:20:57,806
You have friends here.

1495
02:20:59,809 --> 02:21:01,572
You're not alone.

1496
02:21:22,265 --> 02:21:23,994
Hermione.

1497
02:21:24,401 --> 02:21:26,392
This is for you.

1498
02:21:27,003 --> 02:21:29,198
Write to me. Promise.

1499
02:21:30,307 --> 02:21:31,706
Bye.

1500
02:21:37,948 --> 02:21:39,882
Au revoir, Ron.

1501
02:22:23,827 --> 02:22:26,352
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1502
02:22:26,529 --> 02:22:27,655
- No.
- No.

1503
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:32,200
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1504
02:22:36,606 --> 02:22:39,439
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1505
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:48,217
Yes.

1506
02:22:52,956 --> 02:22:56,255
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1507
02:22:56,426 --> 02:22:58,986
I won't. You know I won't.

1508
02:23:00,263 --> 02:23:04,029
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.

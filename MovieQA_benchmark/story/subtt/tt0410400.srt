1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,351
(Door opening and footsteps)

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,391
(Coughing and chatter)

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,398
(Man rustles paper and clears throat)

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,193
MAN: This is a poem, that was...

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,519
Um,  o it i the ia.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,911
Clears throat) It's for my son.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,638
To A Child Dancing In The Wind.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,151
""Dance there upon the shore

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,838
What need have you to care

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,677
For wind or waters roar?.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,278
Tumble out your hair

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,116
That the salt drops have wet

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,757
What need have you to dread

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,677
The monstrous crying of the wind?. ""

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,835
(Laughter)

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,151
(Gulls cry)

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,191
(Waves lap the shore)

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,834
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,473
Excuse me.

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,670
James.

21
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,948
James?.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,752
James!. James!. Come here.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,236
Stay close, OK?.

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,714
Give me your hand, tight. Hold it tight.

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,031
Sorry. Sorry.

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,678
- Sorry.
- Where are they?.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,713
Listen, Frank,
You look after yourself, all right?.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,149
Angela, this way.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,713
Sorry. Excuse me.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,754
(Cheering and whistling)
- There she goes, boys.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,549
Look at that. Isn't that fantastic?.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,559
- Rob!.
- Mum, there you are.

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,160
Hello. I thought I was going to miss it.

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,908
- Where's Grandpa?.
- I don't know.

35
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,429
Pappy won't be coming. He's not here.

36
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,232
Come on, Frank.

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,274
You're missing it, Frank.

38
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,079
- You coming out?.
- I'll be out in a minute, Danny.

39
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,231
How can they let someone else
build our navy's ships?.

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,271
It's just the way it is.

41
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,311
And you...

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,476
How can they let you go?.

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
- You want this?.
- No, thanks.

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,239
All right, Gus?.

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,077
(Whirring of machinery)

46
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,636
(Siren)
- You all right?.

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
- Joan Redmond?.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,435
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,595
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

50
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,074
- Sorry.
- Right...

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,908
As I was saying, driving a bus
is exactly the same as driving a car,

52
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,748
except for the 50 or so back-seat drivers
sitting behind you.

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,591
(Door opens)

54
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,711
Rob brought the boys for your last day.

55
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,511
They were looking for you.

56
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,791
Gus Fuller lost his hand today.

57
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,239
Oh!

58
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,589
How?.

59
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,791
- One of the presses.
- (Gasps)

60
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,793
Will he get more money?.

61
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,791
I watched him do it.

62
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,311
That's you tidy.

63
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,551
See you soon, love.

64
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,593
- Hello.
- Hi.

65
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,872
- JSA, pensions or disability?.
- I'm looking for a job.

66
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,512
First time?.

67
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,597
- Yeah.
- You'll need to speak to someone.

68
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,959
Let's see who's free.

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,752
Angela.

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,792
- All right?.
- OK.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,318
Look, Frank, you don't have to fill it in here.

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,831
You can do it at home.

73
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,632
(Breathes rapidly)

74
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,031
(Panting)

75
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,519
- Won't be the same at work without Frank.
- You got the boot as well, you dozy pillock!

76
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,597
He might have a heart attack.
That happens, doesn't it?.

77
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,676
Work, Monday.
Redundant, Tuesday.

78
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,836
Heart attack, Wednesday.

79
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,838
Frank will be all right, then. Today's Thursday.

80
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,070
What in the name of total insanity
are you wearing?.

81
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,999
- Och, I had nae clean ones.
- Tell me they're not your mother's.

82
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,676
Don't be daft. They're big Janine's.

83
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,269
- She left them in the pub on Friday.
- Don't let Frank catch you wearing them.

84
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,153
- I knew they'd come in handy.
- For what exactly?.

85
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,111
What if I get run over?.

86
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,195
Frank won't be coming swimming tonight.
I'm glad I got out when I did. It's turned nasty.

87
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,834
Frank could have stayed like I did.
The men respect him.

88
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,668
All he had to do was let them upstairs think
they were running the job.

89
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,836
Man's too pig-headed for his own good.

90
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,318
- Frank, I didn't mean...
- Leave it, Eddie.

91
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,473
See you in the pool, then.

92
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,429
Frank?.

93
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,670
Frank?.

94
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,752
- Frank?.
JOAN: Excuse me.

95
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,472
Frank?.

96
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,715
Frank, where are you going?.

97
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,676
EDDlE: Frank!
JOAN: Oh, my God!

98
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,755
Frank!

99
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,519
Hey, man. Hey!

100
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,152
Get an ambulance, Joan!

101
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,111
Please, no.

102
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,718
You're all right, man.

103
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,751
Get out of my way!

104
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,715
It's OK. He's OK. Dad's fine.

105
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,034
It was a panic attack.
That's what the doctor said.

106
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,513
- What?.
- A panic attack.

107
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,028
Only, don't mention it when he comes out.

108
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,071
OK, let's go.

109
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,236
- Eddie rang me.
- Eddie's got a big mouth.

110
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,475
- He was worried.
- I slipped, OK?.

111
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,557
- Can I get money for a can of Coke?.
- You collapsed.

112
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,717
- Mum says you had a panic attack.
- I slipped and fell. It happens.

113
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,877
- What are you asking me for?.
- Have you got money for a can of Coke?.

114
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,751
No, I don't. Have you got your purse?.

115
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,314
- No, I don't have my purse.
- Ask your dad for the money.

116
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,157
- How do I get out of here?.
- Down there.

117
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,838
- Right, left?.
- That way, Frank.

118
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,077
- Right, I'll find it.
- I'm really sorry, love.

119
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,350
Come on, boys, let's go.

120
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,039
- What is the matter with you?.
- You shouldn't...

121
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,356
- You could have said hello.
- You should not have told him.

122
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,116
(Bell)

123
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,993
- Hands.
(Lift door shuts)

124
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,957
- Is Pappy all right?.
- Of course he is.

125
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,030
Do you like Pappy?.

126
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,275
Pappy and I are just different.

127
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,392
Pappy doesn't like you.

128
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,275
Oh, look who it is. Frank's little girl.

129
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,117
(Sniggering)

130
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,871
Are ourfish suppers ready yet, Chinaman?.

131
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,072
Oh, God love us.
He's a real chatterbox tonight, isn't he?.

132
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,394
(Chuckling)

133
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,311
Tell you what. I've changed my mind.

134
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,351
I fancy a curry.

135
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,551
See you Tuesday.

136
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,551
Just a bag of chips, please, Chan.

137
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,030
I heard about your Dad. I'm er...sorry.

138
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,071
OK, Chan?.

139
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,432
Frank, all right?.

140
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,959
Good book?.

141
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,037
It's for my wife. It's about cooking.

142
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,351
What are you looking for?.

143
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,591
I don't know.

144
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,236
But whatever it is, it's not in here.

145
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,313
JOAN: He doesn't know
what to do with himself any more.

146
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,033
More than I can say for you, driving a bus.
Have you told him?.

147
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,117
No. Don't want to give him
anything else to worry about.

148
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,754
He's going to find out sooner or later.

149
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,917
He's shut me out again, Michelle.
Like when Stuart...

150
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,316
It won't last long.
Are things better with him and Rob?.

151
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,679
Not really.

152
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,758
- Good evening.
- Hiya.

153
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,392
- Bag of chips, please.
- OK.

154
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,238
- Is your Dad around?.
- No.

155
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,951
Salt and vinegar?.

156
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,914
Please.

157
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,791
(Laughter on TV)

158
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,109
Oh, hi, Frank. Come on in.
I'm just off to work.

159
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,791
Tom Cruise is in the front room.

160
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,310
Eddie, it's Frank. He's got chips.

161
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,279
TV:..but our industrious little beetle is about
to meet someone altogether more scary...

162
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,311
I've seen this before.

163
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,914
That wee beetle pushes that big ball of shite
for what is the equivalent of six miles for him.

164
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,235
Then just as he gets to where he's going,

165
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,755
another beetle comes...

166
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,870
and steals it from under his nose.

167
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,434
It's what happens. Wait, you'll see.

168
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,675
Six miles.

169
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,711
Poor bastard.

170
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,479
They'll have you shovelling shit, you know that?.

171
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,871
I know.

172
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,633
You still coming on the booze cruise to France?.

173
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,511
It will do us good.

174
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,551
I can see myself on the ship now.

175
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,910
Captain Eddie Fraser, beer in my hand

176
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,154
and the sea air in my lungs.

177
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,758
DANNY: Oh, Eddie!.

178
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,030
That seagull's eating your puke.

179
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,429
He caught it in the air.
That seagull caught it in the air.

180
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,597
Puke again, Eddie. Go on, puke again.

181
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,912
That's brilliant that.

182
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,711
All right?.

183
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,558
Bloody hell.

184
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,434
You can see France already.
Isn't very far, is it?.

185
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,311
Near enough to swim.

186
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,590
I wish I had.

187
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,754
(Laughter)

188
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,478
EDDlE: Frank?.

189
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,030
Frank?.

190
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,071
You all right?.

191
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,075
How mad would you have to be to swim this?.

192
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,279
Totally.

193
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,470
DANNY: How far is it to France?.
EDDlE: We're in France, you dipstick.

194
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,158
DANNY: I know we're in France
but how far is it from Britain?.

195
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,829
NORMAN: 20 miles,
give or take the odd oil tanker.

196
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,030
DANNY: 20 miles, eh?.
How do they measure that?.

197
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,548
MlCHELLE: They look very small from here.

198
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,309
They are very small. It's just
us women like to shrink when we get near them.

199
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,672
You can't just swim across
one of the busiest shipping routes in the world.

200
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,678
Who do you show your passport to?.
Punch and Judy?.

201
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,349
- The deckchair man.
- I was a deckchair man for a day.

202
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,597
- Only a day?.
- It wasn't what I was expecting.

203
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,548
MlCHELLE: Did you tell him yet?.
JOAN: No. God, no.

204
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,591
I will.

205
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,996
He won't like it.
He'll think it's to do with him losing his job.

206
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,953
MlCHELLE: And he'll like it even less
when he finds out the truth.

207
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,753
That it's got absolutely nothing
to do with him at all.

208
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,873
Sorry to pull you back to the yard like this,
Frank. It's a small little matter.

209
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,549
I just need to prove something.
I know you must be busy.

210
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,871
So, you know these guys, Frank?.

211
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,829
- So...
- I've told you...I didn't see anything.

212
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,792
He must have been desperate.
He's going to get nothing.

213
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,871
He used the wrong hand.

214
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,917
He's right-handed.

215
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,631
Duncan.

216
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,516
He crossed hands...

217
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,152
to operate the press.

218
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,829
OK.

219
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,917
You should have been more loyal
to the company, Frank.

220
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,438
You wouldn't know what loyalty is.

221
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,629
Loyalty is a full wage packet
at the end of the week.

222
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,871
Loyalty is being valued.

223
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,155
Being happy with yourself.

224
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,469
Are you happy with yourself, Frank?.

225
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,591
Who do you think you are?.

226
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,755
You seriously think you can intimidate people
into being loyal to you?.

227
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,269
There's not a man in this yard
would piss on you if you were on fire.

228
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,353
Hi, Frank.

229
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,197
Cannae keep away, eh?.

230
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,319
- I knocked a vase over.
- Which one?.

231
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,591
- The one with the crack in it?.
- No, the other one.

232
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,911
Will it fix?.

233
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,151
I need to go and get changed.

234
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,191
(Squelches)

235
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,438
So what if you swam the Clyde?.
It doesn't prove anything.

236
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,789
The Channel's a completely different thing.

237
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,400
- Do you think you could, then, Frank?.
- I know I could.

238
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,557
EDDlE: Look...you got made redundant.

239
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,273
You should just face up to it like everyone else.

240
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,551
Face up to it?.

241
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,431
Like you did, Eddie?.

242
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,118
- That's a lot of reading.
- It's a lot of swimming.

243
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,713
- You think I'm wasting my time?.
- A gem cannot be polished without friction,

244
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,035
nor a man perfected without trials.

245
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,599
- Is that a yes or a no?.
- When do we start?.

246
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,673
Hey, hey, hey.
What have we forgotten?.

247
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,351
What's this?.

248
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,840
You know we're not allowed. In you go.

249
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,592
I'll see you at 3:30.

250
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,471
- Bye!.
- Bye!

251
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,632
- All right, son.
- Dad.

252
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,108
OK?.

253
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,359
You?.

254
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,470
Yeah, good.

255
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,078
Busy?.

256
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,553
Aye.

257
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,476
You used to have one of them. Remember?.

258
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,594
Yeah.

259
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,920
They had one each
but they're always losing them.

260
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,959
I was going to go for a coffee. Want to come?.

261
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,915
I'd better not. Got to get on.

262
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,998
Maybe next time.

263
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,189
Aye.

264
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,589
I promised Michelle I'd fix this for her.

265
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,995
I just wanted to see what was inside.

266
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,315
Now it doesn't seem to want to go back together.

267
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,636
Things aren't meant to be fixed nowadays.

268
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,993
No.

269
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,474
Not by you, anyway.

270
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,589
How's work?.

271
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,917
What was it Sausage Finger said today?.
Something funny.

272
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,397
No, I can't remember.
It was funny anyway, whatever it was.

273
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,834
The thing that he said. It was funny.

274
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,271
I'm going to swim it, Ed.

275
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,432
I know you are.

276
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,317
- Oh, my, that's a lot of reading.
- It's a lot of swimming.

277
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,113
Probably mentions sharks.
Does it mention sharks, Frank?.

278
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,879
EDDlE: There's no sharks in the Channel.
- This one shark,

279
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,593
they opened it up
and found a telly and a box of condoms.

280
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,200
- They did not.
- And don't tell me the telly was still on?.

281
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,711
Look, it's important they take this seriously
or you may as well not bother.

282
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,354
- Bloody hell.
- Bugger me.

283
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,392
Are you coming or are you going?.

284
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,635
- Sorry, Frank.
- Sorry, Frank.

285
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,995
- There is the training schedule.
- I don't mean to be rude, Chan...

286
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,715
- Things to do to set the swim up.
-.but I didn't think you could speak English.

287
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,638
- I didn't think you could speak.
- Danny...

288
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,671
First, we need to register the swim.

289
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,315
I've only heard you say three words
and two of them were "salt" and "vinegar".

290
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,078
Will you let the man speak?.

291
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,793
Sorry, Chan.

292
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,718
Next, we have to get a boat
and an experienced pilot.

293
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
How about Merv?. He's got a boat.

294
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,590
Merv the Perv has got a boat?.

295
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,995
A daft pointy one,
all chrome and shiny plastic.

296
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,918
- I don't want to talk to Merv.
NORMAN: It's got a dinky wee bar.

297
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,554
- Does it go fast, though?.
- Like shit off a stick.

298
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,196
EDDlE: Two years, that's what it takes.

299
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,231
I want to do it in six months.

300
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,431
Would you have time to help me?.

301
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,993
Aye.

302
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,117
Ed, I would have asked you
but I didn't think you would have time.

303
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,188
Aye, well, Chan is probably better
at this sort of thing than me, anyway.

304
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,595
Look, guys, do me a favour
and can we just keep this to ourselves?.

305
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,959
- Sure.
- Aye.

306
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,760
- Is he in?.
- Aye, he's in the kitchen.

307
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,789
Right.

308
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,831
(Doorbell)

309
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,951
- Good evening, Joan.
- Hello, Norman.

310
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,558
- I've got a cake.
- Oh, very nice.

311
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,151
(Doorbell)

312
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,834
- Hello, Mrs Redmond.
- Hello.

313
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,589
- It's Danny. Danny Campbell.
- Ah, right.

314
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,029
You want Frank?. He's...in the kitchen.

315
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,071
(Doorbell)

316
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,750
Come in.

317
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,791
He's in the kitchen.

318
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,310
Keep your eyes open, James.

319
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,554
In here.

320
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,471
On you go.

321
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,797
- All right, Rob?.
- Danny, how's things?.

322
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,673
Aye, not bad. Skint, no job, no girlfriend.

323
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,757
And I've been wearing big Janine's knickers
since last February.

324
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,110
I can't complain.
It's not easy that, doing a woman's job.

325
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,390
Here, I'll leave you to it.
Rather you than me.

326
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,635
- You OK?.
- Yeah.

327
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,558
Leave it alone, you big numpty.

328
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,068
And try to stay on your feet.

329
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,475
I saw Dad down the pool again.
What's he up to?.

330
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,988
- Swimming.
- It seems he's there all the time.

331
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,190
Well, it does him good. Away you go.

332
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,312
- How did they both manage to fall over?.
- Practice.

333
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,754
- May we go up to our room?.
- Yes, you can.

334
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,473
I didn't know you had this.

335
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,317
Angela dug it out. It's a good sand boat.

336
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,594
Well, that's all you ever wanted to make,
both of you. It must be in your blood.

337
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,879
Biscuit?.

338
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,718
- I go up there now and then.
- Mm, I know.

339
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,839
Mum?.

340
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,470
I failed my bus test.

341
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,838
That's not bad.

342
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,077
Time's faster and you're getting
more distance from the strokes.

343
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,588
But it's still a long way from the real thing.

344
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,759
You'd be better at bus driving than me.

345
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,076
I thought about it. Kept seeing those ads.

346
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,236
So, why didn't you tell us?.

347
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,351
There's no sugar in this.

348
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,032
- Can you take it again?.
- You get three goes.

349
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,958
You should try for it. You'd be good.

350
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,549
What, and have Angela give up work?.
She earns twice what I could.

351
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,434
- I've said I can help with the twins.
- And I've said they're my kids.

352
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,393
If I'm not prepared to look after them,
then we shouldn't have had them.

353
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,878
- What?.
- You're like your Dad.

354
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,150
Right, boys, over to the side of the pool.

355
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,071
Right, go on beside Campbell.

356
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,631
Good boy.

357
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,230
Aaron, when you get to the side of the pool,
just stop and wait.

358
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,471
Hold on, Jonathan.

359
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,991
- You OK?.
- It's all right, he's fine.

360
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,589
- I'm all right.
- It's the way he swims. It's OK, just leave him.

361
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,912
Thank you.

362
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,078
- Yes!
- Yes.

363
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,236
Did you see that, big man?.

364
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,788
- Call that swimming?.
- Aye.

365
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,433
- Have you got a name?.
- Aaron.

366
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,231
Good name.

367
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,911
Good swimmer.

368
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,119
Rob, hurry up.

369
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,198
- Come on, let's go.
- He's probably not here.

370
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,152
You said he comes here all the time.
Unless you don't want to.

371
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,193
I'm coming. And I didn't say "all of the time".
I said "some of the time", smartarse.

372
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,593
Where are you going to?.

373
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,835
- All right, Frank?.
- All right, Danny.

374
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,551
- Who's that?.
- I used to work with him.

375
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,433
ROB: I'm going to be first. No cheating.

376
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,991
Ah.

377
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,157
- You got a head start.
- Ah, my toe. Stubbed my toe.

378
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,191
ROB: Who won the race?.
BOY: You.

379
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,591
ANGELA: Somebody's going to get caught.

380
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,074
- Whose clothes are whose?.
- Anyone else in here?.

381
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,076
ROB: No, no, you're safe.

382
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,634
Will you come out?.
Why are you hiding in there?.

383
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,148
Get out of there.
You've got the shampoo?.

384
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,428
Have l?.

385
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,472
ANGELA: Why do men's changing rooms
always smell of P-l-S-S?.

386
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,751
You're lucky, normally they smell of S-H-l-T.

387
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,199
What does that spell?.

388
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,231
(Laughter)

389
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,874
ROB: Right, clothes on. What's first?.
ANGELA: Come on. Let's get dressed.

390
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,398
ROB: Your coat. You're freezing.

391
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,911
- See you Monday.
- Excuse me.

392
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,311
See you Monday.

393
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,394
- Just the three.
- Danny.

394
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,833
Get his change right, Shirley.
He'll be watching the pennies.

395
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,871
It's not even May. You can't go
swimming outdoors this time of year.

396
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,798
I've got to get colder.
I'm going to Loch Lomond tomorrow.

397
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,276
- There's frost forecast.
- I think we should all do it, lend a bit of morale.

398
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,517
- I'll do it. What about you, Eddie?.
- Oh, yeah, count me in.

399
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,235
Not me. I support much better when I'm dry.
I'm more your dry kind of supporter.

400
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,999
- Nice cake, Norman.
- Yeah, less salt this time.

401
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,709
Here we go.

402
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,911
Come on, Eddie.

403
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,753
Where are you going?.

404
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,836
Eddie, come on in. You can do this.

405
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,436
DANNY: Hold on, Frank!

406
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,471
I'll be right with you.

407
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,555
Don't worry, son. It'll grow back.

408
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,955
It better had. I'm playing football later on.

409
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,355
Here we go, lads.
Nice cold beers to warm you up.

410
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,072
Cheers, Norman.

411
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,111
- Hey, sláinte.
- Sláinte.

412
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,277
The fire of the crucible.

413
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,312
- God, what is the fire of the crucible?.
- A Chinese proverb.

414
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,476
From now on you have to train in the cold.

415
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,557
Not only that, you have to swim
25 miles a week six days a week.

416
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,909
- (Laughs)
- Here, I've got one for you, Chan.

417
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,839
Man who walks through airport turnstile
sideways is going to Bangkok.

418
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,389
How did you know he's going to Bangkok?.

419
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,759
DANNY: Bang cock.

420
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,472
Bang cock.

421
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,355
We still need to get a hold of a boat
so we can support Frank in the water.

422
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,154
- I told you, Merv the Perv's got a boat.
- But do you think he'd let us have a go on it?.

423
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,078
I don't see why not.
He'd let you have a go with his wife.

424
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,354
Bang cock! Bang co...

425
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,231
(Laughter)

426
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,679
Oh, no, I can't.

427
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,917
I thought I could but I can't.
I'll see you at the bus stop.

428
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,188
MERV: Hey!

429
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,912
Hey, over here.

430
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,951
Come on.

431
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,231
Don't be shy, give it a try.

432
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,670
Merv, it's Frank. Can I have a word?.

433
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,920
Ooh, hiya, Frank.

434
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,520
- Hey, Vera, it's Frank.
- (Muffled) Oh, hello, Frank.

435
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,835
- Hi, Vera.
MERV: How's Joan?.

436
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,314
Joan's... She's fine. She's... Yeah.

437
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,679
(Muffled talk)

438
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,759
Oh, she's still after Joan's recipe
for that lemon cheesecake.

439
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,588
I'll remind her.
Listen, I'm sorry, is... Is this a bad time?.

440
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,473
- Cos I could come back later...
- No, no, it's great, Frank.

441
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,278
Norman says you've got a boat.
I was wondering if maybe we could..borrow it.

442
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,197
- I want to shag it.
- Merv probably has.

443
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,151
Are you sure you know what you're doing?.

444
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,953
Of course I do. I used to be in the sea cadets.

445
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,639
A bit different
to a leaky canoe on the Clyde, this.

446
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,116
- Don't worry, I'll be careful.
- Yeah, well, just make sure you are.

447
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,592
Are you not coming, Norman?.

448
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,713
Get on there with the missing link at the helm?.
You're joking, aren't you?.

449
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,436
No, I'll leave it till I find my sea legs.
Next time, maybe.

450
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
- Help!
- Slow down!

451
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,758
Right then.

452
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,791
(Engine won't start)

453
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,910
- Ah, you flooded it.
- I'll fix it. Just give us a minute.

454
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,951
Norman!

455
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,399
Help!

456
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,715
EDDlE: Norman!

457
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,318
(Engine starts)

458
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,518
Oh!

459
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,708
Oh, shite!

460
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,270
Bollocks!

461
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,078
Aaargh!

462
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,591
Keep your eye on that, will you?.

463
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,031
What's on your mind, son?.

464
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,631
- I've been thinking.
- What with?.

465
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,430
I was thinking...
I could have a go at the Channel, too.

466
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,994
- Yeah?.
- Yeah.

467
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,678
What do you think?.

468
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,551
Do you think you're up to it?.

469
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,114
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

470
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,355
- Yeah?.
- Definitely.

471
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,638
DANNY: All right, Rob?.

472
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,477
Evening, Janine.

473
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,353
Pint of lager,
eight packets of crisps, assorted flavours,

474
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,595
no prawn cocktail, two pork pies,

475
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,234
three ham sandwiches,
and a pint of Guinness, please.

476
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,829
I'm in training, swimming.
I've got to bulk up.

477
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,235
- You're swimming?.
- Training.

478
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,396
But I'm getting mentally prepared.

479
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,078
I'm in mental training.

480
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,795
- So how's things with you, then?.
- The same.

481
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,916
How is the big fella?.

482
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,188
What?.

483
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,198
Your little boy?.
He fell on his arse the last time I saw you.

484
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,275
Oh, yeah.

485
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,039
He's all right. He does it all the time.

486
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,153
- He bounces back quick enough.
- Oh, yeah. They're very bouncy, kids.

487
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,954
Like balls or castles. Still...

488
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,754
It's got to be the most difficult job in the world,
that, being a dad.

489
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,791
Probably why mine left us.

490
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,748
But you don't miss what you never had, do you?.

491
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,230
Make sure you stay in front of him, Frank.

492
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,352
If the water suddenly gets warm,
that'll be Danny.

493
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,036
- How many have you eaten?.
- Just the one.

494
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,672
Well, get rid of it.

495
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,919
Right, OK.

496
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,590
Don't do anything stupid.
If you get into trouble, go to the boat. Yeah?.

497
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,598
All right. Now remember, we're not superheroes.

498
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,756
- I hear you. I'm good.
- OK, let's go.

499
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,109
What's that?.

500
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,957
Jellyfish.

501
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,312
They're fine. They're fine.

502
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,709
Come on!

503
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,711
- It's colder than last time.
- Slow down.

504
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,991
DANNY: Come on, here we go.
FRANK: Right, hey, Danny.

505
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,031
- Watch this.
- Pace yourself.

506
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,400
TAPE: You are king of the jungle.

507
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,991
I am a lion.

508
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,230
Now repeat after me...

509
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,631
(Gasping)

510
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,031
Right, there you go, Frank.

511
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,554
Why can't they just hold onto the boat and get it?.

512
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,752
Frank wants to do it right.
If they touch the boat, the swim won't count.

513
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,512
Now repeat after me,
you are not a man, you are a wolf.

514
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,279
(Tape on fast rewind)

515
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,071
(Car horn)

516
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,348
- Eddie! He's got cramp.
- Start the boat, Chan. Start the boat.

517
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,278
Danny! Danny, hold on!

518
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,958
- Danny!
- Hold on, Danny!

519
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,877
(Engine won't start)

520
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,312
It won't start.

521
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,072
It's OK. Calm down. Take it easy.

522
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,239
- What did the doctor say?.
- It's fine.

523
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,477
The doctor says he's going to be all right,
no thanks to you.

524
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,715
He looks to you like a dad.

525
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,512
You should have stopped him.

526
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,389
- It wasn't Frank's fault, Ma.
- I will not have him go in the water again.

527
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,078
Ma, it was my own fault.

528
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,071
I just wanted to be the man for once.

529
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,397
Olympic superstar, Nike sponsorship.

530
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,670
Just be the man, you know?.

531
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,911
Like you.

532
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,790
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

533
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,917
I was when I found out
it was Eddie that gave me the kiss of life.

534
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,992
- Are you going training now?.
- Mm.

535
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,270
Put some down for me, will you?.

536
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,790
He can help out. On the boat or something.

537
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,677
But he wears a lifejacket
if he's anywhere near you.

538
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,076
- So his mother's not too happy, then?.
- I should have stopped him.

539
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,429
Remember you stopped Rob swimming in here?.

540
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,959
Yeah, he was seven.

541
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,356
He cursed like mad when I pulled him out
because his mates were watching.

542
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,231
Jumped right back in again.

543
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,317
Ah, you know,
if I had disobeyed my father at that age,

544
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,351
he'd have beat the hell out of me.

545
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,271
But I loved him.

546
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,198
I've never hit Rob.

547
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,958
Ever. Not once.

548
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,398
We never can find two words
to say to each other.

549
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,750
Seems like everything's backwards.

550
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,033
FRANK: That's us.

551
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,993
CHAN: Frank, you need to build up
your stamina so we need to go for a big one.

552
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,508
CHAN: 1 5 miles, OK?.
FRANK: OK.

553
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,348
CHAN: Have you been for a medical.
FRANK: Yeah, I got the all-clear.

554
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,873
Why don't we just take a chance
and go down to Dover?.

555
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,229
It's a long way to go if we don't find somebody.

556
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,989
You said yourself,
if we don't find a pilot, you can't swim.

557
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,793
OK. OK. I'll go there later this week.

558
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,877
I'll come for the ride.
Get a saver, should be cheap enough.

559
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,311
Take Danny, too.
Make sure he brings his water wings this time.

560
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,598
It said "apply thickly".

561
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,791
EDDlE: Maybe we overdid it.

562
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,231
- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

563
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,918
Was it the lorry?.

564
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,269
But he swerved first. Lunatic!

565
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,394
Mrs Redmond, you need to be more...
I'll let you go one more time.

566
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,194
There.

567
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,634
Right, I've just had a word with the barmaid.

568
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,513
Apparently there is a guy that can do it.

569
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,949
Goes by the name of Mad Bob.

570
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,353
Mad Bob?.

571
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,436
He doesn't sound normal.

572
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,278
He sounds frigging nuts. Is he here?.

573
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,117
You looking for a boat?.

574
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,390
- We might be.
- Either you are or you're not.

575
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,669
We are.

576
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,837
- So it's you that's going to be swimming?.
- Mm-hm.

577
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,515
If you can't beat me,
you ain't the man to do the swim.

578
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,231
And I ain't the man to take you.

579
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,150
I take it you're Mad Bob?.

580
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,439
We go on three.

581
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,229
One...

582
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,118
..two...

583
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,671
three!

584
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,029
BOB: 850 the crossing. 200 deposit.

585
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,752
No refunds.

586
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,155
But we get to see your boat?.

587
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,428
What for?.

588
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,869
We get to see the boat.

589
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,150
Righty-ho, you get to see the boat.

590
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,277
Shark.

591
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,673
35-footer.

592
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,633
Fell off my bike. Two-wheeler.

593
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,032
FRANK: Let's go.

594
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,311
BOB: There she is.

595
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,238
Is this yours?.

596
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,672
FRANK: It's all right.

597
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,839
It's good.

598
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,269
Yeah, very nice.

599
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,629
CHAN: There you go, fellas.
FRANK: What date is it?.

600
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,910
EDDlE: 22nd June.
CHAN: Aye, it's the 22nd.

601
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,748
NORMAN: Hang on. Is that a two or a five?.
- You sure?.

602
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,791
Yeah, it's the 22nd.

603
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,309
ROB: One...two...three!

604
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,952
(Cheering)

605
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,956
Forthey are jolly good fellows

606
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,389
For they are jolly good fellows

607
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,553
For they are jolly good fellows

608
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,591
And so say all of us

609
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,439
And so say all of us

610
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,675
- Where were you?.
- Sorry, I got held up.

611
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,109
- I'll get you some food.
- No, it's fine, I've...

612
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,151
And a nice big piece of cake.

613
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,749
- Were you waiting for me?.
- They were.

614
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,872
It's fine. It worked out better.
Come on, let's go crazy.

615
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,911
(Shrieking)

616
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,679
Hey!

617
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,593
Here.

618
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,676
So what did you get them?.

619
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,599
The kids?. Since when did I do the shopping?.
Your mother likes to get those things.

620
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,468
You got them those racetracks.

621
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,909
Mum still does that thing
where she signs the card

622
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,633
and makes it look like you've signed it, too.

623
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,392
How's the swimming coming on?.

624
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,273
I heard you are going to swim
the English Channel.

625
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,678
- I didn't tell her.
- You were right not to.

626
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,392
- Why?.
- Because you heard wrong.

627
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,990
I heard that Danny parked Merv's boat
halfway up the beach

628
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,952
and that you are planning
to swim the Channel this summer.

629
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,195
Danny gets carried away.

630
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,629
- Saw you down the library.
- I like reading.

631
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,989
- Saw you down the pool.
- I like swimming.

632
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,630
What?.

633
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,109
I'm going to get some jelly
before it's all gone.

634
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,635
You can have another go, can't you?.

635
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,240
I just can't seem to concentrate lately.

636
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,398
- You told him at last, then?.
- No, it's not that. It's...something else.

637
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,151
I think he might be having an affair.

638
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,672
But he's acting so odd.

639
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,871
- I'm sorry, that's just daft. I mean...
- Well, there's Vera.

640
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,319
(Michelle laughs)

641
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,920
It's not funny.
She rang last week and...

642
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,713
It's probably just got something
to do with the boat.

643
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,115
- What boat?.
- The boat.

644
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,391
The lads are borrowing a boat
to help Frank swim the Channel.

645
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,719
What channel?.

646
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,996
Thank you.

647
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,716
- Nice.
- Mm.

648
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,629
You know we were talking about buying a car?.

649
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,433
Hm, I fixed the wing mirror back on.

650
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,715
Well, Michelle says
Arthur Hall is selling his Metro. It's red.

651
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,593
- Thought we said a new car could wait?.
- No, we didn't. You did.

652
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,239
Well, we have to be careful
with the money from now on.

653
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,317
Michelle says the insides are just like new.

654
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,311
She also says you've been borrowing Merv's
boat to help you train to swim the Channel.

655
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,876
The English Channel. And I was wondering
when you were thinking about telling me.

656
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,351
I was also wondering how it is
we can't afford a new car

657
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,393
but you can afford to pay for a boat
to show you the way to bloody France.

658
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,791
I'd be worried about you trying to swim
all that way, Frank, if I wasn 't so angry.

659
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,396
I've never asked you for anything, Frank.
But honesty was something I took for granted.

660
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,353
Well, look who it is - the three wise monkeys.

661
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,518
Rob, your dad's got a few more lengths to do.
Why don't we wait for him outside?.

662
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,916
I know about his little secret.
I just want to talk to him, all right?.

663
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,949
- Come on.
- Eddie...

664
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,989
Hey!

665
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,271
You're a liar, Dad.

666
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,153
You lied to me about swimming the Channel.

667
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,150
- Maybe I did.
- Why?.

668
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,074
- Is it because I don't have a job?.
- It's not about you.

669
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,874
Because I look after the twins?.
I'm not ashamed of that, Dad.

670
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,275
I'm not ashamed like you think I should be.

671
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,754
Good. You're not ashamed.

672
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,791
No, but you are.

673
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,831
You're the one who's ashamed!

674
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,993
- I'm not listening to this.
- Why?. What are you afraid of?.

675
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,634
Afraid I'll drown?. Look at me, I'm drowning.

676
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,513
36 years.

677
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,831
36 years.

678
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,440
1 2 hours a day, five days a week.

679
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,712
Now you tell me,
when was I supposed to go shopping?.

680
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,751
(Coughs)

681
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,155
He'll be OK. Just needs time to cool off.

682
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,115
We need to make sure you keep up the times.

683
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,310
- No.
- What?.

684
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,349
No.

685
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,672
- I can't do it.
EDDlE: But, Frank...

686
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,517
I can't do it.

687
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,233
FRANK: He's right.
- Come on, Frank. Come on.

688
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,475
I'm not going to be swimming.

689
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,231
(Turns engine off)

690
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,395
Your father didn't mean to hurt you.

691
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,751
I was married once.

692
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,429
Her name was Bridget.

693
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,789
She left me for a jam salesman.

694
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,954
She never even liked jam.

695
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,189
I didn't bother with women again after that.

696
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,913
I was too scared
the same thing would happen all over.

697
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,277
If anyone tried to get close,
I just pushed them away.

698
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,790
Your father did the same thing with you
after the accident.

699
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,353
Pushed you away.

700
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,957
He blames me.

701
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,076
No, he doesn't.

702
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,634
He blames himself. Always has.

703
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,472
Now you're soaking the seat
and it's leather. It'll stain.

704
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,358
All that way, Frank.

705
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,516
I thought we were too old for secrets.

706
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,189
Like learning how to drive a bus?.

707
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,434
There was an ad in the paper.

708
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,871
I failed twice.

709
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,757
But I'm going to take it again.
I'm not giving up.

710
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,511
Let's just play when it smashes.

711
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,278
All right, you ready?.
You take that one, all right?.

712
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,474
ANGELA: We're not catching the train, James.

713
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,717
There's no point in racing,
I've got the keys, remember.

714
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,989
- (Whispers) Pappy?.
- Sh!

715
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,478
- Are you playing a game?.
- Yeah.

716
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,830
ANGELA: Don't make me come back out.
- You better go inside.

717
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,675
- Is it a secret?.
- Yeah.

718
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,676
Like Daddy's wee brother?.

719
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,994
He says we mustn't talk about him.
That it makes you sad.

720
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,557
Does it make you sad?.

721
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,636
Sometimes.

722
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,835
- I won't tell.
- Good boy.

723
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,831
Are you going to swim the Channel?.

724
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,074
I don't know. What do you think?.

725
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,190
Dad says it's too dangerous.

726
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,596
What is the Channel?.

727
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,599
It's the sea between England and France.

728
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,750
Are there any...sharks?.

729
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,631
No sharks.

730
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,638
- Crocodiles?.
- Mm-mn.

731
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,830
- Piranhas?.
- Bananas?.

732
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,111
- Piranhas?.
- Piranhas!

733
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,276
No, no piranhas.

734
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,834
It doesn't sound too dangerous to me, then.

735
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,871
ANGELA: I'll count to five.

736
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,475
I can swim like a fish.

737
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,712
ANGELA: Are you stopping out here all day
or are you coming in?.

738
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,594
Hey, big man, you not swimming?.

739
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,389
Yes!

740
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,834
That's £5 you owe me. I told you he'd be here.

741
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,592
We're the delegation.

742
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,756
A delegation?.

743
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,679
- It's a kind of a gang.
- Thanks for that, Danny.

744
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,990
Does the delegation have a proposal?.

745
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,917
EDDlE: Yeah.

746
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,791
We think you're wrong to give up.

747
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,831
Now we've come this far.

748
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,596
- We also think you're a big daft bollocks...
- See him?.

749
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,517
See that little laddie with red hair?.

750
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,429
It takes everything out of him
just to swim one width. Just one.

751
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,789
He won't take any help and he never gives up.

752
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,119
Ever.

753
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,593
- And when he gets to the other side...
- Yes!

754
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,191
I'm not giving up.

755
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,552
That toilet needs cleaning again.

756
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,759
Do it yourself.

757
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,037
He's on his knees and she's...

758
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,071
Take it steady.

759
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,069
All right, ladies?. Pam.

760
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,270
- Oh, my God!
- All right, love?.

761
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,993
- You nearly finished?.
- Uh-huh.

762
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,031
Only I thought we might go out.

763
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,998
You mean together?.

764
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,675
Oh, aye. You and me. Me and you.

765
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,794
Excuse me.

766
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,837
Please don't drop the bags.

767
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,154
They split.

768
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,479
Oh, aye?.

769
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,352
Sorry, pal.

770
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,356
- See you Wednesday.
- See you Wednesday.

771
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,399
I nearly drowned.

772
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,829
- We heard.
- In the sea.

773
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,759
- What were you doing in the sea?.
- I don't know.

774
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,438
Do you want to go out with me?.

775
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,513
Yeah!

776
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,516
Good.

777
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,152
That's good.

778
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,991
Happy days.

779
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,512
(Shipping forecast on radio)

780
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,555
You smell of chlorine.

781
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,068
Like Dad when he was laid out.

782
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,119
He used to smell of oil and Woodbines.

783
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,791
I was 1 6.

784
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,509
You came round to talk to Dad about something.

785
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,275
I couldn't believe how handsome you were.

786
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,915
I'm learning to drive a bus.

787
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,717
And then, if I pass, I'm going to drive a bus.

788
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,115
It'll be my job, a proper job.

789
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,631
Driving a bus.

790
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,031
I'm going up.

791
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,037
So should you. You have a big day tomorrow.

792
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,595
Thanks for the sandwiches.

793
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,872
Good luck.

794
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,675
That...time when I came to see your father...

795
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,754
I didn't.

796
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,517
I came to see you.

797
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,156
DANNY: I spy with my little eye...

798
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,953
- You'll never get this. A.
FRANK: Air freshener.

799
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,399
EDDlE: Ambulance.
- No.

800
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,556
- You might get it, Norman.
NORMAN: Why?.

801
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,558
Because you're nearer it.
You could say you're on it.

802
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,352
- I'm on it?.
- Kind of.

803
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,753
EDDlE: Arse.
- No.

804
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,268
You'd have that as well.
Unless it was Norman's arse.

805
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,437
NORMAN: Leave my arse out of this.
DANNY: And that would be N-A.

806
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,231
(Gulls cry)

807
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,434
- You OK with heights?.
- Yeah.

808
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,030
- You?.
- Oh, yeah.

809
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,071
- You sure?.
- Mm-hm.

810
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,709
FRANK: I was thinking about Joan.
I should have told her.

811
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,831
Don't know what I was hiding.

812
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,595
- Maybe we should leave him alone.
- Why?. We should be there for him.

813
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,349
- What if he doesn't want us there?.
- Oh, you're as pig-headed as your father.

814
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,234
Of course he wants us there.
He just doesn't know how to ask.

815
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,511
- But he's not going to achieve anything by it.
- How do you know?.

816
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,439
Because he's not going to bring Stuart back
by swimming the Channel.

817
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,515
Oh, Rob.

818
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,438
It's not Stuart he wants back.

819
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,919
I'm away.

820
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,590
- Mum, thanks for the toys.
- It's OK.

821
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,351
What toys?.

822
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,513
(Fart)

823
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,757
DANNY: Better out than in, right?.
EDDlE: For God's sake!

824
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,117
NORMAN: One more of them
and you're sleeping in the car.

825
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,071
(Sniggering)

826
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,715
FRANK: I knew a guy once
could fart in German.

827
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,751
(Laughter)

828
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,917
You took your time.

829
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,631
I'm sitting in the front.

830
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,315
The observer fellow seems all right.

831
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,955
Right, it's five o'clock. Let's get cracking.

832
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,595
OK, don't forget, don't touch the boat
or anyone on it once you get going

833
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,596
or it will invalidate your swim.

834
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,392
When you get to France, get on dry land,

835
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,715
pick up a stone and bring it back to the boat.

836
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,512
OK.

837
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,028
- Good luck.
- Thank you. Thank you.

838
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,949
Well, go.

839
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,956
- Good luck, mate.
- Good luck, Frank.

840
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,116
Thanks, lads.

841
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,354
Right.

842
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,634
See yous.

843
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,434
- You're not joining us?.
- No, I don't float very well.

844
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,516
Me, neither.

845
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,269
OK.

846
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,231
(Boat's engine starts up)

847
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,629
Come on, Frank.

848
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,477
That's the way.

849
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,628
Ah, we'll be there in no time, Frank.

850
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,311
It's a nice rhythm, that.

851
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,752
One, two, three, four...

852
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,754
I'm all right, Frank. I'm all right. Carry on.

853
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,318
- You passed, didn't you?.
- I thought you'd never ask.

854
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,432
Well done, Mum.
Congratulations, that's brilliant!

855
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,835
JOAN: I think we should celebrate
with a gum drop.

856
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,273
- The fumes are killing me.
- I can't help that.

857
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,920
I'm keeping this close to keep you on course.

858
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,636
FRANK: I can't breathe.

859
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,353
- I'll go ahead.
- Well, what bloody use will I be then?.

860
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,638
Stupid bastard. Bloody fool.

861
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,840
TAPE: I am confident.

862
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,190
- I am confident.
- I am a lion.

863
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,629
I am a lion.
I'm not a timorous beastie.

864
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,830
I am a lion.

865
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,710
EDDlE: He's doing great.
- No, he's not.

866
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,797
At this rate he's not going to make it to the cap
before the ebb tide.

867
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,479
And if he doesn't,
he's going to get swept back out to sea.

868
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,511
- lsn't that being bleak?.
- No, he's right.

869
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,632
BOB: Look, I'll pick up the pace
and he's going to have to keep up.

870
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,636
CHAN: Better do some hypothermia checks.

871
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,398
Can we get closer to him?.

872
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,478
Frank, where are you swimming from?.

873
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,839
England.

874
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,509
- Where in England?.
- Dover.

875
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,438
- What day is it?.
- What?.

876
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,439
- What day is it?.
- Thursday.

877
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,913
He seems all right.

878
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,397
Come on.

879
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,228
I didn't think to ask
where in France he was swimming to.

880
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,716
- There. That's where he's swimming to.
ANGELA: How do you know?.

881
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,069
- Pappy showed me.
- When did Pappy show you?.

882
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,951
I'm not telling you.

883
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,635
BOB: How many times did you try it yourself?.

884
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,079
Three.

885
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,839
- Did you ever make it?.
- Third time lucky.

886
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,871
(Gulls cry)

887
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,836
There it is. Sortie - way out.

888
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,429
- What is it?.
- Ebb tide.

889
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,190
BOB: It's dragging him back out.
EDDlE: What if he can't beat it?.

890
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:39,358
- Can't you do anything?.
- He's in for the long haul.

891
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,834
- He won't be able to last that long.
- Yes, he will.

892
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,791
CHAN: His body temperature is dropping.

893
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,434
If he doesn't make this beach,
he won't make it at all.

894
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,638
EDDlE: Frank!

895
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,319
You've only three miles to go, Frank.

896
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,999
I know you're hurting,
but you got to swim faster.

897
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,953
The tide's against you.
Frank, you've got to swim faster. Come on!

898
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,116
You can do it, Frank.

899
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,151
You can do it.

900
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,991
(Gulls cry)

901
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,592
(Yells in frustration)

902
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,352
FRANK: Stay there! Stay there! Don't move!
Don't you move from there.

903
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,355
(Whimpering)

904
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,677
Stop that. Stop it!

905
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,711
(Gulls cry)

906
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,556
(Gasps)

907
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,995
Come on, Frank, come on.

908
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,231
No!

909
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,038
Is he all right?.

910
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,399
(Yells)

911
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,557
(Joan cries)

912
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,511
(Yells)

913
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,399
Bloody hell!

914
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,199
I need to come out, lads.

915
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,398
What do you think you're doing?.

916
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,716
Why don't you just take it slower for a wee while,
see if it passes?.

917
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,830
I'm sorry, Chan.

918
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,916
I can't do it, mate.

919
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,315
You're nearly there. Look it's not far.

920
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,554
I can't do it.

921
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,751
OBSERVER: Your body is hurting
because you're burning your fat.

922
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,677
It won't last. You'll get through it.

923
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,712
Yeah, Frank. It's just the pain barrier.
It's all in your mind.

924
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,309
- Get me out! It's too far.
- Bollocks! It's always been this far.

925
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,239
- You come in and swim it, then!
- Fine. Get on board and we all can go home.

926
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,113
All my life I've looked up to you, Frank.

927
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,559
All my life.

928
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,149
- I never saw you back down from anything.
- It's too far.

929
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,158
I'm nobody but you know that.

930
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,873
But I'm not daft. I see what's going on here.

931
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,231
Out here in the middle of nowhere.

932
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,508
But he's not here, is he, Frank?.

933
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,791
He never was.

934
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,789
It's taken you 23 years to find that out.

935
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,839
So what now?.

936
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,591
Well, I'll tell you what now.

937
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,879
You get back to swimming
and you shut up about how far it is.

938
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,229
And you shut up about how much it hurts.

939
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,953
Because you don't have a choice.
You never did.

940
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,676
So, come on.

941
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,915
Get stuck in and put some down.

942
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,951
We're wasting time.

943
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,311
I'll go on, then.

944
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,954
ANGELA: It's him!

945
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,352
No, I can't see for sure but...

946
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,436
- Yeah, that's Frank!
JOAN: Let me see!

947
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,035
Right there. Look. Can you see him?.

948
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,635
Come on. Let's go.

949
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,477
Come on, I need to be there, Mum.

950
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,556
Come on, Mum!

951
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,999
My God!

952
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,668
If he touches him before he gets out of the water
the swim won't be recognised.

953
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,554
- Don't, Rob!
- Don't touch him!

954
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,271
Frank!

955
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,110
Let him get out the water!

956
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,192
What's he want?.

957
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,117
Oh, God!

958
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,748
What?.

959
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,469
Did I miss something?.

960
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,591
- Yes!
- Yes!

961
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,434
Yes!

962
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,511
Come on.

963
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,430
DANNY: We did it! We swam the Channel!

964
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,479
Norman!

965
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,791
I took the ferry.

966
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,714
Get the stone. Get the stone.

967
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,432
Pick up a stone.

968
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,277
Yes!

1
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,967
# And keep your retirement #

2
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:18,639
#And your so-called
social security #

3
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,606
# Big city, turn me loose
and set me free... #

4
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,162
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

5
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,456
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,624
Yeah.

7
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,917
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,170
Shep said you'd be here
at 7:30. What gives, man?

9
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:51,005
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,256
We've been
sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,008
He's peed
three times already.

12
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:57,094
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,347
It was a mix-up,
I guess.

14
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,681
You got the car?

15
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,016
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,727
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

17
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,271
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,190
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,484
This is my associate,
Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:12,985
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,530
So, we all set
on this thing, then?

22
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,406
Sure, Jerry. We're all
set. Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,866
Yeah, no,
I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,284
Shep vouched
for you and all.

25
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:23,204
I got every confidence
here in you fellas.

26
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,169
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,295
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,672
No,
that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:33,798
Huh?

30
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,259
The new vehicle
plus $40,000.

31
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,928
Yeah, but the deal
was the car first,

32
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,306
then the 40,000, like
as if it was the ransom.

33
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:43,474
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,101
Shep didn't
tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,227
Well, okay...

36
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,479
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

37
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,147
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:51,732
Yeah, you already
said that.

39
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,403
Yeah, but it's not a
whole pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:59,657
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

41
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,242
I'm not gonna
debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,326
Okay.

43
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,495
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

44
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,621
I will say
this, though.

45
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,374
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,502
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,171
You want your own
wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,298
Yeah.

49
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,342
You...

50
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,303
My point is,

51
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:23,222
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:27,184
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,561
It's like robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,854
It doesn't
make any sense.

55
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,149
Okay, see, it's not
me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,110
The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,904
Her dad,
he's real well-off.

58
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,363
Now, I'm in a bit
of trouble.

59
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,907
What kind of
trouble you in, Jerry?

60
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,744
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,245
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,456
Now, her dad,
he's real well-off.

63
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,249
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

64
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,709
Or your fucking wife,
you know?

65
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,210
Or your
fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:54,503
Well...

67
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:57,340
It's all part of this...

68
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,010
They don't know
I need it, see?

69
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,305
Okay, so there's that. And even
if they did, I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,890
so there's that
on top, then.

71
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,224
See, these are
personal matters.

72
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,309
Personal matters?

73
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:11,312
Yeah, personal matters
that needn't...

74
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,314
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:17,401
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

76
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:18,986
You won't...

77
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,783
Fuck it. Let's take
a look at that Cierra.

78
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,000
Hon?

79
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,753
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

80
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,672
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,423
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41,175
Dad's here.

83
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:46,722
Leads the Badgers in goal
production with five this year.

84
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:47,932
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,100
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:50,184
What you
watching there?

87
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,310
Gophers.

88
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,770
Who they playing?

89
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:53,896
Ooh!

90
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,238
Is he staying
for supper, then?

91
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,031
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,741
Dad?
What?

93
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,118
Are you staying
for supper?

94
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,327
Yeah.

95
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,044
May I be
excused?

96
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,129
You done there?

97
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,630
Uh-huh.
I'm going out.

98
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:21,465
Where are you going?
Just out.

99
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,717
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,468
Back at 9:30.
Okay.

101
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,304
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

102
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,974
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,559
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,310
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,187
What do you think
they do there?

106
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,314
They don't drink milk
shakes, I assure you.

107
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,899
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,325
Wade, have you had
a chance to think about

109
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
that deal I was
talking about,

110
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,662
those 40 acres there,
in Wayzata?

111
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,164
You told me about it.

112
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,166
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

113
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,667
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:59,670
It's a heck of a lot. What did
you say you were gonna put there?

115
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,047
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,590
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,841
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,927
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:08,846
Yeah, well,
it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,974
I had a couple lots, late
50s. Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,684
A lot of money.
Yeah, but the difference...

122
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,936
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,272
He passes on this stuff
before it gets kicked up to me.

124
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,900
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice. "
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,985
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,281
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:30,159
Jean and Scotty
never have to worry.

128
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,967
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
What?

130
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,430
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,226
What are you, nuts? We
had pancakes for breakfast.

132
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,894
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,562
and a beer
and a steak, maybe.

134
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,065
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,072
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,408
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,160
We can stop
outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,579
I know a place there where we
can get laid. What do you think?

139
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,581
I'm fucking
hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,335
Yeah, yeah, Jesus. I'm saying
we can stop, get pancakes,

141
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,838
and then we'll
get laid, all right?

142
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,098
Lou Diamond, ¡ine one.

143
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,185
We sat
right here in this room

144
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,728
and went over
this and over this.

145
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,855
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,858
I sat right here and said
I didn't want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,943
Yeah, but I'm saying
that TruCoat.

148
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,028
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:49,613
It'll cost you a heck
of a lot more than $500.

150
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:50,781
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:51,907
You're talking
in circles.

152
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,826
You're talking like we
didn't go over this already.

153
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,994
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,204
We had a deal
here for 19,500.

155
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,998
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,791
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,793
without the sealant,
for 19,500.

158
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,336
All right,
I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,963
You called me
20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,756
you had it ready
to make delivery.

161
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,466
You says, "Come on down and get it. "

162
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:13,679
And here you are, and you're
wasting my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:16,682
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:18,767
All right.

165
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,395
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,859
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

167
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,362
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:33,699
These guys here.
These guys.

169
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,578
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,542
You going to
the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,127
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,588
You wouldn't have
an extra ticket?

173
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,049
You kidding?

174
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:52,968
Well,

175
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,514
he never
done this before,

176
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,351
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

177
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:03,354
he says I can knock
$100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,482
100?

179
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,526
You lied to me,
Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,362
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,072
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,741
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,326
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,954
Where's my
goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,664
Let's get this
over with.

186
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,291
Where is it?

187
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:03,497
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,918
I am talking
about your potential.

189
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:09,003
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,714
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,132
Yeah.

192
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,551
Yet you're getting
C grades.

193
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,929
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

194
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,014
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,433
You know
what a disparity is?

196
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,559
Yeah!

197
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,769
Okay! Well,
that's why we...

198
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:28,147
We don't want you
going out for hockey.

199
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,565
Oh, man!

200
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,567
Come on. What's the big
deal? It's just an hour...

201
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,444
Hold on.

202
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:34,778
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:35,946
Hello?

204
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,823
Yeah, hiya, hon.
Oh, hi, Dad.

205
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:38,991
Is Jerry around?

206
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,951
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:42,286
Yeah, I'll catch him
for you.

208
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,495
Hon!
Yeah?

209
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,164
It's Dad.
Okay.

210
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:47,207
Look, Dad,
there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,292
Scotty!

212
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,711
Hey, let's watch
that language there.

213
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:51,962
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,130
What's going on there?

215
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:55,591
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,718
Stan Grossman
looked at your proposal.

217
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,094
He says
it's pretty sweet.

218
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,179
No kidding?

219
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,472
Might be interested.

220
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:05,893
No kidding? I'd need the
cash pretty quick there,

221
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,478
in order to
close the deal.

222
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,188
Come by at 2:30.
We'¡ta¡k about it.

223
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:12,316
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.

224
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,234
Stan, you know, Grossman.
Yeah.

225
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,319
2:30.

226
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,528
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,170
Say, Shep,
how you doing there?

228
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:35,172
Say, you know
those two fellas

229
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,924
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,675
I put you in
touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,469
Yeah, well, he had
a buddy there.

232
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,720
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:42,888
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,182
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,850
Carl something.

236
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:48,352
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,397
Well, that's okay. He's a buddy
of the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,898
so I'm not worried.
I just...

239
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,401
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

240
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:59,405
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

241
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,448
Something's happening, see.
Call him up.

242
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,952
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

243
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:08,205
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

244
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,289
Nope.

245
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,208
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,793
Real good, then.

247
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,482
Can you crack a fucking
window open, man?

248
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:41,321
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:43,407
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,327
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

251
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:48,996
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,126
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,837
or John Hancock building,
whatever.

254
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,465
You ever been
to Minneapolis?

255
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,674
No.

256
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,762
Would it kill you
to say something?

257
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,598
I did.

258
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:12,019
"No. " That's the first thing
you've said in the last four hours.

259
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,854
That's a...

260
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:16,523
That's a fountain
of conversation, man.

261
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,275
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,153
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,114
Shit.

264
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,949
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,409
I'm doing
all the driving, man,

266
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,203
whole fucking way
from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,997
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,666
You know,
keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:35,834
fight the boredom
of the road,

270
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,088
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,218
Oh, fuck it. I don't
have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,094
See how you like it.

273
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,892
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,353
Two could play at
that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,730
We'll just see
how you like it.

276
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,776
Total silence.

277
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,448
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

278
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,658
How are you this morning?

279
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,034
Real good.
How you doing?

280
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,536
Pretty good,
Mr. Lundegaard.

281
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,663
You're damn hard
to get on the phone.

282
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:15,165
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

283
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,291
We¡, that's for sure.

284
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,293
Now, I just need
on these ¡ast,

285
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,420
these financing documents
that you sent us,

286
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,673
I can't read the
seria¡numbers of the vehic¡es.

287
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,049
Yeah, but I already
got the...

288
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,551
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,386
I already got the...
What? The...

290
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,720
Yeah, the 320,000.

291
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,264
You got the money
¡ast month.

292
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,723
Yeah, so we're all
set, then.

293
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:34,017
Yeah, but the vehic¡es
that you're borrowing on,

294
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,020
I just can't read the
seria¡numbers on your application.

295
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,272
Maybe if you
could just read...

296
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,398
Yeah, but the deal's
already done.

297
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:40,607
I already got the money.

298
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,150
Yes, but if we have
an audit here,

299
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,610
I just have to know
that these vehic¡es

300
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,028
you're financing
with this money,

301
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,405
that they really exist.

302
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,699
Yeah, well,
they exist, all right.

303
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:50,450
I'm sure they do,

304
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:53,912
but I can't read the seria¡numbers
here, so if you could read me...

305
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,957
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,834
I don't have
them in front of me.

307
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,377
Why don't I just
fax you over a copy?

308
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,045
No, we¡, no,
fax is no good.

309
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,131
That's what ¡have, and I
can't read the darn thing.

310
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,967
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:10,387
Okay, because if I can't corre¡ate
this note with the specific vehicles,

312
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,514
then I got to
call back that money.

313
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,974
Yeah, how much
money was that?

314
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:16,977
320, 000. I got to correlate that money

315
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,520
with the cars
it's being lent on.

316
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,731
Yeah. Okay, no problem. I'll
just fax that right over.

317
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:21,773
No, no, no. Fax...

318
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,650
I mean, send it over. I'll
shoot it right over to you, then.

319
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:24,860
Okay, okay. Fine.

320
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,820
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,162
We're back with Katie Car¡son.
Hi.

322
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:36,288
Now, before
we get going here,

323
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,373
we just want to remind
a¡of our viewers at home

324
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,542
that this March, for
the second year in a row,

325
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,919
Katie and ¡, along
with Twin City Travel,

326
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,589
will be leading a two-week
riverboat trip down the Ni¡e.

327
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,466
It's a terrific time. I
know you've heard about it.

328
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,802
We want all of you
to come with,

329
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,512
and that's the truth.

330
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,224
Okay, now, for those of
you that just joined us,

331
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,768
Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us

332
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:00,937
how to make Holidazzle
eggs ourse¡ves, at home.

333
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,856
Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
What?

334
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,442
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

335
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:06,485
Right.

336
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,611
This is an empty egg.

337
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:08,904
That's right, Dale.

338
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:09,988
Well, how do you
get the egg...

339
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,281
There was an egg in here, right? Yeah.

340
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:14,201
Okay, well, I don't... How do
you... I mean, you don't have

341
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,245
an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?

342
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,372
No, no.

343
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:21,041
I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...

344
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:37,307
Unguent.

345
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:38,392
What?

346
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,227
I need unguent.

347
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,818
No.

348
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,952
No...

349
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,435
You want to do it?

350
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,728
Push.

351
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,748
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,750
Good to see you
again, Jerry.

353
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,419
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:30,921
Those numbers
are right, all right.

355
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,047
Believe me.

356
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,256
This is doable.

357
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:34,591
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,551
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,721
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:41,556
Huh?

361
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:44,351
The financials
are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:47,312
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

363
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,772
My fee?

364
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,441
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:52,901
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,820
Yeah.
We're good to load in.

367
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:56,321
Yeah.

368
00:20:56,405 --> 00:21:00,033
But we never talked about
your fee for bringing it to us.

369
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,452
No, but, Wade, see, I
was bringing you this deal

370
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,954
for you to loan me
the money to put in.

371
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:05,914
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,252
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

373
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,545
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,505
You're saying...

375
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,173
What are you saying?

376
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:16,508
You're saying
we put in all the money,

377
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,009
and you collect
when it pays off.

378
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,597
No, no. See... But I'd...

379
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,308
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

380
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:28,061
Heck, I'd go
one over prime?

381
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:29,563
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:31,690
If I wanted bank
interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:34,776
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,194
He's at North Star.
He's at...

385
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,238
No, no. See, I...

386
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,117
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,744
Finder's fee is,
what, 10%?

388
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,288
Heck, that's not
gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,497
I need the principal.

390
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:50,834
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,335
What the heck
were you thinking?

392
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,712
If I'm only
getting bank interest,

393
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:56,590
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,133
I don't see nothing
like that here.

395
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,759
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,847
Okay. I...

397
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,682
I guarantee you
your money back.

398
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:08,977
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,270
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

400
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,063
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:15,108
Well, look. I don't want
to cut you out of the loop,

402
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,569
but this here's
a good deal.

403
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,988
I assume,
if you're not interested,

404
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,450
you won't mind if we
move on it independently.

405
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,679
Damn it!

406
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,169
Hon?

407
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,632
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,589
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:48,595
Wade, it's Jerry. I don't
know what to do. It's Jean.

410
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,306
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,850
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,064
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,860
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:06,863
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

415
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,334
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,288
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,999
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

418
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:03,336
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,971
Shit.

420
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,808
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,524
All right,
it's just the tags.

422
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,860
I never put
my tags on the car.

423
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:31,906
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:57,140
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,685
or else we're gonna have
to, you know, to shoot you.

426
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,987
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,429
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,899
This is a new car,
then, sir?

429
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:50,985
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,530
You're required to
display temporary tags,

431
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:57,242
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

432
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:58,368
Certainly.

433
00:27:58,452 --> 00:28:00,828
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,288
Certainly.

435
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,169
Yeah, I was gonna tape
up those... The tag.

436
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:12,882
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

437
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:15,051
It must have
slipped my mind.

438
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,762
So maybe the best
thing to do would be

439
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:20,306
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,518
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:26,396
My license
and registration.

442
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:29,857
Yeah, I want to be
in compliance.

443
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:34,404
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

444
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,947
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,956
Put that back in
your pocket, please,

446
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,625
and step out of the car, please, sir.

447
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,276
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:31,919
Whoa.

449
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:35,256
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,219
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,476
You are smooth,
smooth, you know?

452
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:49,937
Oh, daddy.

453
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,941
Just clear him
off the road.

454
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,985
Yeah.

455
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,225
No!

456
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,926
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,267
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,729
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,897
Yeah?

460
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:04,609
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:08,654
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:10,781
Real good, then.

463
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,626
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

464
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,127
Got to go?

465
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,378
Yeah.

466
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,173
I'll fix you
some eggs.

467
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,800
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

468
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,345
You got to eat
a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,182
I'll fix you
some eggs.

470
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,143
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,562
You gotta
eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:46,984
I'll fix you
some eggs.

473
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,278
Norm.

474
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,371
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

475
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,122
Love you, Margie.

476
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:01,499
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:35,658
Hon?

478
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,701
Yeah?

479
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:38,577
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:35:58,348 --> 00:35:59,724
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:03,227
What you got there?

482
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:06,355
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

483
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,190
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:09,525
So what's
the deal now?

485
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:10,860
Gary says
triple homicide?

486
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:12,194
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,904
Two of them
are over here.

488
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:15,865
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:18,784
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:23,038
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:34,800
Jeez. So...

492
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,094
Jeez!

493
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:39,096
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,892
It's in the head
and the hand there.

495
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,228
I guess that's
a defensive wound.

496
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:47,897
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,025
Where's the
state trooper?

498
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,779
Back there a good piece, in
the ditch next to his prowler.

499
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,238
Okay.

500
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,742
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

501
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,243
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:02,745
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,414
There's a high-speed
pursuit, ends here,

504
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:07,750
and then this
execution-type deal.

505
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:08,959
Yeah.

506
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:13,422
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:14,673
Yeah.

508
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:18,093
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:21,263
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

510
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,311
You see something
down there, Chief?

511
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,189
No. I just think
I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,398
Jeez.

513
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:33,943
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,611
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,199
It's just
morning sickness.

516
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,203
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,371
Yeah?

518
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:47,081
Yeah. Now
I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,792
You have breakfast
yet, Margie?

520
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,335
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:52,920
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,129
Yeah?

523
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:56,173
Well...

524
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:59,343
What now, do you think?

525
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,470
Let's go take
a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,392
There's different
footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:07,518
Yeah?

528
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,271
Yeah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,605
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,108
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,568
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,654
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,

533
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,574
and he looks like
a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,659
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,077
Yeah.

536
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:29,540
Didn't monkey with
his car there, did you?

537
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:30,708
No way.

538
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,459
Well, somebody
shut his lights.

539
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,919
I guess the little guy
sat in there

540
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,337
waiting for his buddy to come back.

541
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:37,006
Yeah, it would have
been cold out here.

542
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,009
Heck, yeah. You think is Dave open yet?

543
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,260
Dave?

544
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,762
You don't think
he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:47,182
Oh, no, no. I just want to
get Norm some night crawlers.

546
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,896
Did you look
in his citation book?

547
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,192
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

548
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,528
Under plate
number he put "DLR."

549
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,238
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

550
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:04,366
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,953
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:10,122
They don't got
no match yet.

553
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:13,208
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:15,294
on your police
work there, Lou.

555
00:39:15,378 --> 00:39:16,712
Yeah?
Yeah.

556
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:20,549
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,426
"DLR."

558
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,763
Oh.

559
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:28,891
Jeez.

560
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:31,894
Say, Lou,

561
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:33,062
did you hear
the one about the guy

562
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,688
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

563
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:38,108
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,153
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:52,289
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

566
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,208
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,043
They were darn
clear on that, Wade.

568
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,087
They said, "You call your
cops, and we're gonna shoot... "

569
00:39:58,171 --> 00:39:59,588
Of course they're gonna say that.

570
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,715
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,717
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

572
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,594
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

573
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,637
Well, they...

574
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:07,805
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

575
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:09,598
Yeah, but... There they
are. They got my daughter.

576
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,183
Think this thing
through here, Wade.

577
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,186
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,147
You got to listen to
me on this one, Wade.

579
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,024
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:21,110
You're just whistling
Dixie here.

581
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:23,237
I'm saying the cops, they
can advise us on this.

582
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,571
I'm saying
call a professional.

583
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,573
No. No cops.

584
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:30,119
That's final. This
is my deal here, Wade.

585
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:31,203
Yeah.

586
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,288
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:36,208
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm
leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,292
Well...

589
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:39,545
We got to protect Jean. These...

590
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:41,422
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,465
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,633
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:45,801
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:47,094
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,555
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:53,183
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

597
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:54,685
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,770
No way, Wade.
No way.

599
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,188
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

600
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,314
Yeah.

601
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:01,066
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

602
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,276
Yeah.

603
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,989
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

604
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:09,658
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:11,326
I'm supposed to have
the money ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,578
Damn it!

607
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:16,874
How was everything today?

608
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,751
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,087
How you doing?

610
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,050
Okay. Now, we'll get the money together.

611
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:28,218
Don't worry
about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:28,303 --> 00:41:32,222
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

613
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:33,807
No, I...
They don't...

614
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,684
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

615
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:36,935
They were real clear.
Yeah.

616
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,188
You know, they said
no one listening in.

617
00:41:39,272 --> 00:41:40,481
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,524
You know,
maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,152
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,403
Okay.

621
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:49,448
Now, is Scotty
gonna be all right?

622
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:53,243
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,579
Yeah. I'll go
talk to him.

624
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:13,430
How you doing
there, Scotty?

625
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:15,057
Dad...

626
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:17,810
What are they doing?

627
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,270
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:22,022
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,857
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,568
These men,
they just want money.

631
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:29,404
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:33,075
No, no. Nothing's going wrong here.

633
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,371
Granddad and I, we're, we're
making sure this gets handled right.

634
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,457
I really think we should
call the cops here.

635
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,836
No. No. No one can
know about this thing.

636
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:46,171
We gotta play
ball with these guys.

637
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:48,382
You ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell you the same thing.

638
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,424
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:53,011
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,513
You know?

641
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,933
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,857
So if Lorraine calls,
or Sylvia,

643
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:08,485
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:14,825
That's the best
we can do here.

645
00:43:58,536 --> 00:43:59,870
No!

646
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:18,013
No!

647
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:25,187
Oh, God.

648
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:42,329
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,580
Thanks,
Margaret.

650
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,415
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,501
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,212
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

653
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:51,296
Sure thing.

654
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:54,216
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,093
I brought you
some lunch, Margie.

656
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,387
What are those?
Night crawlers?

657
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,554
Yeah.

658
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:00,889
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:00,974 --> 00:45:03,058
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:03,142 --> 00:45:05,269
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:08,230
What do we
got here, Arby's?

662
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:09,815
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:11,358
Pretty good.

664
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:14,820
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

665
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:17,030
Hon, you're better
than them.

666
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,991
They're real good.

667
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:22,160
They're good, Norm, but
you're better than them.

668
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:24,579
You think so?

669
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:28,500
Hey, you got Arby's
all over me.

670
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:32,963
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:34,589
Not too bad.
You know.

672
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:35,966
How we doing
on that vehicle?

673
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,719
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:42,222
but the night before, two
men checked into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:45,434
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

676
00:45:45,518 --> 00:45:46,643
Jeez, that's
a good lead.

677
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:47,811
Yeah.

678
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:50,397
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

679
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,108
Yeah. Owner was
on the desk then.

680
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:55,110
Said these two
had company.

681
00:45:55,194 --> 00:45:56,278
Oh, yeah?

682
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:57,529
Yeah.

683
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:03,744
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

684
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:05,704
I went to Normandale for
about a year and a half.

685
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:06,913
Yeah, that's where
we met.

686
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,081
But I dropped out,
though.

687
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,207
Yeah.
She dropped.

688
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,334
Yeah.

689
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,127
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:14,046
Chaska.
Le Sueur.

691
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,298
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:17,632
Go Bears.

693
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:22,137
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

694
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:24,306
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

695
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,390
In what way?

696
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:27,392
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:29,811
Can you be
any more specific?

698
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:31,271
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,773
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,693
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

701
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:37,903
Yeah.

702
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,741
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:44,284
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,370
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:49,331
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:51,458
More than
most people, even.

707
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,709
What about
the other fella?

708
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:53,960
He was a little older.

709
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,796
You know, he looked
like the Marlboro Man.

710
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,506
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

711
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,049
But maybe I'm saying
that, you know,

712
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,468
'cause he smoked
a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,345
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

714
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,596
Oh, yeah,
that can happen.

715
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,722
Yeah.

716
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:07,849
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:09,393
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

718
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:10,977
Yeah, is that
useful to you?

719
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,604
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:14,022
Yeah.
Yeah.

721
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:17,359
Come on!

722
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,820
Goddamn it!

723
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:23,782
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,285
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:30,455
Been here for days.

726
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,667
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

727
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:37,003
Fucking TV
doesn't even...

728
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:42,717
Damn it, come on! Plug me in,
man. Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:46,221
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:48,724 --> 00:47:50,684
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:52,227
God...

732
00:47:53,062 --> 00:47:54,229
Fuck!

733
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:57,607
Come on, plug me into
the ozone, baby! Come on!

734
00:47:59,152 --> 00:48:00,444
Come on!

735
00:48:02,238 --> 00:48:06,575
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:16,751
The bark beet¡e
carries the worm to its nest

737
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,131
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

738
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:27,095
In the spring, the ¡arvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.

739
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,430
Well...

740
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:31,600
I'm turning in, Norm.

741
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:33,435
Oh, yeah?

742
00:48:36,355 --> 00:48:38,690
Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.

743
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:53,788
Hello?

744
00:48:53,873 --> 00:48:55,874
Yeah.
Is this Marge?

745
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,209
Yeah.

746
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:58,919
Margie Olmstead?

747
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,130
Yeah. Who's this?

748
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:04,466
This is Mike Yanagita!

749
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,135
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

750
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,056
Mike Yanagita?

751
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,557
Yeah!

752
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:15,268
Well, yeah!

753
00:49:15,937 --> 00:49:17,562
Course I remember you.

754
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:20,106
How are you doing?
What time is it?

755
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,609
Oh, jeez.
It's 10:45.

756
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,069
I hope
I didn't wake you.

757
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:26,905
No. That's okay.

758
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,074
Yeah, ¡'m down in
the Twin Cities,

759
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:32,035
and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.

760
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:33,620
And I saw you
on the news there.

761
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,746
Yeah.

762
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,373
I thought, "Jeez, is
that Margie Olmstead?"

763
00:49:36,457 --> 00:49:37,624
I can't be¡ieve it.

764
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,001
Yeah, that's me.

765
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:42,420
We¡, how the heck
are you?

766
00:49:42,505 --> 00:49:44,130
Okay. You know.

767
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,007
Okay.

768
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:47,592
Yeah?
Yeah.

769
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,678
How you doing?

770
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:51,388
Pretty good.

771
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,015
Well, heck.

772
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,434
It's been such
a long time, Mike.

773
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,312
It's great to
hear from you.

774
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,526
Yeah, you got your...

775
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,696
This is loaded here. This
has your independent...

776
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,116
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

777
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,119
antilock brakes,
alarm, radar,

778
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,205
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

779
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,541
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

780
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,459
Yeah, I don't need
no sealant, though.

781
00:50:21,544 --> 00:50:23,378
Yeah.
You don't need that.

782
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:25,213
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

783
00:50:25,298 --> 00:50:27,924
You ought to be aware of
this GMAC plan they have now.

784
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:29,050
It's really super.

785
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:30,302
Got a call
for you, Jerry.

786
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:31,761
Yeah, okay.

787
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:39,853
Jerry Lundegaard.

788
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:42,063
All right, Jerry, you
got the phone to yourself?

789
00:50:42,148 --> 00:50:43,231
Well, yeah.

790
00:50:43,316 --> 00:50:44,357
You know who this is?

791
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,401
Well, yeah,
I got an idea.

792
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:48,361
How's that Cierra
working out for you?

793
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:50,697
Circumstances
have changed, Jerry.

794
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,906
Well...

795
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:53,783
What do you mean?

796
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:57,579
Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.

797
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,747
Force majeure.

798
00:50:58,831 --> 00:51:00,081
What the...

799
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,499
How's Jean?

800
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
Who's Jean?

801
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,004
My wife. What the...

802
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:08,131
She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd

803
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,424
who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.

804
00:51:09,508 --> 00:51:10,675
What the heck
are you talking about?

805
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,385
Let's just finish
this deal up here.

806
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,638
B¡ood has been
shed, Jerry.

807
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:16,431
What the heck
do you mean?

808
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,391
Three people
in Brainerd.

809
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:19,517
Oh, jeez.

810
00:51:19,602 --> 00:51:21,645
That's right, and we need more money.

811
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:22,937
What the heck
are you talking about?

812
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:24,939
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

813
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:26,066
We need more money...

814
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,193
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

815
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:30,862
Don't ever interrupt me,
Jerry! Just shut the fuck up!

816
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:33,114
Well, I'm sorry,
but I just, I...

817
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,325
I'm not gonna debate you,
Jerry. I'm not gonna debate!

818
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:36,951
We now want
the entire 80,000.

819
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:38,912
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

820
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:40,205
B¡ood has been shed.

821
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:41,539
We've incurred
risk, Jerry.

822
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:42,791
I'm coming into
town tomorrow.

823
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,958
You have
the money ready.

824
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:46,461
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

825
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:47,587
Is it, Jerry?

826
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,839
You ask those three poor souls
up in Brainerd if a dea¡'s a dea¡.

827
00:51:49,924 --> 00:51:51,049
Go ahead, ask them!

828
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,175
The heck do you mean?

829
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:54,678
"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.

830
00:51:58,933 --> 00:51:59,933
Yeah?

831
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:01,059
Jerome Lundegaard?

832
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:02,185
Yeah.

833
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:03,937
This is Reilly Diefenbach
at GMAC.

834
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:06,773
Sir, ¡'ve not received those
vehic¡e IDs you promised.

835
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,191
Yeah. I...

836
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:09,859
Those are in the mail.

837
00:52:09,944 --> 00:52:12,696
That very well may be. I
must inform you, however,

838
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,573
that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

839
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,159
I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.

840
00:52:18,244 --> 00:52:19,285
Yeah.

841
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,121
My patience is at an end.
Yeah.

842
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:22,706
Good day, sir.
Yeah.

843
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:24,017
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

844
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,102
How's the fricassee?

845
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:27,645
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

846
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,980
Oh, no. I got...

847
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:33,026
Hey, Norm, I thought you was
going ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

848
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:35,403
Yeah. After lunch.

849
00:53:35,863 --> 00:53:37,197
What you got there?

850
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:39,699
The numbers
you asked for.

851
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:42,452
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

852
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:44,579
Two to Minneapolis
that night.

853
00:53:44,663 --> 00:53:45,997
First one's
a trucking company

854
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:47,957
and second one's
a private residence,

855
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:49,709
a Shep Proudfoot.

856
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,086
A what?

857
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:54,422
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

858
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:56,382
Yeah.

859
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,135
Okay. Yeah.

860
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:02,096
Think I'll take a
drive down there, then.

861
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:04,098
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

862
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,144
Oh, yeah?

863
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:25,203
Damn it, I want to be
a part of this thing.

864
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,497
No. Wade,
they were real clear.

865
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:29,457
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

866
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,417
and it's gotta be
delivered by me alone.

867
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,753
It's my money,
I'll deliver it.

868
00:54:34,255 --> 00:54:35,547
What do they care?

869
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:36,923
Wade's got
a point, there.

870
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,466
I'll handle the call
if you want, Jerry.

871
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:39,801
No, no. See, they...

872
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:42,136
No. See, they only
deal with me.

873
00:54:42,221 --> 00:54:45,974
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

874
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:48,768
They're very... These
guys are dangerous.

875
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,354
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

876
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:54,315
With all due respect, Jerry, I
don't want you mucking this up.

877
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
What the heck
do you mean?

878
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:57,026
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

879
00:54:57,111 --> 00:54:58,611
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

880
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,321
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

881
00:55:00,406 --> 00:55:01,489
No. See...

882
00:55:01,574 --> 00:55:04,367
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

883
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:06,786
It's my show here.
That's that!

884
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:11,457
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

885
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:19,549
Hi. How you doing?

886
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:21,342
Real good. How are
you doing today, ma'am?

887
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:23,678
I'm doing really
super there. Thanks.

888
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:26,598
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

889
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:30,101
Yep. You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

890
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:33,104
Is there a phone
down here, you think?

891
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,941
Detective Sibert?

892
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:40,570
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

893
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:43,865
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

894
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,909
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

895
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:47,577
so I thought
I'd check in with you

896
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:50,163
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

897
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,207
Oh, yeah?

898
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,253
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have...

899
00:55:57,338 --> 00:55:59,213
No. I can find that.

900
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:01,382
Yeah. Well,
thanks a bunch.

901
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:04,260
Say, say, would you
happen to know

902
00:56:04,345 --> 00:56:07,263
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

903
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,557
The Radisson.

904
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,644
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

905
00:57:29,763 --> 00:57:31,848
Hi. How you doing?

906
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,392
Yeah. I decided
not to park here.

907
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:37,061
Well, what do you mean? You
decided not to park here?

908
00:57:37,146 --> 00:57:39,981
Yeah, I just came in and I
decided not to park here, so...

909
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:42,734
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

910
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:45,111
Yeah, I decided
not to... I...

911
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,196
You know, I'm not...

912
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:49,615
I decided not to take the
trip, as it turns out, so...

913
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,910
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we
still got to charge you the $4.

914
00:57:54,747 --> 00:57:56,039
I just pulled in here.

915
00:57:56,165 --> 00:57:57,498
I just fucking
pulled in here.

916
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,666
Well, but...

917
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:01,210
See, there's a minimum
charge of $4.

918
00:58:01,295 --> 00:58:04,088
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

919
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:11,929
I guess you think you're, you
know, like an authority figure.

920
00:58:12,014 --> 00:58:14,348
That stupid fucking uniform, huh, buddy?

921
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:15,850
King clip-on tie there.

922
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:17,351
Big fucking man, huh?

923
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:20,229
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

924
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:21,689
Ruler of your
little fucking gate here.

925
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:24,400
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

926
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:28,488
Where's Shep?

927
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,406
Talking to a cop.

928
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:31,657
Cop?

929
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:33,743
Said she was a cop.

930
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,207
So do you remember getting
a call Wednesday night?

931
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,416
Nope.

932
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:44,295
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

933
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:45,379
Yep.

934
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:47,465
Anyone else
residing there?

935
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:48,633
No.

936
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:52,720
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

937
00:58:52,805 --> 00:58:56,933
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

938
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,727
Now, I know you've
had some problems.

939
00:58:59,812 --> 00:59:01,646
Struggling with
the narcotics,

940
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,649
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

941
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,359
So?

942
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:07,860
Well, associating
with criminals,

943
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,195
if you're the one
they talked to,

944
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,406
that right there would be
a violation of your parole.

945
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:14,992
Would end you up
back in Stillwater.

946
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,411
Now, I saw some rough
stuff on your priors,

947
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:19,080
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

948
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:23,167
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

949
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,254
So, you think
you might remember

950
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:28,840
who those folks
were who called you?

951
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:38,975
Mr. Lundegaard?

952
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:40,268
Yeah.

953
00:59:40,352 --> 00:59:42,228
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

954
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,105
What is it all about?

955
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,857
Do you mind
if I sit down?

956
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:47,984
Carrying quite
a load here.

957
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:50,069
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

958
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:52,488
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

959
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,407
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

960
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,617
My father-in-law,
he's the owner.

961
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:57,869
Uh-huh.

962
00:59:57,953 --> 00:59:59,954
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

963
01:00:00,038 --> 01:00:01,789
investigating
some malfeasance.

964
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:04,333
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

965
01:00:04,418 --> 01:00:07,503
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

966
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:11,048
Specifically
a tan Cutlass Cierra.

967
01:00:15,637 --> 01:00:17,180
Mr. Lundegaard.

968
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:21,058
Brainerd.

969
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:23,144
Yeah, yeah.

970
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:25,730
Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe, the Blue Ox.

971
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:27,481
Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,697
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

973
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:40,828
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing, then?

974
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:42,413
Nope. No, ma'am.

975
01:00:43,332 --> 01:00:44,624
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

976
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,710
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

977
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,434
Service.
Yeah, get me Shep.

978
01:01:03,518 --> 01:01:04,769
He's not here
right now.

979
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:05,895
What the heck
do you mean?

980
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:07,521
He stepped out.

981
01:01:07,606 --> 01:01:09,065
Where'd he go? It's only...
I'll get you Artie.

982
01:01:09,149 --> 01:01:12,318
No. I don't need
a mechanic. I need a...

983
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:18,407
Jeez. I gotta talk
to a friend of his,

984
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:20,451
so...

985
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:23,120
Have him...

986
01:01:24,456 --> 01:01:25,539
What?

987
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:26,624
Oh, jeez.

988
01:01:47,479 --> 01:01:48,604
Mike?

989
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:50,606
Marge?

990
01:01:52,526 --> 01:01:55,236
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

991
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,571
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

992
01:01:57,656 --> 01:02:00,992
Easy there. Easy there. You do, too.

993
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:02,702
I'm expecting now.

994
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:04,996
I see that.
That's great.

995
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,455
What can I get you?

996
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,416
Just a Diet Coke, please.

997
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,084
Great.

998
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:12,128
This is a nice place.

999
01:02:12,212 --> 01:02:15,673
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

1000
01:02:15,841 --> 01:02:16,882
Yeah.

1001
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,430
So...

1002
01:02:23,181 --> 01:02:24,598
You're living
in Edina, then?

1003
01:02:24,683 --> 01:02:26,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1004
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:28,602
It's actually
Eden Prairie.

1005
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:30,229
That school district.

1006
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,316
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

1007
01:02:33,692 --> 01:02:36,277
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1008
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,029
Oh, yeah.
Long time ago.

1009
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:39,739
Great, great.

1010
01:02:40,073 --> 01:02:42,533
So, what brings you down?

1011
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:44,744
Are you down here
on that homicide,

1012
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,079
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

1013
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:48,456
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1014
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,334
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1015
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,753
Okay.

1016
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:55,129
Well, what about you, Mike?

1017
01:02:55,213 --> 01:02:56,464
Are you married?

1018
01:02:56,548 --> 01:02:57,631
You got kids?

1019
01:02:57,716 --> 01:02:59,508
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1020
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:02,762
I was married.
I was married to...

1021
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:04,764
You mind
if I sit over here?

1022
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,849
I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1023
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:10,019
No. Why don't you sit
over there? I prefer that.

1024
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:14,357
Okay.

1025
01:03:17,235 --> 01:03:18,319
Sorry.

1026
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:21,155
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1027
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:23,491
Sure, sure. I understand.

1028
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:25,993
I didn't mean to...

1029
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:29,538
No, no. That's fine.

1030
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,085
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1031
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,505
So, I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1032
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:40,383
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1033
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:41,926
Yeah. I think
I remember her.

1034
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,804
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1035
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:46,472
So, it didn't
work out, huh?

1036
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:50,101
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1037
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:51,352
Well, they're
a good outfit.

1038
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:55,189
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1039
01:03:55,273 --> 01:03:56,941
But it's not...

1040
01:03:57,025 --> 01:03:59,193
It's nothing like
your achievement.

1041
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:02,279
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1042
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:03,948
It's not that...

1043
01:04:04,032 --> 01:04:07,284
It's not that things
didn't work out. It's...

1044
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,497
Linda had leukemia,
you know.

1045
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,417
She was...
She passed away.

1046
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:15,918
No.

1047
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:19,463
It was tough.

1048
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:20,840
There you go.

1049
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:22,967
It was long...

1050
01:04:24,344 --> 01:04:26,971
She fought
real hard, Marge.

1051
01:04:27,848 --> 01:04:29,223
You know...

1052
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:31,559
So, what can you say?

1053
01:04:34,521 --> 01:04:36,814
Better times, huh?

1054
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:38,357
Better times.

1055
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:45,781
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1056
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:47,658
I always liked you.

1057
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:48,993
Well, I always
liked you...

1058
01:04:49,077 --> 01:04:50,828
I always
liked you so much.

1059
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,793
So, Mike, should we get
together another time, you think?

1060
01:04:57,878 --> 01:04:59,211
No! I...

1061
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,217
I'm sorry. It's...

1062
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:07,678
You know, I shouldn't have done this.

1063
01:05:07,762 --> 01:05:09,805
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1064
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,433
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1065
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:13,934
It's okay, Mike.

1066
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:16,520
You were
such a super lady.

1067
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:19,857
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1068
01:05:22,736 --> 01:05:24,236
It's okay, Mike.

1069
01:05:30,577 --> 01:05:34,413
Here's a song I dedicate to
all the ladies out here tonight.

1070
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,707
Goes like this.

1071
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:40,628
Let's find
each other tonight

1072
01:05:41,463 --> 01:05:43,881
Everything
will be all right

1073
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,218
Don't hesitate now

1074
01:05:47,302 --> 01:05:48,969
Let's find
each other tonight

1075
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:50,387
So...

1076
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,015
Are you
from around here?

1077
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:55,643
Just in town on business.

1078
01:05:56,228 --> 01:05:57,311
Just in and out.

1079
01:06:00,065 --> 01:06:02,608
Just a little
of the old in-and-out.

1080
01:06:03,735 --> 01:06:05,152
What do you do?

1081
01:06:06,404 --> 01:06:07,488
I...

1082
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:12,993
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1083
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:15,037
With other clients?

1084
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,997
I don't think so.

1085
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:18,541
It's nice.

1086
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:21,085
Yeah, well,
depends on the artist.

1087
01:06:21,253 --> 01:06:24,380
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1088
01:06:25,006 --> 01:06:26,090
Waiter!

1089
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,927
What is he, deaf?

1090
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:32,012
So...

1091
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:35,474
How long you work
for the escort service?

1092
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,643
I don't know.
A few months.

1093
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:41,230
Find that work
interesting, do you?

1094
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,358
What are you
talking about?

1095
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:46,193
Right.

1096
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:47,611
Come on.

1097
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:49,697
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1098
01:06:51,533 --> 01:06:54,076
All right.
Where were you?

1099
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:01,709
Shep, what the hell are you
doing? I'm banging that girl.

1100
01:07:01,793 --> 01:07:06,171
Fucking asshole. Get
the fuck out of here.

1101
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:09,258
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1102
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:10,884
Get the fuck out of here.

1103
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:13,971
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

1104
01:07:14,055 --> 01:07:16,015
Trying to get some
goddamn sleep here.

1105
01:07:17,142 --> 01:07:18,183
Come on, brother...

1106
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,518
Fuck you!

1107
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,359
Fuck you.

1108
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:28,611
Animals!

1109
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:32,239
Stay away from me, man.

1110
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:34,408
Hey, smoke
a fucking peace pipe!

1111
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:36,368
Don't you dare
fucking hit me!

1112
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,502
Fucking little weasel!

1113
01:07:45,587 --> 01:07:47,296
Fuck you, man.
Stop it!

1114
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,216
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1115
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:54,928
Jesus Christ! You fucking
shitbag motherfucker!

1116
01:07:58,892 --> 01:07:59,892
Yeah?

1117
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:01,185
All right, Jerry, I'm
through fucking around.

1118
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:02,353
You got
the fucking money?

1119
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:04,480
Yeah, I got
the money, but...

1120
01:08:04,564 --> 01:08:06,273
Don't you fucking
but me, Jerry.

1121
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:09,318
I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,

1122
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:10,944
30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.

1123
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:12,071
Okay. But...

1124
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:14,406
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1125
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:15,949
and I shoot you and I
shoot your fucking wife,

1126
01:08:16,034 --> 01:08:17,326
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1127
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,912
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1128
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,789
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1129
01:08:21,873 --> 01:08:22,915
Got it?

1130
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:24,625
Okay. Real good, then.

1131
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:50,901
Dad.

1132
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:52,903
It's okay, Scotty.

1133
01:08:52,987 --> 01:08:54,655
Where you going?

1134
01:08:54,989 --> 01:08:57,074
I'll be back
in a minute.

1135
01:08:57,325 --> 01:09:01,662
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1136
01:09:03,998 --> 01:09:05,082
Okay.

1137
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:07,751
Here's your damn money.

1138
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,546
Now, where's my daughter?

1139
01:09:11,172 --> 01:09:12,297
Yeah.

1140
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:15,592
You goddamn punk!

1141
01:09:31,943 --> 01:09:38,365
Who the fuck are you?

1142
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,493
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1143
01:09:42,454 --> 01:09:44,079
I am through
fucking around!

1144
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:45,873
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1145
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:47,541
Where's my daughter?

1146
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:49,960
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1147
01:09:50,044 --> 01:09:52,379
I gave simple
fucking instructions.

1148
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:54,173
Where's my damn daughter?

1149
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:55,549
No Jean, no money.

1150
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:57,551
Drop that fucking money!

1151
01:09:57,635 --> 01:09:59,303
No Jean, no money!

1152
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:03,098
Is this a fucking joke here?

1153
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:13,066
Oh, jeez.

1154
01:10:13,151 --> 01:10:15,235
You happy now, asshole?

1155
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,987
What's with you people?

1156
01:10:17,071 --> 01:10:18,947
You fucking imbeciles!

1157
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,916
You fucking shot me!

1158
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,120
May I have your ticket,
please?

1159
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,913
Open the fucking gate!

1160
01:12:29,454 --> 01:12:30,913
Oh, jeez.

1161
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:02,235
Dad?

1162
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,403
Yeah?

1163
01:13:03,863 --> 01:13:05,656
Stan Grossman called.

1164
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,282
Yeah. Okay.

1165
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:08,367
Twice.

1166
01:13:08,493 --> 01:13:09,493
Okay.

1167
01:13:11,496 --> 01:13:13,205
Is everything okay?

1168
01:13:13,581 --> 01:13:14,706
Yeah.

1169
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:18,251
Are you calling Stan?

1170
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,005
Well, I'm...

1171
01:13:23,549 --> 01:13:25,384
I'm going to bed now.

1172
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:03,422
How you doing?

1173
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:05,132
Mr. Mohra?
Yeah?

1174
01:14:05,466 --> 01:14:06,633
Officer Olson.

1175
01:14:06,718 --> 01:14:08,218
Yeah. Righto.

1176
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:10,262
Well...

1177
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:13,515
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1178
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,308
and this little
guy's drinking,

1179
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:17,436
and he says, "Where can
a guy find some action?

1180
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,771
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake. "

1181
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,314
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1182
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:23,608
And he says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1183
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,152
And I says, "Well, what do I look like?

1184
01:14:25,236 --> 01:14:27,362
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing. "

1185
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:29,990
And he says, "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake. "

1186
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:33,326
And I says, "Yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place. "

1187
01:14:33,411 --> 01:14:36,872
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking. "

1188
01:14:36,956 --> 01:14:38,498
Only he don't use
the word "jerk. "

1189
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,167
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1190
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:42,669
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1191
01:14:42,754 --> 01:14:44,337
So, I don't
say nothing.

1192
01:14:44,422 --> 01:14:46,339
He says, "What do you think about that?"

1193
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:49,843
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then. "

1194
01:14:49,927 --> 01:14:50,969
You got that right.

1195
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,804
Yeah, he says, "Yeah, that guy's dead,

1196
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,347
"and I don't mean
of old age. "

1197
01:14:54,432 --> 01:14:57,976
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake. "

1198
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,061
White Bear Lake?

1199
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:01,605
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1200
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:02,856
So I made
that assumption.

1201
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,899
Sure.

1202
01:15:03,983 --> 01:15:05,776
Anyway, he's drinking
at the bar,

1203
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,569
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1204
01:15:07,653 --> 01:15:10,697
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1205
01:15:10,782 --> 01:15:14,910
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1206
01:15:17,163 --> 01:15:18,705
End of story.

1207
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:20,791
Well, what'd this guy
look like, anyways?

1208
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,459
Oh, he's a...

1209
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:24,169
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1210
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:26,505
In what way?

1211
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,548
Just in a general
kind of way.

1212
01:15:28,633 --> 01:15:31,218
Okay. Well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1213
01:15:31,302 --> 01:15:33,011
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1214
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:34,262
but thanks
for calling her in.

1215
01:15:34,347 --> 01:15:35,597
Sure.

1216
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:38,266
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1217
01:15:38,351 --> 01:15:40,644
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1218
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:43,021
Yeah.
You got that right.

1219
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,792
Jesus Christ.

1220
01:18:20,471 --> 01:18:23,890
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1221
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:26,393
Well, I'm sorry
I won't see you.

1222
01:18:26,644 --> 01:18:27,894
But you think
he's all right?

1223
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:29,104
I saw him
last night and...

1224
01:18:29,188 --> 01:18:30,230
What did he say?

1225
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:32,023
Well, it's nothing
specific he said.

1226
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:35,277
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1227
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:37,237
His wife?
Linda.

1228
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:39,364
Who?
Linda Cooksey.

1229
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,241
No. No, no.
They weren't...

1230
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:44,244
He was bothering Linda for
about... For a good year.

1231
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:47,455
Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.

1232
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,040
So...

1233
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,042
He didn't...

1234
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:52,585
He never...

1235
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,379
No! No,
they never married.

1236
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,923
Mike's had
psychiatric problems.

1237
01:18:57,008 --> 01:18:58,425
Oh, my.

1238
01:18:58,509 --> 01:19:00,010
Yeah, he's been
struggling.

1239
01:19:00,094 --> 01:19:02,429
He's living
with his parents now.

1240
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:04,931
Oh, jeez.

1241
01:19:05,016 --> 01:19:07,434
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1242
01:19:07,518 --> 01:19:09,060
Jeez. Well...

1243
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:10,812
Jeez.

1244
01:19:12,523 --> 01:19:14,190
That's a surprise.

1245
01:19:24,243 --> 01:19:25,410
Hello!

1246
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,371
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to
bother you again. Can I come in?

1247
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:12,499
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1248
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:15,085
I understand. I'll keep
it real short, then.

1249
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:18,004
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1250
01:20:18,089 --> 01:20:19,297
Do you mind
if I sit down?

1251
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,507
Carrying a bit
of a load here.

1252
01:20:20,591 --> 01:20:21,716
No, I...

1253
01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:23,510
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1254
01:20:23,594 --> 01:20:24,636
I was just wondering...

1255
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,847
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1256
01:20:27,932 --> 01:20:29,974
Okay. Are you sure?

1257
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,395
'Cause I mean,
how do you know?

1258
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:35,146
Because, see, the
crime I'm investigating,

1259
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,399
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1260
01:20:37,483 --> 01:20:38,733
and they called
someone who works here,

1261
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:40,485
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1262
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,362
you know, connected.

1263
01:20:42,988 --> 01:20:44,406
Yeah, I see.

1264
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:45,907
So, how do you...

1265
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:48,118
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1266
01:20:48,202 --> 01:20:49,869
The car's not
from our lot, ma'am.

1267
01:20:49,954 --> 01:20:52,038
But how do you know that
for sure without doing a...

1268
01:20:52,123 --> 01:20:53,790
Well, I would know.

1269
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,625
I'm the Executive
Sales Manager.

1270
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:57,419
Yeah, but I understand...

1271
01:20:57,503 --> 01:20:59,045
We run a pretty tight
ship here.

1272
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,130
I know, but...

1273
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:02,257
Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1274
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:03,758
I mean,
are the cars counted daily,

1275
01:21:03,843 --> 01:21:05,718
or what kind
of a routine here?

1276
01:21:05,803 --> 01:21:08,263
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1277
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,601
I'm sorry, sir?

1278
01:21:13,686 --> 01:21:15,979
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1279
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:17,730
I answered the darn...

1280
01:21:17,815 --> 01:21:21,067
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

1281
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:27,574
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1282
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:29,200
I'm just doing
my job here.

1283
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:30,452
I'm...

1284
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,373
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1285
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,834
I'm cooperating,
and there's no...

1286
01:21:37,918 --> 01:21:40,003
We're doing all we can.

1287
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,512
Sir, could I talk
to Mr. Gustafson?

1288
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:55,018
Mr. Lundegaard.

1289
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,649
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1290
01:22:01,734 --> 01:22:04,402
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1291
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:07,405
Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

1292
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,573
Sir, right now?

1293
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,241
Yeah! Right now.

1294
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:12,702
You're darn tooting!

1295
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:16,581
If it's so damned
important to you.

1296
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,917
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1297
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,211
What the Christ! Jeez!

1298
01:22:34,725 --> 01:22:37,560
Bob Elcorona, line two.

1299
01:23:05,965 --> 01:23:07,757
For Pete's sake.

1300
01:23:11,428 --> 01:23:13,346
For Pete's sake, he's
fleeing the interview.

1301
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,598
He's fleeing
the interview!

1302
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:19,352
How do I get
an outside line here?

1303
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,438
All right.

1304
01:23:25,693 --> 01:23:27,986
Yeah.
Detective Sibert, please.

1305
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,448
I told you it was over, and I
thought I made myself very clear.

1306
01:23:32,533 --> 01:23:35,326
Oh, you did. You made
yourself perfectly clear.

1307
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:37,287
But something's
come up.

1308
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:38,830
What?

1309
01:23:39,123 --> 01:23:40,456
Well, it's something
kind of small,

1310
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,750
but it might be
a big problem.

1311
01:23:42,876 --> 01:23:47,463
I'm pregnant.

1312
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,884
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,

1313
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:55,471
and there's no doubt about
it, I'm gonna have your baby.

1314
01:23:58,142 --> 01:24:00,602
Now, look here.
I can explain this.

1315
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:04,147
See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.

1316
01:24:05,065 --> 01:24:07,317
You should see
the other guy.

1317
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:09,777
No, no, no. It wasn't
anything like that.

1318
01:24:09,862 --> 01:24:10,987
You don't understand!

1319
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:12,822
I read that letter
that she wrote.

1320
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:14,490
I think I understand
all there is...

1321
01:24:14,575 --> 01:24:16,326
What happened to her?

1322
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:20,288
She started shrieking,
you know.

1323
01:24:20,372 --> 01:24:21,497
Jeez.

1324
01:24:22,249 --> 01:24:24,334
Well, I got the money.

1325
01:24:24,835 --> 01:24:27,503
All of it, all 80 grand.

1326
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,383
That's 40 for you,
40 for me.

1327
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,054
That's it, then.

1328
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,310
You can have my truck.

1329
01:24:42,436 --> 01:24:43,936
I'm taking the Cierra.

1330
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:45,521
We split that.

1331
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,902
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1332
01:24:51,195 --> 01:24:53,196
With a fucking chain saw?

1333
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:56,115
One of us pays
the other for half.

1334
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:58,868
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1335
01:24:59,745 --> 01:25:01,871
Did you fucking
notice this?

1336
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:04,415
I got fucking shot!

1337
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:07,043
I got fucking
shot in the face!

1338
01:25:07,127 --> 01:25:08,670
I went and got
the fucking money!

1339
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:10,505
I got shot
fucking picking it up!

1340
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:13,299
I've been up
for 36 fucking hours!

1341
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:16,094
I'm taking
that fucking car!

1342
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,514
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1343
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:23,017
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1344
01:25:23,143 --> 01:25:28,523
Are we square?

1345
01:25:30,567 --> 01:25:32,443
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1346
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,447
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1347
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:38,991
tell him I'm gonna
nail his fucking ass.

1348
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,371
I'll call you...
Later.

1349
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:58,261
His wife. This guy says she
was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1350
01:25:58,345 --> 01:25:59,804
The day of
our homicides.

1351
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:00,972
Yeah.

1352
01:26:01,056 --> 01:26:02,348
And this guy was who?

1353
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:05,059
Lundegaard's
father-in-law's accountant.

1354
01:26:05,144 --> 01:26:06,811
Gustafson's accountant.

1355
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,020
Yeah.

1356
01:26:08,105 --> 01:26:09,772
But we still
haven't found Gustafson?

1357
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:11,566
...looking...

1358
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,359
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1359
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:15,027
Still missing.
We're looking.

1360
01:26:15,112 --> 01:26:17,113
Copy.
And Lundegaard, too?

1361
01:26:17,322 --> 01:26:19,741
Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?

1362
01:26:19,825 --> 01:26:20,992
I'm almost back.

1363
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:22,618
I'm taking a drive
around Moose Lake.

1364
01:26:22,703 --> 01:26:24,704
Gary's loudmouth.

1365
01:26:24,997 --> 01:26:26,372
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1366
01:26:26,457 --> 01:26:28,040
So the whole state
has it, huh?

1367
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,959
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1368
01:26:30,043 --> 01:26:31,335
Yeah.
It's over the wire.

1369
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,795
It's everywhere.
They'll find them.

1370
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,005
Copy.

1371
01:26:34,465 --> 01:26:35,590
Yeah, we got
a lead on this...

1372
01:26:35,674 --> 01:26:37,049
There's the car!
There's the car!

1373
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:38,134
Whose car?

1374
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:41,554
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1375
01:26:42,139 --> 01:26:45,141
Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.

1376
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:39,839
Police!

1377
01:28:47,598 --> 01:28:49,181
Hands up!

1378
01:28:49,474 --> 01:28:55,271
Police!

1379
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:58,501
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1380
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:07,134
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1381
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:14,225
And those three people
in Brainerd.

1382
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:21,065
And for what?

1383
01:30:22,275 --> 01:30:24,318
For a little bit of money.

1384
01:30:29,866 --> 01:30:33,119
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1385
01:30:42,754 --> 01:30:44,547
Don't you know that?

1386
01:30:50,929 --> 01:30:52,680
And here you are.

1387
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,850
And it's a beautiful day.

1388
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:06,402
Well...

1389
01:31:19,249 --> 01:31:21,333
I just don't understand it.

1390
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:05,127
Mr. Anderson?

1391
01:32:06,463 --> 01:32:07,713
Who?

1392
01:32:07,798 --> 01:32:11,217
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98 out here?

1393
01:32:12,636 --> 01:32:14,095
Just a sec.

1394
01:32:14,179 --> 01:32:15,888
Could you open
the door, please?

1395
01:32:15,972 --> 01:32:17,890
Yeah, yeah,
just a sec.

1396
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:19,767
Just a sec.

1397
01:32:27,317 --> 01:32:29,276
Dale!
My leg!

1398
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:30,569
No!

1399
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,527
They announced it.

1400
01:33:13,113 --> 01:33:14,530
They announced it?

1401
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:15,739
Yeah.

1402
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:17,283
So?

1403
01:33:18,285 --> 01:33:19,910
Three-cent stamp.

1404
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:22,121
Your mallard?

1405
01:33:22,372 --> 01:33:23,414
Yeah.

1406
01:33:24,291 --> 01:33:26,125
That's terrific.

1407
01:33:26,209 --> 01:33:28,169
It's just
a three-cent.

1408
01:33:28,712 --> 01:33:29,795
It's terrific.

1409
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,590
Hautman's blue-winged
teal got the 29-cent.

1410
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:35,342
People don't much
use the three-cent.

1411
01:33:35,427 --> 01:33:38,012
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1412
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:40,681
Whenever they
raise the postage,

1413
01:33:40,765 --> 01:33:42,641
people need
the little stamps.

1414
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:44,476
Yeah?

1415
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:47,563
When they're stuck with
a bunch of the old ones.

1416
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:48,898
Yeah.

1417
01:33:49,649 --> 01:33:51,025
I guess.

1418
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:55,654
That's terrific. I'm
so proud of you, Norm.

1419
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:02,203
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1420
01:34:04,748 --> 01:34:06,540
I love you, Margie.

1421
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:09,210
I love you, Norm.

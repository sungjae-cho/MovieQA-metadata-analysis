1
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,486
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,737
Jimmy?

3
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:10,156
What's up?
Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,203
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:17,539
No.

7
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:21,918
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:50,280
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,364
Die, motherfucker!

10
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,909
Look at me!

11
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:06,880
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

12
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:16,765
"I know I'd go from rags to riches"

13
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:22,771
"If you would only say you care

14
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,527
"And though my pocket may be empty

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,116
"I'd be a millionaire

16
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:42,290
"My clothes may still be torn and tattered"

17
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,004
To me...

18
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,551
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

19
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:59,140
Even before I went to the cabstand
for an after-school job...

20
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,601
...I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

21
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:06,022
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...

22
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,608
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

23
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:12,279
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

24
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,865
They parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket.

25
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:18,159
When they played cards all night...

26
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,370
...nobody ever called the cops.

27
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:23,957
"Must I forever be a beggar

28
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:30,130
"Whose golden dreams will not come true"

29
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,718
Tony Stacks. How are you?

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,262
Tuddy Cicero.

31
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:39,890
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

32
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,227
Tuddy.

33
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:48,481
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

34
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:53,486
...and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

35
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,993
Paulie might have moved slow...

36
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,583
...but it was only because Paulie didn't
have to move for anybody.

37
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:13,006
It's your fault.
-You started it!

38
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,008
I started it? It's your fault.

39
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:18,011
At first my parents loved
that I found a job...

40
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:20,263
...across the street from the house.

41
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,434
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

42
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,811
He liked that I got myself a job.

43
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:30,523
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

44
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,199
Henry! Watch how you cross!

45
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,784
Bring back milk!

46
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,037
My mother was happy
after she found out the Ciceros...

47
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,832
...came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

48
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,710
...that was the answer to all her prayers.

49
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,256
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

50
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,675
I could go anywhere, do anything.

51
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:00,345
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

52
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:05,100
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy
would let me park their Cadillacs.

53
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:09,229
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

54
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,356
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.

55
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:16,861
But, it wasn't too long...

56
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:21,366
...before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

57
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:26,329
For them, it was supposed to be
a part-time job. But for me...

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,415
...it was definitely full time.

59
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,375
That's all I wanted to do.

60
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:34,796
People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.

61
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,716
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

62
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,551
Tell him 519.

63
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:42,596
Every day I was learning to score.

64
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:46,433
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.

65
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:51,021
Did you have a good day at school?

66
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:53,440
My father was always pissed off.

67
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:57,027
Pissed that he made such lousy money,
that my brother Michael...

68
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,653
...was in a wheelchair.

69
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:02,741
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

70
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:04,701
Tell me about this.

71
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,829
It's a letter from school.

72
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,457
It says you haven't been there in months.

73
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,376
In months!

74
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,421
You're a bum!

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,715
Want to grow up to be a bum?

76
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,427
After a while,
he was mostly pissed...

77
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,679
...because I hung around the cabstand.

78
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,723
He knew what went on there.

79
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:31,645
Every once in a while I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

80
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,563
The way I saw it...

81
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:36,566
...everybody takes a beating sometime.

82
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,361
I can't make any more deliveries.

83
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,655
What? You'll fuck everything up.

84
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,907
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

85
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,325
Come with me.

86
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,619
Is that him there?
-No.

87
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,247
How about him?
-No.

88
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,209
That's the guy...
-Get him.

89
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:56,920
Excuse me.

90
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:01,049
Scumbag.
-Come here, you piece of shit.

91
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,475
Know this kid?
-Yeah.

92
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,477
Know where he lives?
-Yeah.

93
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,021
You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.

94
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:18,900
From now on, any letter from
school to his house comes directly here.

95
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,277
Understand?

96
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:23,697
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

97
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,865
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

98
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,412
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

99
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,539
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

100
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:35,375
After a few weeks, my mother went
to the post office to complain.

101
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,712
How could I go to school after that...

102
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:42,549
...and pledge allegiance and sit through
good government bullshit?

103
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,347
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

104
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:51,933
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?

105
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:53,727
All right, make the call.

106
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,481
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.

107
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,234
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.

108
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:06,823
There were guys, that's all they
did all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

109
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:18,752
For a guy who moved all day long...

110
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,963
...Paulie didn't talk to six people.
With union problems...

111
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,007
...or a beef in the numbers...

112
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:27,510
...only the top guys spoke
with Paulie about the problem.

113
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:31,223
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

114
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:34,267
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

115
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:37,395
...or anyone listening to
what he was being told.

116
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:42,025
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and
he got a piece of everything they made.

117
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:46,696
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

118
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:51,201
All they got from Paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off.

119
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,539
That's what it's all about. That's
what the FBI could never understand.

120
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:58,291
What Paulie and the Organization does...

121
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,212
...is protect people who can't
go to the cops. That's it.

122
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,883
They're like the police department
for wiseguys.

123
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,814
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

124
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:25,443
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday morning for fresh bread.

125
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,990
The owner knew who I was with, and no
matter how many people were waiting...

126
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,033
...I was taken care of first.

127
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:36,746
Our neighbors stopped parking in
our driveway, even though we had no car.

128
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:37,998
At 13...

129
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:42,586
...I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

130
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,337
I had it all.

131
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,264
One day...

132
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:58,935
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

133
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,520
You know why?

134
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:03,273
It was out of respect.

135
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,443
What do you think?

136
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,530
Aren't my shoes great?

137
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,617
You look like a gangster.

138
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,619
They shot me. Help!

139
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:19,748
Henry, shut the door.

140
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:24,085
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

141
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,255
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

142
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,382
I can't have that in this joint.

143
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,219
I remember feeling bad
about the guy, but also...

144
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,262
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.

145
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:37,224
I knew Paulie didn't want
anyone dying in the building.

146
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:41,061
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

147
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,564
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

148
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:06,253
It was a glorious time.

149
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,798
And wiseguys were all over the place.

150
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:13,510
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

151
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,596
...decided to take on
a boss and start a war.

152
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,432
It was when I met the world.

153
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:22,435
And it was when
I first met Jimmy Conway.

154
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:28,525
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

155
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:33,196
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

156
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,116
He'd give a doorman $100
just for opening the door.

157
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:39,953
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

158
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,206
The bartender got $100 just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

159
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,459
The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

160
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:52,299
Want a drink?
Give me a Seven and Seven.

161
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,516
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

162
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,143
How you doin'?

163
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:06,563
Thank you.

164
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:07,981
Keep them coming.

165
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:11,234
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

166
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:15,572
He was first locked up at 11,
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

167
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,201
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

168
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:23,747
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.

169
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,999
He actually enjoyed it.

170
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:30,503
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies.

171
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,714
Give me your wallet.

172
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,929
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

173
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:41,681
He was one of the city's
biggest hijackers...

174
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,185
...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

175
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,020
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

176
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,438
They went fast.

177
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:52,442
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

178
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,194
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

179
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:55,528
Help the lady.

180
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,989
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

181
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:01,618
...about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

182
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,829
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

183
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,292
Henry, come here.

184
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,711
Say hello to Tommy.

185
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,840
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

186
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,969
Jimmy, you got anything good?

187
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:23,390
When the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

188
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,393
He made them partners.

189
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,395
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

190
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,315
What do you need?
Two Luckys.

191
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,110
Here you go, Henry.
Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:37,904
What do you need?
One Pall Mall.

193
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,698
What are you doing?

194
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,825
-It's all right.
-Says who? Your mother?

195
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,827
How many Pall Malls you need?

196
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,746
-Where'd you get the cigarettes?
-Get him out of here.

197
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,540
-It's okay.
-It's not okay!

198
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,166
You don't understand.

199
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,169
You don't understand.
Store's closed.

200
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,758
Henry got pinched.
Where?

201
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,427
By the factory.

202
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,931
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

203
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,933
Docket #704162.

204
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,937
Yes, sir. That's me.

205
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,610
Just stand there.
Now stay there.

206
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:24,701
Counselor, proceed.

207
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:29,789
Congratulations.

208
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,625
Here's your graduation present.

209
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,212
Why? I got pinched.
Everyone does, but you did it right.

210
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,131
-You told them nothing.
-I thought you'd be mad.

211
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,467
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

212
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,594
You took your first pinch like a man...

213
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,138
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

214
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,389
What?

215
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:47,974
Look at me.

216
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:50,143
Never rat on your friends...

217
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,729
...and always keep your mouth shut.

218
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,317
Here he is!

219
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:59,736
You broke your cherry!

220
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,328
Congratulations!

221
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,125
"Sometimes

222
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,504
"I

223
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,799
"Wonder

224
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,009
"Why I spend"

225
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,848
"The lonely night

226
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,892
"Dreaming of you so

227
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,188
"The melody was my reverie

228
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,361
"And I am once again with you"

229
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:46,866
By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year in cargo...

230
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,621
...moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

231
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:54,291
See, we grew up near the airport.

232
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,795
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

233
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,966
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

234
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:06,052
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

235
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:10,307
...Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

236
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:14,477
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge.

237
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,480
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

238
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:20,066
To us, it was better than Citibank.

239
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,455
You got a phone?
Come on!

240
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,876
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?

241
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,674
There was Jimmy and Tommy...

242
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,134
...and me.

243
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,595
And there was Anthony Stabile.

244
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,348
Frankie Carbone.

245
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,686
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

246
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:00,023
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

247
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:03,360
...and Freddy No Nose.

248
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:08,782
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

249
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,203
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

250
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:16,373
...and Mikey Franzese.

251
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:21,378
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed
because he said everything twice.

252
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,130
I'll get the papers, get the papers.

253
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:39,854
What is this? Coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.

254
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,232
Suits are up on Thursday.

255
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,485
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

256
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,821
You don't want furs?
I'll take them away.

257
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:51,992
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

258
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,078
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

259
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:59,499
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

260
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,670
...and took the subway to work and
worried about bills, were dead.

261
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,590
They were suckers. They had no balls.

262
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,259
If we wanted something, we just took it.

263
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:13,763
If anyone complained twice, they got
hit so bad they never complained again.

264
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:17,517
It was all just routine.
You didn't even think about it.

265
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,688
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

266
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,773
...have to do with 469?

267
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:28,528
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

268
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:36,745
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.

269
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,748
No problems?
-I'll take care of it.

270
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:50,508
-Tell him what you were telling me.
-Too good to be true.

271
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,889
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

272
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:59,851
Americans change
...their money over into French money...

273
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:01,311
...and send it back here.

274
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:03,939
Calm down.
-It's beautiful.

275
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:06,608
It's totally, totally untraceable.

276
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,986
Our only problem is getting a key,
but I got a plan.

277
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,657
Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
-Yeah, he's a piece of work.

278
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,661
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

279
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:22,415
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

280
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:27,003
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

281
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,922
What about the security?

282
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,340
Security?

283
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,095
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

284
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:38,306
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.

285
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,184
It's beautiful.
It won't be a problem at all.

286
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,270
Good.
-We're on.

287
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,440
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

288
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:49,693
I'm in the weeds lying down.

289
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,112
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting."

290
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,029
"Here?"

291
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:57,117
"This ain't no beach or park."
"I'm resting!" I said.

292
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,453
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

293
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:03,957
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

294
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,545
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

295
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:11,298
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

296
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,843
Bing! Pow! Boom!

297
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:18,263
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

298
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,767
I'm coming around and who do I see
in front of me?

299
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,021
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

300
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:29,774
I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother."

301
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:33,153
I thought he'd shit.

302
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:35,989
Pow! Ping!

303
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:39,075
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

304
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,165
Funny. You're really funny.

305
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,668
What do you mean, I'm funny?

306
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:51,671
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

307
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,673
You're a funny guy.

308
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,843
You mean the way I talk? What?

309
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:00,555
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

310
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:03,850
You know, the way you tell the story.

311
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,645
Funny how? What's funny about it?

312
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:09,981
Tommy, you got it all wrong.
Anthony...

313
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:13,526
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?

314
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,865
Just, you know. You're funny.

315
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,117
Let me understand this.

316
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,203
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

317
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:26,998
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

318
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,293
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

319
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:33,046
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

320
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,718
You know, how you tell a story.

321
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,722
No, I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.

322
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:46,476
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

323
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,728
Tell me what's funny!

324
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:56,319
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

325
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,030
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

326
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,242
You stuttering prick, you!

327
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,369
Frankie, was he shaking?

328
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:09,749
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!

329
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:18,758
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

330
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:22,304
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

331
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:25,849
This guy didn't want to give you the check.

332
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:27,934
Could you take care of this?

333
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:30,854
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.

334
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,856
That's what I want to talk to you about.

335
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:36,568
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

336
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,780
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

337
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:44,451
It's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.

338
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:48,622
Embarrassing me in front
of my friends, like I'm a deadbeat.

339
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:52,292
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

340
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,628
Don't be like that.
Like what?

341
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,303
Do you believe this prick?

342
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:05,430
You think this is funny?

343
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:11,228
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

344
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,023
You don't want
to bring the check?

345
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,068
Do you believe this prick?

346
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,823
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

347
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,242
You're a funny guy.

348
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,161
That's it, Henry!

349
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:33,625
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.

350
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,546
I charged him $7,000.

351
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:42,676
You really are a funny guy.

352
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,266
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.

353
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:51,851
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.

354
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,313
I got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.

355
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:58,608
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.

356
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:02,028
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

357
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:06,283
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.

358
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,869
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

359
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,454
You've known this Tommy
all your life.

360
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:13,707
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

361
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:17,711
When I leave my house in the morning
I look over both shoulders.

362
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:21,006
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

363
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:24,718
-Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
-What could I do?

364
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:30,056
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.

365
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:33,059
Tell him what we talked about.

366
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:40,942
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

367
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,903
What are you talking about?

368
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:44,696
You mean the restaurant?

369
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,574
It's a classy place.

370
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:50,368
You've been in here a million times.

371
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:54,748
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

372
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,501
I don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

373
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,838
I'm begging you. What can I say?

374
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:05,217
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?

375
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:09,054
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

376
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,265
All I know is how to sit down
and order a meal.

377
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:14,768
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

378
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:19,522
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

379
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,524
What do you want from me?

380
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:25,278
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

381
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:27,530
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

382
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,957
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

383
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,793
I just need help. Help me, please.

384
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:42,796
Know anything about
the restaurant business?

385
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:45,549
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

386
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:48,927
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

387
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,305
You want me to be your partner?

388
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,391
Is that what you're telling me?

389
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:57,811
What do you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please.

390
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,813
It's not even fair.

391
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:01,898
You don't understand.

392
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:05,110
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.

393
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:09,656
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

394
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:13,994
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

395
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:16,329
Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.

396
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,832
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...

397
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:22,085
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...

398
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,129
...every week no matter what.

399
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:28,341
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me."

400
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:32,012
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."

401
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:37,851
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.

402
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:40,687
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.

403
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:45,567
Take deliveries at the front door
and sell it out the back at a discount.

404
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:48,862
Take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

405
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:51,698
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

406
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,661
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

407
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,874
...when you can't borrow
another buck from the bank...

408
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,419
...you bust the joint out.
You light a match.

409
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:06,796
Do you need help
reaching anything?

410
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,091
You look like you're decorating
a Christmas tree.

411
00:27:14,054 --> 00:27:16,223
She's from the Five Towns.

412
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:17,474
Who?

413
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,310
The Jew broad. Diane.

414
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:26,691
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

415
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,236
-No.
-No, what?

416
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,739
No, what? Who asked you anything?

417
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:35,075
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.

418
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:36,618
All right, what?

419
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:43,166
She won't go out with ltalians alone.
She's prejudiced against ltalians.

420
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:48,255
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

421
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:53,385
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against ltalians.

422
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:58,765
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

423
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:01,184
See? I knew it. I knew it.

424
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,520
What the fuck is wrong with that?

425
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,855
-When is it?
-Tomorrow night.

426
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm meeting Tuddy.

427
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:10,151
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

428
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,113
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.

429
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:17,492
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

430
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,620
I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.

431
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,791
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!

432
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,378
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

433
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:33,049
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

434
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:35,385
You with your fucking mouth!

435
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,434
I had a meeting
with Tuddy at 11:00...

436
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,603
...and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

437
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,563
Did you have enough to eat?

438
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:49,649
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.

439
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,568
Let me watch your figure.

440
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:53,320
I couldn't wait to go.

441
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:56,197
I was ordering dessert
when they were eating dinner.

442
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,576
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for the check.

443
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:02,078
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

444
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,332
Joe, can we have the check?

445
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:06,917
What are you doing?

446
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,419
I got to go.
We just got here.

447
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:10,921
I got that thing.

448
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,548
We'll leave together.

449
00:29:13,924 --> 00:29:17,427
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

450
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,096
I couldn't stand him.

451
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:24,267
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

452
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:28,772
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

453
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:35,820
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

454
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,616
Ready?
Lighten up.

455
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:42,369
We just got here. What are you doing?

456
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:46,790
Before it was time to go,
he was pushing me into the car...

457
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:49,876
...then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

458
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:54,673
Diane and Tommy made us promise
to meet them again on Friday.

459
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,383
We agreed.

460
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:59,803
But when Friday came around,
Henry stood me up.

461
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,473
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

462
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:06,643
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.

463
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,145
We were a trio
instead of a double date.

464
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:12,399
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

465
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,443
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

466
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:21,658
Tommy, what the fuck?

467
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:24,286
You got some nerve standing me up.

468
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,329
Nobody does that to me.

469
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:29,749
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?

470
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,753
I forgot. I thought it was next week.

471
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,382
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

472
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:39,926
We can talk about this.

473
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,971
Talk to you after what you just did to me?

474
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,348
Forget it.

475
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:49,936
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

476
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:54,691
Let me make it up to you.

477
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:56,192
I'll think about it.

478
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:59,779
I remember, she was screaming
on the street and I mean loud.

479
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:02,574
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.

480
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,826
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

481
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,538
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

482
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,209
Hello, Henry.

483
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,543
-Ready?
-Yeah.

484
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:14,628
Come on.

485
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,922
Wait a minute.
What?

486
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,050
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

487
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,551
KAREN'S Karen?

488
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:22,636
Mom.

489
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,721
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

490
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,348
How do you do?

491
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:29,100
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

492
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,978
It's just the good half.

493
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,315
See you later.

494
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,442
You're leaving your car?

495
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,569
He watches the car for me.

496
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:42,155
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.

497
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,741
It's a lot quicker that way.

498
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:55,544
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,301
How are you doin'?
What's up? Here you go.

500
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:13,687
How are you doin', Gino?
-Good. How are you?

501
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:20,485
Every time I come here,
I see you two. Don't you work?

502
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,672
"He kissed me in a way

503
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:43,341
"That I've never been kissed before

504
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:47,846
"He kissed me in a way

505
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:50,640
"That I wanna be kissed forever more"

506
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,748
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

507
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:16,833
Anthony, right in the front.

508
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:19,294
Anything you need, let me know.

509
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,940
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

510
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:50,116
You gave them $20 each.

511
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:53,245
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

512
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,288
Where?
-Over there.

513
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,165
Thanks a lot, Tony.

514
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:01,920
-What do you do?
-What?

515
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:05,131
-What do you do?
-I'm in construction.

516
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:10,053
They don't feel like you're in construction.

517
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,596
I'm a union delegate.

518
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:14,641
Ladies and gentlemen...

519
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:18,812
...the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...

520
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,147
...Henry Youngman.

521
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:31,491
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

522
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:36,413
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

523
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:41,209
I said, "Where do you
wanna go for our anniversary?"

524
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:43,545
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before."

525
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,422
I said, "Try the kitchen."

526
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,174
Dr. Wellsler is here.

527
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,969
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

528
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:52,762
Gave him another six months.

529
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,933
I love this crowd.

530
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,325
Air France made me.

531
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:16,870
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

532
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:20,707
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

533
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,172
Sixty thousand.

534
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,424
It's going to be a good summer.

535
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:36,223
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

536
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:40,393
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

537
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,981
Check, sir.

538
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:50,403
No. You have to sign for it here.

539
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:52,906
Should I tip him?

540
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,331
Hi, Karen.

541
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:03,375
-How are you?
-Okay. And you?

542
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:08,171
Henry, this is Bruce.
-Good to meet you.

543
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,468
I'll see you around later.

544
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:19,432
Do you know him?

545
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:20,433
Yeah.

546
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,477
He lives across the street.

547
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:28,942
"Roses are red, my love

548
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,237
"Violets are blue

549
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,325
"Sugar is sweet, my love

550
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:40,537
"But not as sweet as you"

551
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:52,090
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

552
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:56,052
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

553
00:36:56,303 --> 00:36:58,805
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

554
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,810
He was an exciting guy.

555
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:07,814
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

556
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:11,484
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

557
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,904
He knew how to handle it.

558
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:24,497
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

559
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,666
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

560
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,543
Even underwater.

561
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:32,756
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested
against hurricane winds.

562
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,593
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.

563
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:38,637
Call me now!

564
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:43,099
Come in for a personalized fitting.

565
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:48,939
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

566
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:51,024
I've been good to you.

567
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:54,277
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

568
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,696
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

569
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,949
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

570
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:01,993
I never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.

571
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,454
What am l, a schmuck?

572
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,123
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

573
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,459
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.

574
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:12,587
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

575
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,173
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!

576
00:38:15,257 --> 00:38:16,049
Fuck him!

577
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:19,302
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

578
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,137
Did I ever bust his balls?

579
00:38:21,221 --> 00:38:23,807
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

580
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,893
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.

581
00:38:27,561 --> 00:38:29,896
You got money
for that commercial!

582
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:33,316
You don't got my fucking money?

583
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,193
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

584
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:38,822
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

585
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,240
Pay me!

586
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:41,825
He'll pay, he'll pay.

587
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,621
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

588
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:52,419
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

589
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:55,672
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!

590
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:59,593
I'll give you... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

591
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,469
Karen, slow down.

592
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:05,515
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

593
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,268
It's Karen.

594
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:21,907
What happened?

595
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,452
What happened? Are you all right?

596
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,953
Who did it?

597
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,750
This guy who lives across the
street from me that I've known all my life.

598
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,424
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

599
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,761
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

600
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:46,139
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

601
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:51,228
He pushed me out of the car.

602
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:00,445
You sure you're all right?

603
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,327
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

604
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:30,392
What do you want, fucko?

605
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:41,695
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

606
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,490
Don't shoot.

607
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:07,262
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

608
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:09,055
Yes.

609
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:14,144
I know there are women...

610
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:17,564
...who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

611
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,609
...gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

612
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:24,738
I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.

613
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:32,954
Mazel tov!

614
00:41:40,962 --> 00:41:42,881
"Will you take part in

615
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:46,051
"My life

616
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:49,804
"My love

617
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:53,600
"That is my dream"

618
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:08,823
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

619
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:11,785
He's settling down now. He's married.

620
00:42:12,536 --> 00:42:14,704
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

621
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:18,583
And you're still bouncing
around from girl to girl.

622
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:28,885
It was like he had two families.

623
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:33,139
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

624
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:36,643
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

625
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,146
Almost all of them were named
Peter or Paul.

626
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:43,191
It was unbelievable.

627
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:46,444
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

628
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,990
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls there...

629
00:42:50,073 --> 00:42:51,324
This is Marie.

630
00:42:51,408 --> 00:42:54,035
...all married to girls named Marie.

631
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,413
She looks ltalian.

632
00:42:57,497 --> 00:43:00,333
And they named
all their daughters Marie.

633
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:04,921
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

634
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:08,592
By the time I had met everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

635
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,099
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

636
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,353
Welcome to the family.

637
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,105
Sunday dinner?

638
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:24,816
So beautiful. I want to cry.

639
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:28,028
Here's something
to help you get started.

640
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:47,672
The bag. The bag.
What bag?

641
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:51,968
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

642
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,555
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

643
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,268
"Will you take part in

644
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:03,271
"My life

645
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,525
"My love

646
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,030
"That is my dream

647
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:19,955
"Life is but a dream"

648
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:28,004
He didn't call?

649
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:29,673
He's with his friends.

650
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:32,217
What kind of person doesn't call?

651
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,679
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.

652
00:44:35,762 --> 00:44:38,431
A grown-up would get you
an apartment.

653
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:41,977
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

654
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:44,104
You're here a month...

655
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:46,648
...and sometimes I know
he doesn't come home at all.

656
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:48,358
What kind of people are these?

657
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:51,695
What do you want me to do?
What can you do?

658
00:44:51,778 --> 00:44:55,615
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

659
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:59,202
Your father never stayed out
all night without calling.

660
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:02,539
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

661
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,041
You don't know how I feel!

662
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,212
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

663
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:11,631
He's with his friends! Dad!

664
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:14,217
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

665
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:17,012
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

666
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,191
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?

667
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:34,988
We were worried!
A married man does not stay out like this!

668
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:36,698
Mom!

669
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,284
Normal people don't act
like this!

670
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,621
What's wrong with you?

671
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:46,458
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?

672
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,086
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

673
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,422
What kind of people are they?

674
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:58,428
We weren't married
to nine-to-five guys.

675
00:45:58,595 --> 00:46:01,431
But the first time I realized how different...

676
00:46:01,514 --> 00:46:03,934
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.

677
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:07,229
Karen, where you from?
Lawrence.

678
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:09,272
On the Island. Nice.

679
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:11,691
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?

680
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:15,487
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

681
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:17,906
Stop picking at that.

682
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,866
I'd like to smack his face.

683
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:21,535
The red-haired guy?

684
00:46:21,618 --> 00:46:23,787
The guy's hands are all over me.

685
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:27,916
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

686
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:31,378
She means it.

687
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:35,215
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie...

688
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:38,385
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.

689
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:42,556
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

690
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,308
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

691
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:49,062
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

692
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:53,400
The gun goes off. Some kid gets
killed. When the grandmother hears...

693
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:56,403
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.

694
00:46:57,404 --> 00:47:01,741
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

695
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,787
Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.

696
00:47:06,204 --> 00:47:08,206
Give me a break. She's drunk.

697
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:12,460
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

698
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:17,340
They had bad skin and wore too
much makeup. They didn't look very good.

699
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:21,052
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

700
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:22,846
...was thrown together and cheap.

701
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:25,557
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

702
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:29,352
She spends her life in a nightgown.

703
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:31,688
The woman is no angel, believe me.

704
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:34,107
They talked about their rotten kids...

705
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,277
...and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

706
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,529
And the kids still didn't listen.

707
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,866
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

708
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:45,535
I don't know if I could live like that!

709
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,873
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

710
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,211
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

711
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,464
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

712
00:47:57,714 --> 00:47:59,966
Because he wanted to get away from her.

713
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,346
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

714
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:07,224
Unless they make themselves get caught.

715
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:10,977
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.

716
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:16,900
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

717
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,153
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

718
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:23,782
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

719
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:33,458
After a while,
it got to be all normal.

720
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:36,503
None of it seemed like crimes.

721
00:48:36,836 --> 00:48:38,838
Henry was just enterprising.

722
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:42,717
He and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

723
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:46,012
...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.

724
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:50,517
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
just blue-collar guys...

725
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:55,480
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

726
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:58,191
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

727
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:07,284
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

728
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:19,462
See you at the diner.
I'm riding shotgun.

729
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:22,132
Did you see him give it right over?

730
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:25,385
Back to the hideout
to split up the loot.

731
00:49:29,598 --> 00:49:31,600
We were all very close.

732
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:35,395
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

733
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:40,483
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

734
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,152
Police.

735
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:44,988
I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.

736
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:46,448
We have a search warrant.

737
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:48,366
Would you read and sign it?

738
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:49,826
Anywhere?

739
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,746
We have to go through everything.

740
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:54,664
You want some coffee?

741
00:49:54,748 --> 00:49:56,708
No coffee now, thanks.

742
00:49:56,917 --> 00:50:00,295
Be careful.
We'll just go about our business.

743
00:50:00,503 --> 00:50:03,006
There was always
a little harassment.

744
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:05,926
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

745
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:09,095
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

746
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:11,848
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

747
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:15,018
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

748
00:50:20,607 --> 00:50:25,111
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

749
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:28,531
...used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

750
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:31,952
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.

751
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:35,288
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

752
00:50:35,372 --> 00:50:37,541
"Don't cry, Pretty, don't cry

753
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:39,709
"Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye"

754
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:43,213
"Happy birthday to you"

755
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:48,885
We always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd.

756
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:53,473
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

757
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:56,810
The women played cards.

758
00:50:56,893 --> 00:51:00,814
When kids were born, Mickey and
Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

759
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:04,401
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

760
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:05,819
...we went together.

761
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:08,780
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

762
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:13,368
I began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck...

763
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,079
...to get us the little extras.

764
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:19,541
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

765
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,168
Can't do it.
Why not?

766
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:25,088
I just can't.
I got something lined up.

767
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:28,425
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

768
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,926
Pretty please?

769
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,554
I can't.
What do you want me to do?

770
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:36,266
I got to go.
Wait a minute.

771
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:39,102
I need money to go shopping.

772
00:51:39,436 --> 00:51:40,770
How much?

773
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,317
That much.

774
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,781
This much. Give me a kiss.

775
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:54,284
Here.

776
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:57,704
See you later.

777
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,127
All right.

778
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:09,216
"I always dreamed the boy I love
would come along

779
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:12,302
"And he'd be tall and handsome,
rich and strong"

780
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,953
Welcome home, Batts.

781
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:42,082
Hi there. How are you?

782
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:45,335
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

783
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:48,547
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

784
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,590
There's only one Irishman here.

785
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:52,467
It's a celebration.

786
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:56,179
Top of the morning.
It's good to be home.

787
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:01,935
This is my friend Jimmy.

788
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:04,521
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

789
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:07,607
Tommy. All dressed up.

790
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:10,110
All grown up and doing the town.

791
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:13,738
Forgot you were having
a party for him.

792
00:53:14,531 --> 00:53:15,865
Come here.

793
00:53:16,283 --> 00:53:18,535
I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?

794
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:21,037
I haven't seen you in six years.

795
00:53:21,538 --> 00:53:24,499
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

796
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,877
Watch the suit.

797
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,130
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

798
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:34,843
Don't get too big on me.
Just don't bust my balls.

799
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:38,805
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

800
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:42,767
This kid was great.

801
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:45,312
I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

802
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:49,399
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

803
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:52,360
He was the best.
Made a lot of money.

804
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:56,531
No more shines.

805
00:53:57,073 --> 00:53:58,658
What?
No more shines.

806
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:01,578
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

807
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:03,747
I don't shine shoes anymore.

808
00:54:04,247 --> 00:54:08,418
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

809
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:10,003
I'm only kidding with you.

810
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:13,173
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

811
00:54:13,256 --> 00:54:15,508
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

812
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:19,429
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

813
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:21,806
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you.

814
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,266
I'm sorry, too.

815
00:54:28,772 --> 00:54:31,024
Now go home
and get your fucking shine box.

816
00:54:31,107 --> 00:54:32,901
Motherfucking mutt!

817
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:35,320
You fucking piece of shit!

818
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:37,447
Come on, come on!

819
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:41,451
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

820
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,703
You bought your fucking button!

821
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:46,289
Don't get nervous.
You motherfucker!

822
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:49,334
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

823
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:52,879
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

824
00:54:52,963 --> 00:54:56,466
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

825
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,052
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

826
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:02,722
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.

827
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:06,142
You understand what I'm saying?
It's alright.

828
00:55:06,226 --> 00:55:10,313
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

829
00:55:11,565 --> 00:55:14,568
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

830
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:17,070
I didn't.
You insulted him a little.

831
00:55:17,153 --> 00:55:20,031
-I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
-Okay.

832
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:22,909
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

833
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:24,828
No, have the drink with me.

834
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:28,498
The drinks are on the house.

835
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:32,419
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

836
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:34,337
Fucking break up my party.

837
00:55:35,672 --> 00:55:38,258
"And the other so-called
gods of our legends

838
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,093
"Though gods they were

839
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:42,846
"And as the elders of our time choose
to remain blind"

840
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,765
You been away for six years.
It's different now.

841
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:48,143
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

842
00:55:48,935 --> 00:55:52,480
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

843
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:55,108
You're gonna get it.
You understand?

844
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:00,655
Get the door!

845
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:17,881
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

846
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:19,633
Let's shoot him.

847
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:39,402
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

848
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,863
His crew'll be looking for him.

849
00:56:44,074 --> 00:56:46,576
This is bad. What do we do with him?

850
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,578
We can't just dump him on the street.

851
00:56:48,662 --> 00:56:52,666
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

852
00:56:52,749 --> 00:56:55,293
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

853
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:01,424
Henry, go open your trunk.

854
00:57:05,428 --> 00:57:07,931
We'll get a shovel
at my mother's house.

855
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:20,610
She has a shovel somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.

856
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:24,322
TOMMY'S Look who's here.

857
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:27,450
What happened?

858
00:57:27,617 --> 00:57:30,620
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

859
00:57:30,704 --> 00:57:32,372
What happened to him?

860
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:33,957
How are you?

861
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,502
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

862
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:39,713
You, too. How are you?

863
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:41,464
Why are you up so late?

864
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:44,676
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

865
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,389
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

866
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:52,559
-Go to sleep. We're leaving.
-I can't. Not while he's home.

867
00:57:52,642 --> 00:57:55,061
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

868
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:55,896
You go inside.

869
00:57:55,979 --> 00:57:57,731
This stuff is like lead.

870
00:57:57,814 --> 00:58:00,817
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

871
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:04,154
You haven't called. Where have you been?

872
00:58:04,404 --> 00:58:06,156
I been working nights.

873
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,992
And tonight we were out late.

874
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:12,370
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

875
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:16,583
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

876
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,504
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

877
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:23,423
The poor thing.

878
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:26,968
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?

879
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:28,762
The paw.

880
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:31,014
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.

881
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:32,766
I got to hack it off.

882
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,186
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

883
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:38,521
I'll bring the knife back.

884
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:39,981
Delicious.

885
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:43,109
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

886
00:58:43,193 --> 00:58:44,945
I do, almost every night.

887
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,989
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

888
00:58:48,114 --> 00:58:52,577
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.

889
00:58:53,036 --> 00:58:54,371
Settle down.

890
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:58,124
How's your friend Henry?

891
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:00,377
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

892
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,295
Talk. What are you quiet for?

893
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:04,798
You don't eat much,
you don't talk much.

894
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:07,384
I'm just listening.
Something wrong?

895
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:11,137
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.

896
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:15,976
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

897
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,522
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

898
00:59:21,481 --> 00:59:25,443
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

899
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:29,030
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking!"

900
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:33,743
But in ltalian, it sounds much nicer.

901
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,162
Cornuto contento.
That's it.

902
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:38,832
It means he's content to be a jerk.

903
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:41,877
He doesn't care who knows it.

904
00:59:42,419 --> 00:59:44,754
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

905
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:47,424
Look at this.

906
00:59:47,924 --> 00:59:49,259
It's beautiful.

907
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:52,512
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

908
00:59:52,596 --> 00:59:54,723
One's facing east,
the other west.

909
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:57,142
He's saying,
"What do you want from me?"

910
00:59:57,225 --> 00:59:59,102
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

911
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:00,770
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

912
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:02,689
Looks like someone we know.

913
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:06,943
Without the beard. It's him.

914
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:10,780
It's him.

915
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:21,374
What the fuck is that?

916
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,044
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

917
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:27,130
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

918
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,550
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

919
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:34,930
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

920
01:00:35,472 --> 01:00:38,892
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.

921
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:41,645
Before you knew it, one was dead.

922
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:43,939
They were shooting each other
all the time.

923
01:00:44,022 --> 01:00:47,651
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

924
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,404
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

925
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:55,325
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

926
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:59,621
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and considered untouchable.

927
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:03,500
Before you touched a made guy,
you needed a good reason.

928
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,002
You had to get an okay...

929
01:01:06,503 --> 01:01:08,547
...or you'd get whacked.

930
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:23,937
Saturday night was for wives,
but...

931
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:27,065
...Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

932
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:32,779
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!

933
01:01:33,697 --> 01:01:37,158
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!

934
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:42,289
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

935
01:01:42,372 --> 01:01:43,540
What?

936
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:48,587
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

937
01:01:48,712 --> 01:01:50,505
So you condone that stuff.

938
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:52,591
Take it easy.

939
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:56,094
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

940
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:57,762
I don't mean me.

941
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:01,933
But, you know, he's got personality.

942
01:02:02,183 --> 01:02:03,602
"Personality?"

943
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:07,689
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

944
01:02:07,814 --> 01:02:11,318
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

945
01:02:11,484 --> 01:02:13,737
I just said he was talented.

946
01:02:14,237 --> 01:02:16,281
Just leave it alone now.

947
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:19,409
He's talented. Leave it at that.

948
01:02:21,953 --> 01:02:24,206
"Pretend you don't see her, my heart

949
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:27,751
"Although she is coming

950
01:02:29,586 --> 01:02:30,879
"Our way

951
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,508
"Pretend you don't need her

952
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,595
"My heart

953
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,849
"But smile and pretend

954
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:45,977
"To be gay

955
01:02:48,772 --> 01:02:50,899
"It's too late for running

956
01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:54,110
"My heart

957
01:02:56,446 --> 01:02:58,323
"Chin up if the tears

958
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:01,660
"Start to fall

959
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:06,039
"Look somewhere above her

960
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:10,293
"Pretend you don't love her

961
01:03:12,254 --> 01:03:14,381
"Pretend you don't see her

962
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,384
"At all

963
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:22,806
"Pretend you don't see her, my heart

964
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,729
"Although she is coming

965
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,233
"Our way

966
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:37,612
"Pretend you don't need her

967
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:41,157
"My heart

968
01:03:43,368 --> 01:03:45,287
"But smile and pretend

969
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,748
"To be gay"

970
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,757
-Hi, Paulie. How are you?
-How are you?

971
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:00,010
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

972
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:18,612
What did you hear about that thing?

973
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,780
The Brooklyn thing?

974
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:22,490
The guy from downtown.

975
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,202
The guy from where Christie lived?

976
01:04:27,204 --> 01:04:30,832
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

977
01:04:31,374 --> 01:04:32,918
Know the guy I mean?

978
01:04:33,376 --> 01:04:34,628
His name was Batts.

979
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:37,797
His people are driving
everyone crazy looking for him.

980
01:04:37,881 --> 01:04:39,716
Nobody knows what happened.

981
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:43,803
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.

982
01:04:45,388 --> 01:04:48,975
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

983
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,769
-All right?
-Okay.

984
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:56,900
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

985
01:05:02,697 --> 01:05:04,407
I want my money.

986
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:07,035
I want my money. He owes it.

987
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,672
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

988
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,841
Paulie was talking about that.
We must move it.

989
01:05:21,925 --> 01:05:25,220
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

990
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:28,932
-It's been six months.
-We got to move it right away.

991
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:45,865
Henry, hurry up. My mother's
making fried peppers and sausage for us.

992
01:05:49,786 --> 01:05:52,122
Here's an arm.
Very funny.

993
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:54,332
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.

994
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:58,211
What do you like,
the leg or the wing?

995
01:05:58,295 --> 01:06:00,422
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

996
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,383
Oh, that's so bad.

997
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:10,056
Come on, girls.

998
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,225
What happened to the car?

999
01:06:12,475 --> 01:06:14,227
I hit a skunk, all right?

1000
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:15,979
Go with your mother.

1001
01:06:17,314 --> 01:06:19,316
It's disgusting, Henry.

1002
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:25,989
I set up Janice in an apartment
near The Suite.

1003
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:28,909
That way I was able to stay over
a few nights a week.

1004
01:06:28,992 --> 01:06:30,076
My new antique lamp.

1005
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,413
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

1006
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:35,582
The furniture's all
Maurice Valencia.

1007
01:06:35,665 --> 01:06:37,250
Looks like Roma.

1008
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:40,003
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

1009
01:06:41,588 --> 01:06:43,506
Come see my bedroom.

1010
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:48,094
Tommy, will you take him?
I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

1011
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:54,392
Love that crystal ball or what?

1012
01:06:55,602 --> 01:06:58,355
This is where we spend most of our time.

1013
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:02,651
I love the floral arrangements.

1014
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:05,904
French.

1015
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:08,114
Janice and I were having
so much fun...

1016
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:09,950
...she started screwing up at work.

1017
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,118
I had to straighten out her boss.

1018
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:14,704
Janice can do
what she wants to do!

1019
01:07:15,038 --> 01:07:16,206
Got it?

1020
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:20,418
Just try to run. Hang up
once more and you'll deal with me!

1021
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:28,093
Get off of her.

1022
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:30,303
You're an animal.

1023
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,861
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

1024
01:07:50,115 --> 01:07:52,868
Did you guys eat?
I'm starving.

1025
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,954
I'll play these.
You'll play those?

1026
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:58,248
Do I stutter? I play those.

1027
01:08:01,751 --> 01:08:03,670
What am I? A mirage?

1028
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:06,506
Where's my fucking drink?

1029
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,593
You wanted a drink?
I asked you for one.

1030
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:12,387
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

1031
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,432
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

1032
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:18,935
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

1033
01:08:19,436 --> 01:08:23,023
I thought it was Henry.
You're a stuttering fuck.

1034
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,483
You said, "I'm all right, Spider."

1035
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:27,360
You ain't all right.

1036
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:29,779
No, you said you were all right.

1037
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:32,616
I am all right!
You ain't, you prick.

1038
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:36,494
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!

1039
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:40,040
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

1040
01:08:40,123 --> 01:08:42,959
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

1041
01:08:43,126 --> 01:08:45,503
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit."

1042
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:47,631
For everybody else you run.

1043
01:08:47,714 --> 01:08:50,842
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!

1044
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:53,386
What's that Bogart movie?

1045
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:56,514
Where he played a cowboy.
The Oklahoma Kid.

1046
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:59,726
Oklahoma Kid. Shane?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

1047
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,812
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1048
01:09:03,897 --> 01:09:05,148
Yahoo, motherfucker!

1049
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:07,567
Round up those fucking wagons.

1050
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:15,617
Now he's moving.

1051
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:19,329
Shot in the foot.

1052
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:23,250
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

1053
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,918
Vito, get a towel.

1054
01:09:25,001 --> 01:09:26,461
Nice fucking game.

1055
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:32,133
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1056
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:35,387
Take him to the doctor
down the street.

1057
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:38,098
Bones are all shattered.

1058
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:39,849
Don't get me upset.

1059
01:09:40,183 --> 01:09:43,186
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!

1060
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:46,523
You trying to make me think
what I did here.

1061
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:48,525
It was an accident.

1062
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:50,777
Little fucking actor.

1063
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:52,779
-You in?
-I'm in.

1064
01:09:52,946 --> 01:09:54,948
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?

1065
01:09:55,865 --> 01:09:57,993
You haven't been home
in two weeks!

1066
01:09:58,076 --> 01:09:59,703
You're not going out tonight!

1067
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:02,789
Will you grow up! I'm still going to go out!

1068
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:05,041
Not without your car keys.

1069
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:07,460
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1070
01:10:07,544 --> 01:10:09,462
Yes! Something's going on!

1071
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:12,465
-Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
-No!

1072
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:16,011
I look in your face
and I know you're lying!

1073
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:21,057
Get out! Get out!
Shut up!

1074
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:22,559
Out of my life!

1075
01:10:22,642 --> 01:10:25,312
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

1076
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:28,648
You're a lousy bastard!
You got a problem.

1077
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:32,027
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1078
01:10:32,235 --> 01:10:35,030
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!

1079
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:48,335
Spider, what's your rush?

1080
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:52,672
Thank you.

1081
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:57,052
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1082
01:10:59,095 --> 01:11:02,682
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

1083
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:04,601
But you can still dance.

1084
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:09,147
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.

1085
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,192
Tell the truth.
You want sympathy.

1086
01:11:12,275 --> 01:11:13,944
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.

1087
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:20,450
I didn't hear right.

1088
01:11:20,534 --> 01:11:22,369
I can't believe what I heard.

1089
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:23,578
This is for you.

1090
01:11:24,955 --> 01:11:28,041
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1091
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,502
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1092
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:34,339
He shoots him in the foot
and he tells him to go fuck himself.

1093
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:39,636
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1094
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:41,805
What's this world coming to?

1095
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:48,728
That's what the fucking world's
coming to.

1096
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:51,106
How's that?
What is wrong with you?

1097
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:54,901
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?

1098
01:11:54,985 --> 01:11:57,988
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1099
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,532
How do I know if you're kidding?

1100
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:03,994
I'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?

1101
01:12:04,077 --> 01:12:05,495
He's dead.

1102
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,999
Good shot. I'm a good shot.

1103
01:12:09,082 --> 01:12:11,126
Hard to miss at this distance.

1104
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,378
You got a problem with what I did?

1105
01:12:13,753 --> 01:12:17,340
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1106
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:20,343
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.

1107
01:12:20,427 --> 01:12:24,014
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1108
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:28,351
I'll dig the hole. I don't give
a fuck. Is it the first hole I dug?

1109
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:31,897
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?

1110
01:12:33,231 --> 01:12:34,608
Hello?
Hello!

1111
01:12:34,858 --> 01:12:37,319
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.

1112
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:41,197
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1113
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:43,158
I want to talk to you!

1114
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:46,203
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1115
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:49,998
Open the door!

1116
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,084
Answer me!

1117
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:56,504
I'll tell everyone
who walks in here...

1118
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:59,341
...that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1119
01:12:59,424 --> 01:13:00,759
Superintendent?

1120
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,678
I want you to know
you have a whore...

1121
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:05,180
...living in 2R!

1122
01:13:05,263 --> 01:13:07,974
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1123
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,770
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!

1124
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,774
Wake up, Henry.

1125
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:26,493
Karen...

1126
01:13:29,454 --> 01:13:31,248
What are you doing?

1127
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,293
Karen, are you crazy?

1128
01:13:35,627 --> 01:13:36,878
I am crazy.

1129
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:40,382
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1130
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:45,220
Karen, take it easy.

1131
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:50,976
Do you love her?

1132
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,395
Do you?

1133
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:55,855
Do you?

1134
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:01,152
I love you. You know I love you.

1135
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:03,655
You don't.

1136
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,284
No, you don't.

1137
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,662
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1138
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:14,958
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1139
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,752
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1140
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:19,504
The truth was...

1141
01:14:19,754 --> 01:14:21,756
...no matter how bad I felt...

1142
01:14:22,507 --> 01:14:24,926
...I was still very attracted to him.

1143
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:28,346
Why give him to someone else?

1144
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,390
Why should she win?

1145
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:37,898
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?

1146
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:42,277
You're all I want, Karen.

1147
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,447
Please put the gun down.

1148
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,158
Baby, come on.

1149
01:15:02,964 --> 01:15:05,175
What are you, fucking crazy?

1150
01:15:05,383 --> 01:15:09,179
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1151
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:12,474
I got to fucking come home...for this?

1152
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:16,019
I should fucking kill you!

1153
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:19,773
How does it feel?
I'm sorry.

1154
01:15:20,065 --> 01:15:22,108
How does it feel, Karen?

1155
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,419
I'm sorry!

1156
01:15:47,759 --> 01:15:49,803
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1157
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:53,890
Looking good.
Thank you. Good to see you.

1158
01:15:54,391 --> 01:15:57,102
Hi, Paulie!
Hi, honey. How are you?

1159
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,105
Go get some cigarettes, okay?
Sure.

1160
01:16:00,605 --> 01:16:03,316
Any of you need anything?
I'm all right.

1161
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,527
You want anything to drink? A beer?

1162
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:06,778
No, this...

1163
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:09,906
Chinese food?
No, come on, sit down.

1164
01:16:16,288 --> 01:16:17,998
Karen came to the house.

1165
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,292
She's very upset.

1166
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,419
You got to straighten this out.

1167
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,714
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what she'll do.

1168
01:16:25,964 --> 01:16:28,133
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1169
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:32,220
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1170
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:36,808
I'm not saying to go back to her right now,
but you got to go back.

1171
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,144
You got to keep up appearances.

1172
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,147
The two of them come
to my house every day.

1173
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,899
I can't have it.

1174
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:47,360
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.

1175
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,655
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1176
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:54,701
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.

1177
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,997
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.

1178
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,583
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1179
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:04,502
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1180
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:08,256
I'll talk to Karen.

1181
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,676
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1182
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:17,098
I'll say you'll go back to her
and it'll be like when you first got married.

1183
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:19,768
You'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.

1184
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:21,686
I know how to talk to her.

1185
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:25,690
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa
this weekend to pick up something for me.

1186
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:27,442
Instead, you'll go with Jimmy.

1187
01:17:27,525 --> 01:17:29,027
You come with me.

1188
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:30,820
Have a good time.

1189
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:33,782
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.

1190
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:35,450
We'll have a good time.

1191
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,161
When you come back,
you'll go back to Karen.

1192
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,956
Please, there's no other way.

1193
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:43,375
No divorce. We're not animali.

1194
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,461
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1195
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:50,465
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1196
01:17:55,512 --> 01:17:57,347
You going to pay us?

1197
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,147
Give us the fucking money!

1198
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:07,232
I can't.

1199
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:11,528
Let's go.

1200
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:22,873
We'll throw the bastard
to the lions.

1201
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:26,001
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!

1202
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:27,836
Throw him over the moat.

1203
01:18:27,919 --> 01:18:29,713
I'll get the money!

1204
01:18:30,255 --> 01:18:32,883
They must really feed each other
to the lions...

1205
01:18:32,966 --> 01:18:34,676
...'cause he gave the money right up.

1206
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:36,177
I'll get the money.

1207
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:39,097
We spent the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1208
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,682
They mean business.

1209
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:43,435
Then, I couldn't believe
what happened.

1210
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:46,521
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1211
01:18:46,605 --> 01:18:49,608
At first I didn't even know why
we got picked up.

1212
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:52,360
Then I found out the guy we roughed up...

1213
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:55,447
...had a sister working as a typist
for the FBI.

1214
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,450
I couldn't believe it. Of all people.

1215
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,745
She gave up everybody.
Jimmy, me. Even her brother.

1216
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:06,374
It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1217
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:09,377
The judge gave us ten years,
like he was giving away candy.

1218
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:12,088
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1219
01:19:12,631 --> 01:19:14,633
You will now be turned over...

1220
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,593
...to the U.S. Attorney General.

1221
01:19:19,512 --> 01:19:21,139
Well, sweet Henry...

1222
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:24,517
Toast, guys. Good trip, good life.
Get out soon.

1223
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:27,562
Good trip, sweetheart.

1224
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,525
We'll watch the home front.

1225
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,238
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1226
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:39,908
Motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1227
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,625
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1228
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,597
Now take me to jail.

1229
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,938
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1230
01:20:10,355 --> 01:20:13,817
We had a pasta course,
then we had a meat or a fish.

1231
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,112
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1232
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:19,739
...and had a wonderful system for garlic.

1233
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,868
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...

1234
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:26,037
...it would liquefy in the pan
with a little oil.

1235
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,081
It was a very good system.

1236
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,959
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1237
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,003
Get that smell?

1238
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:37,132
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
veal, beef, and pork.

1239
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,718
You got to have pork.

1240
01:20:40,218 --> 01:20:41,720
That's the flavor.

1241
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:45,974
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1242
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,476
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1243
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,271
I didn't put
too much onions in, Paul.

1244
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:53,481
There are only three small onions.

1245
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:55,817
Three onions?
How many tomatoes?

1246
01:20:55,901 --> 01:20:58,987
Two big cans.
You don't need three onions.

1247
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,739
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1248
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,658
We had no broiler,
so he did everything in pans.

1249
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:07,078
It smelled up the joint and
the hacks used to die...

1250
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,247
...but he cooked a great steak.

1251
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,334
How do you like yours?
Medium rare.

1252
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,920
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1253
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,049
When you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind...

1254
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:22,844
...of all those old movies with rows
and rows of guys behind bars.

1255
01:21:22,928 --> 01:21:25,096
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1256
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:29,184
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1257
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:31,061
Give me two steaks.

1258
01:21:32,437 --> 01:21:36,066
Everyone else in the joint
was doing real time, all together...

1259
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:37,859
...living like pigs.

1260
01:21:37,943 --> 01:21:40,695
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1261
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:44,199
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1262
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:45,784
They deserved it.

1263
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,329
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
wouldn't rat on the guys we did.

1264
01:21:49,412 --> 01:21:52,290
People used to be able
to leave their doors open.

1265
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:55,919
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1266
01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:58,171
We have to take care
of that bastard.

1267
01:21:58,255 --> 01:21:59,714
I took care of him.

1268
01:21:59,798 --> 01:22:01,508
What'd you bring?

1269
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,343
Some bread.

1270
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:06,054
Vinnie, I got peppers and onions.

1271
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:08,682
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1272
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:09,891
What else?

1273
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,977
Scotch.
Nice.

1274
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:13,937
-Red wine.
-Okay.

1275
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:17,065
-Now we can eat.
-Some white, too.

1276
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:21,653
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1277
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:26,950
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1278
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:35,166
Read 'em and weep.

1279
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:39,671
What are you doing?

1280
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,266
I'll catch you guys later.

1281
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:53,560
Going for a walk in the park?

1282
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,982
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.

1283
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:04,571
-ls there any more?
-No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1284
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,963
You girls stay right here.

1285
01:23:22,047 --> 01:23:24,674
Hold hands.
-Go right up front.

1286
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:30,347
How are you doing?
-Good. How are you?

1287
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:43,068
What?

1288
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,320
I saw her name on the register.

1289
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,489
Want her to visit you?

1290
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:50,992
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing to the parole board.

1291
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:54,246
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1292
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,748
I can't stop people from visiting me.

1293
01:23:56,831 --> 01:24:00,001
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

1294
01:24:01,378 --> 01:24:03,421
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1295
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,674
Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1296
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,425
I'm sorry.

1297
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,053
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1298
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,682
Will you stop it?

1299
01:24:13,932 --> 01:24:16,184
Let her do it!
Stop it!

1300
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:22,274
Shh. Ruth, Ruth, come here.

1301
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:27,153
Nobody's helping me.
I am all alone.

1302
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:30,949
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1303
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:34,536
I asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.

1304
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:39,749
He told me to take the kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1305
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,793
It's going to be okay.

1306
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:45,964
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.

1307
01:24:46,715 --> 01:24:49,426
That's what happens when you go away.

1308
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:53,805
We're on our own. Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.

1309
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:58,059
As long as he's on parole
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1310
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,273
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.

1311
01:25:03,356 --> 01:25:05,901
All I need is for you to bring me this stuff.

1312
01:25:05,984 --> 01:25:08,904
A guy in here from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.

1313
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:11,823
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.

1314
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,158
I'm afraid.

1315
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,160
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1316
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,329
He is not helping us out.

1317
01:25:17,662 --> 01:25:19,915
Is he putting any food on the table?

1318
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,335
We've got to help each other.

1319
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:27,005
We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.

1320
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,678
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

1321
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:34,763
Never.

1322
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:02,082
Ruth & Daddy!

1323
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,794
We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?

1324
01:26:05,877 --> 01:26:09,464
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1325
01:26:09,548 --> 01:26:11,049
I did the sun.

1326
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:14,636
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1327
01:26:15,887 --> 01:26:17,806
Do you like the house?

1328
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:22,018
-Get packed. We're moving out.
-With what?

1329
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:25,564
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.

1330
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:28,900
I got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $15,000.

1331
01:26:29,067 --> 01:26:31,319
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.

1332
01:26:31,403 --> 01:26:34,239
Pittsburgh? You have to see
your parole officer.

1333
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,907
Don't worry about it.

1334
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:39,578
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1335
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:41,329
Ruth & Me!

1336
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:52,007
What do you want?

1337
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,759
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1338
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:01,099
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1339
01:27:02,726 --> 01:27:04,936
I don't want any more of that shit.

1340
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:09,024
What are you talking about?
Just stay away from the garbage.

1341
01:27:09,107 --> 01:27:11,610
Inside, you did what you had to do.

1342
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,738
I'm talking about now. From here and now.

1343
01:27:16,031 --> 01:27:18,617
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk of me.

1344
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,202
Just don't do it.

1345
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,204
Don't do it.

1346
01:27:24,122 --> 01:27:26,875
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.

1347
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:30,212
He's a good earner,
but he takes too many chances.

1348
01:27:30,462 --> 01:27:32,631
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1349
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:36,468
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.

1350
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:40,472
-You got to watch out for them.
-I only use them for certain things.

1351
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,433
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.

1352
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:47,979
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll
die in prison. I don't need that.

1353
01:27:48,647 --> 01:27:52,067
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1354
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:57,489
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello
to some fuck who was selling junk.

1355
01:27:57,906 --> 01:28:00,408
That won't happen to me, understand?

1356
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:03,078
You're out early because I got you a job.

1357
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:04,871
I don't need this heat.

1358
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,582
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1359
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:10,168
Anybody.

1360
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,254
All right.
Yeah?

1361
01:28:12,337 --> 01:28:13,713
Yeah. Of course.

1362
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:24,266
It took me a week of sneaking
around to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1363
01:28:24,349 --> 01:28:26,893
But when I did, it was a real score.

1364
01:28:27,352 --> 01:28:29,896
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1365
01:28:30,188 --> 01:28:35,026
Even with Sandy snorting more than she
mixed, I saw this was a good business.

1366
01:28:35,402 --> 01:28:37,904
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1367
01:28:38,363 --> 01:28:41,658
I had a down payment on my house
and things were rolling.

1368
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:45,245
All I had to do was once in a while
tell Sandy I loved her.

1369
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,293
It was perfect.

1370
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:55,922
As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,
Paulie would never find out.

1371
01:28:56,214 --> 01:29:00,010
Within a couple of weeks
it got so big I needed some help.

1372
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:02,846
I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1373
01:29:02,929 --> 01:29:05,307
Nice.
It's fucking great.

1374
01:29:05,432 --> 01:29:07,434
Conway.

1375
01:29:12,397 --> 01:29:14,900
You bring your pay slips?

1376
01:29:17,569 --> 01:29:19,946
Four and a half months of dirt.

1377
01:29:20,405 --> 01:29:22,449
It's so good.
I did it.

1378
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,620
Do you love it?
It's wonderful.

1379
01:29:27,078 --> 01:29:30,624
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.

1380
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:33,543
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1381
01:29:33,752 --> 01:29:35,212
Okay, ready?

1382
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:37,756
Watch the wall with the rock.

1383
01:29:44,763 --> 01:29:47,724
The electricians did it special.
Come on.

1384
01:29:50,477 --> 01:29:54,940
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1385
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:56,358
Nice, huh?

1386
01:29:56,441 --> 01:29:58,652
Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1387
01:29:58,777 --> 01:30:01,071
He's looking into everything.

1388
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,157
It'll make the Air France hold
look like peanuts.

1389
01:30:04,491 --> 01:30:05,492
Come on.

1390
01:30:05,659 --> 01:30:07,786
-He'll do it, right?
-I told you.

1391
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:11,623
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1392
01:30:12,499 --> 01:30:15,585
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.

1393
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:19,506
I've been cultivating this
son of a bitch for two years.

1394
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:23,552
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime. I could retire.

1395
01:30:23,802 --> 01:30:27,806
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1396
01:30:28,014 --> 01:30:29,432
Let's get a drink.

1397
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:33,186
These are the guys Jimmy put
together for what turned out to be...

1398
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:37,274
...the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.

1399
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:42,654
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard
and make him get us in the front door.

1400
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:44,614
Louisiana Lightning!

1401
01:30:44,698 --> 01:30:47,993
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1402
01:30:48,535 --> 01:30:52,455
Johnny Roastbeef kept them
tied up and away from the alarms.

1403
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:55,500
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1404
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:59,337
He used to play guitar at the lounge.
Everybody loved Stacks.

1405
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:01,756
He was supposed to steal the panel truck...

1406
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,135
...and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours in Jersey.

1407
01:31:05,218 --> 01:31:07,637
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1408
01:31:08,054 --> 01:31:09,806
Have a drink and shut up.

1409
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:11,975
Just because he set this up...

1410
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:15,812
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance
on the money we were going to steal.

1411
01:31:15,896 --> 01:31:19,691
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1412
01:31:26,573 --> 01:31:30,577
I had everyone working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1413
01:31:33,538 --> 01:31:34,998
Have a good flight?

1414
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:37,751
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1415
01:31:38,043 --> 01:31:39,920
They're not that bad.

1416
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:43,131
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1417
01:31:43,215 --> 01:31:45,675
Is this the same baby
you used last week?

1418
01:31:45,759 --> 01:31:48,887
No, that was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1419
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:51,139
Big yawn.

1420
01:31:51,223 --> 01:31:52,974
She looks like you.

1421
01:31:53,058 --> 01:31:55,435
That's what the stewardess said.

1422
01:32:08,573 --> 01:32:10,408
Take it easy, Sandy.

1423
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:12,744
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1424
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:16,831
You got all day. Let's make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1425
01:32:16,915 --> 01:32:19,417
I got to go.
Where are you going?

1426
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:23,755
Don't start. You know I got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1427
01:32:24,756 --> 01:32:25,966
Over there.

1428
01:32:26,049 --> 01:32:30,053
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?

1429
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:31,680
Fucks up my nails.

1430
01:32:31,763 --> 01:32:33,598
You got to be smart.

1431
01:32:34,099 --> 01:32:37,102
There's enough powder here
to put us away forever.

1432
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,562
Loosen up.

1433
01:32:38,645 --> 01:32:40,438
What are you doing?

1434
01:32:42,607 --> 01:32:44,943
You don't have to go anywhere.

1435
01:32:45,277 --> 01:32:46,861
Make them wait.

1436
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:57,747
Nobody knows for sure...

1437
01:32:57,831 --> 01:32:59,916
...how much was taken
in the pre-dawn raid...

1438
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,752
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1439
01:33:02,836 --> 01:33:06,381
The FBI says $2,000,000,
Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.

1440
01:33:09,885 --> 01:33:11,094
Jimmy!

1441
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:13,847
Those sons of bitches!

1442
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,600
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1443
01:33:16,683 --> 01:33:20,520
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1444
01:33:22,314 --> 01:33:24,357
Come here, you! Come here!

1445
01:33:25,358 --> 01:33:27,903
Look at this genius. This genius!

1446
01:33:32,532 --> 01:33:34,576
Merry Christmas!

1447
01:33:39,206 --> 01:33:41,791
Who's this?
This is my wife.

1448
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:46,004
Come here. I want to show you something,
Jimmy.

1449
01:33:48,048 --> 01:33:52,719
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it
for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1450
01:33:55,889 --> 01:33:58,725
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?

1451
01:33:59,017 --> 01:34:03,021
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while? The fucking car?

1452
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:07,734
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.

1453
01:34:08,026 --> 01:34:10,904
-I love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.

1454
01:34:10,987 --> 01:34:13,448
I just got married.
Are you nuts?

1455
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:16,451
Why are you getting excited?
Are you stupid?

1456
01:34:16,535 --> 01:34:19,996
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.

1457
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,208
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1458
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:26,378
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?

1459
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:30,590
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?

1460
01:34:31,716 --> 01:34:33,343
What are you getting excited for?

1461
01:34:33,426 --> 01:34:36,429
Because you're going to get us all pinched.

1462
01:34:36,888 --> 01:34:40,058
What's the matter with you?
I apologize.

1463
01:34:40,934 --> 01:34:43,395
-I'm sorry.
-What's the matter with you?

1464
01:34:50,443 --> 01:34:51,861
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1465
01:34:52,862 --> 01:34:54,489
It's under my mother's name.

1466
01:34:54,573 --> 01:34:57,117
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?

1467
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:00,704
I'm sorry. I apologize.
What did I tell you?

1468
01:35:00,787 --> 01:35:03,999
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1469
01:35:04,082 --> 01:35:05,750
You don't buy anything!

1470
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:07,419
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1471
01:35:10,463 --> 01:35:12,632
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1472
01:35:20,307 --> 01:35:22,684
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1473
01:35:22,767 --> 01:35:23,894
Excuse me.

1474
01:35:24,769 --> 01:35:26,521
-Take it off.
-Why?

1475
01:35:28,607 --> 01:35:30,066
Take it off!

1476
01:35:31,484 --> 01:35:35,155
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
or attract attention?

1477
01:35:35,447 --> 01:35:38,617
One guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1478
01:35:38,825 --> 01:35:40,035
I'll return it.

1479
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:44,956
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1480
01:35:56,176 --> 01:35:59,012
This drink here is better
than sex, babe.

1481
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:05,018
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.

1482
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:09,314
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1483
01:36:09,648 --> 01:36:10,982
That's great.

1484
01:36:11,316 --> 01:36:15,070
I tell them all not to
attract attention. What do they do?

1485
01:36:17,364 --> 01:36:19,950
I've been looking all over for you.

1486
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:22,744
Listen, I need the money.

1487
01:36:23,328 --> 01:36:26,623
-Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
-I need the money.

1488
01:36:27,332 --> 01:36:29,417
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1489
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:32,546
-I did what I had to do.
-Not tonight, Morrie.

1490
01:36:32,671 --> 01:36:34,923
I did my caper. He owes me.

1491
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:39,553
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1492
01:36:39,844 --> 01:36:42,806
They're wearing it.
I got to talk to him.

1493
01:36:45,058 --> 01:36:47,352
I got 500 grand coming to me.

1494
01:36:48,353 --> 01:36:50,772
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1495
01:36:50,855 --> 01:36:53,233
I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.

1496
01:36:53,358 --> 01:36:55,777
-I'll talk to him.
-It's poison in my eyes.

1497
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:58,363
-Morris, are you all right?
-No, I'm not.

1498
01:36:58,446 --> 01:36:59,698
Jimmy?

1499
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:08,039
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1500
01:37:08,331 --> 01:37:10,041
Jimmy.

1501
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:12,586
We did it!

1502
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:19,801
Who is it?
It's me.

1503
01:37:19,885 --> 01:37:21,636
Pete? One second.

1504
01:37:22,429 --> 01:37:26,391
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1505
01:37:27,893 --> 01:37:30,186
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1506
01:37:31,021 --> 01:37:33,732
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1507
01:37:35,358 --> 01:37:38,528
What do you think, Mommy?
I love them all.

1508
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:40,780
I love the gold outfit.

1509
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,782
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

1510
01:37:43,867 --> 01:37:45,243
And? And?

1511
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:47,162
Happy Hanukkah.

1512
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:52,125
Very funny.
Go get yourself something nice.

1513
01:37:59,925 --> 01:38:04,512
Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1514
01:38:05,055 --> 01:38:08,475
Six million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1515
01:38:18,068 --> 01:38:19,486
Yo, Stacks!

1516
01:38:19,945 --> 01:38:21,238
Open up!

1517
01:38:28,912 --> 01:38:32,707
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1518
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:36,211
You didn't bring any coffee?
Do I look like a caterer?

1519
01:38:36,294 --> 01:38:38,755
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1520
01:38:42,592 --> 01:38:44,553
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1521
01:38:44,636 --> 01:38:46,972
I did. Where the fuck is she?

1522
01:38:47,973 --> 01:38:50,976
Always got these
hot books around or a bitch.

1523
01:38:51,101 --> 01:38:52,435
What time is it?

1524
01:38:52,519 --> 01:38:54,854
It's 11:30.
We were to be there by 9:00.

1525
01:38:54,938 --> 01:38:56,690
I'll be ready in a minute.

1526
01:38:56,773 --> 01:39:00,193
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.

1527
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:09,327
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1528
01:39:12,622 --> 01:39:17,252
What the fuck you doing? It's
a joke. A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1529
01:39:37,147 --> 01:39:39,190
Stacks was always crazy.

1530
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:43,403
Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1531
01:39:43,486 --> 01:39:48,074
...went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1532
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:50,202
It was all over the television.

1533
01:39:50,493 --> 01:39:53,371
They even said they got
prints off the wheel.

1534
01:39:54,206 --> 01:39:57,500
It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1535
01:40:09,346 --> 01:40:11,056
I got to talk to you.

1536
01:40:11,514 --> 01:40:14,434
Have a drink.
Have a drink. Come on.

1537
01:40:14,517 --> 01:40:18,688
Have a drink. What are you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1538
01:40:19,856 --> 01:40:22,067
I still have to talk to you.

1539
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:25,820
-What happened with Stacks?
-Don't worry about that.

1540
01:40:25,904 --> 01:40:29,908
-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they going to go?

1541
01:40:29,991 --> 01:40:32,744
It's in the papers.
He's worried.

1542
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:35,163
What are you worried about?

1543
01:40:35,247 --> 01:40:38,750
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1544
01:40:38,917 --> 01:40:42,420
What are you worried about?
You worry too much.

1545
01:40:42,587 --> 01:40:45,674
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?

1546
01:40:46,049 --> 01:40:47,342
Not yet.

1547
01:40:47,926 --> 01:40:49,928
What?
Guess what?

1548
01:40:50,595 --> 01:40:52,430
They are going to make him.

1549
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:56,059
Paulie's going to make you?

1550
01:40:57,727 --> 01:41:00,564
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1551
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:03,400
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.

1552
01:41:04,401 --> 01:41:08,196
He's getting made. We'll work
for this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1553
01:41:09,906 --> 01:41:11,449
I can't believe it.

1554
01:41:11,575 --> 01:41:13,994
I'm happy for you.
Congratulations.

1555
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:16,121
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1556
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,999
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.

1557
01:41:19,082 --> 01:41:21,001
Can I talk to you a second?

1558
01:41:21,084 --> 01:41:24,087
I masterminded the whole thing,
I'm left with dick.

1559
01:41:24,254 --> 01:41:27,799
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1560
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:32,137
I want my money! I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1561
01:41:32,929 --> 01:41:36,099
-Fuck him! I want my money!
-Good. Go tell him.

1562
01:41:38,435 --> 01:41:40,645
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1563
01:41:42,772 --> 01:41:47,027
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.

1564
01:41:47,611 --> 01:41:49,279
All right. You hear me?

1565
01:41:49,446 --> 01:41:51,781
Everything's going to be fine.

1566
01:42:01,166 --> 01:42:04,544
"Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling"

1567
01:42:05,837 --> 01:42:09,132
Half Mick, half Guinea?
I'll sing with an ltalian accent.

1568
01:42:09,216 --> 01:42:13,470
"And down the glen,
the glen and down the mountainside

1569
01:42:22,312 --> 01:42:23,980
"The summer's gone

1570
01:42:24,314 --> 01:42:26,358
"And all the roses dying"

1571
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:54,761
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1572
01:42:54,844 --> 01:42:58,348
His mind was going in eight
different directions at once.

1573
01:43:00,392 --> 01:43:02,811
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1574
01:43:03,228 --> 01:43:04,729
Morrie? Him?

1575
01:43:05,188 --> 01:43:08,108
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1576
01:43:08,191 --> 01:43:12,862
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1577
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:15,490
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1578
01:43:15,699 --> 01:43:19,286
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1579
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:22,372
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1580
01:43:22,914 --> 01:43:25,250
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1581
01:43:25,584 --> 01:43:27,544
Okay?
All right.

1582
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:32,591
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1583
01:43:32,757 --> 01:43:34,593
Stop breaking my balls.

1584
01:43:34,885 --> 01:43:37,095
I was just stalling for time.

1585
01:43:37,554 --> 01:43:41,641
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1586
01:43:41,725 --> 01:43:46,062
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1587
01:43:46,271 --> 01:43:49,566
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out cold.

1588
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:54,237
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1589
01:43:54,446 --> 01:43:57,115
I walk away. We start to go in this joint.

1590
01:43:57,407 --> 01:44:00,076
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1591
01:44:01,453 --> 01:44:03,330
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1592
01:44:03,413 --> 01:44:07,751
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says, "Ah..."

1593
01:44:08,418 --> 01:44:10,295
I said, "Don't say it!"

1594
01:44:14,966 --> 01:44:16,134
"Jerkoff!"

1595
01:44:18,929 --> 01:44:22,349
What are you going to do?
What? I fucking fly at him!

1596
01:44:22,432 --> 01:44:25,852
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1597
01:44:25,936 --> 01:44:30,649
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1598
01:44:30,941 --> 01:44:33,860
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1599
01:44:33,944 --> 01:44:36,321
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1600
01:44:37,489 --> 01:44:39,616
It was a load off my mind.

1601
01:44:40,659 --> 01:44:43,828
He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1602
01:44:43,995 --> 01:44:46,998
Even if I told him he would
have never believed me.

1603
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:53,547
Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1604
01:44:53,797 --> 01:44:56,424
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1605
01:44:56,508 --> 01:44:59,135
I've never met a ball buster like you.

1606
01:44:59,469 --> 01:45:01,763
Who loves you more than I do?

1607
01:45:02,305 --> 01:45:05,058
-I'd do anything for you.
-Except stop busting my balls.

1608
01:45:06,184 --> 01:45:09,145
Let's go have coffee.
Want to go to the diner?

1609
01:45:09,229 --> 01:45:11,481
We'll go to the diner
on the boulevard.

1610
01:45:11,565 --> 01:45:12,732
Which diner?

1611
01:45:12,816 --> 01:45:14,943
Rockaway Boulevard.
It's open 24 hours.

1612
01:45:15,026 --> 01:45:17,654
They got danishes?
They got everything.

1613
01:45:17,737 --> 01:45:20,407
Let's pick up some danishes
for Belle.

1614
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:24,828
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1615
01:45:32,836 --> 01:45:34,629
I thought he'd never shut up.

1616
01:45:34,713 --> 01:45:36,131
What a pain in the ass.

1617
01:45:36,214 --> 01:45:39,718
What'll we do with him?
Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1618
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:41,303
Call me when you're through.

1619
01:45:41,386 --> 01:45:43,930
Frank, let's chop him up.
All right.

1620
01:45:44,014 --> 01:45:46,391
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker?

1621
01:45:46,474 --> 01:45:48,018
You said chop him up.

1622
01:45:48,101 --> 01:45:50,103
At Charlie's, not here!

1623
01:45:52,355 --> 01:45:54,983
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1624
01:45:55,066 --> 01:45:57,527
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1625
01:45:57,861 --> 01:45:59,154
The car's cold.

1626
01:45:59,237 --> 01:46:02,574
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!

1627
01:46:04,326 --> 01:46:06,661
Who is it?
It's Belle. Open up.

1628
01:46:06,745 --> 01:46:08,747
It's Belle. Let me in.

1629
01:46:08,914 --> 01:46:12,751
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1630
01:46:12,876 --> 01:46:14,294
Calm down.

1631
01:46:14,419 --> 01:46:17,088
He's missing! I know something happened.

1632
01:46:17,255 --> 01:46:19,507
He's probably drunk and fell asleep
somewhere.

1633
01:46:19,591 --> 01:46:23,220
In 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.

1634
01:46:23,428 --> 01:46:25,889
Something's happened. I know you know.

1635
01:46:26,097 --> 01:46:29,392
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.

1636
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:32,354
I've been home!
I've been on the phone...

1637
01:46:32,562 --> 01:46:34,356
He's playing cards.

1638
01:46:36,566 --> 01:46:39,653
What'll I tell Belle?
Who gives a fuck?

1639
01:46:40,111 --> 01:46:43,240
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1640
01:46:43,782 --> 01:46:45,909
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.

1641
01:46:46,117 --> 01:46:47,994
I'll bust their fucking balls.

1642
01:46:48,078 --> 01:46:51,081
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1643
01:46:53,416 --> 01:46:55,794
Come on, fuckos.
Let's go for a ride.

1644
01:46:57,128 --> 01:46:59,130
Keep them up all night.

1645
01:46:59,631 --> 01:47:01,424
I'll see you later.

1646
01:47:50,974 --> 01:47:54,519
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1647
01:47:54,603 --> 01:47:56,855
...but it had nothing to do with me.

1648
01:48:07,324 --> 01:48:10,744
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1649
01:48:12,329 --> 01:48:14,497
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1650
01:48:14,915 --> 01:48:17,876
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.
It was his.

1651
01:48:18,919 --> 01:48:22,214
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1652
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,843
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1653
01:48:26,927 --> 01:48:29,763
He'd rather whack them. What did I care?

1654
01:48:30,055 --> 01:48:32,182
I wasn't asking for anything.

1655
01:48:32,432 --> 01:48:35,852
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1656
01:48:35,936 --> 01:48:40,190
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1657
01:49:02,295 --> 01:49:06,383
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...

1658
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:10,220
...it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1659
01:49:14,891 --> 01:49:17,227
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1660
01:49:17,477 --> 01:49:20,897
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through Pittsburgh...

1661
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:24,734
...and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1662
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:27,070
Jimmy was so happy that morning...

1663
01:49:27,237 --> 01:49:30,240
...because this was the day
Tommy was being made.

1664
01:49:30,574 --> 01:49:33,994
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1665
01:49:34,244 --> 01:49:36,997
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1666
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:41,251
They had a signal set up so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1667
01:49:41,918 --> 01:49:44,546
Ma, where are you?
Here I am.

1668
01:49:44,629 --> 01:49:47,132
-You're home.
-Home? I'm leaving.

1669
01:49:47,841 --> 01:49:50,010
-You look lovely.
-I look good, huh?

1670
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,555
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1671
01:49:54,514 --> 01:49:57,726
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1672
01:49:57,809 --> 01:49:59,185
God be with you.

1673
01:49:59,269 --> 01:50:02,022
We always called each other
goodfellas.

1674
01:50:02,272 --> 01:50:03,940
You'd say to somebody:

1675
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:08,361
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us."

1676
01:50:08,653 --> 01:50:10,030
You understand?

1677
01:50:10,655 --> 01:50:12,866
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1678
01:50:15,535 --> 01:50:18,872
But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1679
01:50:18,955 --> 01:50:21,458
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1680
01:50:21,666 --> 01:50:25,629
To become a member of a crew
you must be 100 percent Italian...

1681
01:50:25,879 --> 01:50:29,341
...so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1682
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,391
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1683
01:50:38,642 --> 01:50:41,186
It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1684
01:50:41,478 --> 01:50:44,314
It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1685
01:50:44,648 --> 01:50:49,486
Also, you can fuck around with anybody,
as long as they aren't also a member.

1686
01:50:49,819 --> 01:50:53,406
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1687
01:50:55,242 --> 01:50:56,826
How many years
since you were made?

1688
01:50:56,910 --> 01:50:59,579
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1689
01:51:00,205 --> 01:51:04,793
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1690
01:51:08,004 --> 01:51:11,091
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1691
01:51:11,174 --> 01:51:13,552
...it was like we were all being made.

1692
01:51:14,344 --> 01:51:17,097
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1693
01:51:32,487 --> 01:51:34,781
Who's this?
This is Vinnie.

1694
01:51:34,864 --> 01:51:37,534
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1695
01:51:37,617 --> 01:51:41,121
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1696
01:51:41,955 --> 01:51:46,042
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1697
01:51:48,461 --> 01:51:49,963
What do you mean?

1698
01:51:50,046 --> 01:51:52,048
He's gone. He's gone.

1699
01:51:53,258 --> 01:51:54,384
That's it.

1700
01:51:59,264 --> 01:52:00,473
I knew it!

1701
01:52:01,141 --> 01:52:03,143
I can't fucking believe it.

1702
01:52:13,069 --> 01:52:15,739
They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.

1703
01:52:31,796 --> 01:52:33,256
Are you all right?

1704
01:52:40,597 --> 01:52:44,392
It was revenge for Billy Batts,
and a lot of other things.

1705
01:52:44,851 --> 01:52:46,186
That's that.

1706
01:52:46,269 --> 01:52:48,980
There was nothing
we could do about it.

1707
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:53,693
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.

1708
01:52:54,319 --> 01:52:57,614
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1709
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,754
They even shot Tommy
in the face...

1710
01:53:12,837 --> 01:53:16,508
...so his mother couldn't give him
an open-coffin at the funeral.

1711
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:06,516
I had a busy day.
I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...

1712
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,685
...to match some silencers he had.

1713
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:11,855
I had to pick up my brother
at the hospital...

1714
01:54:12,105 --> 01:54:14,441
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...

1715
01:54:14,608 --> 01:54:17,652
...to fly down to some customers I had
near Atlanta.

1716
01:54:28,914 --> 01:54:32,709
Right away I knew he didn't
want them and I'd be stuck for the money.

1717
01:54:32,792 --> 01:54:36,922
I bought them because he wanted them
and now he didn't want them.

1718
01:54:37,214 --> 01:54:39,883
What good are these? None of them fit.

1719
01:54:40,133 --> 01:54:42,010
I'm not paying for these!

1720
01:54:42,093 --> 01:54:46,223
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.

1721
01:54:46,306 --> 01:54:48,808
The drugs are making your mind
into mush!

1722
01:54:48,934 --> 01:54:50,727
I'll take 'em back.

1723
01:55:03,365 --> 01:55:05,742
My Pittsburgh guys
always wanted guns.

1724
01:55:05,825 --> 01:55:09,162
Since I would see them in the afternoon,
for a delivery...

1725
01:55:09,579 --> 01:55:12,207
...I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1726
01:55:30,976 --> 01:55:32,143
Oh, my God.

1727
01:55:33,478 --> 01:55:37,274
At the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1728
01:55:38,275 --> 01:55:39,859
What happened to you?

1729
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:43,363
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1730
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,366
And I told him
I was partying all night.

1731
01:55:46,866 --> 01:55:47,909
I'm fine.

1732
01:55:47,993 --> 01:55:49,536
Get over here.

1733
01:55:49,786 --> 01:55:51,663
Let me check you out.

1734
01:55:55,625 --> 01:55:58,128
He took mercy on me,
gave me Valium...

1735
01:55:58,211 --> 01:56:00,046
...and sent me home.

1736
01:56:00,297 --> 01:56:04,301
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1737
01:56:05,969 --> 01:56:09,264
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1738
01:56:09,973 --> 01:56:13,059
Right up there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1739
01:56:13,143 --> 01:56:16,062
-Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?
-I'm telling you.

1740
01:56:16,146 --> 01:56:19,733
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1741
01:56:19,816 --> 01:56:22,736
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1742
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:25,947
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1743
01:56:32,329 --> 01:56:34,456
I was cooking dinner that night.

1744
01:56:34,539 --> 01:56:39,002
I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1745
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:44,925
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy...

1746
01:56:45,008 --> 01:56:46,843
...roasted peppers...

1747
01:56:47,052 --> 01:56:50,722
...string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1748
01:56:51,556 --> 01:56:53,099
...that were cut just right...

1749
01:56:53,183 --> 01:56:56,186
...that I was going to fry up
as an appetizer.

1750
01:56:56,269 --> 01:56:58,355
So I was home for about an hour.

1751
01:56:58,438 --> 01:57:02,859
My plan was to start dinner early so I
could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.

1752
01:57:03,068 --> 01:57:07,322
Then get the package for Lois
to take to Atlanta later that night.

1753
01:57:08,448 --> 01:57:12,244
I kept looking out the window
and saw that the helicopter was gone.

1754
01:57:12,536 --> 01:57:14,371
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1755
01:57:14,454 --> 01:57:16,957
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1756
01:57:17,207 --> 01:57:21,503
I asked my brother to watch
the sauce, and Karen and I started out.

1757
01:57:23,713 --> 01:57:25,507
Oh, God. I see it.

1758
01:57:26,383 --> 01:57:28,385
-Look, it's right there.
-Damn!

1759
01:57:30,053 --> 01:57:31,221
That's it.

1760
01:57:31,304 --> 01:57:33,473
We got to get to your mother's.

1761
01:57:33,807 --> 01:57:35,016
See, I told you.

1762
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:36,518
It's funny.

1763
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:40,605
-It's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.

1764
01:58:08,592 --> 01:58:12,262
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.

1765
01:58:12,345 --> 01:58:15,140
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?

1766
01:58:16,766 --> 01:58:19,895
"Everything's gonna be all right
this morning"

1767
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,980
Let's go shopping.

1768
01:58:25,150 --> 01:58:28,737
No, I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all fucking morning!

1769
01:58:32,157 --> 01:58:34,201
Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1770
01:58:34,284 --> 01:58:38,496
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1771
01:58:39,539 --> 01:58:41,541
Come on, let's go inside.

1772
01:58:45,337 --> 01:58:46,880
Yeah, it's gone.

1773
01:58:46,963 --> 01:58:50,800
I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.

1774
01:59:03,313 --> 01:59:05,607
They all right?
They're great.

1775
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:09,027
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1776
01:59:09,402 --> 01:59:11,071
Yeah. I need a hit.

1777
01:59:11,404 --> 01:59:14,574
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1778
01:59:14,658 --> 01:59:18,036
I've seen enough helicopters
for one day, thank you.

1779
01:59:18,495 --> 01:59:22,999
I had to get home and get the
package ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1780
01:59:23,083 --> 01:59:27,087
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1781
01:59:27,212 --> 01:59:29,631
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1782
01:59:29,714 --> 01:59:33,343
I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1783
01:59:33,426 --> 01:59:36,972
-It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.

1784
01:59:37,222 --> 01:59:39,641
When are you coming over?
In an hour.

1785
01:59:39,724 --> 01:59:43,478
You staying tonight, right?
I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1786
01:59:43,562 --> 01:59:47,274
Come on, stop. Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1787
01:59:54,823 --> 01:59:57,242
Hello?
It's me. You ready?

1788
01:59:57,868 --> 02:00:00,370
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1789
02:00:01,121 --> 02:00:04,374
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-I'm stirring it.

1790
02:00:04,457 --> 02:00:07,127
Listen, you know what to do?
Yeah, yeah.

1791
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,629
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois!
This is important.

1792
02:00:09,713 --> 02:00:12,465
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1793
02:00:12,549 --> 02:00:15,468
Understand me? Call from an outside line.
I mean it!

1794
02:00:15,552 --> 02:00:18,889
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.

1795
02:00:19,556 --> 02:00:21,892
You little hick, just make sure you do it!

1796
02:00:21,975 --> 02:00:23,184
You're a pain.

1797
02:00:23,268 --> 02:00:25,478
Hey! Just do it!
Okay.

1798
02:00:27,981 --> 02:00:32,277
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1799
02:00:33,778 --> 02:00:35,822
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.

1800
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,491
What does she do
after she hangs up?

1801
02:00:38,575 --> 02:00:42,412
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1802
02:00:42,662 --> 02:00:47,375
She calls from the house. If anyone
was listening they'd know everything.

1803
02:00:47,667 --> 02:00:52,505
They'd know a package was leaving my
house and they'd have the flight number.

1804
02:00:53,506 --> 02:00:56,426
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1805
02:00:56,593 --> 02:00:58,929
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1806
02:00:59,179 --> 02:01:01,348
I told my brother to watch on the stove.

1807
02:01:01,431 --> 02:01:05,435
All day long the poor guy's been
watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1808
02:01:06,019 --> 02:01:10,523
I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1809
02:01:21,826 --> 02:01:24,871
Do you think you can come over,
fuck me, then leave?

1810
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:29,793
-Got someplace better to go?
-Don't talk like that. Come on.

1811
02:01:30,126 --> 02:01:31,962
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1812
02:01:32,212 --> 02:01:33,505
You believe me?

1813
02:01:34,965 --> 02:01:36,716
Do you believe me?

1814
02:01:39,636 --> 02:01:41,471
-That's the last one?
-Yeah.

1815
02:01:50,647 --> 02:01:53,024
You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!

1816
02:02:00,073 --> 02:02:03,118
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1817
02:02:03,243 --> 02:02:06,162
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1818
02:02:06,663 --> 02:02:09,207
I have to.
You don't have to.

1819
02:02:13,753 --> 02:02:15,171
I got to go home.

1820
02:02:17,257 --> 02:02:19,175
What do you mean you got to go home?

1821
02:02:19,259 --> 02:02:23,013
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1822
02:02:23,638 --> 02:02:25,807
I got to go home and get my hat.

1823
02:02:26,349 --> 02:02:29,019
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?

1824
02:02:29,269 --> 02:02:32,355
I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1825
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:35,942
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.

1826
02:02:37,903 --> 02:02:40,530
Do you understand
what we are involved in?

1827
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:44,034
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1828
02:02:48,914 --> 02:02:52,959
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her damn hat?

1829
02:02:53,043 --> 02:02:55,712
I hid the package and
went to take her home.

1830
02:02:55,795 --> 02:02:56,755
A hat?

1831
02:03:05,805 --> 02:03:07,349
What the fuck is this?

1832
02:03:07,432 --> 02:03:10,352
Police! Freeze!
Don't move, motherfucker!

1833
02:03:10,435 --> 02:03:13,438
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!

1834
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:21,821
I thought I was dead, but when
I heard all the noise I knew they were cops.

1835
02:03:22,072 --> 02:03:23,740
Only cops talk that way.

1836
02:03:23,949 --> 02:03:25,367
Don't fucking move.

1837
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:29,204
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1838
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:31,248
I would have been dead.

1839
02:03:32,165 --> 02:03:34,167
Michael! Lock the door!

1840
02:03:57,941 --> 02:04:02,696
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.

1841
02:04:03,029 --> 02:04:06,783
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't give a fuck.

1842
02:04:06,866 --> 02:04:10,871
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1843
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:14,040
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1844
02:04:14,124 --> 02:04:17,961
...were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1845
02:04:18,044 --> 02:04:19,546
Just get the lawyer.

1846
02:04:19,629 --> 02:04:23,174
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1847
02:04:23,258 --> 02:04:25,760
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.

1848
02:04:25,844 --> 02:04:29,472
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a fucking problem all night.

1849
02:04:29,556 --> 02:04:33,476
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1850
02:04:33,852 --> 02:04:37,856
25 fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1851
02:04:39,232 --> 02:04:42,193
What, were you guys
grocery shopping?

1852
02:04:42,652 --> 02:04:46,364
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1853
02:04:46,656 --> 02:04:48,867
You got anything good in there?

1854
02:04:50,493 --> 02:04:51,912
Is it good?

1855
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,501
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1856
02:05:01,421 --> 02:05:03,089
See you in Attica, dick.

1857
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:07,010
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1858
02:05:07,427 --> 02:05:10,680
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1859
02:05:10,764 --> 02:05:12,432
Fuck Jimmy and his money!

1860
02:05:12,515 --> 02:05:16,102
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1861
02:05:16,436 --> 02:05:18,521
Then you're better off staying in here.

1862
02:05:18,605 --> 02:05:23,443
They could whack me in here as easy as
outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1863
02:05:23,693 --> 02:05:28,240
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1864
02:05:28,406 --> 02:05:32,702
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1865
02:05:32,786 --> 02:05:37,123
I remember I had this feeling I would be
killed right outside the jail.

1866
02:05:37,415 --> 02:05:40,835
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me
and he's such a hothead.

1867
02:05:40,919 --> 02:05:42,712
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1868
02:05:42,796 --> 02:05:47,300
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was in the drug deals with me...

1869
02:05:47,717 --> 02:05:51,054
...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1870
02:05:52,305 --> 02:05:54,182
This is the bad time.

1871
02:05:55,141 --> 02:05:57,769
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1872
02:05:59,062 --> 02:06:02,941
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1873
02:06:03,149 --> 02:06:07,654
...the cops never found, then disappear
until things got straightened out.

1874
02:06:09,489 --> 02:06:12,158
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?

1875
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:14,411
I flushed it down the toilet.

1876
02:06:15,662 --> 02:06:16,621
What?

1877
02:06:17,664 --> 02:06:19,791
What was I supposed to do?

1878
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:24,129
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1879
02:06:24,629 --> 02:06:26,756
They had a search warrant!

1880
02:06:27,465 --> 02:06:31,970
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1881
02:06:32,178 --> 02:06:34,848
I had to! They were going to find it!

1882
02:06:35,098 --> 02:06:38,852
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have! I swear!

1883
02:06:39,978 --> 02:06:41,980
They would've found it!

1884
02:06:43,773 --> 02:06:45,317
Why did you do that?

1885
02:06:45,775 --> 02:06:49,237
They would have found it.
Why did you do that?

1886
02:06:50,488 --> 02:06:51,907
Oh, my God!

1887
02:06:52,532 --> 02:06:55,619
I had to do it.
Oh, my God!

1888
02:07:31,529 --> 02:07:33,615
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1889
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:39,329
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1890
02:07:39,579 --> 02:07:41,081
Yeah, you fucked up.

1891
02:07:44,584 --> 02:07:46,503
But I'm all right now.

1892
02:07:48,171 --> 02:07:51,841
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1893
02:07:52,551 --> 02:07:55,095
You looked in my eyes
and lied to me.

1894
02:07:56,054 --> 02:08:00,100
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.

1895
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:03,353
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1896
02:08:04,437 --> 02:08:06,481
You know, I was ashamed.

1897
02:08:09,776 --> 02:08:11,444
I'm ashamed now.

1898
02:08:15,115 --> 02:08:17,409
But I got nowhere else to go.

1899
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:25,041
You're all I got. And I really,
really need your help. I really do.

1900
02:08:30,964 --> 02:08:32,090
Take this.

1901
02:08:47,147 --> 02:08:49,649
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1902
02:08:59,743 --> 02:09:01,828
Thirty-two hundred bucks.

1903
02:09:01,912 --> 02:09:05,040
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1904
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:09,044
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1905
02:09:09,127 --> 02:09:11,838
We got to get out.
I don't want to run.

1906
02:09:11,922 --> 02:09:15,717
Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1907
02:09:16,259 --> 02:09:18,303
I don't want to do that.

1908
02:09:18,762 --> 02:09:22,682
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

1909
02:09:24,434 --> 02:09:29,147
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1910
02:09:32,525 --> 02:09:34,110
How's he doing?

1911
02:09:34,653 --> 02:09:35,946
He's okay.

1912
02:09:36,529 --> 02:09:38,198
They sobered him up.

1913
02:09:38,448 --> 02:09:40,450
Good. Glad to hear it.

1914
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:46,957
What kind of questions they been asking?

1915
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,583
I don't know.

1916
02:09:49,668 --> 02:09:53,255
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.

1917
02:09:53,797 --> 02:09:56,591
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1918
02:09:56,675 --> 02:09:58,635
Tell him he's got to call me.

1919
02:09:59,386 --> 02:10:03,181
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1920
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:06,893
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1921
02:10:07,185 --> 02:10:10,230
-Take this. It's a couple thousand.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

1922
02:10:10,397 --> 02:10:12,732
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1923
02:10:12,816 --> 02:10:15,986
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1924
02:10:16,069 --> 02:10:17,988
Pick out a few for yourself.

1925
02:10:18,822 --> 02:10:20,991
For my mom.
Yeah, whatever.

1926
02:10:21,074 --> 02:10:23,493
Not here. In the store on the corner.

1927
02:10:23,743 --> 02:10:26,329
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1928
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:34,129
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1929
02:10:34,212 --> 02:10:35,755
-Thanks.
-Don't worry.

1930
02:10:36,006 --> 02:10:38,633
I'll try.
He's got to call me.

1931
02:10:41,219 --> 02:10:42,345
Over here?

1932
02:10:42,512 --> 02:10:44,222
Right down there.

1933
02:10:58,528 --> 02:11:00,780
It's over there, on the corner.

1934
02:11:00,864 --> 02:11:02,073
Right there.

1935
02:11:35,815 --> 02:11:38,276
No! Go ahead! It's right there!

1936
02:11:38,568 --> 02:11:40,737
No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

1937
02:11:40,987 --> 02:11:43,823
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1938
02:11:44,074 --> 02:11:45,825
I'll come back later!

1939
02:12:07,681 --> 02:12:09,224
Karen. Karen!

1940
02:12:14,104 --> 02:12:15,522
What happened?

1941
02:12:16,147 --> 02:12:17,857
Nothing.

1942
02:12:18,024 --> 02:12:20,777
What happened?
I just got scared.

1943
02:12:23,446 --> 02:12:24,948
Got the keys?

1944
02:12:26,283 --> 02:12:27,534
What happened?

1945
02:12:27,701 --> 02:12:30,120
I just got scared. It's okay.

1946
02:12:30,203 --> 02:12:32,289
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1947
02:12:38,628 --> 02:12:43,133
If you're part of a crew nobody
ever tells you they're going to kill you.

1948
02:12:43,633 --> 02:12:45,468
It doesn't happen that way.

1949
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:49,055
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1950
02:12:49,306 --> 02:12:53,143
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1951
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:55,729
People who cared for you all your life.

1952
02:12:55,812 --> 02:13:00,483
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1953
02:13:00,734 --> 02:13:03,820
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1954
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:07,824
I got there 15 minutes early
and Jimmy was already there.

1955
02:13:08,491 --> 02:13:13,079
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1956
02:13:13,413 --> 02:13:15,832
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1957
02:13:16,082 --> 02:13:19,002
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1958
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:23,006
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1959
02:13:23,256 --> 02:13:25,675
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1960
02:13:25,759 --> 02:13:30,597
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1961
02:13:32,182 --> 02:13:35,852
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1962
02:13:36,102 --> 02:13:37,687
Now you understand?

1963
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:44,069
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.

1964
02:13:47,113 --> 02:13:51,451
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1965
02:13:54,037 --> 02:13:58,667
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1966
02:14:00,627 --> 02:14:03,338
I know where he is. He's hiding out.

1967
02:14:04,464 --> 02:14:06,049
Know what I'm saying?

1968
02:14:10,887 --> 02:14:14,558
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1969
02:14:17,143 --> 02:14:18,728
No, not at all.

1970
02:14:20,063 --> 02:14:21,856
That way they got nothing.

1971
02:14:30,574 --> 02:14:33,743
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1972
02:14:33,827 --> 02:14:37,998
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1973
02:14:44,921 --> 02:14:49,009
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1974
02:15:02,105 --> 02:15:05,609
Wherever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1975
02:15:05,775 --> 02:15:08,111
...I don't want to go any place cold.

1976
02:15:08,945 --> 02:15:10,780
You don't have a choice.

1977
02:15:11,531 --> 02:15:14,409
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1978
02:15:14,868 --> 02:15:17,370
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1979
02:15:17,621 --> 02:15:19,706
He's bronchial, that's why.

1980
02:15:19,956 --> 02:15:22,459
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1981
02:15:22,626 --> 02:15:24,544
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1982
02:15:24,628 --> 02:15:28,089
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1983
02:15:29,591 --> 02:15:30,717
What about them?

1984
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,221
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1985
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:37,098
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1986
02:15:37,474 --> 02:15:38,475
No.

1987
02:15:39,643 --> 02:15:43,146
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1988
02:15:43,396 --> 02:15:47,567
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, I can't see them?

1989
02:15:47,651 --> 02:15:50,654
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.

1990
02:15:50,904 --> 02:15:53,573
If there's extraordinary circumstances...

1991
02:15:53,823 --> 02:15:56,743
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1992
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:59,496
I can't leave my parents.

1993
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:02,916
Karen, I told you before.

1994
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:07,379
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

1995
02:16:09,089 --> 02:16:11,174
I can't do it without you.

1996
02:16:11,424 --> 02:16:14,052
So you do whatever, but...that's it.

1997
02:16:16,429 --> 02:16:19,683
You need Henry, not me, right?
That's right.

1998
02:16:19,766 --> 02:16:21,935
I don't care whether you go or not.

1999
02:16:22,519 --> 02:16:25,939
If it'll make him a better witness,
I want you with him.

2000
02:16:26,189 --> 02:16:27,774
They don't want me.

2001
02:16:27,857 --> 02:16:31,778
Henry'll be in the protection
program. They can't get to him.

2002
02:16:31,861 --> 02:16:35,198
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2003
02:16:35,365 --> 02:16:37,742
If he goes into the program
you're in danger.

2004
02:16:37,826 --> 02:16:40,537
I don't know anything.
Don't give me...

2005
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:42,205
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2006
02:16:42,289 --> 02:16:46,626
I've listened to those wiretaps
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2007
02:16:46,877 --> 02:16:50,964
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2008
02:16:55,385 --> 02:16:58,138
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2009
02:16:58,305 --> 02:17:01,057
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.

2010
02:17:01,641 --> 02:17:03,560
He knows it and you know it.

2011
02:17:04,895 --> 02:17:07,272
What about the kids and school?

2012
02:17:07,731 --> 02:17:09,649
I mean, what goes on?

2013
02:17:09,858 --> 02:17:12,152
Go to Wall Street
and get real crooks.

2014
02:17:12,235 --> 02:17:14,654
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2015
02:17:14,738 --> 02:17:18,158
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2016
02:17:18,575 --> 02:17:22,412
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2017
02:17:25,665 --> 02:17:28,752
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2018
02:17:28,835 --> 02:17:31,254
It was easy for us to disappear.

2019
02:17:31,504 --> 02:17:35,842
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.

2020
02:17:36,009 --> 02:17:39,429
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2021
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:41,932
I never voted or paid taxes.

2022
02:17:42,432 --> 02:17:46,436
My birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed I was alive.

2023
02:17:46,519 --> 02:17:48,980
Do you see him here
in this courtroom?

2024
02:17:49,064 --> 02:17:49,940
Yes.

2025
02:17:50,023 --> 02:17:53,026
Will you please point him
out for the jury?

2026
02:17:55,028 --> 02:17:59,616
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2027
02:18:01,284 --> 02:18:03,787
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2028
02:18:03,870 --> 02:18:06,540
Is he in the courtroom?
Yes.

2029
02:18:06,623 --> 02:18:09,209
Can you point him out
for the jury?

2030
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:14,214
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

2031
02:18:16,049 --> 02:18:17,884
I have a document...

2032
02:18:17,968 --> 02:18:20,762
The hardest thing was
leaving the life.

2033
02:18:21,304 --> 02:18:23,014
I still loved the life.

2034
02:18:23,139 --> 02:18:27,102
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle. We had it all.

2035
02:18:27,644 --> 02:18:30,814
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2036
02:18:31,231 --> 02:18:34,651
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2037
02:18:34,734 --> 02:18:36,903
I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.

2038
02:18:36,987 --> 02:18:40,699
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

2039
02:18:40,782 --> 02:18:42,909
Objection!
-Objection sustained.

2040
02:18:42,993 --> 02:18:47,330
I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!

2041
02:18:48,665 --> 02:18:51,084
Anything I wanted was
a phone call away.

2042
02:18:51,167 --> 02:18:54,588
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts
all over the city.

2043
02:18:54,838 --> 02:18:57,382
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

2044
02:18:57,591 --> 02:19:01,678
...then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

2045
02:19:01,928 --> 02:19:03,346
Didn't matter.

2046
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:08,018
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go rob some more.

2047
02:19:08,852 --> 02:19:10,604
We ran everything.

2048
02:19:10,937 --> 02:19:14,774
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2049
02:19:15,358 --> 02:19:19,321
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2050
02:19:20,864 --> 02:19:22,574
And now it's all over.

2051
02:19:23,199 --> 02:19:25,243
That's the hardest part.

2052
02:19:26,036 --> 02:19:27,871
Today everything is different.

2053
02:19:27,954 --> 02:19:31,875
There's no action. I have to wait around
like everyone else.

2054
02:19:32,375 --> 02:19:34,461
Can't even get decent food.

2055
02:19:34,711 --> 02:19:38,089
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2056
02:19:38,215 --> 02:19:40,550
...and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2057
02:19:40,634 --> 02:19:42,552
I'm an average nobody.

2058
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:46,473
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.

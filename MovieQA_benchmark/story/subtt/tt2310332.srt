1
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,510
I warned you!

2
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:17,569
Did I not warn you what would
come of dealing with Dwarves?

3
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,950
Now they've done it!

4
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,694
They've woken the dragon, they've
brought the apocalypse upon our heads.

5
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,245
Come on, quickly, quickly.

6
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:27,635
Faster now, I'm trying
to evacuate myself here.

7
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,006
Careful with that.

8
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,408
Never mind the books! Get
on, get the rest of it.

9
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:33,646
But Sire, should we not
try to save the town?

10
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,390
The town is lost, save the gold!

11
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,151
Pile 'em up!

12
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:58,947
We have no time, we must leave.
- Get him up.

13
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,628
Come on, brother.
- Come on, come on, let's go.

14
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,650
I'm fine, I can walk.
- As fast as you can.

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,668
We're not leaving, not
without our father.

16
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:10,633
If you stay here, your sisters will die.
Is that what your father would want?

17
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,795
Open this door. Do you hear me!

18
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:29,549
Down here, now!

19
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,490
Give me your hand.
- Come on, we gotta go!

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,401
Quickly now, hurry!

21
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,093
Kíli, come on!

22
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,759
Come on! Come On!

23
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,301
Faster! Faster!

24
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,662
If only we could take...

25
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,524
more of these poor people with us.
But they're hardly...

26
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,876
worth it. I quite agree.

27
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,139
Look out!

28
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,091
Move it.

29
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,203
Move it!

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,632
Come on! Faster!

31
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,663
My gold! My gold!

32
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,663
We carry too much weight.

33
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,335
We need to dump something.

34
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:03,194
You gotta go, Alfrid.

35
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,997
Faster! Faster!

36
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,237
Poor souls.

37
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,600
Da!

38
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,829
Da!

39
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,033
He hit it!

40
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,062
- He hit the dragon!
- No.

41
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,884
He did, he hit it's mark, I saw.

42
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,125
These arrows can not
pierce it's hide.

43
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:09,334
Actually, nothing will.

44
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,101
What are you doing?

45
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,353
- Come back! Bain!
- Come back!

46
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,721
Bain!

47
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,233
- Come back here!
- Bain!

48
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:28,374
Leave him!

49
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:30,175
We cannot go back.

50
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,276
Bain!

51
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,115
Dad!

52
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,334
Bain! What are you doing?
Why didn't you...

53
00:07:58,365 --> 00:07:59,505
leave, you were
supposed to leave.

54
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,586
I came to help you.

55
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:04,547
No, nothing can stop it now.
- This might.

56
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,591
Bain, you go back.

57
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,000
You get out of here now.

58
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:16,273
Da!

59
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,035
Bain!

60
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,346
Da!

61
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:36,769
Stop, stop! Halt,

62
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,951
halt!

63
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:49,186
Who are you that would stand...

64
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,504
against me?

65
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:59,378
Now that is a pity.

66
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:04,111
What will you do now... bowman?

67
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,591
You are forsaken.

68
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,374
No help will come.

69
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,013
Now's our chance!

70
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:14,903
Go now!

71
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:17,546
Hit to the open water!

72
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:23,376
Hmm... ahh! Is that your child?

73
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:30,830
You cannot save him from the fire.
He will...

74
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,351
burn!

75
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,388
Stay still, son.

76
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,389
Stay still.

77
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,802
Tell me,

78
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:03,682
wretch, how now shall
you challenge me?

79
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:13,697
You have nothing
left but your...

80
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:16,100
death!

81
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:20,679
Bain. Look at me.

82
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,201
You look at me.

83
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,183
A little to your left.

84
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:32,713
That's it.

85
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,341
Bain! Hold on!

86
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:34,956
Wh-what was that? What happened?

87
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,158
It fell, I saw it.

88
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,081
It's dead.

89
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:46,793
Smaug is dead.

90
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:51,014
By my beard, I think he's right!

91
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,105
Look there!

92
00:11:53,134 --> 00:12:00,158
The Ravens of Erebor are
returning to the Mountain.

93
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:03,000
Aye, word will spread.
Before long...

94
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:09,402
every soul in Middle Earth
will know the Dragon is dead.

95
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:24,567
_

96
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,278
<i>You are not alone, Mithrandir.</i>

97
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,554
<i>Will somebody help me!
Hey, let me go.</i>

98
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,546
Help!

99
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,818
- Da!
- Da!

100
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:24,850
Da!

101
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,693
Ahh! Why me?

102
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,149
Tauriel.

103
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:46,009
Kíli...

104
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,557
come on.

105
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:49,259
We're leaving.

106
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,640
They are your
people, you must...

107
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,873
go.

108
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,532
Come with me.

109
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,974
I know how I feel,
I'm not afraid.

110
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,644
You make me feel alive.

111
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:01,475
No, I can't.

112
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,374
Tauriel,

113
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,196
amrâlimê.

114
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,226
I don't know what that means.

115
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,230
I think you do.

116
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:23,884
_

117
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:29,335
_

118
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,817
_

119
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:03,188
Keep it... as a promise.

120
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:34,051
These are dry. You'll need them.
- Thank you.

121
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,173
Oi, give me one of them!

122
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:37,600
I'll catch my...

123
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,243
death in this cold.
- Find your own!

124
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:43,534
You're not in charge now, Alfrid
Lickspittle. - That is where you are wrong.

125
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,594
In the absence of the Master...

126
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:46,794
the powers seeds to his...

127
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:49,076
deputy, which in this
instance is my good self.

128
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:50,988
Now give me that blanket!

129
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,086
Master's Deputy?

130
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:57,299
Don't make me laugh.
You're a sneak thief,

131
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,900
more like. I'll be dead...

132
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,339
before I answer to
the likes of you.

133
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,371
Maybe that can be arranged.

134
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,884
I wouldn't go turning on
your own, Alfrid. Not now.

135
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:20,879
Da! - Come here. - You're alive!

136
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,509
It's all right.

137
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,770
<i>It was Bard. He killed the...</i>

138
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,182
dragon. I saw it
with me own eyes.

139
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:32,751
He brought the beast down.
Struck him...

140
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,024
dead with a Black Arrow.

141
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:44,567
You've saved us all, bless you.

142
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,450
All hail to the Dragon-slayer!

143
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,250
All hail...

144
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,092
King Bard!

145
00:16:56,071 --> 00:17:01,355
I have said it many times,
this is a man of noble stock.

146
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:04,193
A born leader.
- Do not call me that.

147
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,375
I'm not the Master...

148
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:09,478
of this town. Where is he?

149
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:12,267
Where's the master?
- Half way down the Anduin,

150
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,749
with all our coin,
I don't doubt.

151
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,089
You would know.

152
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,409
You helped him empty...

153
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,851
- the treasury.
- No,

154
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:21,932
I tried to stop him.

155
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,093
<i>Liar! Thief!</i>

156
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:27,053
<i>You're a mongrel.
- I begged, I pleaded,</i>

157
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:31,836
I said: "Master...

158
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:32,896
No!"

159
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,708
Think of the children.

160
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,958
Will nobody think
of the children?

161
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,259
<i>Aargh. Hang him!</i>

162
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,491
To the tree with him!

163
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,516
Let him down!

164
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,164
Let him go!

165
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,738
Look around you!

166
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,640
Have you not...

167
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,627
had your fill of death?

168
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,122
Winter is upon us.

169
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:17,313
We must look to our own, to
the sick and the helpless.

170
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,865
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded,

171
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,653
and those who have
strength left, follow me.

172
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,635
We must salvage what we can.
- And what then?

173
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,676
What do we do then?

174
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,028
We find shelter.

175
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,777
Hello!

176
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:21,969
Bombur?

177
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,357
Bifur?

178
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:26,970
Anybody?

179
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,232
<i>Wait!</i>

180
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:37,134
<i>Wait!</i>

181
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:38,435
It's Bilbo. He's alive!

182
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,273
Stop! Stop!

183
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,625
<i>Stop!</i>

184
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,778
You need to leave. We
all need to leave.

185
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,538
We only just got here.

186
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,627
I tried talking to him,
but he won't listen.

187
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,578
Who do you mean, laddie?
- Thorin!

188
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,611
Thorin. Thorin, he's been
down there for days.

189
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,609
He doesn't sleep,
he barely eats.

190
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,952
He's not been himself, not at all.
It's this...

191
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,924
it's this place. I think
a sickness lies upon it.

192
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,272
A sickness?

193
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,404
What kind of sickness?

194
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,156
Fíli?

195
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:10,194
Fíli!

196
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,446
Fíli!

197
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,469
Gold.

198
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,372
Gold beyond measure...

199
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,492
beyond sorrow...

200
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:55,115
and grieve.

201
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,159
Behold... the great...

202
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,328
treasure hoard of Thrór.

203
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:16,811
Welcome...

204
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,594
my sisters sons...

205
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,846
to the Kingdom...

206
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,887
of Erebor.

207
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,528
Balin!

208
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,891
Bofur!

209
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,568
Kíli! Bifur!

210
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:45,102
- Bombur!
- You're alive!

211
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,815
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing here.

212
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,076
- Nothing here.
- Keep searching!

213
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,755
That jewel could be any...

214
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,287
where.
- The Arkenstone is in these halls.

215
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,759
Find it!
- You heard him, keep looking.

216
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,926
All of you!

217
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,409
No-one rests until it is...

218
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,599
found!

219
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:37,453
<i>I am almost tempted
to let you take it,</i>

220
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,123
<i>if only...</i>

221
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,153
<i>to see Oakenshield...</i>

222
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,625
<i>suffer.</i>

223
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:44,817
<i>Watch it...</i>

224
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,545
destroy him.

225
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,406
<i>Watch it corrupt...</i>

226
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,667
<i>his heart...</i>

227
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:53,269
and drive him mad.

228
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,813
Take only what you need,

229
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:34,854
we have a long march ahead.
- Where will you go?

230
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:39,347
There is only one place.

231
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:41,306
The Mountain?

232
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:44,018
You are a genius, Sire.

233
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,990
We can take refuge
inside the Mountain.

234
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,539
It might smell a bit of dragon.
The women could clean it up.

235
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,834
It will be safe and warm and
dry, and full of stores,

236
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:57,323
bedding and clothing,

237
00:23:57,363 --> 00:23:59,243
your bit of gold.

238
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:02,926
What gold is in that
Mountain, is cursed.

239
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,306
We will take only what
was promised to us,

240
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:07,007
only what we need to rebuild...

241
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:09,358
our lives.

242
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:11,830
Here, pull your weight.

243
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:16,330
News of the death of Smaug will
have spread through the lands.

244
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,791
Aye.

245
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:24,114
Others will now look
to the Mountain...

246
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:25,744
for it's wealth...

247
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:29,035
or it's position.
- What is it you know?

248
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:35,380
Nothing for certain. It's
what I fear may come.

249
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,153
_

250
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,765
_

251
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,326
_

252
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:05,240
_

253
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,249
_

254
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,010
_

255
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,102
_

256
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:15,211
_

257
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,656
_

258
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,217
_

259
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,138
_

260
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,730
_

261
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,221
_

262
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:37,804
_

263
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,472
_

264
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,564
You saw something out there?

265
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,817
The Orc I pursued out of
Lake-town, I know who he is.

266
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:53,269
Bolg, the spawn of
Azog the Defiler.

267
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,499
A Wargpack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgorath.

268
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,309
They fled into the north.

269
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,001
These Orcs were different
from the others,

270
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:02,891
they bore a mark I had not
seen for a long time.

271
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:04,711
The mark of Gundabad.

272
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,042
Gundabad?

273
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:09,472
An Orc stronghold in the far
north of the Misty Mountains.

274
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,723
_

275
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,066
_

276
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:15,968
_

277
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:17,556
_

278
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,096
_

279
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,588
_

280
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,421
_

281
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:27,401
You may tell my father...

282
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:31,874
if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.

283
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,252
Legolas,

284
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,414
it is your King's command.

285
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,365
_

286
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,894
_

287
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,978
I ride north. Will
you come with me?

288
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:47,230
- To where?
- To Gundabad.

289
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:41,009
_

290
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,630
_

291
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,582
_

292
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:36,501
_

293
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:42,544
_

294
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:48,305
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die.

295
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:14,435
_

296
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,715
_

297
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:19,517
_

298
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:22,318
_

299
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:26,088
I am not alone.

300
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:40,523
Are you in need of
assistance, My Lady?

301
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,898
You should have stayed...

302
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:48,467
dead!

303
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,108
Mithrandir...

304
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:20,750
come back.

305
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,896
H- He is here.

306
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:42,760
He is. The darkness
has returned.

307
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:52,201
Gandalf!

308
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:54,953
Gandalf,

309
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,105
climb on!

310
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,237
He is weak.

311
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:02,186
He cannot remain here, it
is straining his life.

312
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:03,438
Go,

313
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:04,469
quickly!

314
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,749
Come with me, My...

315
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:11,040
Lady.

316
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:19,233
Go!

317
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:00,441
_

318
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,279
_

319
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:07,133
_

320
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,634
_

321
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:16,326
_

322
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:27,098
You have no...

323
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,590
power here,

324
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:32,630
servant of Mordor.

325
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,142
You...

326
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:38,674
are nameless,

327
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:42,855
faceless,

328
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,177
formless!

329
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:52,829
Go back to the void...

330
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:58,480
from whence you came!

331
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,699
_

332
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,089
The spirit of Sauron endured...

333
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,092
and has been banished.

334
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:26,584
He will flee into the East.

335
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:30,693
Gondor should be warned.

336
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:33,435
They must set a watch
on the walls of Mordor.

337
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:37,096
No. Look after the
Lady Galadriel.

338
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:41,278
She has spent much of her powers,
her strength is failing.

339
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:42,807
Take her to Lothlórien.

340
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,458
My Lord Saruman,

341
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:46,380
he must be hunted down...

342
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,662
and destroyed, once and for all.

343
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,020
Without the Ring of Power,

344
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,583
Sauron can never again hold
dominion over Middle Earth.

345
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,016
Go now.

346
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,465
Leave Sauron to me.

347
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,702
- I need a horse.
- What?

348
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,840
Gandalf,

349
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,981
where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.

350
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,583
They have no idea what is coming.
I saw them...

351
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:21,751
with my own eyes.

352
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,114
Rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.

353
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,206
You must summon our
friends, bird and beast.

354
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:30,485
The battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.

355
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,699
It is here in these halls,

356
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:38,039
I know it.
- We have searched and searched.

357
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:40,210
- Not well enough.
- Thorin,

358
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:45,340
we all would see the stone returned.
- And yet it's still not found!

359
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:52,286
Do you doubt the loyalty
of anyone here?

360
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,951
The Arkenstone is the
birthright of our people.

361
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,030
It is the King's jewel.

362
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,773
Am I not the King?!

363
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,637
Know this,

364
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:31,161
if anyone should find it...

365
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,831
and withhold it from me...

366
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:37,083
I will be avenged.

367
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,170
Dragon sickness...

368
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,349
I've seen it before.

369
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,831
That look,

370
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:04,092
the terrible need.

371
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:07,293
It is a fierce and
jealous love, Bilbo.

372
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:12,045
It sent his grandfather mad.

373
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,648
Balin, if-if Thorin...

374
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:18,887
had the Arkenstone.

375
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:21,708
Well, if-if it was found...

376
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,860
would it help?

377
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,333
That stone...

378
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:33,255
crowns all.

379
00:36:33,295 --> 00:36:36,293
It's the summit of
this great wealth,

380
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,494
bestowing power...

381
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,686
upon he who bears it.

382
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:43,456
But stay his madness?

383
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:45,248
No, lad...

384
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,690
I fear it would make him worse.

385
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:54,222
Perhaps it is best...

386
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:57,835
it remains lost.

387
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:11,119
What is that?

388
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,148
In your hand.

389
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,940
- It-it's nothing.
- Show me.

390
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:20,213
It

391
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:30,144
I picked it up in
Beorn's garden.

392
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,248
You've carried it all this way?

393
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:39,659
I'm going to plant it in my garden.
In Bag-End.

394
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:45,760
That's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.

395
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,873
One day it will grow...

396
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:53,454
and every time I look
at it, I'll remember...

397
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:57,246
remember everything that
happened, the good, the bad...

398
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,487
and how lucky I am
that I made it home.

399
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,762
Thorin, I... Thorin,

400
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:17,682
the survivors from Lake-town,
they're streaming into Dale.

401
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:19,695
There's hundreds of them.

402
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:23,297
Call everyone to the gate.

403
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,967
To the gate. Now!

404
00:38:57,978 --> 00:38:59,260
Come on,

405
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,621
- keep moving.
- Sire!

406
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:03,751
Sire!

407
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,311
Up here!

408
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:16,527
Look Sire! The braziers are lit.

409
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,556
So,

410
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:22,018
the company of Thorin
Oakenshield survived.

411
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,250
Survived?

412
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,838
You mean there's a bunch of Dwarves
in there with all that gold?

413
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,101
You shouldn't worry, Alfrid.

414
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,963
There's gold enough in
that Mountain for all.

415
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:34,231
Make camp here tonight.

416
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,224
Find what shelter you can.

417
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:38,085
Get some fires going.

418
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,487
Come on, hurry along now.
- Alfrid,

419
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:41,768
you take the night...

420
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,596
watch.

421
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,501
Push!

422
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,775
I want this Fortress
made safe by sun-up.

423
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,164
This Mountain was hard-won,

424
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,295
I will not see it taken again.

425
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,688
The people of Lake-town
have nothing.

426
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:12,318
They came to us...

427
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:15,088
in need. They have
lost everything.

428
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:22,090
Do not tell me what they have lost.
I know well enough their hardship.

429
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:25,342
Those who've lived
through dragon fire...

430
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:28,842
should rejoice! They have...

431
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:31,204
much to be grateful for.

432
00:40:35,858 --> 00:40:37,025
More stone!

433
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:42,010
Bring more stone to the gate!

434
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:06,539
<i>These children are starving.
We need food.</i>

435
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,708
<i>We won't last three days.</i>

436
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,760
Bard, we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

437
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:17,262
<i>It will be all right, don't worry.
- We need more water.</i>

438
00:41:17,302 --> 00:41:19,813
The children and the wounded
and the women come first.

439
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:22,967
Morning, Alfrid,

440
00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:25,536
what news from the night watch?

441
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:28,597
All quiet, Sire. Not
much to report.

442
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,639
Nothing gets past me.

443
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,780
Except an army of
Elves, it would seem.

444
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:16,297
My Lord Thranduil, we did not...

445
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:19,405
look to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

446
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:48,509
You have saved us.

447
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,757
I do not know how to thank...

448
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:52,829
you. - Your gratitude
is misplaced.

449
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,592
I did not come on your behalf.

450
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:59,322
I came to reclaim
something of mine.

451
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:10,086
There are gems in the
Mountain that I too desire.

452
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:12,996
White gems of pure starlight.

453
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,469
The White gems of Lasgalen.

454
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:21,298
I know an Elf-lord who will
pay a pretty price for these.

455
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:28,014
Wait!

456
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,032
Please, wait!

457
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:34,786
You will go to war over
a handful of gems?

458
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:38,617
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

459
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,378
We are allies in this.

460
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:42,659
My people...

461
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:45,559
also have claim upon the
riches in that Mountain.

462
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,831
Let me speak with Thorin.

463
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:51,364
You would try to
reason with the Dwarf.

464
00:43:51,384 --> 00:43:53,862
To avoid war?

465
00:43:53,891 --> 00:43:54,813
Yes.

466
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:57,594
Nice going lads, nice work.

467
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:00,815
Come on!

468
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:26,394
Hail Thorin, son of Thráin.

469
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,967
We are glad to find you
alive beyond hope.

470
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:33,398
Why do you come to gates of the King
under the Mountain armed for war?

471
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:36,519
Why does the King under the
Mountain fence himself in...

472
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,539
like a robber in his hole?

473
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,362
Perhaps it is because I'm
expecting to be robbed.

474
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:45,423
My Lord,

475
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:50,784
we have not come to rob you,
but to seek fair settlement.

476
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:53,117
Will you not speak with me?

477
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:29,699
I'm listening.

478
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,920
On behalf of Te people of Lake-town,
I ask that you honour your pledge.

479
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,862
A share of the treasure,

480
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:39,094
so that they might
rebuild their lives.

481
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:45,286
I will not treat with any man, while
an armed host lies before my door.

482
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:49,226
That armed host will attack this
mountain if we do not come to terms.

483
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:53,298
And your threats do not sway me.

484
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,601
What of your conscience?

485
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,971
Does it not tell you
our cause is just?

486
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:03,873
My people offered you help...

487
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:09,485
and in return you brought upon
them only ruin and death.

488
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,974
When did the men of Lake-town come to our
aid but for the promise of rich reward.

489
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,516
A bargain was struck.

490
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:16,088
A bargain?

491
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:19,079
What choice did we have but to barter
our birthright for blankets...

492
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,139
and food. To ransom our...

493
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:26,663
future in exchange for our freedom.
You call that a fair trade?

494
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,974
Tell me, Bard the dragon-slayer,

495
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:36,284
why should I honour such terms?

496
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,367
Because you gave us your...

497
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:41,898
word.

498
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,798
Does that mean nothing?

499
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:04,306
Begone, ere our arrows...

500
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:05,568
fly!

501
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:25,423
What are you doing?

502
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:29,217
You cannot go to war.

503
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,626
This does not concern you.
- Excuse me,

504
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:36,409
but just in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

505
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:40,048
Not to mention several
hundred angry fishermen.

506
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,771
W-w-we are in fact outnumbered.

507
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:45,623
Not for much longer.

508
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:48,443
What does that mean?

509
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:50,813
It means, Master Baggins,

510
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,425
you should never
underestimate Dwarves.

511
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:00,929
We have reclaimed Erebor.

512
00:48:02,237 --> 00:48:05,739
Now we defend it.

513
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,969
He will give us nothing.

514
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:28,447
Such a pity. But still...

515
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:31,239
you tried.
- I do not understand.

516
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:33,539
Why?

517
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,811
Why would he risk war?

518
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:52,728
It is fruitless to reason with them.
They understand...

519
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:55,639
only one thing.

520
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,500
We attack at dawn.

521
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:06,101
Are you with us?

522
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,695
Master Baggins, come here.

523
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:03,014
You're going to need this.

524
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:05,476
Put it on.

525
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:12,778
This vest is made
of silver steel.

526
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,090
Mithril it was called
by my forebears.

527
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:24,603
No blade can pierce it.

528
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:38,938
I look absurd. I'm not a
warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

529
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:41,018
It is a gift,

530
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:43,650
a token of our friendship.

531
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,413
True friends are
hard to come by.

532
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:55,253
I have been blind, but now
I'm beginning to see.

533
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:57,706
I am betrayed.

534
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:00,657
Betrayed?

535
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:03,277
The Arkenstone...

536
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:13,751
one of them has taken it.

537
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:24,648
One of them is false.

538
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:27,106
Thorin,

539
00:51:27,157 --> 00:51:30,068
the quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.

540
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:31,929
Is that not enough?

541
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,278
Betrayed by my own kin.
- No, eh...

542
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,992
you - you made a promise to
the people of Lake-town.

543
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,074
Is this...

544
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,913
treasure truly worth
more than your honour?

545
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:45,554
Our honour, Thorin. I was
also there, I gave...

546
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:48,376
my word.
- For that, I'm grateful.

547
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:50,135
That was nobly done.
But the treasure...

548
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:52,056
in this Mountain does
not belong to the...

549
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:53,557
people of Lake-town.

550
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:54,699
This gold...

551
00:51:58,938 --> 00:52:01,260
is ours...

552
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,201
and ours alone.

553
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:10,244
With my life...

554
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:14,505
I will not part...

555
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,827
with a single coin.

556
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:21,286
Not...

557
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:27,021
one piece of it.

558
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:48,599
Gundabad.

559
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:55,811
What lies beyond?
- An old enemy.

560
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:56,782
The ancient Kingdom...

561
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,313
of Angmar.

562
00:53:01,572 --> 00:53:04,135
This fortress was
once it's stronghold.

563
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:06,317
It is where they kept
their great armouries,

564
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:09,405
forged their weapons of war.

565
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:12,088
A light. I saw movement.

566
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:17,188
We wait for the cover of night.

567
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,702
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

568
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:23,231
In another age our
people waged war on...

569
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,543
those lands.

570
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:36,438
My mother died there.

571
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:41,498
My father does not speak of it.

572
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:43,559
There is no grave,

573
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:46,889
no memory,

574
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:50,632
nothing.

575
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:01,237
Let me through!

576
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:02,865
Make way!

577
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:19,103
No, no,

578
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:21,664
no! Oi, you!

579
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:23,295
Pointy hat!

580
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:25,534
Yes...

581
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:26,644
you.

582
00:54:26,704 --> 00:54:28,797
We don't want no
tramps, beggars...

583
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:30,327
nor vagabonds around...

584
00:54:30,378 --> 00:54:32,677
here. We've got enough trouble
without the likes of you.

585
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,849
Off you go.

586
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:36,699
On your horse.

587
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,652
Who's in charge here?

588
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:39,932
Who is asking?

589
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:47,726
You must set aside your petty
grievances with the dwarves.

590
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:48,693
War is coming.

591
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:53,266
The cesspits of Dol
Guldur have been emptied.

592
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,097
You're all in mortal danger.

593
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,606
What are you talking about?

594
00:54:57,646 --> 00:55:00,478
I can see you know
nothing of wizards.

595
00:55:00,518 --> 00:55:05,099
They are like winter thunder on a wild
wind, rolling in from a distance...

596
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:08,172
breaking hard and alarmed.

597
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,534
But sometimes a storm...

598
00:55:10,554 --> 00:55:12,402
is just a storm.

599
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:14,143
Not this time.

600
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:16,856
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

601
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,427
These are fighters, they
have been bred for war.

602
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,306
Our enemy has summoned
his full strength.

603
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:24,119
Why show his hand now?
- Because...

604
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,869
we forced him.

605
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,009
We forced him when the company of Thorin
Oakenshield set out to reclaim...

606
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:30,641
their homeland.

607
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:33,253
The Dwarves were never
meant to reach Erebor,

608
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:36,271
Azog the Defiler was
sent to kill them.

609
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:40,605
His master seeks control
of the Mountain,

610
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:42,487
not just for the
treasure within,

611
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:46,737
but for where it lies,
it's strategic position.

612
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:47,947
This is the gateway to...

613
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:51,347
reclaiming the lands of
Angmar in the North.

614
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,750
If that fell Kingdom
should rise again...

615
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:58,989
Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire...

616
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,822
even Gondor itself will...

617
00:56:00,851 --> 00:56:01,853
fall.

618
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:05,786
These Orc armies you
speak of, Mithrandir,

619
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:07,393
where are they?

620
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:14,255
_

621
00:56:15,387 --> 00:56:17,829
_

622
00:56:18,028 --> 00:56:19,780
_

623
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:24,360
_

624
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,802
_

625
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:44,820
_

626
00:56:56,382 --> 00:56:58,295
_

627
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:03,016
These bats are bred
for one purpose.

628
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,706
For what?

629
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:07,998
For war.

630
00:57:49,182 --> 00:57:51,295
_

631
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,927
_

632
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:12,152
Since when has my council
counted for so little?

633
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,032
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

634
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:16,864
I think you're trying to
save your Dwarvish friends.

635
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:19,384
And I admire your
loyalty to them.

636
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:22,887
But it does not dissuade
me from my course.

637
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:26,278
You started this, Mithrandir.

638
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,418
You will forgive
me if I finish it!

639
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:31,661
Are the archers in position?

640
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:34,483
Yes, My Lord.
- Give the order...

641
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:38,262
if anything moves on
that mountain, kill it!

642
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,634
The Dwarves are out of time.

643
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:11,346
You, bowman!

644
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:13,807
Did you agree with this?

645
00:59:13,827 --> 00:59:16,336
Is gold so important to you?

646
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:20,090
Would you buy it with
the blood of Dwarves?

647
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,391
It will not come to that.

648
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,380
This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.

649
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:27,552
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

650
00:59:27,612 --> 00:59:29,670
They will fight to the
death to defend their own.

651
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:31,302
Bilbo Baggins!

652
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:35,815
If I'm not mistaken, this is
the Halfling who stole...

653
00:59:35,856 --> 00:59:39,766
the keys to my dungeons from
under the nose of my guards.

654
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:43,268
He is.

655
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:45,818
Sorry about that.

656
00:59:47,498 --> 00:59:51,791
I came to give you this.

657
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,724
The Heart of the Mountain.

658
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:02,775
The King's jewel.

659
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:05,427
And worth a king's ransom.

660
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:09,456
How is this yours to give?

661
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:11,748
I took it as my 14th
share of the treasure.

662
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,471
Why would you do this?

663
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:15,942
You owe us no loyalty.

664
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:17,929
I'm not doing it for you.

665
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,434
I know that Dwarves
can be obstinate...

666
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:23,804
and pigheaded and...

667
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,693
difficult.

668
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:27,655
And suspicious and secretive...

669
01:00:27,715 --> 01:00:29,496
with the worst manners
you can possibly...

670
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,737
imagine, but they
are also brave...

671
01:00:31,788 --> 01:00:34,876
and kind...

672
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,197
and loyal to a fault.

673
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:41,139
I've grown very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

674
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,980
But Thorin...

675
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,541
values this stone
above all else.

676
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:48,121
In exchange for it's return,
I believe he will...

677
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,702
give you what you were owed.
There will be no need...

678
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:52,655
for war.

679
01:00:58,396 --> 01:00:59,347
Rest up tonight.

680
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:01,289
You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

681
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:03,079
Get as far away from
here as possible.

682
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,818
- I-I'm not leaving.
- Oh?

683
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,750
You picked me as the 14th man. I'm
not about to leave the company now.

684
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,981
There is no company,
not any more.

685
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:11,519
And I don't like to think
what Thorin would do...

686
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:14,302
when he finds out what you've done.
- I'm not afraid of Thorin.

687
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:15,813
Well, you should be.

688
01:01:15,864 --> 01:01:17,394
Don't underestimate...

689
01:01:17,445 --> 01:01:19,903
the evil of gold.

690
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:20,815
Gold...

691
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:23,146
over which a serpent
had long brooded.

692
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:25,858
Dragon-sickness seeps into
the hearts of all who get...

693
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,757
near this Mountain.

694
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:30,498
Almost all.

695
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:34,688
You there!

696
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:35,949
Find this Hobbit a bed...

697
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,891
and fill his belly
with hot food.

698
01:01:40,112 --> 01:01:41,985
He has earned it.

699
01:01:44,304 --> 01:01:47,085
Hey, keep an eye on him.

700
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:50,956
If he should try to
leave, you tell me.

701
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:56,269
Move it, stupid Hobbit.

702
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,182
Wakey, Wakey. Hobbit, up you...
get?

703
01:02:55,391 --> 01:02:57,463
I will put the next one
between your eyes.

704
01:03:22,103 --> 01:03:23,860
We've come to tell you...

705
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,134
payment of your debt
has been offered...

706
01:03:27,193 --> 01:03:29,514
and accepted.

707
01:03:30,385 --> 01:03:32,485
What payment?

708
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:33,775
I gave you nothing.

709
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:36,458
You have nothing.

710
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,041
We have this.

711
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:49,972
They have the Arkenstone.

712
01:03:51,563 --> 01:03:52,724
Thieves.

713
01:03:52,744 --> 01:03:56,684
How came you by the
heirloom of our house?

714
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,215
That stone belongs to...

715
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:59,936
the king.

716
01:03:59,996 --> 01:04:01,077
And the King may have it...

717
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:04,086
and our good will.

718
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:12,309
But first he must
honour his word.

719
01:04:14,822 --> 01:04:16,492
They're taking us for fools.

720
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:19,583
This is a ruse...

721
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:22,744
and a filthy lie.

722
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:28,677
The Arkenstone is in this
Mountain, it is a trick!

723
01:04:28,706 --> 01:04:31,358
I-It's no trick.

724
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:33,460
The stone is real...

725
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,621
I gave it to them.

726
01:04:43,751 --> 01:04:45,092
You?

727
01:04:47,565 --> 01:04:50,954
I took it as my 14th share.

728
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:53,577
You would steel from me?

729
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:55,237
Steel from you? No,

730
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:59,327
no. I may be a burglar, but I
like to think I'm an honest one.

731
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:03,481
I'm willing to let it
stand against my claim.

732
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:07,190
Against your claim?

733
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,943
Your claim,

734
01:05:09,994 --> 01:05:13,106
you have no claim over
me, you miserable...

735
01:05:13,146 --> 01:05:15,655
rat!

736
01:05:15,695 --> 01:05:18,336
I was going to give it to you.

737
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:21,485
Many times I wanted to, but -
- But what,

738
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,367
thief?

739
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:26,800
You are changed, Thorin.
The Dwarf I met...

740
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:31,411
in Bag-End would never have
gone back on his word,

741
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,181
would never have doubted
the loyalty of his kin.

742
01:05:33,231 --> 01:05:36,681
Do not speak to me...

743
01:05:36,722 --> 01:05:38,382
of loyalty.

744
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,297
Throw him from the rampart!

745
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,438
Did you not hear me?!

746
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:58,172
I will do it myself.

747
01:05:58,202 --> 01:06:00,570
I curse you!

748
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,172
Cursed be the wizard
that forced...

749
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:05,195
you on this company.
- If you don't like my burglar,

750
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:06,275
then please...

751
01:06:06,315 --> 01:06:07,456
don't damage him.

752
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,974
Return him...

753
01:06:09,014 --> 01:06:10,365
to me.

754
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:17,838
You're not making a very
splendid figure as King under...

755
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:21,922
the Mountain, are you,
Thorin, son of...

756
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:23,333
Thráin.

757
01:06:30,065 --> 01:06:33,284
Never again will I have
dealings with wizards...

758
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:34,414
or Shire rats.

759
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:41,588
Are we resolved?

760
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:43,048
The return of the...

761
01:06:43,088 --> 01:06:45,260
Arkenstone for
what was promised.

762
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,304
Give us your answer.

763
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:56,413
Will you have peace...

764
01:06:57,934 --> 01:06:59,606
or war?

765
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,300
I will have war.

766
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:26,784
Ironfoot.

767
01:07:29,856 --> 01:07:31,757
Dáin! Dáin!

768
01:07:31,788 --> 01:07:33,679
Dáin!

769
01:07:53,786 --> 01:07:56,889
Who is that? He doesn't
look very happy.

770
01:07:56,909 --> 01:08:00,467
It is Dáin, Lord
of the Iron Hills.

771
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:02,869
Thorin's cousin.
- Are they alike?

772
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:08,041
I've always found Thorin the
more reasonable of the two.

773
01:08:17,655 --> 01:08:19,006
Good morning!

774
01:08:19,037 --> 01:08:20,795
How are we all?

775
01:08:24,358 --> 01:08:26,059
I have a wee proposition,

776
01:08:26,088 --> 01:08:28,310
if you wouldn't mind
giving me a few moments...

777
01:08:28,331 --> 01:08:30,448
of your time.

778
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:34,112
Would ya consider...

779
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:34,893
JUST...

780
01:08:34,922 --> 01:08:36,344
SODDING OFF?!

781
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:38,712
All of you!

782
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:40,434
Right now!

783
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:41,574
Stand fast!

784
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:44,604
Calm now, Lord...

785
01:08:44,623 --> 01:08:47,286
- Dáin.
- Gandalf the Grey.

786
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:50,248
Tell this rabble...

787
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:52,306
to leave, or I'll...

788
01:08:52,356 --> 01:08:54,259
water the ground
with their blood.

789
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,851
There is no need for...

790
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,952
war between Dwarves,
Men and Elves.

791
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:03,042
A legion of Orcs...

792
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:04,823
march on the Mountain.

793
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:05,795
Stand your army...

794
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:09,083
down.
- I will not stand down before any Elf.

795
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:12,766
Not least this
faithless woodland...

796
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:17,738
sprite. He wishes nothing
but ill upon my people.

797
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:18,948
If he...

798
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:22,912
chooses to stand
between me and my kin,

799
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:25,029
I'll split his pretty head open!

800
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,112
See if he's still smirking...

801
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,503
- then.
- Dáin!

802
01:09:29,554 --> 01:09:32,592
He's clearly mad,
like his cousin.

803
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:35,314
You hear that, lads? We're on!

804
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:38,738
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering.

805
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,074
Were-worms!

806
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:11,368
Oh, come on.

807
01:10:24,244 --> 01:10:28,935
_

808
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,501
The Hordes of Hell are...

809
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,948
upon us!

810
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:45,112
To battle, to battle,
sons of Durin!

811
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:52,984
I'm going over the wall,
who's coming with me?

812
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,067
Aye! Yes! Come on, let's go.

813
01:10:55,096 --> 01:10:56,957
- Stand down.
- What?

814
01:10:56,997 --> 01:10:58,746
Are we to do nothing?

815
01:10:58,775 --> 01:11:00,658
<i>I said stand...</i>

816
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:02,429
<i>down!</i>

817
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:06,609
The Elves,

818
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,470
will they not fight?

819
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:12,434
Thranduil!

820
01:11:12,463 --> 01:11:14,072
This is madness!

821
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:10,493
Uh, Gandalf...

822
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:12,336
is this a good place to stand?

823
01:12:12,826 --> 01:12:15,354
_

824
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:32,292
_

825
01:12:34,404 --> 01:12:36,375
_

826
01:12:38,216 --> 01:12:40,746
_

827
01:12:55,301 --> 01:12:56,862
Azog.

828
01:12:58,342 --> 01:13:00,345
He's trying to cut us off.

829
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:05,595
All of you...

830
01:13:05,645 --> 01:13:07,766
fall back to Dale!

831
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,078
Now!

832
01:13:11,858 --> 01:13:16,301
To the city! Bilbo, this way!

833
01:14:25,756 --> 01:14:27,087
Sigrid!

834
01:14:28,405 --> 01:14:29,407
Tilda!

835
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,854
My children, where
are my children?

836
01:14:41,913 --> 01:14:45,012
I saw them, they were
down in the Old Market.

837
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:48,296
The Market? Where are they now?

838
01:14:48,345 --> 01:14:50,207
Tilda! Sigrid!

839
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:54,197
Bard, Orcs are storming
over the Causeway.

840
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:57,300
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them of for as long as you can.

841
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,030
Archers, this way!

842
01:14:59,889 --> 01:15:04,301
The Orcs have taken Stone
Street, the Market is overrun.

843
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:10,323
The rest of you, follow me!

844
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,545
Charge! Onward! To the death!

845
01:16:07,707 --> 01:16:09,488
- Da!
- Da!

846
01:16:09,555 --> 01:16:11,596
- Over here!
- Da is here!

847
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,417
Tilda!

848
01:16:39,668 --> 01:16:40,787
Bain!

849
01:16:40,817 --> 01:16:42,417
Sigrid! Get down!

850
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:06,658
Listen, I need you to gather
the women and children,

851
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,229
take them to the Great Hall...

852
01:17:08,288 --> 01:17:10,039
and barricade the door.

853
01:17:10,081 --> 01:17:13,990
You understand? You must
not come out for any...

854
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,561
reason.
- We want to stay with you.

855
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:18,024
Show your father some respect.

856
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:20,471
You leave it to me, Sire.

857
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,244
You heard him, we
make for Great Hall.

858
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:27,814
Alfrid, women and children only.
I need every man...

859
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:31,887
fighting. See that you return.
- I'll get them to safety, Sire.

860
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,868
My sword is yours to command.

861
01:17:36,908 --> 01:17:38,239
Get up!

862
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:40,731
- Look after them.
- I will.

863
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,641
Shift it, granny.

864
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:57,998
Make for the Great Hall.

865
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:02,539
Out of my way!

866
01:18:02,569 --> 01:18:05,311
Abandon the cripples!

867
01:18:51,168 --> 01:18:53,551
_

868
01:18:54,828 --> 01:18:58,100
_

869
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:07,015
You buggers!

870
01:19:17,847 --> 01:19:18,917
Thorin!

871
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,942
Where's Thorin?

872
01:19:22,981 --> 01:19:24,752
We need him. Where is he?

873
01:19:28,912 --> 01:19:32,115
_

874
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:36,685
_

875
01:19:38,216 --> 01:19:40,149
Pull back!

876
01:20:08,918 --> 01:20:10,729
Since when do we forsake our...

877
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,247
own people?

878
01:20:13,269 --> 01:20:15,161
Thorin, they are dying...

879
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,801
out there.

880
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:25,416
There are halls beneath
halls within this Mountain,

881
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:29,376
places we can fortify.

882
01:20:30,546 --> 01:20:32,318
Shore up, make safe?

883
01:20:32,347 --> 01:20:33,439
Yes.

884
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:36,747
Yes,

885
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:38,859
that is it.

886
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:41,622
We must move the gold
further underground...

887
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,220
to safety.
- Did you not hear me?

888
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,662
Dáin is surrounded.

889
01:20:45,702 --> 01:20:47,673
They're being
slaughtered, Thorin.

890
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:51,594
Many die in war,

891
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:54,355
live is cheap.

892
01:20:56,537 --> 01:20:57,547
But a treasure...

893
01:20:57,578 --> 01:20:59,756
such as this...

894
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:02,368
cannot be counted in lives lost.

895
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:09,011
It is worth all the
blood we can spend.

896
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:16,533
You sit here in these vast halls
with a crown upon your head,

897
01:21:16,573 --> 01:21:20,926
and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

898
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:27,158
Do not speak to me as if I
were some lowly Dwarf...

899
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:29,957
Lord. As is if...

900
01:21:29,988 --> 01:21:32,520
I were still...

901
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:39,863
Thorin... Oakenshield.

902
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:44,326
I am your King!
- You were always my King.

903
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:47,104
You used to know that once.

904
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:51,819
You cannot see what
you have become.

905
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:55,087
Go,

906
01:21:58,051 --> 01:21:59,121
get out...

907
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,271
before I kill you.

908
01:22:17,926 --> 01:22:22,489
<i>You sit here with a
crown upon your head.</i>

909
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,988
<i>You are lesser now than
you have ever been.</i>

910
01:22:25,059 --> 01:22:29,032
<i>A treasure such as this cannot
be counted in lives lost.</i>

911
01:22:29,072 --> 01:22:31,474
<i>A sickness lies
upon that treasure.</i>

912
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:33,762
<i>The blind ambition
of a Mountain King.</i>

913
01:22:33,813 --> 01:22:35,373
<i>Am I not the King?</i>

914
01:22:35,434 --> 01:22:39,858
<i>This gold is ours,
and ours alone.</i>

915
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:41,326
<i>Treasure hoard...</i>

916
01:22:41,345 --> 01:22:44,677
<i>I will not part...</i>

917
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:47,581
<i>with a single coin.</i>

918
01:22:47,621 --> 01:22:49,198
<i>He could not see
beyond his own desire!</i>

919
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:51,940
<i>As if I were some
lowly Dwarf Lord.</i>

920
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,512
<i>Thorin Oakenshield.</i>

921
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:57,381
<i>A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.</i>

922
01:22:57,421 --> 01:22:58,502
<i>Oakenshield.</i>

923
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:03,337
<i>This is Thorin, son of
Thráin, son of Thrór.</i>

924
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:05,655
<i>I am not my grandfather.</i>

925
01:23:05,695 --> 01:23:07,636
<i>You are the heir to
the Throne of Durin.</i>

926
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,479
<i>They are dying out there.</i>

927
01:23:09,529 --> 01:23:11,279
<i>Take back Erebor.</i>

928
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,149
<i>Dáin is surrounded.</i>

929
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,301
<i>Is surrounded.</i>

930
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:20,121
<i>Take back your homeland.</i>

931
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,372
<i>You are changed, Thorin.</i>

932
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,293
<i>I'm not my grandfather.</i>

933
01:23:24,354 --> 01:23:27,573
<i>Is this treasure truly worth
more than your honour?</i>

934
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:32,317
<i>I'm not my grandfather.</i>

935
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:46,171
<i>This treasure will
be your death.</i>

936
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:29,329
Fall back!

937
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:32,418
Fall back! Back to the Mountain!

938
01:24:35,532 --> 01:24:36,743
Fall back!

939
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:44,454
_

940
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:48,375
_

941
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,229
I will not hide...

942
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:26,019
behind a wall of stone, while
others fight our battles for us!

943
01:25:29,481 --> 01:25:33,242
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

944
01:25:36,994 --> 01:25:38,305
No,

945
01:25:38,345 --> 01:25:40,264
it is not.

946
01:25:42,155 --> 01:25:44,216
We are sons of Durin...

947
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,797
and Durin's folk...

948
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:52,291
do not flee from a fight.

949
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:19,399
I have no right to ask
this of any of you,

950
01:26:24,533 --> 01:26:29,413
but will you follow
me one last time?

951
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:50,811
_

952
01:26:53,993 --> 01:26:55,704
_

953
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,739
Thorin.

954
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,782
To the King! To the...

955
01:27:40,832 --> 01:27:42,773
King!

956
01:28:06,533 --> 01:28:07,684
The Dwarves,

957
01:28:07,724 --> 01:28:09,801
they're rallying.

958
01:28:12,484 --> 01:28:16,203
They're rallying to their King.

959
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:23,399
Any man who wants to give
their last follow me!

960
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:46,507
I say we stand with our
men in life and in death.

961
01:28:46,528 --> 01:28:49,307
- I'm with ya.
- Arm yourselves!

962
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:50,988
Come with us, love.
- No, no, no.

963
01:28:51,019 --> 01:28:53,461
You leave an old woman be.
- Don't be afraid.

964
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:55,168
I said get off!

965
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:58,341
Alfrid Lickspittle,

966
01:28:58,371 --> 01:29:00,783
- you are a coward.
- A Coward?

967
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:03,542
Not every man is brave
enough to wear a corset.

968
01:29:03,591 --> 01:29:04,882
You're not a man,

969
01:29:04,912 --> 01:29:06,694
you're a weasel.

970
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,831
Dáin!

971
01:29:22,881 --> 01:29:26,283
Thorin... hold on!

972
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,931
I'm coming!

973
01:29:35,324 --> 01:29:36,916
Hey, cousin...

974
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:40,219
what took you so long?

975
01:29:43,998 --> 01:29:46,220
There's too many of
these buggers, Thorin.

976
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:49,613
I hope you've got a plan.

977
01:29:49,653 --> 01:29:51,631
Aye,

978
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:54,012
we're going to take
out their leader.

979
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:55,514
Azog?

980
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:01,765
I'm going to kill
that piece of filth.

981
01:30:01,805 --> 01:30:02,936
Lead on!

982
01:30:17,882 --> 01:30:20,154
We may yet survive this.

983
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:22,542
Gandalf!

984
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:30,926
It's Thorin.

985
01:30:30,976 --> 01:30:33,018
And Fíli and Kíli...

986
01:30:33,047 --> 01:30:35,800
and Dwalin.

987
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:38,048
He's taking his best warriors.

988
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:39,539
To do what?

989
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:43,193
To cut the head of the snake.

990
01:31:16,323 --> 01:31:17,323
Die!

991
01:31:24,367 --> 01:31:25,938
Gandalf!

992
01:31:25,978 --> 01:31:27,878
Legolas.

993
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,329
Legolas Greenleaf!
- There's a second army.

994
01:31:32,369 --> 01:31:35,492
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

995
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:39,962
Gundabad? Ahh. This was
their plan all along.

996
01:31:42,423 --> 01:31:46,087
Azog engages our forces, then
Bolg sweeps in from the north.

997
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:47,746
What, th... the north?

998
01:31:47,786 --> 01:31:49,306
Where is the north...

999
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,639
- exactly?
- Ravenhill.

1000
01:31:51,689 --> 01:31:53,890
Ravenhill?

1001
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,779
Thorin is up there...

1002
01:31:55,828 --> 01:31:58,050
and Fíli and Kíli.
They're all up there.

1003
01:32:14,337 --> 01:32:16,509
Where is he?

1004
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:23,180
It looks empty.

1005
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:29,993
I think Azog has fled.
- I don't think so.

1006
01:32:31,234 --> 01:32:32,234
Fíli,

1007
01:32:33,305 --> 01:32:34,673
take your brother.

1008
01:32:34,724 --> 01:32:36,154
Scout out the towers.

1009
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:40,127
Keep low and out of sight.
If you see something,

1010
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:42,596
report back, do not engage.
Do you understand?

1011
01:32:42,617 --> 01:32:46,579
We have company.
Goblin mercenaries.

1012
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,048
No more then a hundred.
- We'll take care of them. Go!

1013
01:32:50,099 --> 01:32:51,199
Go!

1014
01:33:22,773 --> 01:33:24,344
Recall your company.

1015
01:33:30,595 --> 01:33:32,266
My Lord, disperse...

1016
01:33:32,296 --> 01:33:35,479
this force to Ravenhill, the
Dwarves are about to be overrun.

1017
01:33:35,519 --> 01:33:38,988
Thorin must be warned.
- By all means, warn him.

1018
01:33:39,009 --> 01:33:41,570
I've spent enough Elvish
blood in defence of this...

1019
01:33:41,621 --> 01:33:43,221
accursed land. No more!

1020
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:44,940
Thranduil?

1021
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:49,003
- I'll go.
- Don't be ridiculous,

1022
01:33:49,043 --> 01:33:51,475
you'll never make it. - Why not?

1023
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:54,954
Because they will see you
coming, and kill you!

1024
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:57,127
No, they won't.

1025
01:33:58,448 --> 01:33:59,649
They won't see me.

1026
01:34:01,006 --> 01:34:04,659
It's out of the question.
I won't allow it.

1027
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:08,489
I'm not asking you to
allow it, Gandalf.

1028
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:10,820
Oh.

1029
01:34:44,704 --> 01:34:46,567
_

1030
01:34:46,596 --> 01:34:50,686
You will not turn away.
Not this time.

1031
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,509
Get out of my way.

1032
01:34:53,559 --> 01:34:55,368
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

1033
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,649
Yes, they will die.

1034
01:34:57,698 --> 01:35:01,641
Today... tomorrow,

1035
01:35:01,681 --> 01:35:04,381
one year hence a
hundred years from...

1036
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:06,582
now. What does it matter?

1037
01:35:06,622 --> 01:35:08,364
They are mortal.

1038
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:13,375
You think your life is
worth more than theirs,

1039
01:35:13,425 --> 01:35:16,597
while there is no love in it?

1040
01:35:16,648 --> 01:35:20,547
There is no love in you.

1041
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:29,072
What do you know of love?
Nothing.

1042
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:32,975
What you feel for that
Dwarf is not real.

1043
01:35:35,132 --> 01:35:41,994
You think it is love? Are
you ready to die for it?

1044
01:35:43,126 --> 01:35:44,657
_

1045
01:35:45,158 --> 01:35:46,828
_

1046
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,032
I will go with you.

1047
01:36:16,789 --> 01:36:18,161
Get up.

1048
01:36:18,211 --> 01:36:21,451
Get away from me. I
don't take orders...

1049
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:23,212
from you. People trusted you,

1050
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:24,592
they listened to you.

1051
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:25,944
The Master's mantel...

1052
01:36:25,974 --> 01:36:29,043
was there for the taking...

1053
01:36:29,064 --> 01:36:30,645
and you threw it all away.

1054
01:36:30,704 --> 01:36:33,226
For what?

1055
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:42,661
Alfrid,

1056
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,439
your slip is showing.

1057
01:36:59,555 --> 01:37:03,257
Stay here, search
the lower levels.

1058
01:37:03,328 --> 01:37:05,088
I've got this.

1059
01:37:14,153 --> 01:37:15,942
Where is that Orc-filth?

1060
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:19,663
Thorin!

1061
01:37:19,724 --> 01:37:21,126
Bilbo.

1062
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:23,144
You have to leave here. Now!

1063
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:25,166
Azog has another army,
attacking from the north.

1064
01:37:25,195 --> 01:37:27,117
This watchtower will be
completely surrounded,

1065
01:37:27,157 --> 01:37:29,109
there'll be no way out.
- We are so close.

1066
01:37:29,149 --> 01:37:30,699
That Orc-scum is in there.

1067
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:32,608
- I say we push on.
- No!

1068
01:37:32,667 --> 01:37:36,511
That's what he wants.
He wants to draw us in.

1069
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:39,411
This is a trap.

1070
01:37:55,237 --> 01:37:57,198
Find Fíli and Kíli,
call them back.

1071
01:37:57,257 --> 01:38:00,100
Thorin, are you sure about this?
- Do it.

1072
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:03,850
We live to fight another day.

1073
01:38:25,778 --> 01:38:27,158
Oh no.

1074
01:38:27,429 --> 01:38:29,320
_

1075
01:38:30,192 --> 01:38:32,592
_

1076
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:36,493
_

1077
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:39,706
_

1078
01:38:39,735 --> 01:38:40,737
Go.

1079
01:38:44,667 --> 01:38:45,667
Run!

1080
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,730
_

1081
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,840
Kíli!

1082
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,081
Thorin!

1083
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:23,240
Thorin, no.

1084
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,692
_

1085
01:40:46,085 --> 01:40:47,542
No.

1086
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,480
Kíli!

1087
01:42:36,795 --> 01:42:39,237
_

1088
01:42:43,546 --> 01:42:45,969
_

1089
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:06,729
Kíli!

1090
01:43:11,729 --> 01:43:12,780
Kíli!

1091
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:16,430
- Tauriel!
- Kíli.

1092
01:44:21,416 --> 01:44:22,516
No!

1093
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:34,130
No.

1094
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:49,872
Tauriel!

1095
01:54:30,859 --> 01:54:32,601
The eagles are coming.

1096
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:23,859
Hey, Bilbo.

1097
01:55:23,909 --> 01:55:26,591
No, don't look. Don't move.
Lie still.

1098
01:55:27,573 --> 01:55:28,724
Ow.

1099
01:55:30,702 --> 01:55:33,564
I'm glad you're here.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1100
01:55:34,625 --> 01:55:37,373
I wish to part from you in friendship.
- No,

1101
01:55:37,444 --> 01:55:39,055
you are not going
anywhere, Thorin,

1102
01:55:39,095 --> 01:55:41,537
you're going to live.

1103
01:55:41,608 --> 01:55:44,707
I would take back my words
and my deeds at the gate.

1104
01:55:46,018 --> 01:55:48,819
You did what only a
true friend would do.

1105
01:55:50,481 --> 01:55:51,481
Forgive me.

1106
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:55,863
I was too blind to see.

1107
01:55:58,685 --> 01:56:04,345
I am so sorry that I have
led you into such peril.

1108
01:56:04,405 --> 01:56:07,469
No, I-I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.

1109
01:56:07,519 --> 01:56:08,936
Each and every one of them.

1110
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:17,260
It is far more than
any Baggins deserves.

1111
01:56:20,192 --> 01:56:24,202
Farewell, Master Burglar.

1112
01:56:24,252 --> 01:56:31,805
Go back to your books
and your armchair.

1113
01:56:31,845 --> 01:56:34,296
Plant your trees,

1114
01:56:34,346 --> 01:56:39,297
watch them grow.

1115
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:45,783
If more people valued home...

1116
01:56:45,853 --> 01:56:48,421
above gold,

1117
01:56:48,492 --> 01:56:53,496
this world would be
a merrier place.

1118
01:56:56,085 --> 01:56:58,567
No. No, no, no, no. No,

1119
01:56:58,617 --> 01:56:59,898
Thorin!

1120
01:56:59,948 --> 01:57:01,908
Thorin, don't you dare...

1121
01:57:03,518 --> 01:57:05,238
Thorin?

1122
01:57:10,332 --> 01:57:13,421
Look, Thorin. Thorin, hold on.

1123
01:57:13,452 --> 01:57:14,403
You hold on,

1124
01:57:14,453 --> 01:57:16,083
you see, the Eagles...

1125
01:57:16,123 --> 01:57:19,024
the Eagles, the Eagles are here.

1126
01:57:19,054 --> 01:57:23,737
Thorin...

1127
01:57:23,777 --> 01:57:26,038
the Eagles...

1128
01:58:21,898 --> 01:58:25,871
I... can not go back.

1129
01:58:25,921 --> 01:58:28,689
Where will you go?

1130
01:58:28,729 --> 01:58:31,351
I do not know.

1131
01:58:31,421 --> 01:58:33,132
Go north.

1132
01:58:33,193 --> 01:58:36,802
Find the Dúnedain.

1133
01:58:36,853 --> 01:58:39,826
There is a young ranger amongst
them, you should meet him.

1134
01:58:41,796 --> 01:58:49,100
His father Arathorn was a good man.
His son might grow to be a great one.

1135
01:58:51,771 --> 01:58:52,890
What is his name?

1136
01:58:52,960 --> 01:59:00,962
He is known in the wild as Strider. His
true name you must discover for yourself.

1137
01:59:05,515 --> 01:59:10,167
Legolas, your mother loved you,

1138
01:59:12,599 --> 01:59:17,158
more than anyone,
more than life.

1139
01:59:52,113 --> 01:59:54,265
They want to bury him.

1140
01:59:56,234 --> 01:59:57,905
Yes.

1141
01:59:58,975 --> 02:00:04,948
If this is love, I
do not want it.

1142
02:00:05,007 --> 02:00:09,811
Take it from me, please?

1143
02:00:14,462 --> 02:00:17,333
Why does it hurt so much?

1144
02:00:17,384 --> 02:00:21,113
Because it was real.

1145
02:03:05,828 --> 02:03:11,569
There is to be a great feast tonight.
Songs will be sung, tales will be told,

1146
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:15,671
and Thorin Oakenshield...

1147
02:03:15,712 --> 02:03:17,751
will pass into legend.

1148
02:03:19,271 --> 02:03:20,993
I know that's how you must...

1149
02:03:21,054 --> 02:03:24,225
honour him, but to me,
he was never that.

1150
02:03:24,286 --> 02:03:26,765
He was...

1151
02:03:26,824 --> 02:03:29,907
to me...

1152
02:03:29,947 --> 02:03:32,850
he was...

1153
02:03:38,461 --> 02:03:41,409
Well, I think I'll slip quietly away,
will you tell the others I said goodbye?

1154
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:44,152
You can tell them yourself.

1155
02:03:59,717 --> 02:04:03,320
If any of you are ever
passing Bag-End...

1156
02:04:08,101 --> 02:04:09,542
tea is at four.

1157
02:04:11,154 --> 02:04:13,762
There's plenty of it...

1158
02:04:15,493 --> 02:04:17,265
and you are welcome any time.

1159
02:04:23,027 --> 02:04:24,398
Uh...

1160
02:04:26,029 --> 02:04:27,560
don't bother knocking.

1161
02:05:10,015 --> 02:05:12,296
Ahh, the borders of the...

1162
02:05:12,346 --> 02:05:14,007
Shire.

1163
02:05:14,047 --> 02:05:16,377
It is here I must leave you.

1164
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:20,750
That's a shame.

1165
02:05:22,759 --> 02:05:24,340
I quite liked having a...

1166
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:29,793
wizard around. It seems
they bring good luck.

1167
02:05:29,833 --> 02:05:32,052
You don't really
suppose, do you,

1168
02:05:32,092 --> 02:05:36,185
that all your adventures and
escapes were managed by mere luck.

1169
02:05:36,216 --> 02:05:40,686
Magic rings should not
be used lightly, Bilbo.

1170
02:05:40,747 --> 02:05:43,639
Don't take me for a fool, I
know you found one... - No.

1171
02:05:43,668 --> 02:05:46,859
In the Goblin tunnels, and
I've kept my eye on you...

1172
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:48,520
ever since.

1173
02:05:51,462 --> 02:05:53,344
Well, thank goodness.

1174
02:05:57,743 --> 02:06:00,145
Farewell, Gandalf.

1175
02:06:02,043 --> 02:06:03,916
Farewell.

1176
02:06:10,877 --> 02:06:12,139
You uhh...

1177
02:06:12,168 --> 02:06:16,032
you needn't worry about that ring, it
fell out of my pocket during the battle.

1178
02:06:16,061 --> 02:06:18,201
I lost it.

1179
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:23,454
You're a very fine person,
Mr Baggins, and I'm very...

1180
02:06:23,505 --> 02:06:25,823
fond of you.

1181
02:06:25,904 --> 02:06:33,029
But you're only quite a little
fellow in a wide world after all.

1182
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:07,430
Wait a minute, that my
mother's glory box.

1183
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:08,640
And that's...

1184
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:10,091
my dining chair?

1185
02:07:10,122 --> 02:07:13,261
Hey, put that poof down!

1186
02:07:13,301 --> 02:07:15,193
What is going on?

1187
02:07:15,222 --> 02:07:16,163
Hello, mister...

1188
02:07:16,213 --> 02:07:19,176
Bilbo. You're not
supposed to be here.

1189
02:07:19,235 --> 02:07:21,074
What do you mean?

1190
02:07:21,125 --> 02:07:22,926
On account of you being
presumed dead and all.

1191
02:07:22,956 --> 02:07:28,438
I am not dead,
presumed or otherwise.

1192
02:07:28,467 --> 02:07:32,591
I'm not sure that's permitted.
Mister Bilbo!

1193
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:36,980
<i>Anyone. Any bids on 21?
Any ones on 21?</i>

1194
02:07:37,051 --> 02:07:38,462
<i>Sold to Mrs. Bolder! ...
For sale, by auction, the</i>

1195
02:07:38,487 --> 02:07:40,006
effects and estate of... the Late Mr.
Bilbo Baggins...

1196
02:07:40,033 --> 02:07:43,382
Somewhere for Fatty
to put his feet on.

1197
02:07:44,663 --> 02:07:45,864
So do I have any bids...

1198
02:07:45,914 --> 02:07:48,476
for this. This is Shire-made.

1199
02:07:48,506 --> 02:07:51,765
None of your Dwarvish reproductions
here, honestly. - Stop!

1200
02:07:51,805 --> 02:07:54,569
Stop, there's been a mistake.

1201
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:56,760
Who are you?
- What do you mean "who am I"?

1202
02:07:56,819 --> 02:07:58,511
You know perfectly
well who I am,

1203
02:07:58,572 --> 02:08:00,590
Lobelia Sackville Baggins.

1204
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:02,220
This is my home...

1205
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:05,033
and those are my spoons,
thank you very much.

1206
02:08:05,083 --> 02:08:07,682
This is most irregular.
It's been more...

1207
02:08:07,762 --> 02:08:10,255
than 13 months since
the disappearance.

1208
02:08:10,305 --> 02:08:12,145
If you are in fact...

1209
02:08:12,206 --> 02:08:15,426
Bilbo Baggins and undeceased?

1210
02:08:15,485 --> 02:08:17,167
Can you prove it?

1211
02:08:17,247 --> 02:08:18,247
What?

1212
02:08:18,268 --> 02:08:20,158
Well... uh, something
official...

1213
02:08:20,208 --> 02:08:22,717
with your name on it would suffice.
- All right.

1214
02:08:22,787 --> 02:08:23,838
Right!

1215
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:28,792
A contract of employment as a

1216
02:08:28,842 --> 02:08:32,533
a but... Never mind that one.

1217
02:08:34,283 --> 02:08:38,234
There, my signature.
- Yes, well... uh...

1218
02:08:38,304 --> 02:08:43,557
o, it certainly seems to be in order.
Yes, it seems there can be no doubt.

1219
02:08:43,587 --> 02:08:46,688
Who is this person you
pledged your service to?

1220
02:08:48,099 --> 02:08:50,260
Thorin Oakenshield?

1221
02:08:53,662 --> 02:08:55,641
He...

1222
02:08:55,671 --> 02:08:58,873
he was my friend.

1223
02:10:52,105 --> 02:10:53,726
No, thank you!

1224
02:10:53,796 --> 02:10:58,747
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers, or distant relations!

1225
02:10:58,797 --> 02:10:59,939
And what about...

1226
02:10:59,998 --> 02:11:02,560
very old friends?

1227
02:11:09,453 --> 02:11:12,395
- Gandalf?
- Bilbo Baggins!

1228
02:11:12,435 --> 02:11:15,914
My dear Gandalf!
- It's good to see you.

1229
02:11:15,984 --> 02:11:20,578
One hundred and eleven years old.
Who would believe it?

1230
02:11:23,747 --> 02:11:26,000
Come on, come in.

1231
02:11:26,029 --> 02:11:28,671
Welcome, welcome.

1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,212


2
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,309
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:37,141
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,971
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,976
Lumos Maxima.

6
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,689
Lumos Maxima!

7
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:35,409
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,489
Harry, open the door.

9
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,327
Marge. How lovely to see...

10
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,720
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,160
What is it?

12
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:53,362
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,084
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,356
I will if she does.

15
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:01,556
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:04,435
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:06,490
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:10,808
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,161
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,045
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,381
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,488
Okay.

23
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:27,481
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:31,291
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,265
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,751
A bit more.

27
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:40,503
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,154
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:48,015
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:52,049
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,223
What are you smirking at?

32
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,175
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:00,502
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,568
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,053
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,902
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

37
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,554
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,756
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,890
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,834
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,066
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:29,103
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:31,991
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:34,609
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:41,394
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,317
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,580
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:50,608
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:54,576
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:58,640
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,435
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,900
Right.

53
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,107
Let me tell you...

54
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,731
Vernon!

55
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:36,373
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,952
Stop!

57
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,882
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

58
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,096
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

59
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,046
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

60
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,927
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:37,749
Oh, God.

62
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,637
Marge!

63
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,564
Please!

64
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,250
Marge!

65
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,348
Come back!

66
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,664
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

67
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:23,957
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:27,379
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:30,448
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:31,896
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,295
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,278
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

73
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:11,671
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

74
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:16,590
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

75
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,560
What you doing down there?

76
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,338
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?

77
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,058
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

78
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,363
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

79
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,121
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

80
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,949
Well, come on, then. In.

81
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:43,832
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

82
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,708
Come on.

83
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,836
Come on. Move on, move on.

84
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,118
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

85
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:22,421
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

86
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,829
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

87
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,305
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

88
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,354
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

89
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,751
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

90
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:48,598
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

91
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:54,386
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

92
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:56,211
They don't see nothing, do they?

93
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:58,833
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

94
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,440
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

95
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:14,224
Ten, nine, eight...

96
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,044
...seven, six, five...

97
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,381
...four, three, three and a half...

98
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,301
...two, one and three quarters.

99
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,377
Yes!

100
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:28,887
Who is that?

101
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,352
That man.

102
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,677
Who is that?

103
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,303
Who is...?

104
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,807
That is Sirius Black, that is.

105
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:42,485
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

106
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:45,910
He's a murderer.

107
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:48,594
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

108
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,504
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

109
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,554
He's the first one that done it.

110
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:58,002
He was a big supporter of...

111
00:10:58,489 --> 00:10:59,919
...You-Know-Who.

112
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:02,391
I reckon you've heard of him.

113
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,081
Yeah.

114
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,527
Him I've heard of.

115
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,675
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

116
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:12,754
They're getting closer, Ernie.

117
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,669
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

118
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:25,080
Mind your head.

119
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:31,642
Hey, guys? Guys?

120
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,906
Why the long faces?

121
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,849
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:50,295
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

123
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,131
Mr. Potter, at last.

124
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,636
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

125
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:23,638
Room 11.

126
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:27,382
Hedwig.

127
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,262
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

128
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:33,972
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

129
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:39,283
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

130
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,517
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

131
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:46,478
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

132
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,228
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

133
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,998
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

134
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:59,699
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

135
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,354
So that's that...

136
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:05,272
...and no harm done.

137
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,190
Pea soup?

138
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,393
No, thank you.

139
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,667
- Minister?
- Yes?

140
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,525
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

141
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:17,073
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

142
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:20,174
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

143
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,768
...for blowing up their aunts.

144
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:30,929
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

145
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,465
...was very, very irresponsible.

146
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:37,270
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

147
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,190
Sirius Black, you mean?

148
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,045
But what's he got to do with me?

149
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:47,863
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

150
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,056
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

151
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:54,073
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

152
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:58,063
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

153
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,023
Hedwig.

154
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:08,984
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

155
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,641
...wander.

156
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,928
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

157
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,423
Housekeeping.

158
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,869
I'll come back later.

159
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,511
I'm warning you, Hermione.

160
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:51,218
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

161
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,392
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

162
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:56,431
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

163
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:59,023
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

164
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:01,614
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

165
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,175
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

166
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:05,839
Harry.

167
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:08,248
Harry.

168
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,305
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:15,701
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:18,963
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,163
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

172
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,632
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,169
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,337
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:29,879
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,114
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,559
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,794
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

179
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,303
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,674
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,784
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

182
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:44,302
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,026
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:50,674
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:57,302
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,018
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,381
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:06,034
You are in danger.

189
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,048
Grave danger.

190
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,049
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,128
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,835
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,198
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,117
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:25,558
Sorry.

196
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:28,504
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,227
...Black lost everything.

198
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:34,517
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,754
And in his mind...

200
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,790
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:43,539
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:45,778
And that is why...

203
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:48,400
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,356
To find you.

205
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,330
And kill me.

206
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,786
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,375
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,045
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:05,039
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,477
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,398
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:12,081
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:14,648
Don't lose him!

214
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,616
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

215
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,152
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

216
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:23,760
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,587
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:27,696
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:30,518
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,551
Who do you think that is?

221
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:37,463
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

222
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,665
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,833
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,260
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,969
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,972
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:07,992
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

228
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,976
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,820
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,182
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:20,021
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,960
Why are we stopping?

233
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,651
We can't be there yet.

234
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,860
What's going on?

235
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:34,611
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,709
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,400
There's something moving out there.

238
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,327
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:24,247
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:34,775
Harry.

241
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,590
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:45,106
Thank you.

243
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,567
Here, eat this. It'll help.

244
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,088
It's all right. It's chocolate.

245
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,120
What was that thing that came?

246
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,585
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

247
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:05,331
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:08,978
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,183
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,029
What happened to me?

251
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:24,851
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:28,051
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:31,444
And did either of you two...

254
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,884
...you know...

255
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:36,017
...pass out?
- No.

256
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,811
I felt weird, though.

257
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:39,733
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,058
But someone was screaming.

259
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,535
A woman.

260
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,374
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:47,895
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,999
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

263
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:54,325
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:57,653
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:00,152
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,712
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:05,295
Good luck, professor.

268
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:12,917
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:15,634
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

270
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,311
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:21,390
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,831
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

273
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,814
...has decided to retire...

274
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,587
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,371
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,255
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:39,575
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:53,076
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:55,662
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:24:55,866 --> 00:25:00,818
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,781
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:25:05,722 --> 00:25:09,235
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,995
Now whilst I've been assured...

284
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:14,673
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,118
...a word of caution.

286
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:19,346
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:22,774
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:26,418
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:30,066
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:35,698
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:40,918
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,528
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:49,431
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:02,862
Fortuna Major.

295
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,146
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:11,159
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

297
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,076
Watch this.

298
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:28,142
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

299
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:31,759
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,576
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:37,810
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

302
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,073
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

303
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:43,382
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

304
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,384
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,673
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

306
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,946
Do not give him one again.

307
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,634
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,115
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

309
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,122
I think we have a winner.

310
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,262
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

311
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:17,263
Look at him. His face.

312
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,267
Welcome, my children.

313
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:06,353
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,605
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:16,749
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:21,328
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:25,238
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:28,816
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:30,613
What do you see?

320
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:36,211
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,742
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:43,246
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,272
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,986
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,357
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,375
I think so.

327
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:55,220
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,413
Pity.

329
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:02,129
Broaden your minds.

330
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:08,788
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:10,776
- I think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,106
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:14,899
Yeah.

334
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:19,960
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:23,857
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:25,333
So...

337
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:29,391
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:30,869
Give me the cup.

339
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,159
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,737
My dear...

341
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,312
...you have the Grim.

342
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:45,779
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:48,694
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,961
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,495
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,634
It's an omen...

347
00:29:55,802 --> 00:29:57,557
...of death."

348
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,588
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:09,495
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:13,170
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:16,337
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,098
A fair few.

353
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,273
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,092
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:25,166
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:28,598
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

357
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:32,819
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

358
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:37,742
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:39,668
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,742
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:55,505
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,063
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,794
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:03,702
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:16,341
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

366
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:22,931
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,528
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,234
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,414
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,312
Dementor! Dementor!

371
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:57,936
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

372
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,511
Yeah.

373
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:12,174
Isn't he beautiful?

374
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,864
Say hello to Buckbeak.

375
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:17,588
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

376
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,726
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

377
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,246
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

378
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,190
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

379
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:29,970
It may be the last thing you ever do.

380
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:33,399
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

381
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,807
Well done, Harry. Well done.

382
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,846
Come on now.

383
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,636
Now...

384
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:47,378
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

385
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:49,332
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

386
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,862
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

387
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:54,064
If he does, you can go and touch him.

388
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:57,298
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

389
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,806
Just make your bow.

390
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,945
Nice and low.

391
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,665
Back off, Harry. Back off.

392
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,894
Keep still.

393
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,413
Keep still.

394
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:30,519
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

395
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,342
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

396
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,300
Go on. Don't be shy.

397
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,735
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

398
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:52,309
Not so fast, Harry.

399
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:00,307
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

400
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,537
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

401
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:07,573
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

402
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,491
That's it...

403
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:11,380
Yes!

404
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,222
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

405
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,294
Does he get to fly?

406
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:19,798
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

407
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:21,455
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,658
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

409
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:29,495
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

410
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,678
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

411
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,702
That was wicked, Harry!

412
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,239
Oh, please.

413
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,212
Well done, well done.

414
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,955
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

415
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:27,251
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

416
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,790
Malfoy, no...

417
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:31,064
No!

418
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,296
Buckbeak!

419
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,536
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

420
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:38,388
Whoa! Buckbeak!

421
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,716
Away, you silly creature...

422
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:44,848
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

423
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,225
Hagrid!

424
00:36:46,393 --> 00:36:51,379
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

425
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,077
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

426
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,411
You and your bloody chicken!

427
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:23,886
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

428
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,797
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

429
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,158
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

430
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,230
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

431
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:38,548
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

432
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:42,323
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

433
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,276
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

434
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,098
Sirius Black!

435
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,997
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

436
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,912
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

437
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,468
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

438
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,836
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

439
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:03,375
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

440
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:07,186
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

441
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:34,223
Intriguing, isn't it?

442
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,987
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

443
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,875
...as to what is inside?

444
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,902
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

445
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:49,431
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

446
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,565
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

447
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,229
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

448
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,498
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

449
00:38:56,728 --> 00:39:00,952
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

450
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:06,381
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

451
00:39:07,704 --> 00:39:11,316
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

452
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,997
After me. Riddikulus!

453
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,207
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

454
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,830
A little louder and very clear.

455
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:21,137
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

456
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:23,343
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

457
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:27,374
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

458
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:31,154
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

459
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:35,574
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

460
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:39,698
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

461
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:42,133
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

462
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,721
Come on.

463
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:48,493
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

464
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,289
Professor Snape.

465
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,277
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

466
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,701
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

467
00:39:55,864 --> 00:40:00,174
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

468
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,191
No...

469
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,650
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

470
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:08,977
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

471
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,143
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

472
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:16,022
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

473
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:19,380
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

474
00:40:19,832 --> 00:40:22,646
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

475
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,466
Can you do that?

476
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,634
Yes. Wand at the ready.

477
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,308
One, two, three.

478
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:42,519
Think, Neville, think.

479
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:47,118
Riddikulus!

480
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:54,033
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

481
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,015
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

482
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,277
Form a line!

483
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:07,702
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

484
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,864
...and turn it into something funny.

485
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:12,689
Next! Ron!

486
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:19,183
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

487
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,661
Wand at the ready, Ron.

488
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,131
Riddikulus!

489
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:35,604
Yes!

490
00:41:36,185 --> 00:41:38,966
You see? Very good, very good!

491
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:45,013
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

492
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:48,850
Show us what you see.

493
00:41:57,752 --> 00:42:01,013
Keep your nerve. Steady.

494
00:42:01,176 --> 00:42:03,064
Riddikulus!

495
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:05,944
And next! Step up, step up!

496
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,756
Wonderful, wonderful!

497
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,207
Here!

498
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,571
Riddikulus!

499
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:42,551
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

500
00:42:42,712 --> 00:42:44,622
Collect your books from the back.

501
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:47,312
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

502
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,382
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

503
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:56,720
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

504
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:59,701
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

505
00:42:59,864 --> 00:43:02,680
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

506
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:06,261
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

507
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:07,886
That's the rule, Potter.

508
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,185
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

509
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:13,741
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

510
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:16,301
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

511
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:19,538
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

512
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:26,126
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

513
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:30,419
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

514
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:45,615
Professor, can I ask you something?

515
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:49,525
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

516
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,062
I thought it'd be obvious.

517
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:53,940
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

518
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:57,453
I did think of Voldemort at first.

519
00:43:57,687 --> 00:44:00,176
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

520
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,765
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

521
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:05,717
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

522
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,308
This is very wise.

523
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,454
Before I fainted...

524
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,630
...I heard something.

525
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,713
A woman...

526
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:15,446
...screaming.

527
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,739
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

528
00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:21,750
Our pain becomes their power.

529
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:24,656
I think it was my mother...

530
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:26,963
...the night she was murdered.

531
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:32,781
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

532
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,085
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

533
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,544
They're your mother, Lily's.

534
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:40,823
Yes.

535
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:44,013
Oh, yes. I knew her.

536
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:49,940
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

537
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:53,234
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

538
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:56,596
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

539
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,014
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

540
00:45:00,183 --> 00:45:06,096
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

541
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:10,097
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

542
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:11,725
...he...

543
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:15,445
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

544
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:22,894
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

545
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:29,591
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

546
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:33,391
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

547
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:40,918
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

548
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:43,533
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

549
00:45:43,703 --> 00:45:47,598
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

550
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:50,349
What's going on?

551
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,855
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

552
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,350
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

553
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:59,636
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

554
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,769
Get back, all of you.

555
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,968
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

556
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:07,413
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

557
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:11,799
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

558
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,782
It's not funny, Ron.

559
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:19,633
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

560
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,668
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

561
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,814
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

562
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:30,807
You heard. Move!

563
00:46:44,439 --> 00:46:47,190
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

564
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:51,439
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

565
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,573
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

566
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:57,423
The Fat Lady's there.

567
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,141
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

568
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,248
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

569
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,750
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

570
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,957
Dear lady, who did this to you?

571
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:18,605
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

572
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:22,381
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

573
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:24,918
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

574
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,216
Sirius Black!

575
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:32,337
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

576
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:03,991
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

577
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:06,606
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

578
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,663
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

579
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:11,377
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

580
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:13,997
I didn't really expect him to linger.

581
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,428
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

582
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,795
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

583
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:22,512
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

584
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:24,467
Any theories on how
he managed it?

585
00:48:24,663 --> 00:48:27,511
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

586
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:29,230
You may recall...

587
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,116
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

588
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:34,254
...about your appointment
of Professor...

589
00:48:34,423 --> 00:48:38,352
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

590
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,822
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

591
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,464
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

592
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,867
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

593
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:49,583
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

594
00:48:50,424 --> 00:48:54,930
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

595
00:48:55,223 --> 00:49:01,454
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

596
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:40,467
Turn to page 394.

597
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,942
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

598
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,919
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

599
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,788
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

600
00:50:00,984 --> 00:50:05,839
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

601
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,082
"Werewolves"?

602
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,027
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

603
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:18,256
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

604
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:21,488
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

605
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:25,453
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

606
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,991
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

607
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,518
No one?

608
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,781
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

609
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:37,009
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

610
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:38,669
A werewolf has no choice.

611
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:40,688
With each full moon...

612
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:44,597
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

613
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:48,207
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

614
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:51,986
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

615
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:54,388
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

616
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,462
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

617
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:59,828
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

618
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,381
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

619
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:07,984
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

620
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:11,730
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

621
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:14,384
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

622
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,611
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

623
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,701
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

624
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:26,516
Page 394.

625
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,846
The term "werewolf"...

626
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:35,022
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

627
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:39,991
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

628
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,868
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

629
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,934
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

630
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:48,022
...being bitten by a werewolf...

631
00:52:06,071 --> 00:52:09,551
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

632
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:07,156
Aresto momentum!

633
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:12,303
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

634
00:54:12,472 --> 00:54:14,676
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

635
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,590
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

636
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:20,718
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

637
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:27,062
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

638
00:54:27,256 --> 00:54:29,143
You gave us a right good scare.

639
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,748
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

640
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:35,252
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

641
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:41,136
No one blames you, Harry.

642
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:45,011
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

643
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,214
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

644
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,896
There's something else
you should know too.

645
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:57,492
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

646
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,404
Well...

647
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,835
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

648
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:05,647
Is there no chance of fixing it?

649
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,156
No.

650
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,515
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

651
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:13,870
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

652
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,072
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

653
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:21,329
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

654
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,254
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

655
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:30,513
You are not weak, Harry.

656
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,574
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

657
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:37,742
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

658
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,404
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

659
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:44,460
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

660
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:47,980
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

661
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:50,060
You made the one
on the train go away.

662
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,953
There was only one that night.

663
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:56,624
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

664
00:55:56,952 --> 00:56:01,708
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

665
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:05,392
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

666
00:56:05,558 --> 00:56:07,380
For now, I need to rest.

667
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,891
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

668
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:52,781
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

669
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,733
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

670
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,611
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

671
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:00,085
We'll get you there.

672
00:57:00,247 --> 00:57:02,702
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.

673
00:57:02,872 --> 00:57:06,319
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

674
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:09,390
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

675
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:12,783
What are you doing?!

676
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:15,731
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

677
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:19,091
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

678
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:22,070
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

679
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,889
George, if you will.

680
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:27,218
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

681
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,159
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs...

682
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,398
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

683
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:39,794
We owe them so much.

684
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:46,867
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

685
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,649
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

686
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:50,763
- In his study.
- Pacing.

687
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:52,877
Does that a lot.

688
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,835
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.

689
00:57:55,032 --> 00:57:56,941
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

690
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,192
- Every minute.
- Every day.

691
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:01,229
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

692
00:58:01,399 --> 00:58:04,018
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

693
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,736
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

694
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,937
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

695
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:11,858
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

696
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:15,317
And don't forget. When you're done,

697
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:19,636
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

698
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:55,634
Now, how much do you want?

699
00:59:02,615 --> 00:59:04,470
Delicious.

700
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:16,045
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

701
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:17,841
Twice.

702
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:20,756
Do you want to move a bit closer?

703
00:59:20,951 --> 00:59:22,577
To the Shrieking Shack?

704
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:25,621
Actually, I'm fine here.

705
00:59:25,783 --> 00:59:27,539
Well, well. Look who's here.

706
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:30,098
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

707
00:59:30,328 --> 00:59:34,419
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

708
00:59:34,647 --> 00:59:37,713
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

709
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,895
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

710
00:59:43,095 --> 00:59:46,390
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

711
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:48,460
You filthy little mudblood!

712
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:53,964
Who is that?

713
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:02,227
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

714
01:00:21,238 --> 01:00:23,410
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

715
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,598
Get out of the way!

716
01:00:29,048 --> 01:00:30,575
Move!

717
01:00:30,742 --> 01:00:33,613
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

718
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:39,093
Harry!

719
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:43,151
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

720
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:47,377
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

721
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,868
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

722
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:54,892
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

723
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:57,453
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

724
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,859
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

725
01:01:00,022 --> 01:01:01,811
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

726
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:03,316
Allow me, minister.

727
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:05,266
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

728
01:01:05,463 --> 01:01:08,277
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

729
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,181
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

730
01:01:12,344 --> 01:01:16,205
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

731
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,698
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

732
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:22,391
And what would bring him here?

5
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:27,022
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

6
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:28,878
Come.

7
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:33,226
Harry!

8
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:44,905
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

9
01:01:45,108 --> 01:01:47,017
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

10
01:01:47,252 --> 01:01:48,778
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

11
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,013
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

12
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:56,498
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

13
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,434
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

14
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:04,815
Tell me what this is all about.

15
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:09,257
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

16
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:11,981
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

17
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,857
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

18
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:19,150
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

19
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:22,545
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

20
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,844
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

21
01:02:25,044 --> 01:02:27,182
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

22
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:29,105
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

23
01:02:29,268 --> 01:02:31,886
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

24
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:36,078
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

25
01:02:36,277 --> 01:02:39,953
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

26
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,221
He destroyed him!

27
01:02:42,836 --> 01:02:47,375
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

28
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,442
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

29
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:53,710
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

30
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:56,625
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

31
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:00,431
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

32
01:03:00,628 --> 01:03:02,668
...and remains to this day...

33
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:04,652
...Harry Potter's godfather!

34
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:15,151
Ron, look!

35
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:23,115
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

36
01:03:59,987 --> 01:04:01,743
Harry, what happened?

37
01:04:04,148 --> 01:04:06,188
He was their friend...

38
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,814
...and he betrayed them.

39
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:11,475
He was their friend!

40
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,507
I hope he finds me.

41
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:18,352
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

42
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:21,292
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

43
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:36,556
Harry.

44
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:38,605
There you are. You came.

45
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:42,705
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

46
01:04:42,868 --> 01:04:45,234
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

47
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:46,858
I'm sure.

48
01:04:47,412 --> 01:04:49,779
Well, everything's prepared.

49
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:53,266
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

50
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:54,867
Did you ever hear of it?

51
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:56,622
No? Well...

52
01:04:56,788 --> 01:05:00,204
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

53
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:04,844
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

54
01:05:05,011 --> 01:05:08,688
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

55
01:05:08,852 --> 01:05:12,649
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

56
01:05:12,851 --> 01:05:16,497
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

57
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,790
Close your eyes.

58
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:23,314
Concentrate.

59
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:26,506
Explore your past.

60
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:28,785
Do you have a memory?

61
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:32,428
Allow it to fill you up.

62
01:05:33,107 --> 01:05:35,116
Lose yourself within it.

63
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:40,529
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

64
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:43,664
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

65
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:50,513
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

66
01:06:07,603 --> 01:06:10,092
Expecto Patronum!

67
01:06:10,835 --> 01:06:14,065
Expecto... Expecto...

68
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,950
Expect...

69
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:21,770
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

70
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:25,712
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

71
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:31,020
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

72
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,578
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

73
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:37,423
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

74
01:06:37,588 --> 01:06:40,621
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

75
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,308
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

76
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:47,021
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

77
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,376
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

78
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:03,023
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

79
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,891
Well, it is.

80
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,548
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

81
01:07:09,716 --> 01:07:13,513
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

82
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:20,433
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?

83
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,823
Just do it.

84
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,590
Expecto Patronum!

85
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:41,577
Expecto Patronum!

86
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:03,340
Yes!

87
01:08:05,236 --> 01:08:08,497
Well done, Harry. Well done!

88
01:08:09,013 --> 01:08:12,974
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

89
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,474
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

90
01:08:15,635 --> 01:08:17,326
And just so you know, Harry...

91
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:21,321
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

92
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:23,466
...is saying something.

93
01:08:25,555 --> 01:08:27,466
I was thinking of him.

94
01:08:27,635 --> 01:08:29,709
And Mum.

95
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:32,014
Seeing their faces.

96
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:35,213
They were talking to me.

97
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,552
Just talking.

98
01:08:37,716 --> 01:08:39,951
That's the memory I chose.

99
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:43,859
I don't even know if it's real.

100
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:46,411
But it's the best I have.

101
01:08:55,284 --> 01:08:57,488
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

102
01:08:57,684 --> 01:08:59,570
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

103
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:02,066
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

104
01:09:02,227 --> 01:09:05,260
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

105
01:09:05,427 --> 01:09:07,467
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

106
01:09:07,635 --> 01:09:10,832
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

107
01:09:10,995 --> 01:09:14,738
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

108
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:17,648
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

109
01:09:17,843 --> 01:09:19,819
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

110
01:09:19,987 --> 01:09:21,416
- Did.
- Didn't.

111
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,900
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

112
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:29,231
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

113
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:31,949
...talking about why we were there.

114
01:09:33,747 --> 01:09:36,300
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

115
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:39,315
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

116
01:09:39,507 --> 01:09:42,409
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

117
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,646
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

118
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:48,746
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

119
01:09:48,948 --> 01:09:50,672
And then?

120
01:09:51,347 --> 01:09:53,933
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

121
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:58,061
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

122
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,952
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

123
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:34,025
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

124
01:10:34,227 --> 01:10:36,648
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.

125
01:10:36,852 --> 01:10:40,648
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

126
01:10:58,067 --> 01:11:00,141
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

127
01:11:00,307 --> 01:11:03,307
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

128
01:11:03,508 --> 01:11:05,875
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

129
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:16,937
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

130
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:02,380
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

131
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,747
Mischief managed. Nox.

132
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:16,144
Potter.

133
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:19,657
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

134
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:20,841
I was sleepwalking.

135
01:12:21,011 --> 01:12:23,500
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

136
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:28,271
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

137
01:12:28,468 --> 01:12:32,623
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

138
01:12:33,331 --> 01:12:36,266
Now, if you don't mind, I would
appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

139
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:41,437
Turn out your pockets.

140
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,561
Turn out your pockets!

141
01:12:48,354 --> 01:12:49,914
What's this?

142
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:53,212
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

143
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:02,969
Reveal your secrets.

144
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:08,097
Read it.

145
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:15,704
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

146
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:19,833
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

147
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,558
Go on.

148
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,398
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

149
01:13:26,593 --> 01:13:29,048
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

150
01:13:30,593 --> 01:13:33,212
Well, well. Lupin.

151
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:37,883
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

152
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:41,535
Harry, are you all right?

153
01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:44,096
That remains to be seen.

154
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:48,475
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

155
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,024
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

156
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:56,797
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

157
01:13:56,961 --> 01:14:00,310
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

158
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:04,190
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

159
01:14:04,385 --> 01:14:08,444
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

160
01:14:08,609 --> 01:14:11,608
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

161
01:14:11,776 --> 01:14:14,973
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

162
01:14:20,737 --> 01:14:23,355
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

163
01:14:28,257 --> 01:14:29,632
Come in.

164
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:36,347
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

165
01:14:36,544 --> 01:14:40,822
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

166
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:44,506
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

167
01:14:44,706 --> 01:14:46,615
...is a map to you?

168
01:14:47,393 --> 01:14:49,760
- No.
- No, sir.

169
01:14:51,681 --> 01:14:54,583
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

170
01:14:54,785 --> 01:14:58,909
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

171
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:03,449
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

172
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:07,872
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

173
01:15:08,097 --> 01:15:10,169
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

174
01:15:10,336 --> 01:15:12,671
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

175
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:16,346
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

176
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:21,084
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

177
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:29,824
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

178
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:35,391
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

179
01:15:35,808 --> 01:15:38,427
Oh, really? And who might that be?

180
01:15:38,593 --> 01:15:40,088
Peter Pettigrew.

181
01:15:42,594 --> 01:15:44,601
That's not possible.

182
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,353
It's just what I saw.

183
01:15:50,082 --> 01:15:51,707
Good night, professor.

184
01:15:55,073 --> 01:15:59,067
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

185
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:04,449
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

186
01:16:04,609 --> 01:16:07,805
Only then can you see. Try again.

187
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:10,328
Now, what do we have here?

188
01:16:12,577 --> 01:16:14,682
Do you mind me trying?

189
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:19,841
The Grim, possibly.

190
01:16:21,921 --> 01:16:25,849
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

191
01:16:26,018 --> 01:16:29,629
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

192
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:33,567
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

193
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:37,242
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

194
01:16:37,408 --> 01:16:41,239
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

195
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:44,408
...to which you so desperately cleave.

196
01:16:59,298 --> 01:17:01,207
Have I said something?

197
01:17:05,696 --> 01:17:10,486
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

198
01:17:10,657 --> 01:17:13,112
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

199
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:15,354
Hang on.

200
01:17:15,552 --> 01:17:18,335
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

201
01:17:18,658 --> 01:17:21,918
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

202
01:17:58,144 --> 01:18:03,196
Harry Potter...

203
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:13,885
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

204
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:15,610
Sorry?

205
01:18:15,809 --> 01:18:20,250
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

206
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,358
...shall break free.

207
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:24,667
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

208
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:30,583
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

209
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:39,805
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

210
01:18:40,576 --> 01:18:42,299
No.

211
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,216
Nothing.

212
01:19:34,656 --> 01:19:38,518
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

213
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:41,307
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

214
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:45,466
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

215
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,999
This is going to be rich.

216
01:19:48,192 --> 01:19:50,265
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

217
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:53,432
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

218
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,291
Hermione, no!

219
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:58,012
He's not worth it.

220
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:13,495
Malfoy, are you okay?

221
01:20:13,697 --> 01:20:17,722
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

222
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:22,144
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

223
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:44,893
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

224
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:47,229
Why don't we just set him free?

225
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:49,727
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

226
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:52,758
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

227
01:20:52,928 --> 01:20:55,197
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

228
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,103
When it happens.

229
01:20:58,272 --> 01:20:59,581
Great man, Dumbledore.

230
01:21:00,545 --> 01:21:02,006
A great man.

231
01:21:04,384 --> 01:21:07,232
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

232
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:10,426
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

233
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:14,105
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

234
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,519
Scabbers! You're alive!

235
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:27,226
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

236
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:31,002
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

237
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:32,216
I meant me!

238
01:21:32,897 --> 01:21:35,001
Blimey. What was that?

239
01:21:41,217 --> 01:21:42,558
Hagrid!

240
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:45,693
Oh, crikey.

241
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:49,724
No, minister. Over this way.

242
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,848
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

243
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:57,628
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

244
01:21:57,792 --> 01:22:01,241
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

245
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:04,926
Quick. Quick!

246
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,748
Hagrid.

247
01:22:06,913 --> 01:22:10,687
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

248
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:15,132
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

249
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,850
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

250
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,602
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

251
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,477
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

252
01:22:26,497 --> 01:22:28,951
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

253
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:32,350
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

254
01:22:33,472 --> 01:22:36,921
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

255
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:40,122
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

256
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:45,559
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

257
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:49,112
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

258
01:22:49,313 --> 01:22:53,535
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

259
01:22:53,696 --> 01:22:55,356
What?

260
01:22:55,521 --> 01:22:57,529
I thought I just saw...

261
01:22:57,697 --> 01:22:59,705
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

262
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:06,846
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

263
01:23:51,457 --> 01:23:52,863
Oh, no.

264
01:24:03,328 --> 01:24:05,434
He bit me. Scabbers.

265
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,870
Ron. Ron!

266
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,182
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

267
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,323
Wait!

268
01:24:20,992 --> 01:24:25,116
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

269
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:27,484
That's not good. Ron, run!

270
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:32,919
Harry, Hermione, run!

271
01:24:33,472 --> 01:24:35,033
It's the Grim!

272
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,696
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

273
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:46,806
Harry!

274
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,589
- Help!
- Ron!

275
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,772
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

276
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,926
Come on!

277
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,136
Move!

278
01:25:19,008 --> 01:25:20,699
Duck!

279
01:25:55,073 --> 01:25:57,276
Harry!

280
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:15,391
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

281
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:19,327
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

282
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,269
I just hope I'm wrong.

283
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,194
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

284
01:26:44,257 --> 01:26:45,783
Come on.

285
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,085
Ron.

286
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,121
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

287
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,419
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

288
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,387
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

289
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,276
No. Only one will die tonight.

290
01:27:21,472 --> 01:27:23,328
Then it'll be you!

291
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,354
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

292
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:34,268
Expelliarmus!

293
01:27:37,856 --> 01:27:41,851
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

294
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:44,951
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

295
01:27:45,536 --> 01:27:49,017
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

296
01:27:59,008 --> 01:27:59,956
- I found him.
- I know.

297
01:28:00,128 --> 01:28:01,404
- He's here.
- I understand.

298
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:04,635
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

299
01:28:05,056 --> 01:28:08,635
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

300
01:28:09,313 --> 01:28:12,246
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

301
01:28:14,945 --> 01:28:16,570
How long have you known?

302
01:28:17,057 --> 01:28:20,122
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

303
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,135
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

304
01:28:23,295 --> 01:28:25,598
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

305
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:28,312
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

306
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,814
Twelve years of it!

307
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:33,694
In Azkaban!

308
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:44,442
Very well. Kill him.

309
01:28:44,993 --> 01:28:48,604
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

310
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:50,262
I know why.

311
01:28:50,496 --> 01:28:52,635
You betrayed my parents.

312
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,615
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

313
01:28:55,777 --> 01:28:57,598
Somebody did betray your parents...

314
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,109
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

315
01:29:01,312 --> 01:29:04,628
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

316
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,800
And he's in this room! Right now!

317
01:29:08,288 --> 01:29:11,135
Come out, come out, Peter!

318
01:29:11,295 --> 01:29:14,166
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

319
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:19,382
Vengeance is sweet.

320
01:29:19,552 --> 01:29:21,723
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

321
01:29:21,888 --> 01:29:23,165
Severus...

322
01:29:23,328 --> 01:29:27,867
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

323
01:29:28,032 --> 01:29:29,308
Brilliant, Snape.

324
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:33,695
You put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

325
01:29:33,888 --> 01:29:36,441
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

326
01:29:36,608 --> 01:29:41,398
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

327
01:29:41,567 --> 01:29:44,023
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

328
01:29:44,257 --> 01:29:45,750
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

329
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:48,255
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

330
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,838
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

331
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,749
I could do it, you know.

332
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:59,610
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

333
01:29:59,777 --> 01:30:02,361
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

334
01:30:02,529 --> 01:30:05,878
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

335
01:30:06,048 --> 01:30:11,231
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

336
01:30:11,456 --> 01:30:13,595
Severus, please.

337
01:30:14,592 --> 01:30:16,501
After you.

338
01:30:20,769 --> 01:30:22,426
Expelliarmus!

339
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,543
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

340
01:30:27,776 --> 01:30:30,231
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

341
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:31,994
We thought he was our friend!

342
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,030
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

343
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,267
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

344
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:41,147
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

345
01:30:41,344 --> 01:30:45,174
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

346
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,007
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

347
01:30:50,272 --> 01:30:53,273
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

348
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,829
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

349
01:30:56,001 --> 01:30:58,487
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

350
01:30:58,656 --> 01:31:01,503
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

351
01:31:01,695 --> 01:31:04,794
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

352
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,862
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

353
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:13,303
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

354
01:31:13,504 --> 01:31:14,519
Scabbers!

355
01:31:14,687 --> 01:31:17,622
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

356
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,956
Remus?

357
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,126
Sirius.

358
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:45,118
My old friends!

359
01:31:50,528 --> 01:31:54,206
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

360
01:31:54,368 --> 01:31:57,881
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

361
01:31:58,689 --> 01:32:01,209
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

362
01:32:01,409 --> 01:32:06,394
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

363
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,278
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

364
01:32:09,472 --> 01:32:11,993
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

365
01:32:12,353 --> 01:32:17,719
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

366
01:32:19,808 --> 01:32:22,078
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

367
01:32:22,272 --> 01:32:27,706
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

368
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:32,218
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

369
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:34,359
No!

370
01:32:35,809 --> 01:32:39,605
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

371
01:32:39,775 --> 01:32:41,598
But we'll take him to the castle.

372
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,615
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

373
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:50,014
I said we'd take you to the castle.

374
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:52,473
After that,
the dementors can have you.

375
01:32:56,256 --> 01:32:59,834
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

376
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,382
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

377
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:05,047
I was going for the rat.

378
01:33:05,217 --> 01:33:08,893
Normally, I have a very
sweet disposition as a dog.

379
01:33:09,056 --> 01:33:14,074
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

380
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:18,910
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

381
01:33:30,977 --> 01:33:32,406
Okay.

382
01:33:37,215 --> 01:33:39,637
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

383
01:33:39,807 --> 01:33:41,149
It's fine. I'll stay.

384
01:33:41,888 --> 01:33:43,798
You go, I'll stay.

385
01:33:44,095 --> 01:33:47,095
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

386
01:33:48,608 --> 01:33:51,478
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

387
01:33:51,648 --> 01:33:54,104
They might chop it.

388
01:33:54,559 --> 01:33:57,113
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

389
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:01,306
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

390
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:04,285
It's beautiful, isn't it?

391
01:34:05,088 --> 01:34:08,699
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

392
01:34:09,376 --> 01:34:12,409
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

393
01:34:14,463 --> 01:34:17,148
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

394
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:19,993
He doesn't deserve it.

395
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,193
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

396
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:24,822
...to become killers.

397
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:28,569
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

398
01:34:28,736 --> 01:34:31,005
Alive, you're free.

399
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,136
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

400
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:37,532
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

401
01:34:37,695 --> 01:34:40,084
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

402
01:34:40,256 --> 01:34:44,119
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

403
01:34:46,495 --> 01:34:48,317
I don't know if you know, Harry...

404
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,409
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

405
01:34:52,576 --> 01:34:54,431
I know.

406
01:34:55,552 --> 01:34:59,446
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

407
01:34:59,616 --> 01:35:02,005
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

408
01:35:02,176 --> 01:35:04,565
What? Come and live with you?

409
01:35:05,824 --> 01:35:08,825
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

410
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:10,682
Harry!

411
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:28,857
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

412
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:35,229
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

413
01:35:36,544 --> 01:35:38,453
This flesh is only flesh!

414
01:35:39,551 --> 01:35:41,559
Expelliarmus!

415
01:35:51,232 --> 01:35:52,727
Harry!

416
01:35:53,759 --> 01:35:56,608
Remus! Remus!

417
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,796
Run! Run!

418
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:16,343
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

419
01:36:16,512 --> 01:36:21,401
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

420
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:23,706
Professor?

421
01:36:27,647 --> 01:36:29,110
Professor Lupin?

422
01:36:36,577 --> 01:36:39,674
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

423
01:36:40,096 --> 01:36:42,518
There you are, Potter!

424
01:37:14,943 --> 01:37:15,925
Sirius!

425
01:37:16,737 --> 01:37:19,038
Come back here, Potter!

426
01:38:22,176 --> 01:38:23,518
Sirius!

427
01:38:24,288 --> 01:38:27,135
No. Sirius!

428
01:39:07,296 --> 01:39:10,045
Expecto Patronum!

429
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:19,677
Harry?

430
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,844
I saw my dad.

431
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:24,533
What?

432
01:41:24,735 --> 01:41:26,196
He sent the dementors away.

433
01:41:26,368 --> 01:41:27,709
I saw him across the lake.

434
01:41:27,903 --> 01:41:29,464
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

435
01:41:29,695 --> 01:41:32,412
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

436
01:41:32,575 --> 01:41:34,964
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

437
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:36,923
Much worse.

438
01:41:37,088 --> 01:41:39,357
They're going to suck out his soul.

439
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,333
Headmaster, stop them.

440
01:41:42,495 --> 01:41:45,724
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

441
01:41:45,887 --> 01:41:47,992
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

442
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,501
He's my rat, sir.

443
01:41:49,887 --> 01:41:53,533
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

444
01:41:53,727 --> 01:41:57,240
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

445
01:41:57,439 --> 01:41:59,828
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

446
01:42:00,064 --> 01:42:05,246
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

447
01:42:08,224 --> 01:42:10,874
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

448
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,651
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

449
01:42:19,647 --> 01:42:22,070
Mysterious thing, time.

450
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,475
Powerful...

451
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,421
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

452
01:42:28,928 --> 01:42:32,408
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

453
01:42:33,184 --> 01:42:35,191
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

454
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,083
You must not be seen.

455
01:42:37,247 --> 01:42:40,760
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

456
01:42:40,928 --> 01:42:44,311
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

457
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,554
If you succeed tonight...

458
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:49,437
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

459
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,337
Three turns should do it, I think.

460
01:42:58,015 --> 01:42:59,772
Oh, and by the way.

461
01:42:59,936 --> 01:43:05,532
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

462
01:43:05,696 --> 01:43:07,669
Good luck.

463
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:10,527
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

464
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:13,404
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

465
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:42,741
What just happened?

466
01:43:42,911 --> 01:43:45,115
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

467
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:47,068
Where were we at 7:30?

468
01:43:47,231 --> 01:43:48,954
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

469
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,421
Come on. And we can't be seen.

470
01:43:52,447 --> 01:43:54,203
Hermione!

471
01:44:11,648 --> 01:44:14,201
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

472
01:44:15,935 --> 01:44:19,350
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

473
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:22,268
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

474
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:23,709
That's us.

475
01:44:23,935 --> 01:44:26,717
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

476
01:44:26,943 --> 01:44:28,317
This is not normal.

477
01:44:30,527 --> 01:44:32,797
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

478
01:44:32,959 --> 01:44:35,064
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

479
01:44:35,232 --> 01:44:38,460
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

480
01:44:38,655 --> 01:44:41,721
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

481
01:44:41,887 --> 01:44:45,116
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

482
01:44:47,328 --> 01:44:50,361
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

483
01:44:53,376 --> 01:44:54,652
Good punch.

484
01:44:54,816 --> 01:44:56,245
Thanks.

485
01:44:57,215 --> 01:44:58,808
Malfoy's coming.

486
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,916
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

487
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:05,301
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

488
01:45:05,471 --> 01:45:09,246
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

489
01:45:10,559 --> 01:45:13,048
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

490
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:33,846
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

491
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,054
Of course.

492
01:45:37,214 --> 01:45:39,124
Remember what Dumbledore said?

493
01:45:39,295 --> 01:45:43,157
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

494
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,797
Let's go.

495
01:46:05,215 --> 01:46:07,223
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

496
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:09,780
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

497
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:12,318
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

498
01:46:13,312 --> 01:46:15,613
Scabbers, you're alive!

499
01:46:15,775 --> 01:46:18,425
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

500
01:46:18,655 --> 01:46:21,438
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

501
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,468
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

502
01:46:28,192 --> 01:46:30,809
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

503
01:46:30,974 --> 01:46:33,691
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

504
01:46:33,855 --> 01:46:36,604
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

505
01:46:36,767 --> 01:46:38,939
We can't be seen.

506
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,737
Fudge is coming.

507
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,614
And we aren't leaving?

508
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:50,198
Why aren't we leaving?

509
01:47:00,672 --> 01:47:02,165
Are you mad?

510
01:47:07,936 --> 01:47:09,244
That hurt.

511
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,716
Sorry.

512
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,273
We're coming out the back door. Go!

513
01:47:49,984 --> 01:47:52,666
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

514
01:47:54,654 --> 01:47:55,931
What?

515
01:47:56,767 --> 01:47:58,523
I thought I just saw...

516
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:01,272
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

517
01:48:15,008 --> 01:48:17,211
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

518
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,086
Get away. Get off.

519
01:48:46,367 --> 01:48:49,629
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

520
01:48:50,463 --> 01:48:53,463
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

521
01:48:53,695 --> 01:48:57,307
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

522
01:49:01,599 --> 01:49:04,184
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

523
01:49:06,494 --> 01:49:10,140
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

524
01:49:10,912 --> 01:49:14,074
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

525
01:49:14,463 --> 01:49:16,088
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

526
01:49:18,687 --> 01:49:21,534
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

527
01:49:21,728 --> 01:49:23,931
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

528
01:49:26,463 --> 01:49:30,772
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

529
01:49:30,976 --> 01:49:32,569
- Now, look there.
- Where?

530
01:49:32,767 --> 01:49:35,996
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

531
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:39,507
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

532
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,397
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

533
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,077
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

534
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:47,351
- Over there.
- Where?

535
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,210
- Over there.
- This way.

536
01:49:49,406 --> 01:49:51,959
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

537
01:49:53,567 --> 01:49:55,193
But where is it?

538
01:49:56,095 --> 01:49:58,200
I saw the beast, just now.

539
01:49:58,815 --> 01:50:00,921
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

540
01:50:01,087 --> 01:50:02,363
Buckbeak.

541
01:50:02,559 --> 01:50:06,488
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

542
01:50:06,656 --> 01:50:07,932
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

543
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:12,187
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

544
01:50:12,415 --> 01:50:15,133
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

545
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,083
- Right.
- Well, well...

546
01:50:17,246 --> 01:50:18,708
We must search the grounds.

547
01:50:18,879 --> 01:50:21,782
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

548
01:50:21,951 --> 01:50:27,166
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

549
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:31,156
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

550
01:50:31,328 --> 01:50:33,117
Thank you.

551
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:36,475
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

552
01:50:46,815 --> 01:50:48,244
- Come on.
- This way.

553
01:50:54,782 --> 01:50:56,473
This way, now.

554
01:50:58,814 --> 01:51:00,472
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

555
01:51:00,672 --> 01:51:03,060
- How?
- No idea.

556
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:14,269
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

557
01:51:20,446 --> 01:51:22,356
And Snape's coming.

558
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:29,912
And now we wait.

559
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:32,794
And now we wait.

560
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:02,362
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

561
01:52:05,055 --> 01:52:06,745
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

562
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:11,068
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

563
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:13,270
...I did see someone.

564
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:16,735
That someone
made the dementors go away.

565
01:52:16,894 --> 01:52:18,171
With a Patronus.

566
01:52:18,336 --> 01:52:20,157
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

567
01:52:20,318 --> 01:52:21,725
According to him...

568
01:52:21,886 --> 01:52:25,148
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

569
01:52:25,311 --> 01:52:27,133
It was my dad.

570
01:52:28,191 --> 01:52:29,914
My dad conjured the Patronus.

571
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:32,250
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

572
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,835
I'm just telling you what I saw.

573
01:52:39,807 --> 01:52:41,368
Here we come.

574
01:52:46,814 --> 01:52:49,084
You see Sirius talking to me there?

575
01:52:49,248 --> 01:52:52,061
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

576
01:52:52,222 --> 01:52:55,322
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

577
01:52:55,486 --> 01:52:57,046
It'll just be me and him.

578
01:52:57,695 --> 01:52:59,550
We could live in the country...

579
01:52:59,712 --> 01:53:02,231
...someplace you can see the sky.

580
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,116
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

581
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:07,605
Harry!

582
01:53:09,087 --> 01:53:10,713
Run!

583
01:53:17,344 --> 01:53:18,805
Let's go.

584
01:53:37,568 --> 01:53:39,804
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

585
01:53:43,872 --> 01:53:45,212
Thanks.

586
01:53:46,974 --> 01:53:50,836
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

587
01:55:02,879 --> 01:55:04,569
That was so scary.

588
01:55:04,734 --> 01:55:07,550
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

589
01:55:18,526 --> 01:55:21,526
Sirius. Come on!

590
01:55:36,894 --> 01:55:38,903
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

591
01:55:39,071 --> 01:55:42,169
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

592
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,282
Any minute now.

593
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:54,421
Right there. You'll see.

594
01:55:55,775 --> 01:55:58,163
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

595
01:55:58,334 --> 01:56:00,755
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

596
01:56:04,734 --> 01:56:07,070
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

597
01:56:09,055 --> 01:56:10,844
...both of you.

598
01:56:12,831 --> 01:56:14,489
Harry!

599
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:20,029
Expecto Patronum!

600
01:57:16,254 --> 01:57:17,748
You were right, Hermione.

601
01:57:17,919 --> 01:57:21,114
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

602
01:57:21,278 --> 01:57:23,929
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

603
01:57:24,094 --> 01:57:26,363
I knew I could do it
this time because...

604
01:57:26,526 --> 01:57:28,152
...well, I had already done it.

605
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,686
- Does that make sense?
- No.

606
01:57:30,848 --> 01:57:33,564
But I don't like flying...!

607
01:57:46,175 --> 01:57:47,450
Bombarda!

608
01:58:19,391 --> 01:58:22,074
I'll be forever grateful for this...

609
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:23,514
...to both of you.

610
01:58:23,678 --> 01:58:26,494
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

611
01:58:26,654 --> 01:58:29,436
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

612
01:58:29,598 --> 01:58:31,290
And besides...

613
01:58:32,158 --> 01:58:35,323
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

614
01:58:35,487 --> 01:58:37,526
And you know it.

615
01:58:38,558 --> 01:58:40,380
And for now, that will do.

616
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:45,047
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

617
01:58:46,014 --> 01:58:48,436
...but you look so like your father.

618
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:51,998
Except your eyes.

619
01:58:52,926 --> 01:58:55,131
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

620
01:58:56,990 --> 01:59:01,880
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

621
01:59:02,462 --> 01:59:03,892
But know this:

622
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:07,992
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

623
01:59:09,311 --> 01:59:11,198
And you can always find them...

624
01:59:13,502 --> 01:59:15,291
...in here.

625
01:59:25,247 --> 01:59:27,667
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

626
01:59:53,407 --> 01:59:54,967
We have to go.

627
02:00:22,078 --> 02:00:24,631
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

628
02:00:24,799 --> 02:00:26,260
Did what?

629
02:00:26,462 --> 02:00:28,317
Good night.

630
02:00:36,734 --> 02:00:38,010
How did you get there?

631
02:00:38,174 --> 02:00:40,728
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

632
02:00:41,055 --> 02:00:43,543
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

633
02:00:43,742 --> 02:00:47,125
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

634
02:01:12,542 --> 02:01:13,971
Hello, Harry.

635
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:19,194
I saw you coming.

636
02:01:23,582 --> 02:01:26,167
I've looked worse, believe me.

637
02:01:28,766 --> 02:01:31,800
- You've been sacked.
- No.

638
02:01:31,967 --> 02:01:34,813
No. I resigned, actually.

639
02:01:34,974 --> 02:01:36,666
Resigned? Why?

640
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:41,916
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

641
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:47,349
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

642
02:01:47,518 --> 02:01:50,747
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

643
02:01:50,974 --> 02:01:52,796
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

644
02:01:52,958 --> 02:01:54,748
...risked enough on my behalf.

645
02:01:54,911 --> 02:01:58,042
Besides, people like me are...

646
02:01:58,654 --> 02:02:01,850
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

647
02:02:11,007 --> 02:02:13,462
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

648
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:15,703
None of it made any difference.

649
02:02:15,902 --> 02:02:19,286
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

650
02:02:19,454 --> 02:02:22,802
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

651
02:02:22,975 --> 02:02:25,363
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

652
02:02:25,726 --> 02:02:28,115
It made a great deal of difference.

653
02:02:32,574 --> 02:02:34,680
If I am proud of anything...

654
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:37,399
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

655
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:40,184
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

656
02:02:40,383 --> 02:02:44,440
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

657
02:02:45,311 --> 02:02:47,699
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

658
02:02:47,871 --> 02:02:50,358
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

659
02:02:50,878 --> 02:02:52,155
Until then...

660
02:02:53,438 --> 02:02:55,064
...mischief managed.

661
02:03:27,935 --> 02:03:31,961
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

662
02:03:32,126 --> 02:03:33,467
Harry.

663
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:35,612
Wherever did you get it?

664
02:03:35,775 --> 02:03:38,076
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

665
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:40,311
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

666
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:43,642
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

667
02:03:43,806 --> 02:03:46,195
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

668
02:03:46,365 --> 02:03:47,794
Did not.

669
02:03:49,118 --> 02:03:52,468
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

670
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:54,099
For me?

671
02:03:54,302 --> 02:03:56,723
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

672
02:03:56,894 --> 02:03:58,716
This came with it.

673
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:04,952
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

674
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:06,875
How fast is it, Harry?

675
02:04:25,438 --> 02:04:26,999
Lumos.

676
02:04:27,167 --> 02:04:29,468
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

677
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:22,553
Mischief managed.

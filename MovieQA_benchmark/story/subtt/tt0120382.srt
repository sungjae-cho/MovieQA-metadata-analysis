00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
out of seahaven.

188
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,900
Off this island. Out.

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Out of your job?

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
What the hell's wrong
with your job?

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
You have a great job,
Truman.

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
You have a desk job.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
I'd kill for a desk job.

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Here you go.

195
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,100
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

196
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,900
No, thanks.

197
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Now, there's excitement.

198
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
[Both laugh]

199
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't you ever
get antsy?

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
Itchy feet?

201
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,600
Where's there to go?

202
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Fiji.

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
[Laughs]

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
Where the hell's Fiji?

205
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Near Florida?

206
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Hmm.

207
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,900
See here?

208
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,800
Yeah.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
This is us...

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
And all the way
around here...

211
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
Fiji.

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
You can't get
any further away

213
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,400
before you start
coming back.

214
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
You know, there are
still islands in Fiji

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
where no human being
has ever set foot.

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
Whoo.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,700
So, when are you
going to go?

218
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,400
It's not that simple.

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
It takes...

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Money,

221
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
planning.

222
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,700
I can't just up and go.

223
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,900
Right.

224
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm going to do it.

225
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't worry about that.

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Bonus time is just
around the corner.

227
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,300
Hmm.

228
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
Hey, you coming
for a drink?

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
No. I can't tonight.

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,600
I don't like the look
of that weather, son.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I think we should
head back.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
Oh, no, dad.
Not yet.

233
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,400
No, come on.
We should go back.

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
A bit farther.
Listen--

235
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,500
please?

236
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,000
Ok.

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes.

238
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,900
[Thunder]

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,300
Daddy!

240
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
[Thunder]

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Ohh!

242
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
Oh

244
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
[thunder]

245
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

246
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,000
I figure if we can
scrape together 8,000--

247
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
every time you and marlon
get together--

248
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
we can bum around the world
for a year on that.

249
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,000
And then what, Truman?

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
We'd be where we were
5 years ago.

251
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,400
You're talking
like a teenager.

252
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,300
Well, maybe I feel
like a teenager.

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
We have mortgage payments,
Truman.

254
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,000
We have car payments.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What, we're just going
to walk away

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
from our financial
obligations?

257
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,700
It would be
an adventure.

258
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I thought we were going
to try for a baby.

259
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Isn't that enough
of an adventure?

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,500
That can wait.

261
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,000
I want to get away--

262
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
see some of the world,

263
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,500
explore.

264
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,500
Honey, you want to be
an explorer?

265
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
This'll pass.

266
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,500
We all think like this
now and then.

267
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Let's get you out of
these wet clothes, hmm?

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,100
Come to bed.

269
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
You never
see anything anyway.

270
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,300
They always...

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,300
Turn the camera
and play music and...

272
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
You know,
the wind blows in,

273
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,700
and the curtains move,

274
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,600
and you don't
see anything.

275
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
Dog fancy, please.

276
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
Dog fancy.

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you.

278
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,500
[Dog barks]

279
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Paper, Earl, please.

280
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,500
Paper.

281
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,400
Oh...

282
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I might as well
pick one of these up.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
For the wife?

284
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,500
She's got to have them.

285
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,400
Anything else, Truman?

286
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
That's the whole
ball of wax.

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Catch you later.

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Ok.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Dad?

290
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,200
Ohh!

291
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,600
Hey, what are you
doing?

292
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Hey! What the--

293
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
get out of the way!

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Stop them!

295
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
Ohh!

296
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Stop those people!

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
Stop! Stop!

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Hey! Open the doors!

299
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Somebody
stop the bus!

300
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,200
Stop the bus!

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,900
Somebody stop it!

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Somebody stop the bus!

303
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,600
Stop the bus!

304
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Aah!

305
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
It doesn't sound insane
at all, Truman.

306
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,100
I see him 10 times a week

307
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,600
in a hundred
different faces.

308
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,600
I almost hugged
a perfect stranger

309
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,200
in the salon
last Thursday.

310
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,700
It was dad.

311
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,800
I swear. Dressed like
a homeless man.

312
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
And you know what else
was strange?

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

314
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,800
came out of nowhere

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
and forced him
onto a bus.

316
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,600
Well, it's about time

317
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,900
they cleaned up
the trash downtown

318
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,800
before we become just like
the rest of the country.

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
They never found
dad's body.

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,300
Maybe somehow--
oh, God.

321
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm telling you,
if it wasn't him,

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
it was his twin.

323
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,200
Did dad have
a brother?

324
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,100
Truman, you know
perfectly well

325
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,700
that your father
was an only child,

326
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
just like you.

327
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, sweetie...

into that storm.

blamed you, Truman...

You really shouldn't
upset her like that.

Did you want--
what did you want?

344

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,700
You really ought
to throw out that mower.

elk rotaries.

See, they
got rid of her,

353

but they couldn't erase
the memory.

556
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,400
and we've still got
some great music up ahead,

557
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,700
but hey,
don't forget to buckle up.

558
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

559
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,700
A safe driver is what?
Yes.

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,900
[Turns radio off]

561
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,500
Morning, ma'am.

562
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,100
[Electrical buzzing]

563
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,100
I love that idea.

564
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
It's pretty cool,
isn't it?

565
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, I love it.

566
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,400
[Speaking spanish]

567
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,700
[Ding]

568
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,500
Can I help?

569
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,900
Yeah. I have
an appointment

570
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
at gable
enterprises.

571
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
That's impossible.

572
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,900
What's happening?

573
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,000
Guard: Nothing.

574
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,500
Just tell me
what's happening.

575
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,400
Got to go, sir.
We're remodeling.

576
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,000
No, you're not.

577
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,700
What are those people
doing back there?

578
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,500
It's none of
your business.

579
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,400
If you don't tell me what's
happening, I'll report you!

580
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,000
You're trespassing.

581
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Right.

582
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,700
Marlon!

583
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Truman.

584
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,400
What are you
doing here?

585
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,500
[Whispering]
I gotta talk to you.

586
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,000
It's a bad time, ok?
I'm way behind.

587
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm onto something, marlon.
Something big.

588
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,300
You ok?
You look like shit.

589
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I think I'm mixed up
in something.

590
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,000
Mixed up in what?

591
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
There's no point
trying to explain it,

592
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

593
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,700
[Stammering]

594
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
The people on the elevator.

595
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
There was
no backing on it.

596
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
I looked out.
There was people there.

597
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,700
And on the radio
on the way to work,

598
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
it starts
following me along,

599
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,100
talking about everything
that I'm doing.

600
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,800
You know what I mean?

601
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Truman, look, this is
one of your fantasies.

602
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,700
I think
this is about my dad.

603
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Your dad?

604
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,900
I think he's alive.

605
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah. I'll tell you
about it later.

606
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm definitely
being followed.

607
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
Who?

608
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
It's hard to tell.

609
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,800
They look just like
regular people.

610
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
How about those two?

611
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Truman: I don't know.

612
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Could be.

613
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
It's when I'm unpredictable,
that's--they can't...

614
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,800
Did anything happen?

615
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,200
No.

616
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,500
Mm-hmm. We gotta
get out of here.

617
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,200
You ready to go?

618
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,700
No. I just
came here. Come on.

619
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
I told you I can't.

620
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
[Growls]

621
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,100
You're gonna get both our asses
fired. You know that.

622
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
Ok, man,
let's do it.

623
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,600
What?
Whatever you say.

624
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm game.

625
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
Marlon: What are you
talking about?

626
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Yes, siree. Your birthday
comes but once a year.

627
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,500
Truman: Maybe I'm being
set up for something.

628
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,500
You ever think
about that, marlon?

629
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,500
Like your whole life

630
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,100
has been building
towards something?

631
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,600
Mmm, no.

632
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
When you were
hauling chickens

633
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,400
in the summer
for kaiser,

634
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
what was
the furthest

635
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
you ever got
off the island?

636
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
Went all over.

637
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,600
Never found a place
like this, though.

638
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Look at that sunset,
Truman.

639
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,500
It's perfect.

640
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,600
Yeah.

641
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,900
That's the big guy.

642
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
Quite a paintbrush
he's got.

643
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,900
Yup.

644
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Just between you
and me, marlon...

645
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,700
I'm going away
for a while.

646
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
Really?

647
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,400
Yeah.

648
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,300
Mother: Oh, little angel.

649
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
[Women laugh]

650
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,300
Oh, my little clown.

651
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Old carrot top.

652
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
The best photos.

653
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,100
Ohh.
Ohh.

654
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
We should be getting you
home, mother.

655
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,000
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at mount rushmore.

656
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Do you remember, Truman,
when dad was still with us?

657
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
That was quite a drive.

658
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,300
You slept
the whole way there.

659
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Truman:
It looks so small.

660
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,100
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

661
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,900
Oh, look, Truman.

662
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,800
The happiest day
of our lives.

663
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, look.

664
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,100
Jean, Jodie, joanne.

665
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Doesn't she look
beautiful, Truman?

666
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
Well, she still does.

667
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,100
And there's lots of pages
left over for baby photos.

668
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
I would like to hold
a grandchild in my arms

669
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:54,900
before I go.

670
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,400
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

671
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,100
I'll take her.

672
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
No, no, no.
You stay, relax.

673
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Enjoy yourself.

674
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Your favorite show
will be coming on.

675
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Besides, we have
something to discuss.

676
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,900
A certain person's
birthday.

677
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
Oh, I see.

another episode

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,000
of I love Lucy
same time tomorrow.

680
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,400
But right now it's time
for golden oldies.

681
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,400
Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic

682
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,500
show me the way to go home.

683
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
A hymn of praise
to small-town life,

684
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
where we learn that you don't
have to leave home

685
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,500
to discover
what the world's all about,

686
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,600
and that no one is poor
who has friends.

687
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,700
Full of laughter and love,
pain and sadness,

688
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
but ultimately redemption,

689
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
we share the trials
and tribulations

690
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,600
of the abbott family.

691
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Note the touching performance of
Ronald brierly as Uncle buddy.

692
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,800
And that scene with the bowl
of cherries is gonna have you

693
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.

694
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,900
And there'll be tears, too,

695
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,000
when David and Jennifer
are reunited.

696
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,100
But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts

697
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,700
in Camden village.

698

[Radio static]

700
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh.

701
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,100
Thank you, sweetie.

702
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
I need to talk to you,

703
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,100
but let's go outside.

704
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Oh, sweetie, I'd love to,
but I'm really late.

705

What's your rush?

706
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Surgery.

707
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,200
There was that elevator
disaster downtown.

708
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,700
It was on the news
last night.

709
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
This cable just snapped.
This elevator,

710
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,300
it just plummeted down
10 flights.

711
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,400
The non-union workers.

712
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Just monsters.
You know, that building,

713
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,100
it's right next door
to where you work.

714
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,200
Can you imagine if you
had been in there?

715
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,100
It's not even worth
thinking about.

716
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,100
Anyway,
I have an amputation

717
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,300
on one of the young
women in that elevator.

718

It's very sad.

for you.

Oh, uh...

Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
nurse Burbank.

727

It's very important.

728

I'm afraid that
that's not possible.

Can you pass along a message?

I'll try.

734
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,300
Can you tell her
I had to go to Fiji

when I get there?

When you--
when you get to Fiji?

737
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,900
You got it.

Fine. I'll tell her.

going to be pretty.

Beautiful job.

00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
I'll just let someone else
tidy up here.

How can I help?

757
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,500
I would like to book
a flight to Fiji.

to leave?

I don't have anything
for at least a month.

A month?

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,500
It's the busy season.

00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,300
You want to book the flight?

768
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
It doesn't matter.

769
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,500

I'm sorry, son.

His father was from
Chicago, wasn't he?

789
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,700
No. His dentist
was from pensacola.

His father
was from des moines.

791

to go to Chicago?

He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

So why would you want
to go there?

00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,600
Because I never have.

01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,300
Coming to you now
from seahaven island,

1095
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,500
enclosed in the largest
studio ever constructed,

1096
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,800
and along with
the great wall of China,

1097
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,200
one of only 2 manmade structures
visible from space,

1098
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,200
now in its 30th great year,

1099
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,500
it's...

1100
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,100
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you--

1101
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,900
I was on pins and needles
the entire time.

1102
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
Hello and good evening.
I'm your host Mike michaelson,

1103
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,900
and welcome to tru-talk,

1104
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,800
our forum for issues
growing out of the show.

1105
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,900
But tonight,
something very special indeed,

1106
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,200
a rare and
exclusive interview

1107
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,700
with the show's
conceiver and creator.

1108
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,000
So, come with us now as we
go live to the lunar room

1109
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,200
on the 221st floor
of the Omni cam echosphere,

1110
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,900
where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary--

1111
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,300
the designer and architect
of the world within a world

1112
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,300
that is seahaven island--
christof.

1113
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,000
Before we begin,
I'd like to thank you

1114
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,700
on behalf of our audience
for granting this interview.

1115
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,700
We know how demanding
your schedule is,

1116
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,000
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.

1117
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,600
This, sir,
is indeed an honor.

1118
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,300
Don't mention it.

1119
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,700
Well, the catalyst for
the recent dramatic events

1120
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,800
on the show has been
Truman's father, kirk,

1121
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,300
and his attempts
to infiltrate the show.

1122
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,700
But before we get into that,
I think it's worth noting

1123
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,100
that this is not the first time
someone from the outside

1124
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,500
has attempted
to reach Truman, is it?

1125
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,100
Christof: We have had
close calls in the past.

1126
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,000
Man: Truman!
It's television!

1127
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,400
Yes!

1128
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,100
Yes! I did it!

1129
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
I'm on the Truman show!

1130
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,200
Mike: But there's never
been anything to compare

1131
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,800
with this most recent
breach in security--

1132
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
the first intruder to be
a former cast member.

1133
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,100
A dead one at that.

1134
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,300
Gotta say, writing kirk
back in--masterstroke.

1135
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,100
Since kirk started this
crisis in Truman's life,

1136
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,200
I came to the conclusion
that only he could end it.

1137
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
Truman! Truman! No!

1138
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,300
[Construction noises]

1139
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,400
That's off limits!

1140
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
Why? What's
over there?

1141
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,700
Nothing. It's dangerous.
That's all.

1142
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,600
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

1143
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
Mike: But let's remind
viewers exactly why

1144
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,600
dad was written out
in the first place.

1145
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,600
Christof: As Truman grew up,
we were forced

1146
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
to manufacture ways
to keep him on the island.

1147
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,900
I'd like to be
an explorer,

1148
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,600
like the great
Magellan.

1149
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,300
You're too late.

1150
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,300
There's really
nothing left to explore.

1151
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,800
[Snarling]

1152
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,500
Christof: Finally, I came up
with kirk's drowning.

1153
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,200
Mike: Most effective.

1154
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,100
Truman's been terrified
of the water ever since.

1155
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,400
Christof: When kirk read
the synopsis of the episode,

1156
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,300
he was disappointed
to say the least.

1157
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,000
Jesus!

1158
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,300
I'm sure that's what caused
him to break onto the set.

1159
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,700
But how do you intend to
explain his 22-year absence?

1160
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,600
Amnesia.

1161
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,800
Brilliant. Let's take
some viewer phone calls.

1162
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,400
Charlotte, north Carolina,
you're on with christof.

1163
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,500
Man: Uh, yeah,
hi, christof.

1164
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,800
I was wondering how many
cameras you got in that town.

1165
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,400
Somewhere in
the vicinity of 5,000.

1166
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,100
Man: That's
a lot of cameras.

1167
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,100
Remember, we started
with just one.

1168
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,900
He was curious
from birth.

1169
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,900
Premature by 2 weeks.

1170
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,800
Almost as if he couldn't
wait to get started.

1171
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Mike: His eagerness
to leave his mother's womb

1172
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,700
was the very reason
he was the one selected.

1173
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,500
In competition with 5 other
unwanted pregnancies,

1174
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,700
the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,

1175
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,600
Truman was the one
who arrived on cue.

1176
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,000
Mike: Incidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child

1177
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,200
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.

1178
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
That's correct.

1179
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,600
The show has generated
enormous revenues now,

1180
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,100
equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.

1181
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,200
People forget it takes
the population

1182
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
of an entire country to
keep the show running.

1183
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,800
Since the show is on
24-hours a day

1184
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,300
without commercial interruption,
all those staggering revenues

1185
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,900
are generated
by product placement.

1186
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,400
That's true. Everything
on the show is for sale.

1187
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,000
From the actor's wardrobe,
food products,

1188
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,100
to the very homes
they live in.

1189
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,400
Mike: And all of it available
in the Truman catalog.

1190
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,900
Operators are standing by.

1191
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,700
Christof, let me ask you,

1192
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,900
why do you think Truman
has never come close

1193
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,300
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?

1194
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,500
We accept the reality
of the world

1195
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,600
with which we are
presented.

1196
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,900
It's as simple as that.

1197
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,800
The hague for christof.

1198
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,500
Hello? The hague?

1199
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,600
All right,
we've lost that call.

1200
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,800
Let's go to Hollywood.
You're on tru-talk.

1201
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,600
Hi, christof. I'd just
like to say one thing.

1202
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,100
You're a liar
and a manipulator,

1203
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,200
and what you've done
to Truman is sick!

1204
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,300
Well, we remember
this voice, don't we?

1205
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,700
How could we forget?

1206
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,200
Mike: Let's go
to another call.

1207
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,100
No, no, no.
It's fine, Mike.

1208
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,700
I love to reminisce with
former members of the cast.

1209
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,900
Sylvia...

1210
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,200
As you announced so
melodramatically to the world,

1211
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,700
you think because you batted
your eyes at Truman once...

1212
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,900
Flirted with him...

1213
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,400
Stole a few minutes
of air time with him...

1214
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,900
To thrust yourself and your
politics into the limelight...

1215
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,900
That you know him?

1216
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,900
That you know
what's right for him?

1217
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,200
You really think you're
in a position to judge him?

1218
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,300
What right do you have
to take a baby

1219
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,400
and turn his life into
some kind of mockery?

1220
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,200
Don't you ever
feel guilty?

1221
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,100
I have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.

1222
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
The world...

1223
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,000
The place you live in...

1224
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,700
Is the sick place.

1225
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,300
Seahaven's the way
the world should be.

1226
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
He's not a performer.
He's a prisoner.

1227
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,500
Look at him! Look at
what you've done to him!

1228
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
He can leave at any time.

1229
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,400
If his was more
than just a vague ambition,

1230
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,700
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,

1231
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
there's no way
we could prevent him.

1232
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I think what distresses
you really, caller,

1233
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
is that ultimately...

1234
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,200
Truman prefers his cell,
as you call it.

1235
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,500
That's where
you're wrong.

1236
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,700
You're so wrong, and
he'll prove you wrong.

1237
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,500
Mike: Well, aside from
the heated comments

1238
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,400
of a very
vocal minority,

1239
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,100
it's been an overwhelmingly
positive experience.

1240
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,600
Yes. For Truman and
for the viewing public.

1241
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,500
Well, christof,
I can't thank you enough

1242
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,300
for giving so generously
of your time tonight.

1243
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,700
I think it's safe to say now
that this crisis is behind us

1244
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,300
and Truman is back
to his old self,

1245
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,000
we can look forward to some
exciting new developments?

1246
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,800
Well, Mike, the big news

1247
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
is that Meryl
will be leaving Truman

1248
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,700
in an upcoming episode,

1249
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,900
and a new romantic interest
will be introduced.

1250
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,400
Mike: Aha.

1251
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm determined television's
first on-air conception

1252
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,400
will still take place.

1253
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Well, another television
milestone straight ahead.

1254
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,500
You heard it here first.

1255
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,900
It has been a singular honor
and pleasure, sir.

1256
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,600
Christof...Thank you.

1257
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,300
Thank you, Mike.

[Birds chirping]

1259
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,500
Hey, simeon.
What?

1260
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,000
Is he looking at us?

1261
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,000

1441
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,500
Go find him, pluto.

1442
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,200
Good dog! Good dog!

1443
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,300
All this fuss.

1444
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,200
If he could just
hear my voice.

1445
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,200
Truman!

1446
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,900
Truman!

1447
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,700
Let me try.

1448
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,300
Truman!

1449
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,000
It's me! Dad!

1450
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,100
Let's talk!

1451
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,300
Yeah, I know.

1452
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,700
Just about done
with the square.

1453
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

1454
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,100
He's got to be in there.

1455
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,600
Simeon:
Barrymore, huh?

1456
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,000
Uh-huh.

1457
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,100
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

1458
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:32,700
I don't know.

1459
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,200
Send somebody
over there, ok?

1460
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,800
All right.

1461
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,700
Take another man and get
down there now, all right?

1462
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,800
I don't give a damn. Just
find the son of a bitch.

1463
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Get some batteries. This guy's
not gonna glow in the dark.

1464
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:47,800
Just get 'em down here.

1465
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,100
I don't know what's going
on. Reroute it back to me.

1466
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,000
We need more light.

1467
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,900
We'll never find him
this way.

1468
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,300
What time is it?

1469
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,200
It's way too early
for that.

1470
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,100
Cue the sun.

1471
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,600
[People gasp]

1472
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,400
Jeez!

1473
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,700
What time is it?

1474
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,700
Christof,
what's going on?

1475
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,300
Did you know that there's
a rumor circulating

1476
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,600
that he's dead?
You hear me?

1477
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,300
The media is having
a feeding frenzy over this.

1478
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,900
All the phone lines
are jammed,

1479
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,900
and every network has
a pirated shot of marlon

1480
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,500
making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

1481
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,800
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

1482
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,700
Why? We're getting higher
ratings with this graphic

1483
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,700
than we've ever had
on this show.

1484
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:45,900
No sign of him.

1485
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,000
Why don't you head back
to town and join the others?

1486
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,100
Everyone else is
at first positions, ok?

1487
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,900
Thank you.

1488
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,000
Everyone's at first
positions, right?

1489
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,700
Simeon:
We've got the light.

1490
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,700
So he's got to
be there somewhere.

1491
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,200
We're not
watching the sea.

1492
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,500
Simeon: Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

1493
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,200
Sweep the harbor.

1494
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,100
Bring up the harbor cameras.

1495
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,900
Shift all harbor cameras
to computer, please.

1496
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,600
Some of those are out,
aren't they?

1497
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,000
Operator: Yeah.
We have 4 of them down,

1498
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,300
but we have
the lighthouse cameras up.

1499
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,800
All buoy cams, please.

1500
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,600
Moses:
What's happening?

1501
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,700
Operator: Ok. Long lens,
short base cameras.

1502
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,400
Moses: Why are we
looking at the water?

1503
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,400
Operator: Pan it,
will you, please?

1504
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,900
Truman...

1505
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,400
Where are you going?

1506
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
How can he sail?
He's in insurance.

1507
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,200
Operator: Isn't he
terrified of the water?

1508
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,200
Resume transmission.

1509
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,900
Resuming transmission.

1510
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,800
I got 2 to 1
he doesn't make it.

1511
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,900
Man: Hey, I want
a piece of that.

1512
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,900
2 to 1
he doesn't make it.

1513
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,500
[Key tapping]

1514
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,000
Just leave 'em
in the car.

1515
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,500
Shh.

1516
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,800
Let's get off
this mast shot.

1517
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,400
We can't see his face.
Go to the cabin cam.

1518
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,900
Cabin cam.

1519
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,000
There. Perfect.

1520
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,700
That's our hero shot.

1521
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,400
Let's get another boat
out there.

1522
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,400
Ok. Listen, Gus, I need you to
talk to the guys on the ferry.

1523
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1524
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,900
[Grinding]

1525
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,100
Gus: Come on.

1526
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,200
I'm just a bus driver.

1527
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,300
Bottom line is,
they can't drive the boat.

1528
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,900
They're actors.

1529
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,000
How do we stop him?

1530
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,500
Ok, uh...

1531
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,200
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1532
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,800
So hold on to your hats.

1533
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,300
You got that?

1534
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,600
No. I think we're gonna
want to localize the storm

1535
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,900
over the boat.

1536
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,900
You can get
the coordinates for that.

1537
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,900
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1538
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,000
He'll turn back.
He'll be too afraid.

1539
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,300
[Whispering]

1540
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,000
There she blows.

[Motor stalling]

1542
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,800
Come on.

1543
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,400
Give me some lightning.

Again!

1546
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,100
Hit him again!

1547
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,600
For God's sake, christof,
the whole world is watching.

1548
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,300
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1549
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,400
He was born in front
of a live audience.

[Cheering]

1551
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,200

You can do it!
Hold on!

1553
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,000
Is that the best
you can do?

1554

You're gonna have
to kill me!

I demand that you
cease transmission.

1558
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,000
Keep running.

1561

continues singing]

I'm telling you
for the last time.

How close is he?
Very.

1566
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,300
Capsize him.

Damn you,
christof!

1568

You can't. He's tied
himself to the boat!

Shut up!

1570
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,700
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1571
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,400
Do it.
No.

[Over speaker]
I can hear you.

1584
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,000
Who are you?

1585
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
I am the creator
of a television show

1586
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,600
that gives hope and joy
and inspiration to millions.

1587
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,500
Then who am I?

1588
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,100
You're the star.

1589
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,100
Was nothing real?

1590
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,100
You were real.

1591
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,100
That's what made you
so good to watch.

1592
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,200
Listen to me, Truman.

1593
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,800
There's no more truth
out there...

1594
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Than there is in the world
I created for you.

1595
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,000
The same lies.

The same deceit.

1597
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,300
But in my world...

1598
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,200
You have nothing
to fear.

1599
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,500
I know you better
than you know yourself.

1600
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,600
You never had
a camera in my head.

1601

You're afraid.

1602
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,700
That's why
you can't leave.

1603

1604
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,900
I understand.

I have been watching you
your whole life.

when you were born.

took your first step.

first day of school.

lost your first tooth.

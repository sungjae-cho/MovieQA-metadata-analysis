They should, but you can't

She just needs a weekend taking it easy.

Is thatyour mum's bread?

You didn't have to throw the whole loaf.
That would've killed me.

No. Sorry, I misunderstood you.
The duck was dead already.

No. I love ducks. They're my

I'll come if you take my mum, too.

516

She has no money, so we'll have to go
somewhere cheap or you'll have to treat us.

679
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,513
WlLL: A bit sad, really.

680
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,470
You know, he wrote one crap song
that turned out to be a massive hit...

681
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,189
...and then spent the rest of his life
trying to write a better one.

They're just a couple of older kids.
They started following me after school.

Does this happen often?

WlLL: Christ.

1519
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,637
MARCUS: Now there were loads of people.

1520
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,915
And that was great. Mostly.

1521
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:57,195
Are you two lazy bastards
gonna get up and help, or what?

1522
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,358
So how do you know Will?

1523
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,194
We volunteered together
at Amnesty lnternational a couple years ago.

1524
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,477
Yeah, that's right.
How is the Burmese situation, Tom? Better?

1525
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,959
I mean good?

1526
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,558
Yeah, and he called me up
out of the blue for Christmas lunch.

1527
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,119
So, here I am.

1528
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,474
Really?

[Soft piano music]

1530
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:26,674
So, listen, what's the deal
with you and Ellie now?

1531
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,036
Is she your girlfriend?

1532
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,872
Are you insane?

1533
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,190
Where did you get those trainers?

1534
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,919
-Why? What's wrong with them?
-Nothing.

1535
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,195
What?

1536
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,553
By the way,
I do think you and Rachel have a shot.

1537
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,632
-I mean, if you don't screw it up.
-Thank you.

1538
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,991
WlLL: I'd created a monster.

1539
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,191
Or maybe he created me.

1540
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:58,679
MARCUS: I don't know
what Will was so upset about.

1541
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,869
All I meant was
I don't think couples are the future.

1542
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,953
You need more than that. You need backup.

1543
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,637
The way I saw it,
Will and I both had backup now.

1544
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,951
It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:

1545
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,871
"No man is an island. "

No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

- I love you.
- I know.

I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

Right.

I'm sorry, I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

54
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,359
Absolutely. Horrible moment, though.
Can I call you back?

55
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:21,892
Of course.

56
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:25,895
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

57
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:28,158
Understood.

58
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,608
Er, bugger off, call me later.

59
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,040
So what's this big news?

60
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,782
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

61
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,658
and I'm the lobster.

62
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,420
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:46,330
- ln the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

64
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:49,718
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

65
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,804
Duh.

66
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,633
Best sandwiches in Britain.

67
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,136

68
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:07,224
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

69
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,697
Morning, my future wife.

70
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,247
(Man) OK, you can stop there. Thanks.

71
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,707
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.

72
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,210
By the way, he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

73
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:42,349
Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

74
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,548
He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.

75
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,134
Great, Just Judy!

76
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,933
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

77
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:58,519
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

78
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:02,231
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

79
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:05,817
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

80
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,944
That is true.

81
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,448
Good luck, kiddo.

82
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,878
(Cheering, applause)

83
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:38,430
(Press shouting) Prime Minister, over here!

84
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,742
(Cheering)

85
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,858
Thank you.

86
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,780
- Welcome, Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

87
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,824
How are you?

88
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,086
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

89
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,338
Cool. Powerful.

90
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,080
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

91
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,833
Yes, I would like that very much indeed.

92
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:13,388
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

93
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,600
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning, sir.

94
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,342
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

95
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:24,690
Hated him, I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

96
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,890
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

97
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:29,475
Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.

98
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,144
Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot.

99
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:35,064
No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

100
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,983
And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.

101
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:41,778
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David. I mean, sir.

102
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,155
Shit, I can't believe I've just said that.

103
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,950
And now I've gone and said ''shit''.
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

104
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,422
You could've said ''fuck''
and we'd have been in real trouble.

105
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,290
Thank you, sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

106
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,971
Oh, piss it!

107
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:04,809
Right, I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

108
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,758
Yeah, I can't see why not.

109
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,408
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

110
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,524
- Yes, I did.
- I just went ''blurh''.

111
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,901
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

112
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:30,321
Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

113
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,333
Ah.

114
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,450
(Clears throat)

115
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,787
Oh, no.

116
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,049
That is so inconvenient.

117
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,929
ln the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

118
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,631
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

119
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,800
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

120
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:57,929
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

(~ Organ plays Wedding March)

122
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,739
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

123
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,939
Yeah, I'm mature now.

124
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,120

- Did you do this?

128
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,294
Er, no.

00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:37,589

that can't be done ~

that can't be sung

Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,319
Oh, I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

142
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,311
- The lady of the house let you in, did she?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,783
- Lovely, obliging girl.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:46,161
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

145
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:50,582
- Oh.
- Listen, erm, I've been thinking.

146
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:55,086
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

147
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:59,788
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

148
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,831
(Girlfriend) Hurry up, big boy!

149
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:06,012
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

151
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,690
(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!

152
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,850
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.

153
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,690
Taste explosion?

154
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,880
- Food?
- No, thanks.

155
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,996
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?

156
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:50,708
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

157
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,210
Oh. Tastes like it, too.

158
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,007
I'm Colin, by the way.

159
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:01,593
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

160
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,095
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

161
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,107
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

162
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,017
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

163
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,603
- God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

164
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,897
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.

165
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,902
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

166
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,446
English girls. They're stuck up, you see.

167
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:29,294
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler, game for a laugh.

168
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:33,632
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

169
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,791
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

170
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,126
I think it's crap, Colin.

171
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,003
That's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,089
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

173
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:48,301
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

174
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:51,856
Colin, you're a lonely, ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

175
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:56,892
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

176
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,780
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting, guys!

177
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:04,534
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

178
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:07,026
Judy, could you take the top off this time?

179
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,321
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

180
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:14,991
Yes, OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

181
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,503
Not always the case, is it?

182
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:20,329
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years ln Tibet...

183
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,623
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

184
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,709
Guys, time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

185
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,920
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

186
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,932
(Judy laughs)

187
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:34,842
(Director) Right, let's have
another look at that, please.

188
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,271
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

189
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,648
- OK, yeah. ls that all right?
- Yes.

190
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,525
I'll warm them up!

191
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,207
- And massage them, please.
- Right.

192
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:08,706
It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

193
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:17,672
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

194
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:20,133
Some of her requests,

195
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:25,940
for instance, that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

196
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:29,850
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

197
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:33,071
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:37,659
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

199
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:41,360
I said, ''Over my dead body.''

200
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:44,582
And she said, ''No, Daniel, over mine.''

201
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,793
And as usual, my darling girl...

202
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,828
and Sam's darling mum was right.

203
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:58,167
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

204
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,294
inevitably,

205
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,630
ever so coolly,

206
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:08,301
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

~ I wish it could be

214
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:42,706
~ I could love you but why begin it?

215
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:45,845
~ Cos there ain't any future in it

Do you love him?

223
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,607
Er, er, what?

224
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,444
No, l-l just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

225
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:20,407
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

226
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,286
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

~ ..on my finger... ~

228
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,289
So that's a no, then?

229

Yes. Erm...

230

~ Goodbye baby, baby bye bye... ~

232

This DJ, what do you reckon?

233
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,103
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

234
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,595
I think it all hangs on the next song.

235
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,690
Now here's one for the lovers.

236
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,777
That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

239
00:17:56,908 --> 00:18:02,069
- He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

240
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:06,281

243
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,122
Oh, yes, of course, erm...

244
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,166
Great, er, good, good.

245
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:22,431
How are you doing, Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

246
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:24,213
Absolutely.

247
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,342
- Harry?
- Sarah,

248
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:35,526
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

249
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:41,229
Two years, seven months,

250
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,981
three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

251
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:49,069
And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

252
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:52,197
Um...

253
00:18:55,126 --> 00:19:00,120
Two years, seven months, three days
and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

254
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,882
Thought as much.

255
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,999
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

256
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,334
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

257
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,432
Oh, that is... that is bad news.

258
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:15,926
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

259
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,471
- Like what?
- lnvite him out for a drink

260
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:24,402
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

261
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,811
- You know that?
- Yes.

262
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:30,314
And so does Karl.

263
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,858
Think about it, for all our sakes.

264
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,485
It's Christmas.

265
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:40,448
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

266
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,710
Thanks, boss.

267
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:46,578

What is that?

That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.

275
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:20,035
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

276
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:24,237
Oh, and coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.

Except we've changed
the word ''love'' to ''Christmas''.

282
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:44,296
Yes, is that an important message
to you, Bill?

283
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,840
(Snorts) Not really, Mike.

284
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:51,219
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

285
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,763
- And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

286
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:57,809
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish

287
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:02,021
and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

288
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:04,825
- Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

289
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,734
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

290
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:11,529
lt doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

291
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:15,366
- Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

292
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:18,170
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

293

No, only kidding! (Snorts)

294
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,956
- She was rubbish.
- OK, here's one.

295
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:27,637
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

296
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,213
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

298
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:36,468
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

299
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,845
wasn't some smug teenager

300
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:43,224
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

301
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:46,811
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

302
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:49,563
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

303
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:53,233
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe,

304
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,412
ugliest man in the world,

305
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:59,916
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

306
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:05,244
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

307
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:09,080
buy my festering turd of a record.

308
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:12,166
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

309
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:16,681
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

310
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:19,006
I think you're referring to

311
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:21,383
''lf you really love Christmas...''

312
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:24,688
''Come on and let it snow.'' Ouch.

313
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,804
So, here it is one more time,

314
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:30,193

Christmas number one,

Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.

I feel it in my toes ~

- The President's visit.

319
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,294
Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

320
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:55,705
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

- like the last government.
- (All) Here, here.

322
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,472
This is our first really important test,
let's take a stand.

323
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:07,226
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

324
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,844
not to. Not this time.

325
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:15,442
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

326
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:18,017
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

327
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,855
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

328
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,624
Right.

- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

332
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,667
..and these are for you.

333
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,513
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

334
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:52,766
I was hoping you'd win, not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

335
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,718
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

336
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,678
Thanks very much. Thanks...

00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,773
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.

339
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,360
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

340
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,990
Oh, I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

341
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,211
You know the type, he's married to his job.

342
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:27,506
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

343
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:30,832
Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

344
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:33,376
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

345
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,256
I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,

346
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:43,009
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

347
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,136
- Thank you!
- Oh, well, you know.

348
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:46,929
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

349
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,348
The move again, please, Judy.

350
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,934
- Ooh, sorry.
- Oh, God, sorry. You all right?

351
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,116
- Exciting news!
- What?

352
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:01,494
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

353
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:02,996
- No.
- Yes!

354
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:07,197
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

355
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:10,909
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

356
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:15,173
No, Col! There are a few babes in America,
I grant you,

357
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,999
but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

358
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,304
Tone, you're just jealous.

359
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:25,255
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

360
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,717
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

361
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,430
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

362
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:39,434
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

363
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,770
- No, Colin, no!
- Yes!

364
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:43,021
- Nyet!
- Da!

365
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,449
- Nein!
- Ja, darling!

366
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:48,234
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favourite night of the year

367
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,653
and your unhappy job to organise.

368
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,708
- Tell me.
- It's basic, really.

369
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:57,576
Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

370
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:01,673
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

371
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:06,208
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean, not children.

372
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,878
But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

373
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,685
Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible
six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:20,523
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

375
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:24,610
Really?

376
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,727
Right.

377
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,947
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he'll be up there now.

378
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,700
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

379
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:48,298
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

380
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,175
Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

381
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:56,795
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

382
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,922
I mean, clearly it's about his mum

383
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:04,135
but Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,980
(Karen) At the age of 1 1?

385
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:10,265
(Daniel) Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
Maybe just his veins.

386
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:14,696
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him, you know, and...

387
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:21,744
I don't know, this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

388
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,069
like it never did before.

389
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:28,949
Listen, it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

390
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:31,576
Just be patient.

391
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,995
And maybe check the room for needles.

392
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:39,041
And then when he sometimes does
come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

393
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:51,761
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

394
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:55,066
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:59,226
I just don't know.

396
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,978
Get a grip.

397
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,240
People hate sissies.

398
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,566
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

399
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,569
Yeah. Absolutely.

400
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,696
Helpful.

401
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,248
So, what's the problem, Samuel?

402
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:30,962
ls it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

403
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,507
Maybe school?

404
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,645
Are you being bullied?

405
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,940
Or is it something worse?

406
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,058
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,864
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:52,481
Even though you won't be able to help?

409
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,150
Even if that's the case, yeah.

410
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,613
OK. Well...

411
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,575
truth is, actually...

412
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:06,536
I'm in love.

413
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:08,214
Sorry?

414
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:12,833
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

415
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:17,180
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

416
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:21,299
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,385
Ah, well. OK, well...

418
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,764
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,017
- Why?
- Because l...

420
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:34,227
thought it'd be something worse.

421
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,313
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

422
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,034
Er...

423
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,776
No, you're right.

424
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:44,986
Total agony.

425
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,240
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

426
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,777
(Mobile)

427
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,199
Yeah, absolutely.

428
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,535
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:13,190
Alone again.

430
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,161
Naturally.

431
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,361
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

432
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:23,043
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

433
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,629
Thanks.

434
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,746
Natalie.

435
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,802
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

436
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,713
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:43,342
and me knowing so little about you,
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,261
Well, there's not much to know.

439
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,848
Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?

440
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,110
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

441
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:55,519
- Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

442
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,356
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

443
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:03,026
At the end of the high street,
Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

444
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,945
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:10,293
Erm, and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,547
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

447
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:19,249
I've just split up with my boyfriend, so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

448
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:23,628
- Ah. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

449
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,130
I'm well shot of him.

450
00:32:26,182 --> 00:32:29,018
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,011
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

452
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:35,680
Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

453
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,100
No.

454
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:48,327
You know, erm...

455
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:52,289
being Prime Minister,
I could just have him murdered.

456
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,865
Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.

457
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:59,868
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

458
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,914
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

459
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:11,671
Oh, God.

460
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,675
Did you have this kind of problem?

461
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,721
Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

462
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:25,224
So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.

463
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,518
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

464
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,980
So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

465
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:33,940
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good, good.

466
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:37,110
And what does she, he, feel about you?

467
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:40,113
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:43,001
And even if she did, she'd despise me.

469
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,409
She's the coolest girl in school.

470
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:49,590
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

471
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,165
Good. Good.

472
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:55,585
Well,

473
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:58,337
basically you're fucked, aren't you?

474
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:02,925
(~ All I Want For Christmas ls You)

475
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:07,053
Hi there and welcome back.

476
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:11,432
So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:16,030
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,480
No. Little scamps.

479
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:21,983
But very, very talented musicians.

480
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:26,331
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

481
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:27,863
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.

482
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:31,961
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

483
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,660
Oh, great.

484
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:37,497
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,

485
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:42,345
so if you've got a framed picture,
like, for instance, this one of Blue,

486
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:44,462
you can just write on it.

487
00:34:56,524 --> 00:34:58,151
(Kids snickering)

488
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:02,102
(Dec) Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.
(Billy) Oh, yeah.

489
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:05,022
Hiya, kids.

490
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,493
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

491
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,693
don't buy drugs.

492
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,750
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

493
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:20,619
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

494
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:25,498
~ All I want for Christmas is you ~

495
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:36,883
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

496
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,511
Actually, they're not funny. They're art.

497
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,941
(Laughing)

498
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:46,777
OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

499
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:51,198
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line,
she wants to ask you a favour.

500
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,234
- (Sighing) OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.

501
00:35:56,286 --> 00:36:01,405
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'

502
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:03,824
- I'm always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark?'

503
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:06,827
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

504
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:09,662
lt was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

505
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:13,332
- So, what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour.'

506
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:16,387
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

507
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,515
- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I'm sorry.

508
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:23,258
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

509
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,437
To be honest, I didn't really...

510
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:30,191
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

511
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:35,185
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it,
so don't get any hopes up.

512
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,104
- 'Must go.'
- (Click)

513
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,580
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

514
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:49,573
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

515
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,700
How true.

516
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,203
- (Sarah) Stop.
- (Mobile)

517
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,497
And of course, your mobile goes.

518
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,177
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

519
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,181
- So, how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

520
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,433
Think I've found a venue.

521
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,894
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

522
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:16,055
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

523
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,268
Oh. Right.

524
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,532
Good. Well, I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

525
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:27,701
You should.

526
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,532
(Typewriter clacking)

527
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:40,410
(Bell tinkles)

528
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:48,334
Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

529
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:51,253
Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

530
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,432
And this year you bring a lady guest?

531
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:56,727
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

532
00:37:56,768 --> 00:38:01,231
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

533
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:04,025
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah, yeah.

534
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:09,311
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

535
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,938
This is Aurelia.

536
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,950
Ah.

537
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:18,068
- Er, bonjour, Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

538
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:23,281
(French) Er, je suis, er, tres heureux
de vous avoir ici.

539
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:28,421
Unfortunately, she cannot speak French,
just like you.

540
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:30,423
She's Portuguese.

541
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:33,082
(ltalian) Ah, ah, buongiorno.

542
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,094
Eusebio, er, er...

543
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,544
(Pidgin Spanish) Er, molto bueno...

544
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:43,841
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

545
00:38:43,894 --> 00:38:46,302
And ''molto bueno'' is Spanish.

546
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,897
Right.

547
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,723
Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

548
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,517
Can you drive her home after her work?

549
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:57,395
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

550
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,689
Which is what? Turkish?

551
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:09,489
(Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

552
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,201
Er, bella.

553
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:16,746
Er, mon-montagno,

554
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:18,873
arvarez...

555
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:24,378
No, right. Silence is golden.

556
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,642
As the Tremeloes said.

557
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:32,187
Clever guys,

558
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:37,514
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

559
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,558
Gr-great band.

560
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,143
(~ High-pitched humming:
Silence ls Golden)

561
00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:44,604
Oh, shut up.

562
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:47,023
(Cheering)

563
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,626
(Press) Mr President!

564
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,130
- Over here, sir!
- What will you be talking about?

565
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,258
Mr President, welcome.

566
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,926
It's a pleasure to meet you.

567
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,803
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

568
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:13,129
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of lonely.

569
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,256
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

570
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,800
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:20,521
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

572
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:23,566
Really? I've never found that.

573
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:28,070
Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome,
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

574
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:32,824
- Very jealous of your plane, by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

575
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:35,149
Ah, Natalie. Hi.

576
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,953
Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?

577
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,696
- (Natalie giggles)
- Excellent.

578
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,118
(Sighs) My goodness,
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

579
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,245
Did you see those pipes?

580
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,498
Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

581
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:57,262
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

582
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,212
That is unexpected.

583
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:01,756
Well, it shouldn't be.

584
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:05,009
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:07,928
We're being consistent with their policies.

586
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,847
With all respect, they were bad policies.

587
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,152
Thanks, Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

588
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:18,104
Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

589
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:24,036
Well, now, that was an interesting day.

590
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:29,666
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today,

591
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,492
then just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:35,494
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

593
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:38,633
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

594
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:41,927
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,586
I'll give you anything you ask for.

596
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:47,755
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

597
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:54,188
Hi.

598
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,305
Pathetic.

599
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,503
It's great Scotch.

600
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:24,496
I'll, erm... I'll be going, then.

601
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,291
Er, Natalie,

602
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:33,296
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,840
Thank you, sir.

604
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:54,075
Er, yes, Peter.

605
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,400
Mr President, has it been a good visit?

606
00:42:56,452 --> 00:43:00,038
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,749
We got what we came for

608
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,325
and our special relationship
is still very special.

609
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:08,911
Prime Minister?

610
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:13,509
I love that word ''relationship''.
Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

611
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,085
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

612
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,392
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

613
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,469
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to, erm...

614
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,182
Britain.

615
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,394
We may be a small country
but we're a great one, too.

616
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:39,699
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, the Beatles,

617
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,993
- Sean Connery, Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)

618
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:46,038
- David Beckham's right foot.
- (Laughter)

619
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,780
David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

620
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:52,877
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:56,172
And since bullies only respond to strength,
from now onward,

622
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,956
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

623
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:03,293
And the President
should be prepared for that.

624
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:06,181
(Press clamouring)

625
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,220
Mr President!

626
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,600
Joe.

627
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:23,894
It's your sister on line four.

628
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,816
All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy
and important, how can I help you?

629
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:32,027
Have you gone completely insane?

630
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,822
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

631
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,657
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

632
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,493
- 'I'll call you back.'
- No, you won't!

633
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,302
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

634
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:52,461
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

635
00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:57,091
What did I do?
I made a papier-mâché lobster head.

636
00:44:57,143 --> 00:44:59,718
What is this we're listening to?

637
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,053
Joni Mitchell.

638
00:45:02,105 --> 00:45:04,973
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

639
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:08,611
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

640
00:45:10,029 --> 00:45:15,107
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

641
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:19,371
Did she? Oh, well, that's good,
I must write to her and say thanks.

642
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:23,030
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

643
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:27,295
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

Mary, can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

665

- Certainly, sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

Just don't go eating it all yourself,

671
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,543
you're getting chubbier every day.

00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,259
Oop. Sorry.

676
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,469
(Ringing continues)

677
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:24,357
Hello?

678
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:42,863
- Thank you.
- (Portuguese) Nao!

679
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:46,116
- Eu peço imensa desculpa.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

680
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,743
- God, it's half the book. Oh, no.
- Que desastre.

681
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:52,330
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

682
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:55,082
They're not worth it!

683
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,085
Stop! Stop.

684
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:00,754
Aa-ahh.

685
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:04,143
It's all just rubbish.

686
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,927
Just leave it.

687
00:48:19,823 --> 00:48:23,076
Oh, God, she's in.

688
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:26,944
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

689
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,447
(Portuguese) Fuck - it's cold!

690
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,328
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

691
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,716
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

692
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,250
It's not worth it,
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

693
00:48:43,302 --> 00:48:45,179
(Portuguese) I don't want to drown

694
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,005
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

695
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,516
Just stop. Stop.

696
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:52,311
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

697
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:54,271
I really must do copies.

698
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:57,857
There'd better not be eels in here.

699
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:01,016
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.

700
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:03,060
Oh, what the hell is that?

701
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:15,613
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:23,536
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

703
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:28,134
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

704
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:40,385
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?

705
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,321
- Romance?
- Yes.

706
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,366
It's, erm...
(lmitates horror film sound effects)

707
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:55,648
Ah, er...

708
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,942
(Portuguese) Thriller...crime...

709
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,987
(Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime. Crime, murder.

710
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,780
(Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

711
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,950
Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

712
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:11,464
And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

713
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:23,131
Mm.

714
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:28,844
(Portuguese) I'd better get back to work.

715
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:32,681
- Ah.
- (Portuguese) Later you'll drive me home?

716
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,808
Sure.

717
00:50:38,113 --> 00:50:41,116
It's my favourite time of day...

718
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:43,232
driving you.

719
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:50,040
(Portuguese) It's the saddest part
of my day, leaving you.

720
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,422
Sorry.

721
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:28,324
(TV) 'And coming up
later this morning, it's this guy...'

722
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:32,776
~ There's no beginning, there'll be no end

723
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:36,613
- ~ Cos on Christmas...
- '..the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,

724
00:51:36,665 --> 00:51:39,282
'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

725
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:47,122
Banoffee pie?

726
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:48,968
No, thanks.

727
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,513
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

728
00:51:52,554 --> 00:51:56,058
Right, well, lucky you.

729
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,009
- Can I come in?
- Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

730
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:04,972
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

731
00:52:05,024 --> 00:52:07,974
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

732
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:10,310
or maybe Munchies?

733
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:14,772
Actually, I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

734
00:52:14,824 --> 00:52:17,775
Mark, can I say something?

735
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:19,902
Yeah.

736
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:23,488
I know you're Peter's best friend

737
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:28,701
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

738
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:31,673
Look, don't, don't argue.

739
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:34,123
We've never got friendly.

740
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,708
But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.

741
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,837
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

742
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:44,799
lt would be great if we could be friends.

743
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:47,510
Absolutely. Absolutely.

744
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:53,515
Great.

745
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:56,570
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

746
00:52:56,611 --> 00:53:00,479
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

747
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:03,482
This one says
''Peter and Juliet's Wedding''.

748
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:05,859
Do you think we might be on the right track?

749
00:53:05,911 --> 00:53:10,488
Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.

750
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:13,293
- Do you mind if l...?
- I've probably taped over it.

751
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:16,452
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

752
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:19,622
Oh.

753
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:23,344
Oh, bingo.

754
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,097
That's lovely.

755
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:29,297
Well done, you.

756
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:32,883
Oh, that's gorgeous.

757
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:38,440
Thank you so much, Mark,
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

758
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:47,688
I look quite pretty.

759
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:57,113
You've stayed rather close.

760
00:54:51,214 --> 00:54:53,497
They're all of me.

761
00:54:57,553 --> 00:55:00,722
(Mark) Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,838
Yes.

763
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,992
But...

764
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:38,297
you never talk to me.

765
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,749
You always talk to Peter.

766
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:47,514
You don't like me.

767
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:50,798
I hope it's useful.

768
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,936
Don't show it around too much.

769
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:57,179
Needs a bit of editing.

770
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:00,932
Look, I've got to get to a...lunch.

771
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,944
Early lunch.

772
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:05,936
You can just show yourself out, can't you?

773
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:15,997
It's a...self-preservation thing, you see.

774
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,075
(~ Dido: Here With Me)

775
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:30,302
~ Oh I am what I am

776
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:33,294
~ I'll do what I want

777
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:38,142
~ But I can't hide

778
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:40,342
~ And I won't go

779
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,106
~ I won't sleep

780
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:47,067
~ And I can't breathe

781
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:50,195
~ Until you're resting here with me

782
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:52,853
~ And I won't leave

783
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:55,689
~ And I can't hide

784
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:58,577
~ I cannot be

~ And I won't go

~ Until you're resting here with me ~

790
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:17,511
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

791
00:57:19,846 --> 00:57:22,849
Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat.

792
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:26,018
Ah...

793
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,677
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

794
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:30,804
Anything for the hero of the hour.

795
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,610
Don't ask me why,
and don't read stuff into this,

796
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:38,102
it's just a weird personality thing.

797
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,240
But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?

798
00:57:41,282 --> 00:57:43,815
The chubby girl?

799
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,942
Ooh, would we call her chubby?

800
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:50,655
I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there,
yes, sir. Huge thighs.

801
00:57:51,749 --> 00:57:54,783
Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...

802
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,788
I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could, erm...

803
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:05,418
redistribute her?

804
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,545
It's done.

805
00:58:42,503 --> 00:58:44,661
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

806
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,539
I got some terrible news today.

807
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,582
Let's have it.

808
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:52,720
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

809
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,296
Yes, she's American.

810
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:57,756
And she's not my girl.

811
00:58:57,808 --> 00:59:01,937
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

812
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,189
That is bad news.

813
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:08,766
Well, we need Kate

814
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:12,154
and we need Leo, and we need them now.

815
00:59:12,196 --> 00:59:14,021
Come on.

816
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,859
'Hold on. Hold on.

817
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:22,194
'Keep your eyes closed.

- 'Do you trust me?'
- 'l trust you.'

00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:30,285
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

820
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:32,954
- Fool!
- Get off, you big bully.

821
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:38,626
'All right, open your eyes.'

822
00:59:41,764 --> 00:59:45,382
You know, Sammy,
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

823
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:48,437
but general wisdom is that in the end,

824
00:59:48,478 --> 00:59:51,929
there isn't just one person for each of us.

825
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,099
There was for Kate and Leo.

826
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:57,820
There was for you.

827
00:59:57,862 --> 00:59:59,822
And there is for me.

828
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,855
She's the one.

829
01:00:03,492 --> 01:00:06,411
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

830
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:09,653
Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.

831
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:22,457
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

832
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,338
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

833
01:00:44,487 --> 01:00:47,322
(Pidgin Portuguese)
Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia.

834
01:00:47,364 --> 01:00:52,608
Grande, er... grande familio,
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

835
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,735
Stupido.

836
01:01:20,852 --> 01:01:23,553
Well, goodbye.

837
01:01:23,605 --> 01:01:25,732
(Portuguese) Thank you.

838
01:01:28,776 --> 01:01:31,268
Erm, it was, erm...

839
01:01:32,363 --> 01:01:35,396
(Portuguese) I will miss you.

840
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,619
And your very slow typing...

841
01:01:40,703 --> 01:01:43,570
and your very bad driving.

842
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,951
(Car horn)

843
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:48,430
~ You know I love Christmas, I always will

844
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:54,467
~ My mind's made up, the way that I feel

845
01:02:55,895 --> 01:03:00,472
~ There's no beginning, there'll be no end

846
01:03:00,524 --> 01:03:05,560
~ Cos on Christmas you can depend ~

847
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:13,817
Daniel!

848
01:03:14,912 --> 01:03:18,989
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

849
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:22,158
- Well, girls love musicians, don't they?

and played superbly,

01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:07,352
No. I don't want something I need.

1027
01:17:07,404 --> 01:17:10,855
I want something I want. Something pretty.

1028
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:13,941
Right.

1029
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:17,110
Right.

1030
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:28,204
Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

1031
01:17:32,092 --> 01:17:34,761
Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied

1032
01:17:34,803 --> 01:17:37,973
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

1033
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:02,067
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1034
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:04,872
Looking for anything in particular, sir?

1035
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,573
Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

1036
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,835
It's £270.

1037
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:16,298
- Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1038
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:22,418
Would you like it...giftwrapped?

1039
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:25,254
- Yes, all right.
- Lovely.

1040
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,592
Let me just pop it in the box.

1041
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:33,731
There.

1042
01:18:33,772 --> 01:18:37,390
- Look, could we be quite quick?
- Certainly, sir.

1043
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:40,309
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1044
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:49,443
- There.
- That's great.

1045
01:18:49,495 --> 01:18:52,331
Not quite finished.

1046
01:18:55,834 --> 01:19:00,546
- I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

1047
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:04,008
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1048
01:19:10,764 --> 01:19:12,807
Ooh!

1049
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,603
Could we be quite quick, please?

1050
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:32,439
Prontissimo.

1051
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:53,468
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.

1052
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:57,044
- Actually, I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it, sir.

1053
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:59,380
Want to bet?

1054
01:19:59,432 --> 01:20:01,882
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1055
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:07,637
There we go. Almost finished.

1056
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:12,183
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1057
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:15,352
No, sir, we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1058
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:17,031
I don't want a Christmas box.

1059
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,856
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1060
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:21,702
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1061
01:20:21,744 --> 01:20:24,496
- All we need now...
- Oh, God.

1062
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:26,748
- ..is a sprig of holly.
- No, no, no, no.

1063
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,833
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1064
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,575
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1065
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:35,620
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1066
01:20:35,673 --> 01:20:38,342
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1067
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:42,043
after 13 years of
Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1068
01:20:42,095 --> 01:20:44,170
Actually, I do love this one.

1069
01:20:44,222 --> 01:20:46,432
(~ Darlene Love: All Alone On Christmas)

1070
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,684
~ I've gotta know

1071
01:20:48,726 --> 01:20:54,898
~ Where do the lonely hearts go... ~

1072
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:58,307
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1073
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:01,393
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1074
01:21:01,446 --> 01:21:04,813
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1075
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:06,606
I bloody am.

1076
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:09,995
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1077
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:13,123
lt is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1078
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:16,615
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1079
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,951
(Clears throat) Look, erm...

1080
01:21:20,296 --> 01:21:22,871
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1081
01:21:22,923 --> 01:21:27,583
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink,
do you? I mean, nothing implied.

1082
01:21:27,636 --> 01:21:33,255
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1083
01:21:33,307 --> 01:21:36,644
Obviously, if you don't want to,
you don't have to. l...

1084
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:38,426
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1085
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:41,179
No. That would be lovely.

1086
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:43,598
Oh, great.

1087
01:21:45,944 --> 01:21:47,268
Yay!

1088
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,478
You know, that is really great.

1089
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,482
Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages
to get the courage up, so thank you.

1090
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,693
(Repetitive drumbeats)

1091
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,410
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1092
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:10,705
We've been waiting for hours,
it's the first ever preview.

1093
01:22:10,757 --> 01:22:12,832
~ ..is a thing of the past

1094
01:22:12,884 --> 01:22:16,304
~ Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1095
01:22:16,346 --> 01:22:19,348
~ Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared... ~

1096
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:23,467
(Karen) It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1097
01:22:23,519 --> 01:22:26,719
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1098
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,522
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1099
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:41,608
(Russian) ls this the way to the train station?

1100
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:44,829
I would like half-pint of churly.

1101
01:22:45,914 --> 01:22:48,614
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1102
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:52,451
(Portuguese) Oh, my God,
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1103
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:54,786
lt must have been the prawns.

1104
01:22:54,838 --> 01:22:57,372
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1105
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:02,762
(Portuguese) My goodness,
this is a very big fish!

1106
01:23:02,804 --> 01:23:05,838
lt tastes delicious!

1107
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,600
~ All alone on Christmas

1108
01:23:07,641 --> 01:23:10,310
~ Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

~ All alone on Christmas
~ Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1110
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,899
~ Tell me I've got to know

1111
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:20,653
~ Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
~ Don't leave me alone ~

1112
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:25,491
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah, back broken from too much sex.

1113
01:23:25,532 --> 01:23:27,899
You are on the road to disaster.

1114
01:23:27,951 --> 01:23:31,454
No, I am on shag highway, heading west.

1115
01:23:32,038 --> 01:23:34,029
Farewell, failure.

1116
01:23:34,082 --> 01:23:38,033
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1117
01:23:38,085 --> 01:23:41,672
~ And he's got a big knob ~

1118
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:45,706
(~ Santana Featuring Rob Thomas:
Smooth)

1119
01:23:52,389 --> 01:23:54,965
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1120
01:23:55,017 --> 01:23:58,437
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1121
01:23:59,187 --> 01:24:02,106
(On jukebox) ~ Man, it's a hot one

1122
01:24:02,148 --> 01:24:05,484
~ Like seven inches
from the midday sun... ~

1123
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:09,311
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please.

1124
01:24:09,363 --> 01:24:12,783
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1125
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,983
Oh, my God.

1126
01:24:16,036 --> 01:24:17,943
Are you from England?

1127
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,030
- Yes.
- Oh...

1128
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:25,085
that is so cute.

1129
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:28,828
Hi, I'm Stacey. (Giggles)

1130
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,955
Jeannie?

1131
01:24:32,842 --> 01:24:34,969
Yeah?

1132
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:37,795
- This is...
- Colin.

1133
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:41,548
Frissell.

1134
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,727
Cute name.

1135
01:24:43,769 --> 01:24:46,604
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1136
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:48,888
Yep. Basildon.

1137
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,859
- Oh.
- Oh.

1138
01:24:51,901 --> 01:24:56,853
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1139
01:24:56,905 --> 01:24:59,063
(Stacey) Uh-huh.

1140
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:06,111
- Hey, girls.
- Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1141
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,780
He's from England.

1142
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:13,076
Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.

1143
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:18,789
- Hey, gorgeous.
- (Gentle growl)

1144
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:22,678
That is so funny!

1145
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:26,379
- What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.

1146
01:25:26,432 --> 01:25:28,558
(With English accent) ''Bottle.''

1147
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,675
- What about this?
- Er, straw.

1148
01:25:30,727 --> 01:25:32,604
(Girls) ''Straw.''

1149
01:25:32,645 --> 01:25:34,637
- What about this?
- Table.

1150
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:37,973
- Table. The same.
- Oh, it's the same.

1151
01:25:38,025 --> 01:25:41,445
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1152
01:25:41,487 --> 01:25:44,323
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1153
01:25:44,364 --> 01:25:47,701
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1154
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:52,486
No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1155
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:55,072
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1156
01:25:55,124 --> 01:25:57,282
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1157
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,337
Well, if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1158
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:03,412
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1159
01:26:03,465 --> 01:26:05,591
What?

1160
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:09,293
Well, we're not the richest of girls,
you know.

1161
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:14,339
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1162
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:17,759
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1163
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:24,264
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1164
01:26:24,316 --> 01:26:27,100
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1165
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:29,561
No?

1166
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:32,146
Which means...

1167
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:34,409
we would be naked.

1168
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,737
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1169
01:26:40,789 --> 01:26:43,198
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...

1170
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,367
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1171
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:48,630
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1172
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:50,548
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1173
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:54,917
Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her
cos she is ''the sexy one''.

1174
01:26:54,969 --> 01:26:57,753
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1175
01:26:57,805 --> 01:27:01,673
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh, and he's a Christian.

1176
01:27:04,144 --> 01:27:05,801
(All) Cheers.

~ lf I could

1178
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:10,597
~ Then I would

1179
01:27:10,649 --> 01:27:14,861
~ I'll go wherever you will go

1180

1181

~ Or down low

~ I'll go wherever you will go

1183
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:26,789
~ lf I could turn back... ~

1184
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,083
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1185
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,116
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1186
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:35,338
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no. I want to choose mine.

1187
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,663
I think I want...

1188
01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:43,627
- ..this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well

1189
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,630
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1190
01:27:47,682 --> 01:27:49,841
Thank you.

1191
01:27:49,893 --> 01:27:52,020
That's a real first.

1192
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:54,511
- Rip it!

01:39:46,197 --> 01:39:50,024
with a chubby employee. (Snorts)

1369
01:39:50,076 --> 01:39:52,828
And, much as it grieves me to say it,

1370
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:58,656
it might be that the people I love is, in fact...

1371
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:02,670
you.

1372
01:40:03,755 --> 01:40:05,882
Well, this is a surprise.

1373
01:40:05,923 --> 01:40:07,748
Yeah.

1374
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,083
Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?

1375
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:12,210
No, look. I'm serious here.

1376
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:18,132
I left Elton's and a hefty number
of half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1377
01:40:18,184 --> 01:40:22,511
in order to hang out with you at Christmas.

1378
01:40:24,064 --> 01:40:29,517
- Well, Bill...
- It's a terrible, terrible mistake, chubs...

1379
01:40:33,323 --> 01:40:36,690
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1380
01:40:40,162 --> 01:40:44,072
And to be honest,
despite all my complaining...

1381
01:40:45,959 --> 01:40:48,409
we have had a wonderful life.

1382
01:40:52,924 --> 01:40:54,633
Well...

1383
01:40:56,427 --> 01:40:58,637
thank you.

1384
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:03,339
I mean, come on, it's been an honour.

1385
01:41:04,851 --> 01:41:07,259
I feel very proud.

1386
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,470
Oh, look, don't be a moron.

1387
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:20,312
(Clears throat)

1388
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:23,816
Come on, let's get pissed and watch porn.

I'd like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.

(David) Oh, God, it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

01:44:29,283 --> 01:44:31,441
She lives next door.

1432
01:44:33,912 --> 01:44:36,529
Ah. Brilliant.

1433
01:44:36,581 --> 01:44:39,584
You're not who I think you are, are you?

1434
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,752
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1435

My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

ls, er, Natalie in?

01:45:08,526 --> 01:45:11,445
Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1441
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:16,690
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1442
01:45:16,742 --> 01:45:21,861
Erm, this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1443
01:45:21,913 --> 01:45:23,873
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1444
01:45:23,915 --> 01:45:27,741
And, erm...this is the Prime Minister.

1445
01:45:27,793 --> 01:45:30,713
Yes, we can see that, darling.

1446
01:45:30,754 --> 01:45:33,590
And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

1447
01:45:33,632 --> 01:45:36,749
It's the school Christmas concert,
you see, David.

1448
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:40,252
All the local schools have joined together,
even St Basil's...

1449
01:45:40,305 --> 01:45:44,173
- Too much detail, Mum.
- Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1450
01:45:44,225 --> 01:45:48,134
Well, l...just needed Natalie...

1451
01:45:50,897 --> 01:45:52,972
on some state business.

1452
01:45:53,024 --> 01:45:57,653
- Oh.
- Right, yes. Of course.

1453
01:45:57,695 --> 01:45:59,488
Right, er...

1454
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:02,282
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1455
01:46:02,324 --> 01:46:03,732
Er, Natalie.

1456
01:46:03,784 --> 01:46:06,317
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1457
01:46:06,369 --> 01:46:10,029
- No, it's nothing, really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1458
01:46:10,081 --> 01:46:14,241
- No, really, it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1459
01:46:14,293 --> 01:46:16,337
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1460
01:46:16,378 --> 01:46:18,912
Mm. Erm...

1461
01:46:20,716 --> 01:46:22,842
Listen, why don't I give you a lift

1462
01:46:22,884 --> 01:46:28,003
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1463
01:46:29,557 --> 01:46:31,100
OK.

1464
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:34,009
- Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.

1465
01:46:34,061 --> 01:46:36,188
Hold tight, everybody.

1466
01:46:42,777 --> 01:46:45,613
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1467
01:46:45,654 --> 01:46:48,355
Ah, right. Well, er...

1468
01:46:50,284 --> 01:46:52,525
I just wanted to say...

1469
01:46:54,454 --> 01:46:56,612
thank you for the Christmas card.

1470
01:46:56,664 --> 01:46:58,489
You're welcome.

1471
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:00,501
Look, I'm so sorry about that day.

1472
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:03,879
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1473
01:47:03,921 --> 01:47:08,414
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened, I promise.

1474
01:47:08,466 --> 01:47:11,636
I just felt like such a fool because...

1475
01:47:11,678 --> 01:47:14,962
I think about you all the time, actually.

1476
01:47:15,014 --> 01:47:18,434
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1477
01:47:18,475 --> 01:47:20,133
- ..love.
- Oh, wow.

1478
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:22,854
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1479
01:47:24,564 --> 01:47:26,639
Erm...

1480
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,351
Ow!

1481
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,815
(Sighs)

1482
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,151
Well, look, l...

1483
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:44,446
I think I'd better not come in, you know?

1484
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:49,002
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1485
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:52,662
No, please come. lt'll be great.

1486
01:47:52,714 --> 01:47:55,414
No, I'd...I'd better not.

1487
01:47:56,509 --> 01:48:01,336
But I will be very sorry

1488
01:48:01,389 --> 01:48:03,515
to drive away from you.

1489
01:48:04,975 --> 01:48:07,185
Just give me one second.

1490
01:48:21,114 --> 01:48:24,284
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1491
01:48:24,326 --> 01:48:27,443
- Erm...erm...
- Um...um...

1492
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:32,614
No!

1493
01:49:03,944 --> 01:49:07,604
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1494
01:49:07,656 --> 01:49:09,866
OK. Terry, I won't be long.

1495
01:49:13,328 --> 01:49:16,247
Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

1496
01:49:16,289 --> 01:49:20,449
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1497
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:26,423
Look, the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1498
01:49:26,464 --> 01:49:30,510
- Oh, David.
- Ah!

1499
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:32,876
Oh, how are you?

1500
01:49:32,928 --> 01:49:37,005
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1501
01:49:37,057 --> 01:49:39,215
What the hell are you doing here?

1502
01:49:39,267 --> 01:49:42,301
- Well, you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1503
01:49:42,353 --> 01:49:47,097
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1504
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:49,057
I thought it was time I did.

1505
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:52,529
I didn't want anyone to see,
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1506
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,021
Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

1507
01:49:55,073 --> 01:49:58,816
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1508
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:02,152
- Thank you.
- All right.

1509
01:50:02,204 --> 01:50:05,155
Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

1510
01:50:05,207 --> 01:50:08,293
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1511
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:10,576
- Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.

1512
01:50:10,629 --> 01:50:12,703
And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...

1513
01:50:12,756 --> 01:50:15,623
- who's my, erm, catering manager.
- Oh.

1514
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:17,750
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1515
01:50:17,802 --> 01:50:19,876
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1516
01:50:19,929 --> 01:50:22,139
20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

1517
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:27,133
I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir,
just because it's Christmas.

1518
01:50:27,185 --> 01:50:29,343
- No, seriously.
- (Bell)

1519
01:50:29,395 --> 01:50:31,762
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.

1520
01:50:31,814 --> 01:50:34,483
- Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.

1521
01:50:34,525 --> 01:50:37,475
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

1522
01:50:37,528 --> 01:50:39,738
- Come on.
- Right.

1523

~ Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

1524

Erm, some of the staff
have decided to help out

1535
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:32,827
and for this, we ask you to forgive us.

1536
01:51:32,869 --> 01:51:34,745
Thank you.

1537
01:51:34,787 --> 01:51:36,664

(A capella) ~ I don't want a lot for Christmas

1539
01:51:44,129 --> 01:51:48,455
~ There's just one thing I need

01:51:48,507 --> 01:51:51,844

1554
01:52:43,306 --> 01:52:48,019
~ All I want for Christmas is you

1555
01:52:49,645 --> 01:52:51,970
~ You baby

1556
01:52:52,022 --> 01:52:55,932
~ Oh, all the lights are shining

1557
01:52:55,984 --> 01:53:00,113
~ So brightly everywhere

1558
01:53:00,155 --> 01:53:03,939
~ And the sound of children's laughter
fills the air

1559
01:53:03,991 --> 01:53:06,400
~ Laughter fills the air

1560
01:53:06,452 --> 01:53:09,402
~ Everyone is singing
~ Oh yeah

1561
01:53:09,455 --> 01:53:11,863
~ I hear those sleigh bells ringing

1562
01:53:11,915 --> 01:53:14,751
~ Santa won't you bring me my honey

1563
01:53:14,793 --> 01:53:18,296
~ Won't you please bring my baby to me

1564
01:53:18,337 --> 01:53:21,288
~ I don't want a lot for Christmas

1565
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:24,875
~ This is all I'm asking for
~ All I'm asking for

1566
01:53:24,927 --> 01:53:27,877
~ I just wanna see my baby

1567
01:53:27,929 --> 01:53:31,099
~ Standing right outside my door

1568

~ And you and you
~ All I want for Christmas

1576
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:01,918
~ All I want for Christmas ~

1577
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,326
(Cheering, whistling)

1578
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:20,132
Right.

1579
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,512
So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1580
01:54:25,564 --> 01:54:27,847
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1581
01:54:28,942 --> 01:54:31,017
Little bow.

1582
01:54:34,405 --> 01:54:36,563
And a wave.

1583
01:54:49,877 --> 01:54:53,130
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1584
01:54:53,172 --> 01:54:55,299
I'll see you later, all right?

1585
01:54:55,341 --> 01:54:57,499
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1586
01:54:59,928 --> 01:55:04,088
Tell me, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

1587
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,215
What position is that?

1588
01:55:06,267 --> 01:55:10,010
lmagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1589
01:55:10,062 --> 01:55:13,179
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1590
01:55:13,232 --> 01:55:16,015
- Oh, Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1591
01:55:16,067 --> 01:55:18,736
- Good night.
- Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1592
01:55:18,778 --> 01:55:21,781
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1593
01:55:21,822 --> 01:55:24,231
or if it's sex and a necklace

1594
01:55:24,283 --> 01:55:27,984
or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?

1595
01:55:29,246 --> 01:55:34,407
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1596
01:55:34,459 --> 01:55:37,962
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.

1597
01:55:42,549 --> 01:55:45,385
I am so in the wrong.

1598
01:55:45,427 --> 01:55:47,502
A classic fool.

1599
01:55:47,554 --> 01:55:50,755
Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.

1600
01:55:50,807 --> 01:55:53,674
You've made the life I lead foolish, too.

1601
01:55:56,061 --> 01:55:59,064
Darling. Ooh, darlings!

1602
01:55:59,106 --> 01:56:02,306
Oh, you were wonderful.

1603
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:05,393
My little lobster, you were so...

1604
01:56:05,445 --> 01:56:07,770
What is that word?

1605
01:56:07,822 --> 01:56:10,063
Orange.

1606
01:56:10,116 --> 01:56:13,202
Come on, I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1607
01:56:14,661 --> 01:56:19,405
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, son.

1608
01:56:19,457 --> 01:56:23,534
- Thanks. Plan didn't work, though.
- Tell her, then.

1609
01:56:23,586 --> 01:56:25,494
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1610
01:56:25,546 --> 01:56:28,496
No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

1611
01:56:28,549 --> 01:56:33,887
Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1612
01:56:35,471 --> 01:56:37,713
I never told your mum enough.

1613
01:56:37,765 --> 01:56:42,227
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1614
01:56:43,353 --> 01:56:47,649
You've seen the films, kiddo.
lt ain't over till it's over.

1615
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:54,353
OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1616
01:56:54,405 --> 01:56:56,730
Yes.

1617
01:56:56,782 --> 01:56:59,107
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1618
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:03,528
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1619
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,738
That's OK.

1620
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:09,241
- My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn't.

1621
01:57:09,293 --> 01:57:12,212
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1622
01:57:12,254 --> 01:57:15,173
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1623
01:57:15,215 --> 01:57:18,051
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1624
01:57:18,093 --> 01:57:19,886
Carol.

1625
01:57:19,928 --> 01:57:24,338
- OK, I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1626
01:57:25,725 --> 01:57:28,050
I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1627
01:57:28,102 --> 01:57:30,343
Carol. (Laughs)

1628
01:57:31,688 --> 01:57:36,317
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1629
01:57:37,944 --> 01:57:40,019
(Carol laughs)

1630
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:46,232
- Tell her.
- What?

1631
01:57:46,285 --> 01:57:49,318
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1632
01:57:52,957 --> 01:57:55,084
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

1633
01:57:55,126 --> 01:57:57,409
Over there.

1634
01:57:59,254 --> 01:58:01,298
Oh, no.

1635
01:58:02,382 --> 01:58:05,385
It's OK, we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1636
01:58:20,565 --> 01:58:22,692
(Portuguese) Good evening.

1637
01:58:22,734 --> 01:58:25,768
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1638
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:29,521
I am here to ask your daughter

1639
01:58:29,573 --> 01:58:31,533
for her hands in marriage.

1640
01:58:31,575 --> 01:58:33,816
You want to marry my daughter?

1641
01:58:33,869 --> 01:58:35,777
Yes.

1642
01:58:35,829 --> 01:58:37,288
Come here,

1643
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:38,873
there is a man at the door.

1644
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:42,668
He wants to marry you.

1645
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:44,086
But I've never seen him before.

1646
01:58:44,128 --> 01:58:45,535
Who cares?

1647
01:58:45,587 --> 01:58:47,829
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1648
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:50,915
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1649
01:58:50,967 --> 01:58:55,711
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1650
01:58:55,763 --> 01:58:59,506
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1651
01:58:59,558 --> 01:59:01,049
You! Stay here.

1652
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:04,052
As if I would. Stupid!

1653
01:59:06,981 --> 01:59:11,777
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1654
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:17,647
Wait. Wait.

1655
01:59:20,994 --> 01:59:22,401
Oh, no.

1656
01:59:23,913 --> 01:59:25,790
You better not say yes, Father.

1657
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,834
Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1658
01:59:33,964 --> 01:59:37,582
- Look, we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1659
01:59:37,634 --> 01:59:42,044
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1660
01:59:43,764 --> 01:59:45,724
No.

1661
01:59:47,809 --> 01:59:51,010
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

1662
01:59:51,062 --> 01:59:54,649
Just a moment, I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1663
01:59:54,691 --> 01:59:56,734
- Unless...
- What?

1664
01:59:56,776 --> 01:59:59,351
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1665
01:59:59,403 --> 02:00:01,937
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1666
02:00:02,573 --> 02:00:05,690
- OK.
- Yes!

1667
02:00:05,742 --> 02:00:10,121
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1668
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,055
(Beeping)

1669
02:01:11,926 --> 02:01:14,543
(lnaudible through glass)

1670
02:01:15,721 --> 02:01:18,129
(Chattering excitedly)

1671
02:01:22,936 --> 02:01:25,553
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1672
02:01:25,605 --> 02:01:27,815
Cool!

1673
02:02:02,054 --> 02:02:04,129
Joanna.

1674
02:02:05,182 --> 02:02:07,257
Sam?

1675
02:02:10,478 --> 02:02:14,774
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1676
02:02:14,815 --> 02:02:18,517
Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

1677
02:03:11,032 --> 02:03:13,607
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1678
02:03:13,659 --> 02:03:15,703
This man wants to marry her.

1679
02:03:15,745 --> 02:03:18,497
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1680
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:39,224
Boa noite, Aurelia.

1681
02:03:40,767 --> 02:03:42,842
Boa noite, Jamie.

1682
02:03:58,157 --> 02:04:01,160
Beautiful Aurelia...

1683
02:04:01,202 --> 02:04:05,414
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1684
02:04:06,498 --> 02:04:08,708
to marriage me.

1685
02:04:10,043 --> 02:04:14,870
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1686
02:04:16,507 --> 02:04:23,503
but sometimes things are so transparency,

1687
02:04:24,806 --> 02:04:28,226
they don't need evidential proof.

1688
02:04:30,144 --> 02:04:36,150
And I will inhabit here,
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1689
02:04:36,191 --> 02:04:38,725
Definitely go for England, girl.

1690
02:04:38,777 --> 02:04:42,061
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1691
02:04:43,072 --> 02:04:49,078
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me,

1692
02:04:49,954 --> 02:04:54,666
and of course I prediction you say no....

1693
02:04:55,750 --> 02:05:03,664
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to...check.

1694
02:05:07,886 --> 02:05:11,504
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1695
02:05:14,309 --> 02:05:16,383
(English) Thank you.

1696
02:05:18,187 --> 02:05:20,262
That will be nice.

1697
02:05:22,524 --> 02:05:25,308
Yes is being my answer.

1698
02:05:26,987 --> 02:05:29,312
Easy question.

1699
02:05:29,364 --> 02:05:31,814
(Portuguese) What did you say?

1700
02:05:31,866 --> 02:05:33,242
Yes, of course.

1701
02:05:33,492 --> 02:05:35,942
(Cheering)

1702
02:05:35,995 --> 02:05:38,320
Bravo!

1703
02:06:03,686 --> 02:06:05,844
(English) You learned English?

1704
02:06:06,355 --> 02:06:08,565
Just in cases.

I have made the wrong choice,

picked wrong Englishman.

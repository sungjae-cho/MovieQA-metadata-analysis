There was a girl in a pink dress.

751

She was with some bloke. Erm, Officer.

752

you just turn tail and run.

The situation was... Complicated.

1267
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,010
You lied to me all night long,

1268
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,595
because you're a princess and you think

1269
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,388
you can get away with whatever you like.

01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:14,973

- Lizzy.

1274
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,066
- Lizzy is fine.
- No. No, it's not. Not any more.

1275
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,235
You made a first-class prat out of me.

Well, I had to.

01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,995

a cup of blooming tea for myself.

Not once, not properly.

1280
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,962
Even in the ATS, I had to sit between
chaperones and come home for dinner

while the rest of them ate compo rations.

- Yes.
- Poor old boy.

Got on with it, though.

No. He doesn't care for my type.

Then Soho.

1438
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,045
- Soho?
- An interesting place.

1439

that everyone was just wild for...

1440
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:19,137
By the way, what's a knocking shop?

Papa... Mummy.

1445
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,338
Sorry we're late.

1446
01:24:57,885 --> 01:24:59,677
This is my friend, Jack Hodges.

1447
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:03,806
He should have breakfast with us.

1448
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,151
I don't think that that
would be appropriate.

1449
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,189
Well, I do.

1450
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,838
We heard your speech, sir.

1451
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,175
In a pub.

1452
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,094
KING GEORGE: Did you indeed? In a pub?

1453
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,681
Presumably everyone was too drunk
to take any notice.

1454
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,311
Actually, they liked it.

1455
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,232
They liked it very much.

1456
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,907
Where did you meet my daughter?

1457
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:04,951
On the number 14 bus.

1458
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,246
Really? I've always wanted to go on a bus.

1459
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,789
I jumped on the wrong one.

1460
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,541
Margaret was on the number nine, you see.

1461
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,198
Jack's been wonderful all night.

1462
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,837
Really?

1463
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,505
In what way wonderful?

1464
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,509
I was very lucky to have him

1465
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:23,386
to look after me.

1466
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,680
He's a hero, you know.

1467
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,182
He flew more than 50 missions over Germany.

1468
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:30,434
Oh, right. How did you get along?

1469
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,479
I did the best I could.

1470
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:36,858
You see that badge?

1471
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:38,776
That one?

1472
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:42,405
It indicates Jack's an ace
and has shot down at least five planes.

1473
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,233
He thinks I don't know
what that badge means, but I do.

1474
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:46,659
He's a bit of a good 'un underneath.

1475
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:47,743

I don't see what's so funny.

1478
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,887
Jack has to go somewhere now

1479
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,851
and I would like a word with him
before he does.

1480
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,725
Oh, and I owe him some money.

1481
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,018
How much?

1482
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,448
Seven pounds, eleven and fourpence, please.

1483
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:16,522
Well, we...

1484
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,524
Don't keep much here,

1485
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:22,403
but I'll, er, have a whip-round
amongst the footmen.

1486
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:45,843
So...

1487
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:49,889
You seem to have
brought her home for us safe and sound.

1488
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,394
Well done.

1489
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,314
- For everything.
- Thank you, sir.

You spent last night at the Ritz.

1493

Lillibet.

1494
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,381
I'm having luncheon
with the American ambassador.

1495

1496
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:28,886
I'd like that.

1497
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:30,930
Oh, good.

1498
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:34,475

By the way,

1504
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,537
I don't think the future
belongs to just my lot.

1505
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,709
And I don't think you do either.

1506
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,549
Right.

1507
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,327

1515

He's rather influential.

1516
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,198
- Actually, I could call.
- No.

1517
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,367
Thank you,
but I can take care of it myself.

1518
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,912

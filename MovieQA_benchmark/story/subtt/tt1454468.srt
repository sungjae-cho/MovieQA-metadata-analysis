480
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,962
Alright .

481
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:05,136
Let us stabilize yourself .

482
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:21,735
Alright .

483
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:25,549
Let's go to the Chinese station .

484
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:27,926
Houston , blind calls .

485
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:33,891
Tiangong located about 100 km to the west ...

486
00:54:34,056 --> 00:54:37,495
and I strayed around ...

487
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:41,702
13 degrees .
I will reset the trajectory path .

488
00:55:07,448 --> 00:55:09,021
Alright .

00:55:10,447 --> 00:55:16,671
I 'll turn on the SKD in
5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ...

490
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,308
What happened ?

491
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:37,783

Come on .

493
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,833
You must be kidding .

494
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,387
You must be kidding !

495
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:20,441

Woof ... Woof ...

00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:10,182
I'm going to die , Aningaaq .

516
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:16,034
I know , we're all going to die .
Everyone knows it .

517
00:59:16,192 --> 00:59:18,770
But I'm going to die today .

518
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:25,006
Funny thing , you know .
Because know .

519
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:30,819
The problem I'm still scared .

520
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:33,385
I was really scared .

521
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:39,516
Nobody will mourn for me .
No one will pray for my soul .

522
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,359
You want to mourn for me ?

523
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,789
You want to pray for me ?

524
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,336
Or maybe it's too late .

525
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:59,059
I will pray myself, but I 've never
prayed all my life , so ...

526
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:02,023
No one ever taught me .

527
01:00:05,845 --> 01:00:08,315
No one ever taught me .

528
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:21,133
Baby ...

529
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:36,286
There baby with you ?

530
01:00:38,203 --> 01:00:40,648
What you 're singing the songs Nina Bobo ?

531
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:45,208
Sweet.

532
01:00:47,288 --> 01:00:50,044
I used to sing it to my baby .

533
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,790
I will soon meet him .

534
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:09,267
Tunable once , Aningaaq .
Keep singing like that .

535
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,567
Sing until I sleep
and I'm going to sleep .

536
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:45,735
Do not , do not , do not !

537
01:03:32,637 --> 01:03:38,192
30 hours 11 minutes , contact Anatoly
and say his record is solved .

538
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:41,111
- A bit blurry here , is not it ?
- How did you get here ?

539
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:44,823
- Trust me , it's an amazing story .
- But how ?

540
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:47,893
That's better .

541
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:52,170
Extra backup power ,
Conserve battery power .

542
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:54,905
Glad you were not there to bother me .

543
01:03:54,993 --> 01:03:56,595
I have to admit ...

544
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,374
Nice to meet you ,
I did not think you would survive .

545
01:03:59,414 --> 01:04:01,252
Have you found her vodka ?

546
01:04:02,563 --> 01:04:04,552
You never told me where .

547
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:13,190
For Anatoly .

548
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:15,297
Cheers .

549
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:22,993
Do not want to ?
Alright .

550
01:04:23,408 --> 01:04:25,236
Let's get out of here .

551
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:31,442
China Station is just 100 Mil ,
It's like a walk in the day of the week .

552
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,467
- I can not .
- Sure you can .

553
01:04:33,562 --> 01:04:37,064
- No fuel , already tried everything .
- Well , there's always something that can be done .

554
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,495
- I tried everything .
- Have you tried a jet landing ?

555
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:43,349
- That to landing , so ...
- Landing and launch it the same ...

556
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:47,005
- You do not learn it in training ?
- Never before landing simulator training , I told you .

557
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:49,365
- But you're about it , right?
- And I always crashed ...

558
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:52,441
Listen, do you want to go home or want to stay here ?

559
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,778
I understand , once comfortable up here .

560
01:05:00,537 --> 01:05:04,907
You can , turn off all system ...

561
01:05:05,294 --> 01:05:07,468
Turn off all the lights ...

562
01:05:08,222 --> 01:05:11,244
Close your eyes and lose everything .

563
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:13,859
No one can hurt you ...

564
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,787
You're safe ...

565
01:05:18,822 --> 01:05:21,963
So what good is it to survive ?
What's the point of living ?

566
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:28,166
Your son is gone .

567
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:30,713
Nothing is more painful than that .

568
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,454
Still questioning what you're doing now .

569
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:40,556
If you decide to go ,
So just do it .

570
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,739
Sit back and enjoy the journey .

571
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,520
You're going to set down both feet on the ground
and began to move on.

572
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,191
How did you get here ?

573
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:51,684
I told you , it's an incredible story .

574
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:53,454
Hey , Ryan .

575
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:54,843
What ?

576
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:56,893
Time to go home .

577
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:42,368
Landing .

578
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:46,600
Landing , the landing .

579
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,506
All right , landing .
The landing of the color green .

580
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:19,480
Alright .

581
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:22,860
All right , landing .

582
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:30,219
Jet landing will automatically turn
exactly 3 meters before landing , so ...

583
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,058
Oh, you clever bastard , Matt .

584
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:37,003
I had to ...

585
01:07:37,088 --> 01:07:41,341
I had to get rid of the rear engine ...

586
01:07:42,503 --> 01:07:44,391
Okay , okay ...

587
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,032
Okay ...

588
01:07:47,682 --> 01:07:49,131
Okay ...

589
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:54,280
Separation of three modules ...

590
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,265
Began .

591
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:11,968
Well ...

592
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,081
Houston , this is the tricky part .

593
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:21,498
Soyuz have to think , we just
within three meters of the Earth .

594
01:08:23,758 --> 01:08:24,842
Alright .

595
01:08:24,937 --> 01:08:30,761
Hey , Matt , because I kept hearing
story for this week ...

596
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,873
I want you to do something for me .

597
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:36,908
You'll meet a
brown-haired little girl ...

598
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:39,602
Very wrinkled, irregular .

599
01:08:39,986 --> 01:08:41,713
He does not like to comb it .

600
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:43,760
That's all right.

601
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,186
Her name is Sarah .

602
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:49,206
Could you please tell him ...

603
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,745
Mothers have found your red shoes .

604
01:08:52,426 --> 01:08:55,133
He was very concerned about the shoes, Matt .

605
01:08:55,525 --> 01:08:57,947
It turns out there was under his bed .

606
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:06,320
Give hugs and kisses for me .
Say if the mother missed her .

607
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:09,190
Tell him , he is the angel .

608
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:13,677
He makes me proud .
Very , very proud .

609
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:20,636
and tell him I will not give up .

610
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:30,012
Tell him I love him , Matt .

611
01:09:30,606 --> 01:09:33,386
Tell her I love her very much .

612
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,783
Can you do that for me ?

613
01:09:40,068 --> 01:09:41,882
Understandable .

614
01:09:43,533 --> 01:09:45,040
This is it .

615
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:24,563
<i> You're losing altitude , Tiangong . < / i >

Shenzou , Shenzou .

628
01:14:44,378 --> 01:14:46,621
On the Soyuz , the power button ...

629
01:14:46,706 --> 01:14:48,015
Herein .

630
01:14:50,671 --> 01:14:53,310
Okay , undocking , undocking .

Eenie , meenie ...

632
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:58,633
Okay , it does not sound good .

Moe .

635
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:04,693
I do not speak Chinese .

636
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:08,355
Miny , Moe ...

637
01:15:09,845 --> 01:15:12,620
Okay , sounds good .

638
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:23,296
Houston , Houston , calls the blind ...

639
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,058
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone ,
Reporting from Shenzou .

640
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:29,778
I will soon be separated from Thiangong ...

641
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:36,625
Do I have a bad feeling about this mission ?

642
01:15:39,052 --> 01:15:41,290
Remind me when it's orange .

643
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,458
Not so , Houston .

644
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,327
It's getting orange .

645
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,611
Getting hot here .
Alright .

646
01:15:55,962 --> 01:16:00,622
Well , according to my observations ,
There are only two possible outcomes .

647
01:16:01,335 --> 01:16:05,448
I got down safely ,
and had a remarkable story to tell.

648
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:08,122
Or I'll burn in 10 minutes ahead .

649
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:11,865
Will I lead them all.

650
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,503
It costs nothing .

651
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:23,384
By the way ...

652
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:27,874
It will be an incredible journey .

653
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:31,547

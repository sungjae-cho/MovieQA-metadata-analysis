170
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,199
It's all so unprecedented. I'm at a
loss coming up with proper punishment.

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,679
As Lissa's guardian...

172
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,919
You're not an official
guardian, Hathaway.

173
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,119
You are a novice.

174
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,919
You put Vasilisa at the
mercy of the Strigoi,

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,359

or even worse, transform...

Yes. My Sandovsky's
syndrome has gotten worse.

Oh, Victor, we never
meant to worry you.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,959
Headmistress,

185
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,839
these girls have been
through so much.

186
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,799
As provost of this school

187
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,439
and Lissa's father's oldest friend,

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,919
I beg you, look into your heart.

189
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,199
Vasilisa, I have the
utmost sympathy

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,639
for the loss of your parents
and your brother, Andre.

191
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,039
But why did you flee a
heavily guarded compound

192
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,319
of Moroi students from
all over the world?

193
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,199
It's not easy to explain.

194
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,879
Lissa felt more in danger here
in your secure environment

195
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,199
than on the outside as
an anonymous teenager.

196
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,246
Fascinating. This is where
you give me specifics.

197
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,999
Where's Ms. Karp?

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
She should be here.

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,359
She can maybe shed some
light onto the situation.

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,291
Ms. Karp is no longer
part of this institution.

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,767
I...

202
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,719
This is where you give me specifics.
What do you mean?

203
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,251
It's not important!

204
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,079
Vasilisa Dragomir is from one
of the 12 royal families.

205
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,679
She's the last of
the Dragomir line.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,999
With my condition taking the
Dashkov family out of contention,

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,079
Lissa is a possible
successor to the throne.

208
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,079
But you, Hathaway, a Dhampir
girl cut off from the community,

209
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,079
out on civilian streets without a
dime or a Social Security number?

210
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,479
"Blood whore" is such an ugly term,

211
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,639
but I'm sure Moroi men on
business trips would pay a lot

212
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,039
for the especially sweet taste.

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,039
Headmistress Kirova.

214
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,439
- They have the bond.
- That's... that's impossible.

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,759
In my brief observation period,

216
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,159
Rose could tell what Lissa
was thinking or feeling,

217
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,279
sometimes without being
in the same place.

218
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,679
What a rare and wonderful gift.

219
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,959
This doesn't take away from the fact
that Rose Hathaway is wild, dangerous...

220
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,519
- insubordinate, vulgar.
- Right here, folks. Right here.

221
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,199
But the number of female Dhampir
guardians has gone down

222
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,759
way too much to risk losing
one with such potential.

223
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,399
Ellen, what this impressive new
guardian says seems reasonable.

224
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,839
We're so sorry, Headmistress.

225
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,199
After the crash, I lacked a strong
parental figure to confide in.

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,559
I'm afraid Rose and I got
in way over our heads.

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,959
Hathaway can stay, but no
extracurricular activities,

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,279
no parties, no socializing,
nothing resembling fun.

LISSA: Before the accident,
my father used to say

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,559
that for a Moroi not declaring a magic
is like not going through puberty.

240
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,999
Yeah, and he also used to
say practice during the day

my condolences at the funeral.

from the other instructors.

- (SCOFFS) Don't be absurd.
- Said the girl licking the wall.

Lissa, I can clean it up.
I'm sorry.

677
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,439
Leave it. The misspelling shows it was
just a bunch of stupid teenagers.

678
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,919
OK, you know what, I'm gonna
go start packing. I'm really...

679
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,359
No, Rose. We can't just keep running
away, at least until we know

680
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,639
what we're running away from.

681
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,719
Ooh! A mystery, how exciting.

682

We can be like three
Nancy Drews trying...

683
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,079
I hate mysteries. I would prefer a
good Strigoi attack at this point

684
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,159
because at least I'd know what
those homicidal bloodsuckers want.

No more. I am taking our
dear beloved queen's advice,

Mia is the mastermind.

Yeah, but we didn't even
really know Mini-Mia

leave for the first time.

we should be focused on.

Do what you have to do, Dhampir. I am
done trying to crawl under the radar.

692
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,119
It's not possible, and...
it's not effective.

Don't worry, Natalie
knows of my skills.

keeping it from her.

Are you going to use
compulsion on Mia?

Where's the fun in that?

699
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,919
I'm going to use compulsion
on everyone but Mia.

such a large scale...

- What?
- Yeah, I was there.

704
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,639
And the poison that that freak

705
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,719

makes me want to vomit.

You've already taken too
many hits for me, Rose.

Look, it's your turn
to have a little cry,

kick a little ass.

to bring up family.

- I should go and talk to Lissa.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

just stay away from her.

with the dark side, and she's done.

killing during the feeding process.

one personally, as a friend.

or me or Lissa...

You hesitate, and that
hesitation could kill you.

But the Dhampir must always bow down.
I get it. The Moroi come first.

748
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,999
Not always. My father was a Moroi.

"Vladimir had mastered
a very rare magic,

and this magic had a name: Spirit."

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,399

been beating herself up

about not being able
to declare a magic.

This makes Lissa more special

I ever even imagined.

I guess I should be happy that the bad

more sick and disgusting.

- I know.

Both a little on the nose, but...

00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,079
No, maybe they're so obvious
that they're not obvious.

1154
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,879
I did see Kirova with
Mia the other night.

1155
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,559
OK, my conspiracy theory of choice

1156
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,839
is that someone might be
trying to drive Lissa mad,

1157
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,839
to take her out of
throne contention.

1158
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,079
I mean, we all know Queen
Tatiana has her issues.

1159
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,719
All three witches could
be working together.

1160
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,199
I like the way your mind works.
Just hold that thought.

1161
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,359
"At times, after the expense of
power and in times of trauma,

1162
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,879
Vladimir's agony would manifest
directly onto his skin."

1163
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,119
So this proves that
Lissa's not a freak.

1164
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,039
Sort of. I mean, it shows that
she could be rehabilitated.

1165
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,959
Wait. Lissa does something
like that to herself?

00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,039
- Cuts and scars and...
- Yes.

your support these past few weeks.

hasn't been herself.

- Rose.
- Hey, what's up?

1337
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,399
- (SIGHING) OK.
- Rose, you look...

1338
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,919
No, you don't get to stare at her.

1339
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,999
I took it upon myself to talk to
these royal pains in the butt.

1340
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,359
ROSE: Hmm.

1341
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,919
Don't you have something to say?

1342
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,439
- We're sorry.
- Hmm.

1343
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,479
We didn't do anything to
you that we said we did.

1344
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,119
You're telling something that never
happened actually never happened?

1345
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,279
Thanks.

1346
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,119
Mia let us have sex with
her if we obeyed her.

1347
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,279
I tagged the note at the church
and air-blasted the memorial.

1348
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,999
What did you think of
the scary screen saver?

1349
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,879
We actually put a lot
of work into that.

1350
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,439
And the bloody one just happened.

1351
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,199
We thought it'd be fun to all
hook up in the princess's room,

1352
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,479
and things got out
of hand, literally.

1353
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,359
It's called blood splash.
It's a new Moroi fad,

you fang open your wrist and spray.</i>

Ew! Stop. I nap on that couch.

1356
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,879
OK, what about the cat?

1357
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,159
We thought it was a fox.

1358
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,159
Hurting animals...
that's disgusting.

1359
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,839
Said the creepy blood splasher.

1360
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,610

1361
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,041

Ever feel like you're
being watched?

1369

Can we pretend the past
month never happened?

1370
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,039
Why were you in the hospital?
Pregnant?

1371
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,999
- I guess not.
- Herpes?

1372
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,919
Maybe your baby has herpes.
I don't care if it's true. I'll tell...

1373
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,919
- Go away, Mia.
- Why are you Dragomirs such drags?

1374

First Andre, then you steal Aaron
from me and don't even keep him.

- I vow to take down the entire...

Allow me, Mr. Ozera.

made a great team.

everything, and poor Aaron

had no idea what a
sociopath you really are.

- I've seen you in action.
- Why are you doing this?

1448
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,119
My dear, the simple truth is,
I need you to heal me.

1449
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,959
Testing you with the
animals was misguided,

1450

but earth-magicking the cement

is bathed in a very
expensive love charm,

to be of much use to you.

You were my family's
most cherished friend.

1459
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,119
Why didn't you just ask me?

1460
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,959
How touching...
genuinely, my darling,

1461
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,999
but a chronic disease
like my Sandovsky's needs

1462
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,759
continual healings, and then
there is the other matter.

1464
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,439
Yes, Spirit users take their
power from their own essence.

1465
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,999
To heal another requires
giving part of oneself,

1466
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,319
and it can destroy one over time.

1467
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,439
You want me to give
up my life for yours.

1468
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,319
Basically. But, you see, my dear,

1469
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,319
I am much more important than you,

1470
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,759
and the Moroi need a strong
leader, but my disease means

1471
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,919
that I cannot occupy my
rightful place upon the throne.

1472
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,239

the innocent you thought she was.

1670

provided me with the intel

To become a Strigoi,
don't you have to...

1678
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,599
Yes. I chose Ray to be my first.

1690

There's so much to read here.

1721
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,559
Apparently, Vladimir and Anna
almost drowned in this flood,

1722
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,919
but he saved them from certain
death, and listen to this.

"It took many years for Vladimir to
master the power of his Spirit."

"Despite his sufferings
and delusions,"

1725

"he never contemplated
the way of the Strigoi,"

1726
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,239
"because he always
had the strength"

1727
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,319
"of his shadow-kissed guardian,
Anna, to see him through."

is kindness and dignity and something
more original than gossip,

Yes. I did.

Why would you do that?

1779
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,759
It's more than my age and
my position at the academy.

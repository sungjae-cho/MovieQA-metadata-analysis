1
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,541
There was no one like Hal.

2
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:34,347
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

3
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:36,045
"Blue Moon" was playing.

4
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:37,747
- You know "Blue Moon?"
- Sure.

5
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,189
I still remember that.

6
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:45,428
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

7
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,466
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

8
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:53,230
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

9
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,265
Is that a joke?

10
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:59,809
The sex was always great.
Well, he was nine years older than me.

11
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,037
He'd already made
and lost a fortune.

12
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,275
But then he made it back, and more.
I mean, much more.

13
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,782
God, he was dynamic.

14
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,717
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking...

15
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,118
...not that I care
to get too graphic.

16
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,556
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

17
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,389
Cocktails, they call them.

18
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,191
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,628
I never trusted doctors.

20
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:24,463
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

21
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:26,501
I have never been
to San Francisco.

22
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,732
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

23
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:32,776
I'll be staying with my sister, Ginger.
She's divorced.

24
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:37,210
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. We're both adopted.

25
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,146
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

26
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,320
That's mine. The Vuitton.

27
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,422
My plan is to start
a new life out here.

28
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,252
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

29
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,659
Go West. Was it Horace Greeley
who said that? "Go West. "

30
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:56,164
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

31
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,962
Oh, I'll call you, maybe for lunch.

32
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:01,503
I don't have your number.

33
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:06,540
- Who's that woman you were talking to?
- I was sitting next to her on the plane.

34
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,178
She was talking to herself.

35
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,042
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

36
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,275
But she couldn't stop babbling
about her life.

37
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,960
Where...?
Where am I exactly?

38
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,369
You said 305 South Van Ness.

39
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,579
- Can you wait, help me
with my bags? - Sure.

40
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,347
I don't know where she is.

41
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:56,787
She expected me.

42
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:59,922
The plane was on time.

43
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,902
- Yes, I'm...
- You all right?

44
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:12,064
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath...

45
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:17,178
...and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

46
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,042
Okay.

47
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,308
- Could I have some privacy?
- Sure, sure.

48
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,249
Hello, Ginger?

49
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,923
Yes, I'm here.
I'm right in front of the place.

50
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,252
It is 305?

51
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,124
Well, how long?

52
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,424
What?
Where is it?

53
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:42,127
No, no, I see it.
Okay. Oh, okay.

54
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,830
Just- Would you please hurry?
My sister left the keys in the bar.

55
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,976
- Can you wait?
- Sure!.

56
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,260
Is that it?

57
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,568
Thank you.

58
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,472
Oh, thank you.

59
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:23,668
Have a great day, all right?
Bye-bye.

60
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:30,681
- So, what do you think?
- I love it.

61
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,820
The fireplaces work.
I don't like when they're for show.

62
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,820
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

63
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:39,892
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view...

64
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,655
- You wanted Fifth Avenue.
- Central Park. Superb.

65
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,592
Oh, this space is perfect.

66
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,494
We hardly have to do a thing.

67
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,033
- You shouldn't spoil me so.
- Well, why not?

68
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,830
Who else am I gonna spoil?
Did I tell you my news?

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,167
- What? - Danny is
gonna be living with us.

70
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,434
Oh, honey.
Oh, that's great news.

71
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,806
I worked it out with his mom,
her lawyers.

72
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:03,212
Oh, he'll be so much happier
when he's with us full-time.

73
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,415
Happy birthday, Danny.

74
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:11,823
Kids at school say we're really rich
and that you give money to charity.

75
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:14,859
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life...

76
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,792
...to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

77
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,694
Not everyone is as
lucky as we are.

78
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,026
- Domingo?
- Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,000
- Another bottle of the Margaux.
- Sure.

80
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,463
Excuse me.

81
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:29,040
- It would look perfect.
- Wouldn't wash me out?

82
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:30,972
No, not at all. Not the way he...

83
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh, isn't he sweet?

84
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,449
This song was playing
when Hal and I first met.

85
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:41,713
- I fell in love with the name Jasmine.
- Oh, so romantic.

86
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,550
I changed it.

87
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:48,091
Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.

88
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,464
This song was playing
when we first met.

89
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,693
You know it? Yeah, we met
at a party at Martha's Vineyard.

90
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:00,104
"Blue Moon. "

91
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:03,065
Come on, boys.

92
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,370
Okay, let's go, Augie.
I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.

93
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,571
We helped Dad
move the furniture today.

94
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:12,478
Oh, really? That's your idea
of taking the boys?

95
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:15,586
Letting them help you lug
somebody's furniture upstairs?

96
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,756
- They loved it. Great exercise.
- Yeah?

97
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,720
- They- We ate franks
and beans. - Yeah.

98
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,760
- Relax. - Okay. Let's go,
Johnny, come on.

99
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,760
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- What's the rush?

100
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,194
What's the rush, Ginger?
You got a date?

101
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,869
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,369
- It happens to be Jeanette, so...
- Jeanette?

103
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,439
Jasmine?
What is she doing in town?

104
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:39,372
She's living with me
till she gets back on her feet.

105
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,274
She's had a bad time. Yeah.

106
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:44,243
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

107
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,440
Now that she's broke,
she's moving in.

108
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,642
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

109
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,412
And it's none of your damn
business. She's family.

110
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,113
- She stole our money.
- Okay.

111
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:57,455
Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

112
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:01,758
For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

113
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,094
What the hell did she know
about finance?

114
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:08,102
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years...

115
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:11,139
...up to his ass in phony real
estate and bank fraud.

116
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,970
She knew nothing about it?

117
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:16,773
Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

118
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,974
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in...

119
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:23,313
- ... she just looked the other way.
- I don't think so, Augie.

120
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:28,821
You said it. You said to me,
"She's a phony and had to know. "

121
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,256
Jasmine, your country house
is so beautiful.

122
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:35,091
- See? - I'm sorry, but we
need an answer on this.

123
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,961
I told you, you change the
name of the corporation.

124
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,263
- Operate under Global Innovations.
- I don't know if we can.

125
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:42,803
I think we can, actually.

126
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,635
- Pay out of the accounts in
Amsterdam. - Amsterdam.

127
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:49,643
Whenever I hear them, they're one step
ahead of the Justice Department.

128
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:51,678
Just hope your
house is not bugged.

129
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,715
Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

130
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,943
I have no head for
that sort of thing.

131
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,521
- We transfer to the old corporation?
- We could. Perfectly legal.

132
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:04,990
- It would be a mistake under that name.
- Definitely get in trouble for that.

133
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,391
Just don't file a joint tax return.

134
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,293
Don't say that. I sign anything.
I'm very trusting.

135
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,832
Famous last words.

136
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,402
It's called looking the other way.

137
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,504
Jasmine.
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,678
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

139
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,313
Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.

140
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,710
- Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.
- It's okay.

141
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,215
- No, it's fine.
- Augie's day with the boys.

142
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,183
Well, no wonder you're late.

143
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,117
- Hello. Matthew, is it?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,884
Boys, say hello.
I told you about her, remember?

145
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,560
- Hi, I'm Jasmine.
- Shake hands. Okay, go play.

146
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,195
- They're big.
- I know.

147
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,524
- I'm getting it first.
- Quiet, you two.

148
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,361
- Well, they're loud.
- Stop running around.

149
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,333
Christ, this kid's got...
What the hell is it? ADD?

150
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,998
- Yeah. Your place is homey.
- Are you kidding me?

151
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,736
No, I mean, it"s got a very...
Well, it's casual charm.

152
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,642
God, knock it off, Jasmine.

153
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,349
I need to stay here
for a while. No, I do.

154
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,946
- I'm out of cash.
- Okay.

155
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,886
Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe...

156
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,085
...I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

157
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:17,390
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

158
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,260
And the lawyers.

159
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,095
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

160
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,897
I really get some bad thoughts
when I'm alone.

161
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,598
Well, you know, all I can say is,
you look great.

162
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,076
- Now who's lying?
- You do.

163
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,113
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious...

164
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,806
- ... about moving here.
- Yeah?

165
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,747
- I wasn't sure how angry
you still were. - Oh, well...

166
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,821
- Another drink? We're celebrating.
- Of course, yeah.

167
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,288
Oh, the flight was bumpy.

168
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:50,624
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

169
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:53,698
I mean, you'd think
first class, right?

170
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:55,759
You flew first class?

171
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,700
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

172
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:02,603
- Isn't first class a fortune?
- Yes, I was quite shocked.

173
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,746
- I thought you were tapped out.
- I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

174
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,143
I've run up some serious debts.

175
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,147
So how did you fly first class?

176
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:15,220
I don't know, Ginger.
I just did.

177
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:19,154
All I meant was, if you've got
no money, to go first class...

178
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,157
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

179
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,423
Would you stop staring
at my luggage?

180
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,794
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

181
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,671
- You told me you had to sell everything.
- Look, look, look.

182
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:36,672
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

183
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:40,243
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

184
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,278
God, I hate to tell
you about that.

185
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:46,748
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef...

186
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:49,945
...until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell...

187
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:52,750
...and then it seems
you can't give it away.

188
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,161
Kids, stop it, come on!

189
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:00,131
- Were you adopted?
- Yes.

190
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,164
We were both adopted.

191
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,031
Born to different moms and dads,
but raised by the same mom and dad.

192
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,865
Could you stop doing that
gun thing? Sorry.

193
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:12,134
- Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.
- Matthew.

194
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,471
Did you like the new mom and dad?

195
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,648
- Yes, of course...
- Aunt Jasmine did.

196
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,012
I ran away from home
as fast as my feet could carry me.

197
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,210
- How come?
- Well...

198
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,889
Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine
and not me.

199
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,183
- Oh, stop.
- How come?

200
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,725
- She had better genes.
- Don't tell them that.

201
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:33,386
- Well, am I lying?
- Dad said you're glad we lived far away.

202
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,367
What?

203
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:38,995
They're perfect for the dress
that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

204
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,737
What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

205
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:48,901
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I...
I just got a call from my sister, Ginger.

206
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:53,413
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

207
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,085
He is a piece of work.

208
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,879
I just... I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

209
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,455
- The one in San Francisco, the builder?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:04,354
Oh, no, he's a contractor.
I mean, he's... No, he's a handyman.

211
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,690
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

212
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,834
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

213
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,093
Okay, that happens.

214
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:15,328
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

215
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,976
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

216
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,878
- Hi.
- Oh, you made it.

217
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,106
- How lovely to see you.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

218
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,907
- Welcome.
- Hi. Thank you.

219
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,279
- Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
- Augie.

220
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,647
- This is Jeanette.
- Jasmine. I changed it.

221
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,448
- Jasmine. - I'm finally
getting to meet the sister.

222
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:38,560
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry
we couldn't make it to the wedding.

223
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:41,253
Just that Hal had some business
in Saint-Tropez.

224
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:43,456
- Couldn't get back in time.
- Know what?

225
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:47,103
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

226
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,795
- He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
- I know. Hey...

227
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:52,668
Hal! You remember Ginger.

228
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,274
- Oh, my gosh.
- How are you?

229
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:55,968
- How are you?
- This is Augie.

230
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,874
- Augie. How you doing?
- Awesome.

231
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,981
- Hell of a place you got.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:02,083
- Why don't you come through?
- Told you.

233
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:04,150
- Yvette, coffee?
- This is really...

234
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,513
Yeah, she's got taste.

235
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,689
It's like what you
see in the movies.

236
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:11,655
We have so much to catch up on.
Can't wait for you to show us New York.

237
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:13,886
Why don't you take
our car and driver?

238
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:17,327
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

239
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:21,196
- No, no, I will definitely make
some time. - Oh, good.

240
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,499
Where are you staying?

241
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:28,199
Oh, well, we... We thought about
asking if we could stay with you...

242
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:31,845
...but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

243
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,912
- Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
- Yeah.

244
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:37,108
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

245
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,514
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, it's not necessary.

246
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,849
Please, you're our guests.
I insist.

247
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:45,493
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

248
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,030
- What? Tonight?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:51,823
We have dinner plans.

250
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,969
I don't think we can...
Something we can't get out of.

251
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:56,661
- I'm sorry.
- There'll be time.

252
00:14:56,872 --> 00:15:00,170
We stashed the kids with Augie's sister,
we're here for a week.

253
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,206
- It's gonna be great.
- It is. Okay.

254
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,968
Well, we don't have
a lot of free time...

255
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,081
...but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

256
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:09,715
I mean, or Daniel. I mean...

257
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,715
- They'd get a kick out of that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:17,186
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

259
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:22,724
- I love how you're doing your hair.
- Oh, thanks.

260
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,196
You'll have to take me shopping.
You always could pick clothes.

261
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,564
And Augie's got
some exciting business news...

262
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,900
...he wants to talk to Hal about.

263
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,975
Don't worry, I don't need
to borrow money. We're flush.

264
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,373
- Yeah, - What kind of
work do you do, Augie?

265
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,913
Well, you know,
I do, like, repairs, furniture moving...

266
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,107
...but I got plans to be my own boss.

267
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:48,014
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

268
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:49,621
Hey, could we have a tour?

269
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:54,088
Oh, yeah, of course.
Why don't you start in the kitchen?

270
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,388
- Is there a little girls' room?
- Just down the hall.

271
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,357
Five days.

272
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:03,263
I'll have to invite them
to my birthday party now.

273
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:07,269
- Where did she come up with him?
- I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

274
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,271
We've got to make sure
we make their stay extra nice.

275
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,502
My God, five days.

276
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,717
Look.

277
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:21,416
It's so beautiful.

278
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:23,613
Oh, but where would I wear
a Fendi bag?

279
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:26,019
Oh, go ahead.
It's my treat.

280
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,318
- No.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,256
Really?

282
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,557
Oh, my God.
I love it. Look.

283
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:34,960
Look.

284
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,965
- Take the other one off.
- No, I like this.

285
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,075
Boy, this is some place you got here.

286
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,575
- I mean, this is unreal.
- It is.

287
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,542
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

288
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,147
I used to be a lifeguard.

289
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:52,977
Start your own construction company?
Great idea.

290
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,653
- We came into some money.
- Tell him how, Augie.

291
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:01,918
Well, the first 10, 12,000,
I really worked for.

292
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,755
Put away a little each week.

293
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:05,954
But he's not telling
you the big news.

294
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,258
- Why we're in New York.
- You tell them.

295
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,491
Okay, I will.

296
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,192
We always play the lottery...

297
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:15,634
...and we never even get two numbers.
Am I right?

298
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,330
But last week, we hit it.

299
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,440
We got 200,000 bucks.

300
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:22,010
Oh, that's fantastic.

301
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,272
- I thought I'd drop dead.
- That's great.

302
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:27,508
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

303
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,311
He was shaking when we won.

304
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:33,514
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell her,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

305
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,352
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

306
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:38,687
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

307
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:43,459
Well, if you like, I think Hal
could probably help you do better.

308
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,692
Yeah?

309
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:49,533
You know- You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to-

310
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:53,837
Hey, come on. We don't know
the first thing about money, but he does.

311
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:57,411
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

312
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:00,515
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

313
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:02,879
- There are ways.
- You see, Augie? You see?

314
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,749
Suppose I put you in a venture
that was low-risk, but very high-yield.

315
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,517
I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.
I'm talking about 20 percent.

316
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,389
- Profitable enough?
-20 percent?

317
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:15,393
He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

318
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,726
You mean,
not starting my own business.

319
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:21,234
No, we mean investing with Hal.

320
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:24,566
Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

321
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,209
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

322
00:18:27,444 --> 00:18:28,502
Ginger.

323
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:31,579
Let them in on one of your-
The hotel deal or something.

324
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:34,012
It'd be great for them. Make a killing.

325
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:37,254
- Pay attention, Augie.
- I'm paying attention.

326
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:40,346
You will make money for them,
won't you?

327
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,353
I make money, they make money.

328
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,355
God, they're hard work.

329
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,585
Tomorrow I'm taking the day off.

330
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:49,788
I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

331
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:51,761
I've got that luncheon to plan...

332
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:54,698
...the fundraiser
for the Central Park Conservancy.

333
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:57,065
I've rented them a limo and a driver...

334
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:00,800
...and I've suggested they go
to the South Street Seaport.

335
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:03,906
Can you imagine if they lived here?

336
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,273
Here, for doing your duty.

337
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:10,418
Happy birthday.

338
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:15,281
I'm giving it to you now so you can wear it
to your party tomorrow night.

339
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:19,285
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.

340
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:22,952
Not bad taste
for a philistine businessman, huh?

341
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,317
- I know, it's so extravagant.
- Oh, look at that.

342
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,050
He surprised me in the tub,
so to speak.

343
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:05,060
Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,
but it's nothing like Sardinia.

344
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,597
This year you are coming
to Palm Beach, no excuses.

345
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,398
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

346
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,039
- Who's that woman?
- Which?

347
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,731
- That one.
- Oh, Raylene.

348
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,036
She's a friend. I love Raylene.

349
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,906
We met in a yoga class.

350
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,877
- Isn't she pretty?
- Yeah.

351
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,845
She runs a modeling agency.

352
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,451
- How long have you known her?
- Few years. Why?

353
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,956
- And you trust her?
- Trust her?

354
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,625
Of course I trust her.
What kind of question is that?

355
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,522
She just seems so cozy all night
with your husband.

356
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,130
I wouldn't worry. Hal's not
the roving type, nor is Raylene.

357
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,857
- She's a very close friend.
- I don't know.

358
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,401
If it was my husband,
I'd keep an eye on him.

359
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,541
Goodness, you are a suspicious one.

360
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,437
- I'm just saying.
- Just relax.

361
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,635
I am relaxed.

362
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,942
You shouldn't drink so much, Augie.

363
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,586
Nobody wants to hear
those stupid Polish jokes, you know?

364
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,778
Oh, I had a drink?

365
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,047
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

366
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:10,160
Let me tell you, you were half in the bag
the entire night, okay?

367
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,488
Tell me about my drinking.

368
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,132
- Give me that.
- What's eating you?

369
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,894
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

370
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:22,902
- What?
- Would you tell your friend?

371
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,371
- I'm talking.
- Tell him what?

372
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,672
Are you listening to me?

373
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:33,373
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

374
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:34,949
- Would you tell him?
- Yeah.

375
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:38,246
- Bet your ass I'd tell him.
- But what if it causes trouble?

376
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:39,889
Or maybe a divorce?

377
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,185
If you don't say anything,
it could've been a passing thing.

378
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:46,089
He never knows and he lives on
happy with his wife.

379
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:49,994
You know, I would tell him,
because that's what a friend's for.

380
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,170
You gotta have his back.
That's why I'd tell him.

381
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:56,168
It's a tough call, Augie. I don't know.

382
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,165
- Ginger?
- What?

383
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,843
What are we doing?
Are we playing charades?

384
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,512
I mean, come on.

385
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:06,181
- Did you see something?
- Yeah.

386
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,907
On the street, by accident.

387
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,112
I saw Hal kissing that brunette
who was at the party.

388
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:18,183
You saw Hal kiss Raylene? Raylene?

389
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:20,453
You know her name too?

390
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,492
My God, she gets around.

391
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:26,032
Oh, we were introduced.
Come on, you got nothing to worry about.

392
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:28,431
- Yeah.
- Nobody could ever take your place.

393
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:32,472
Yeah, believe me,
I wasn't thinking she'd look at you.

394
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:35,176
- Nobody would ever look at me, right?
- Right.

395
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:39,246
- You looked at me.
- Yeah, once. It was a mistake.

396
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:43,048
- All right, listen.
- What?

397
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:45,584
You think Hal's banging her?

398
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,349
When Jasmine don't wanna
know something...

399
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,526
...she's got a habit
of looking the other way.

400
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,958
Thank you for my present.
I got so many comments.

401
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:58,463
I think everyone enjoyed themselves
and that piano player was-

402
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:01,158
He was fantastic. I got his card.

403
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,397
What were you talking to Raylene
so intensely about?

404
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:09,509
Oh, her husband is thinking about
getting his own plane.

405
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:14,513
I was just weighing the pros and cons
for her of a Challenger versus a-

406
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:17,345
- Gulfstream?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,113
- She's so pretty.
- Yeah.

408
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:23,586
Bill's out of town for a couple weeks
and she'll be all alone.

409
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:27,989
I thought maybe we could take her out
to dinner or have her over here.

410
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:29,987
- Yeah.
- Great.

411
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:31,790
Sure.

412
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,936
- This is silly, Ginger.
- Why?

413
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,266
- It's Sunday.
- So?

414
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:43,636
It's his day off.
He wants to spend it alone with you.

415
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,641
He's alone with me plenty.

416
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,316
If I'm gonna marry Chili,
you're gonna meet him sooner than later.

417
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,381
I told him we'd show you the town.

418
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:55,647
- Well, he won't want your sister around.
- Will you stop it?

419
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:59,555
This city is so beautifully European.

420
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:01,661
Have you ever been abroad?

421
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,386
- At all?
- No.

422
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:06,726
We used to sail
from Saint-Tropez to Cannes...

423
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:09,164
...and up the coast to Monaco.

424
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,797
- It reminds me of the Mediterranean.
- There's Chili.

425
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,836
- Which one?
- There.

426
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:16,940
- Who's that with him?
- I don't know.

427
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,104
- Chili.
- Hi.

428
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,143
- Hi, hey.
- You look beautiful.

429
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:23,282
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

430
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,313
- You smell good too.
- You're late.

431
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,544
- Eddie. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Ginger. Hi.

432
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:29,813
This is Jasmine.

433
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:32,115
- Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.
- This is Eddie.

434
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,486
- Nice to meet you. Eddie.
- I'm Jasmine.

435
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:36,355
- Hi.
- Ginger told me about you.

436
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:38,826
Oh, all good, I hope.

437
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,296
I gotta tell you, I was all set
to move in with your sister.

438
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:46,165
Then she tells me that we gotta postpone
because her sister's in town.

439
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:49,274
- He's joking.
- Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

440
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:50,670
It was an emergency.

441
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:52,941
- No.
- Things happen. Right, Eddie?

442
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:54,943
Could've happened to anybody.

443
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:57,707
Told me you never been here,
don't know anybody...

444
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,851
...so I brought along this sad excuse
for a blind date.

445
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:03,850
- Best he could do on short notice.
- He works with me.

446
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:05,351
I gotta get a beer.

447
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,855
- You want a beer?
- Can I buy you a drink?

448
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:11,221
- I have a drink, but thank you.
- I'm dropping dead of hunger.

449
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:13,522
This place has the best clams.

450
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:15,222
You like clams, Jasmine?

451
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:17,363
No, no, no. I'm not hungry.

452
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,862
What the hell are you drinking?
Let me see. What is this?

453
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:22,232
- Is it vodka?
- Martini.

454
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:26,137
- This place has the best clams in the city.
- The best are at Manero's.

455
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:29,212
- You're nuts. They don't even compare.
- Who cares?

456
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:32,976
This place is good too. They're fresh.
That's the thing with clams.

457
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:36,177
You get a bad clam,
you'll wish you were never born.

458
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,720
- So, what do you do, Jasmine?
- I told you, she just got here.

459
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,755
- She's looking for a job.
- Yeah?

460
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:44,560
I know a dentist who's looking for help.

461
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:46,821
- Oh, yeah?
- No, I'm actually thinking...

462
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:49,431
- ... of going back to school.
- School?

463
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,369
To study what?

464
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't know. I mean,
the biggest mistake I made...

465
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:01,239
...was leaving college in my last year
and not completing my education.

466
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,743
What would you be?

467
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,539
An anthropologist.

468
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,741
Really? Like digging up old fossils?

469
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:09,419
That's an archaeologist.

470
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,645
Ginger told me the whole story.

471
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,346
That must be terrible, right?

472
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:16,083
One minute you're on top of the world,
the next-

473
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:18,558
- Guy turns out to be a crook.
- Yeah.

474
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:21,163
Her husband, he owned racehorses.

475
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:22,957
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

476
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,192
Oh, yes, yes, for a year or two...

477
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,894
...Hal became quite obsessed
with thoroughbreds.

478
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:31,567
So, what are you gonna study
in college?

479
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,799
Let me guess.

480
00:27:33,543 --> 00:27:35,306
A nurse.

481
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,872
Is that how I impress you?

482
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:41,107
- A nurse?
- You got something against nurses?

483
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:44,685
- My sister's a nurse.
- Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.

484
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:48,051
They have extensive knowledge
of how the human body works.

485
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:52,319
- Careful what you accuse my sister of.
- Just saying, I know a few good nurses.

486
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,587
Chili, why don't you
change the subject?

487
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,631
You think you're being charming,
but you're not.

488
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,234
You always stare into space like that?

489
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,106
I had a friend who used to do that...

490
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,435
...but there was something wrong
with him. He was epileptic.

491
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,001
I'm not epileptic.

492
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:14,141
If you see the waitress,
I'd like another Stoli martini.

493
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,716
- What are you gonna study?
- Leave her alone.

494
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,150
- It's like the third time you asked.
- So? She hasn't answered.

495
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:23,484
I don't know, but I'll be sure
to keep you informed.

496
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:28,095
- Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.

497
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:31,528
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

498
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:35,100
- What do you wanna do?
- Why don't we take her to see the sights?

499
00:28:35,304 --> 00:28:39,138
Then back to my place. She likes vodka.
My buddy's just back from Russia.

500
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,810
- Brought me this incredible vodka.
- Great idea.

501
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,378
- You're gonna love my place.
- Yeah, let's go.

502
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:18,006
- Wait till you try this vodka.
- All right, man.

503
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,976
I wish my apartment had a garden.

504
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,809
- We didn't take her inside Alcatraz.
- Thank you.

505
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:27,011
- They got tours in there, Jasmine.
- Ginger said your ex-husband did time?

506
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:30,658
He'd still be doing time
if he didn't hang himself in his cell.

507
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:34,555
- Really? Like with a belt?
- Well, it had to be a belt. Or a bedsheet.

508
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:36,228
- Could be a bedsheet.
- No.

509
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,799
He managed to get a piece of rope.

510
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,167
Plain rope.

511
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,361
You can get anything if you got juice.

512
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:48,166
That's some way to go.
Strangle yourself to death?

513
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,843
No, it wasn't strangulation.

514
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:53,707
When you hang yourself,
your neck breaks.

515
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:56,815
I wouldn't feel sorry for him.
He hurt a lot of people.

516
00:29:57,017 --> 00:30:00,043
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, including me and Augie and her.

517
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:03,417
A lot of people are under
the misapprehension you strangle...

518
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:06,457
- ... but your neck snaps.
- Okay, we got it.

519
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,961
He was a bad guy, you know?

520
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:11,721
He lived like a big shot
on other people's money.

521
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:15,331
- And he played around behind her back.
- No.

522
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:18,731
- Jasmine, go and start your cooldown.
- Oh, good.

523
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,140
- Hey, Jas.
- Yeah?

524
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,277
I know you don't wanna go
to the Yankee game tonight.

525
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:30,939
I'd go to any sporting event with you,
you know, but I just never got baseball.

526
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,416
- I thought I'd ask Melanie. She's a fan.
- Oh, sure. God, she'll be thrilled.

527
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:36,883
- Hey, Mel?
- Yeah?

528
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,718
- You like baseball, right?
- I love baseball. Why?

529
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:44,363
I got two season tickets
behind the Yankee dugout for tonight.

530
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:47,397
I don't have anybody else to go with me.
Are you free?

531
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,228
Absolutely, if you're sure
there's nobody else.

532
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:51,596
No.

533
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:54,932
- No, no, you'll do just fine.
- All right, thanks.

534
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,310
- This is where you live? Nice.
- Yeah.

535
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:02,742
- Hey, can you grab the groceries for me?
- Yeah.

536
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,988
- I can get this one.
- Get them.

537
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,487
- You got it? All right.
- I got it.

538
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:17,587
- Oh, no.
- That's okay, don't worry.

539
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,321
- No more vodka for you.
- I didn't have any vodka.

540
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:22,796
- I didn't have no vodka.
- I know about you.

541
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,333
Hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

542
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:26,799
- Take it upstairs?
- Yes?

543
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,131
- Yeah.
- All right.

544
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,699
Eddie wants your phone number.

545
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,945
- Why?
- I think he wants to call you.

546
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:36,979
I think he wants to ask you out,
you know, for dinner.

547
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:40,777
- Look, I'm busy at the moment.
- He's a terrific guy. Look at him.

548
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,181
Well, why doesn't he ask me himself?

549
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:46,321
Because he's shy, you know?
He thinks he's short.

550
00:31:48,425 --> 00:31:51,326
Look, I'm concentrating
on school, okay?

551
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,360
- And getting a job.
- That's perfect.

552
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:55,532
Right, he knows this dentist.

553
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,634
No, I have no interest
in being a receptionist.

554
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,168
What did you have in mind,
running a bank?

555
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:05,138
- Is this what you wanted to talk about?
- And how long you're planning...

556
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:09,005
- ... on staying with Ginger.
- Oh, right. It's just till I find my feet.

557
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:10,646
We have a lot of big plans.

558
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,681
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin
any of your big plans.

559
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:16,648
No one wants to get out of here
as fast as I do.

560
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:20,051
I'm sure this is a big comedown
from what you're used to.

561
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:23,818
It's fine. It's- I'm grateful for her help.

562
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,962
So you don't want Eddie to call you?

563
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:29,598
No, I'm not ready to go out
at the moment.

564
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,563
Ginger said
you had a nervous breakdown.

565
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,367
She tends to be quite dramatic.

566
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:41,203
Said you were in the street,
talking to yourself.

567
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:47,913
You know, I don't think
that this is any of your business.

568
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:52,281
No, but since I'm marrying her,
we don't have any secrets between us.

569
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,287
- What did Chili want?
- Oh, nothing.

570
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,591
His retarded boyfriend wanted a date,
but he was too shy to ask.

571
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:08,532
- What do you think of Chili?
- He's very anxious to move in with you.

572
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,933
Yeah, I know. He's got the hots for me.

573
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,630
Can I speak frankly?

574
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:14,603
- You hate him?
- Yeah.

575
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,301
I could tell you two didn't hit it off.

576
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,947
He's another version of Augie.
He's a loser.

577
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:24,550
Hey, didn't I hear Eddie say
he knows a dentist looking for help?

578
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,382
Oh, forget it! Jesus, it's too menial!

579
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,581
I'd go nuts.

580
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,094
I wanna go back to school.

581
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:40,166
I wanna get my degree and become,
you know, something substantial.

582
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,302
I can't just do some mindless job.

583
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:46,666
I was forced to take a job selling shoes
on Madison Avenue.

584
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,741
Oh, so humiliating.

585
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,642
Friends I'd had at dinner parties
at our apartment came in...

586
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:57,807
...and I waited on them. I mean,
do you have any idea what that's like?

587
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:01,681
You know, one minute,
you're hosting women...

588
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:05,949
...and the next, you're measuring
their shoe size and fitting them.

589
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,655
Erica Bishop came into the store.

590
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:12,822
She saw me
and was so embarrassed for me...

591
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:16,264
...she slipped out
thinking I didn't see her.

592
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:19,573
I saw you, Erica!

593
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:23,509
Are you okay?

594
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:27,172
Hey, you got great taste.

595
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:31,943
Maybe you could do something
in fashion.

596
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,586
Or designing. Yeah?

597
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,019
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

598
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:40,317
Everyone used to say
I'd make a good interior decorator.

599
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:44,320
There's courses,
but, you know, they cost money.

600
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:48,524
No, Eve Logan
got her decorator's license online.

601
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:50,726
On a computer?

602
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,335
I guess you could, but-

603
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,906
Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.

604
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,005
But I could take a class in computers.

605
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:03,911
And then when I can handle a computer,
then I can study decorating online.

606
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,484
- That sounds too complicated.
- Why is your reaction always negative?

607
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,315
I'm just saying.

608
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,889
You know, first you gotta
learn computers...

609
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:15,720
...and then go for a decorator's
license online.

610
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:19,126
You're afraid I'll stay here too long.

611
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,061
No, you know-

612
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:24,565
Just all those courses,
they cost money.

613
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:30,165
You'll work out here. It's mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight.

614
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:33,436
There's the follow-up cards,
which I explained...

615
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,375
...and the notices for cleanings.

616
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:38,713
Any questions?

617
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:42,414
Tell Dr. Flicker it's an emergency.

618
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,953
- Come on, come on.
- Yes?

619
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,083
What?

620
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:50,261
Yes, a cancellation.

621
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:53,090
Oh, you want to cancel.

622
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,765
- When?
- Please.

623
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:58,698
Wait, wait, wait. You said the 24th.

624
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:00,735
My husband has an abscess.

625
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:04,438
Can you just put someone on
who speaks better English?

626
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:09,237
The software interface
is what provides you, the user...

627
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:12,905
...the ability to control the hardware,
the computer.

628
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,778
Okay, that's the operating.

629
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:18,922
The operating system
gives you that ability.

630
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,091
I need an appointment in two weeks.

631
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:29,626
Is the 1 Oth good for you?

632
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,803
The 1 Oth. Yes, fine.

633
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,268
Oh, better make it the 12th.

634
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:38,636
- Oh, we're all booked on the 12th.
- Okay.

635
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,140
Make it the 14th.

636
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,642
- The 14th?
- Oh, no.

637
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,940
Is 3 good on the 9th?

638
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:47,117
Or noon on the 11 th?

639
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:51,345
Can you just settle on a time, please?
Just pick a time.

640
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:54,850
Remember the yoga class.

641
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:59,086
Deep breath.

642
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:02,022
Breathe deeply.

643
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:06,992
All right, deep breath.

644
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,134
If you take a deep breath,
you can smell the honeysuckle.

645
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:16,278
- Beautiful. Make a great perfume.
- It would.

646
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,005
- Your polo pony's in great shape.
- Thank you.

647
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:21,547
- No, I have never seen a polo match.
- Really?

648
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:26,154
My husband's a fanatic. Not to say
he's good at it, but it keeps him busy.

649
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,880
We got a flight to catch.

650
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:30,649
Hal's taking Danny to Augusta
for the Masters.

651
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:33,386
They're golf degenerates.
I'll be home alone.

652
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,291
- We'll be back in three days.
- Did we tell you?

653
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:38,865
- Danny was first in his class at Harvard.
- No.

654
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,262
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

655
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,959
- Thanks.
- He's a math genius.

656
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:45,629
He's the genius. Dad did a guest lecture
at the business school...

657
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,207
...and everyone said
it was the best lecture.

658
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,345
Naturally I became an instant
celebrity on campus.

659
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:54,345
Hey, I need your signature
on these, baby.

660
00:37:56,085 --> 00:38:00,715
Be careful. Don't get hit by a golf ball.
That's how Ray Becker died.

661
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:04,222
You know, a little blue bruise
on his temple.

662
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:17,736
What are you always studying
in your spare time?

663
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,533
Well, I'm trying to learn
to use a computer.

664
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:24,041
I wanna study interior design online.

665
00:38:24,245 --> 00:38:26,372
Oh, you wanna be a decorator?

666
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,708
Yeah, it's where my strongest gifts are.

667
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,750
You know, I have a natural flair
for space and color...

668
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,751
...and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings.

669
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:39,188
It's very commendable, but I can't really
have you studying on work time...

670
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,760
...if it interferes
with the business at hand.

671
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,557
Yes. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

672
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,825
Please, see that it doesn't.

673
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:54,772
- I was gonna ask you a question.
- Yes?

674
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:59,471
Would you have a drink with me?

675
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,777
A drink?

676
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,215
I'd love it if you could.

677
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:08,482
Well, it would have to be a quick one...

678
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:12,453
...because, you know,
I'm meeting my boyfriend for dinner.

679
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,423
I was just saying...

680
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:21,260
...you can tell an awful lot about people
when you look in their mouths.

681
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:25,632
Are they conscientious?
Are they disciplined? Are they vain?

682
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:28,636
Or careless?
You have to know what to look for.

683
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,639
Do you have the time?
I have to keep an eye on it.

684
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:32,902
I've got homework.

685
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:38,107
This computer thing is proving
a little more difficult than I imagined.

686
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,914
It's funny, really, because I used to be
a straight-A student in college.

687
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:47,115
You know, but they say every year,
millions of brain cells just die off.

688
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:49,385
You have good teeth.

689
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:53,392
I'm sure you get
many compliments on them.

690
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,261
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

691
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:59,766
You know,
you're a very beautiful woman.

692
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,668
Are you serious with your boyfriend?

693
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:06,167
I don't mean to pry.

694
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:12,343
God, life is complicated.

695
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,846
Have you ever had any children?

696
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:18,148
How do you expect me to react
when my father is unmasked...

697
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:21,451
- ... as a common thief?
- You can't just drop out of Harvard.

698
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:24,824
No, it's too humiliating.
I wanna die when I see what he's done.

699
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:27,363
- How he lied, stole, ruined people.
- I know-

700
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:28,863
He is a sleazy criminal.

701
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:32,468
But if you drop out, you will be
throwing away your whole future.

702
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:35,231
You think I could ever face anybody
up at school?

703
00:40:35,473 --> 00:40:37,737
My father, who I bragged
to everyone about?

704
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:40,945
The financial genius, generous,
the philanthropist?

705
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,376
He's such a phony.
He's a cheap crook.

706
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:46,049
His charitable contributions
with stolen money.

707
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:49,516
Well, just think how he feels.
He was arrested in the street.

708
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:52,315
- It's in all the papers.
- How can you look at him?

709
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:55,550
Did you not suspect anything
or did you not care?

710
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,957
- What does that mean?
- It didn't pay for you to ask questions.

711
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,691
Think I would have allowed him
to set up corporations under my name?

712
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,893
Sign accounts? This is no cake walk.
I could get indicted.

713
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:10,336
He's done nothing but lie over the years.
He is a con man and a hypocrite.

714
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:14,534
This is how you respond, by squandering
your life to get even with him?

715
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:17,247
Don't try to find me, because you won't.

716
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:20,779
He's a fucking bum. Let's go.

717
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:23,384
Let's go, let's go. Get out of the clinch.

718
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,418
- Hey. Hey.
- That's it, pop the jab.

719
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:28,420
Hey, guys, keep it down.
My sister's trying to study.

720
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,422
When can we stop tiptoeing around?

721
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:32,219
- Pop the jab.
- She'll hear you.

722
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,728
Well, I don't care.
I work hard all week. I wanna relax.

723
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:41,536
- Let's go, come on.
- Let's go. Work the body.

724
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,434
- The guy's just standing.
- Look.

725
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,007
And Bruno makes it easy,
because he just pushes himself forward.

726
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,806
Her sister, she had millions.
Turned out she married a crook.

727
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:53,243
Look, where was she
when she was loaded...

728
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,941
...and you were tending bar,
waiting tables?

729
00:41:56,153 --> 00:41:58,814
Now family's family?

730
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,950
- Yeah.
- Yeah, nice. You can see the money.

731
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:03,523
- I know.
- He's right.

732
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:06,627
Is it possible,
without ruining any of your fun...

733
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:08,797
...that you could lower the TV a bit?

734
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:12,523
Hey, Jasmine, why don't you
stop working for a bit? Have a beer.

735
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,062
Believe me, I wish I could.

736
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,466
What kind of work are you doing?

737
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:21,973
I'm trying to work a computer...

738
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:24,442
...but it seems I have no aptitude for it.

739
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,842
Hey, listen, I just-
I want you to know...

740
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:31,452
...it's great when a grown-up continues
with their education. Not for nothing.

741
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:37,320
Well, my goal is to
study interior decorating online.

742
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,556
Why don't you just go
to decorator school?

743
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:46,759
Well, I have to use my days to work
and pay my way.

744
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:50,096
As Hal said,
"It's not the money, it's the money. "

745
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:54,071
Yeah, okay, but, you know,
life ain't all work and no play, right?

746
00:42:54,276 --> 00:42:57,177
Ginger says between work and school,
you're cracking up.

747
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:59,472
- Hey, why don't you shut up?
- No, no.

748
00:42:59,681 --> 00:43:02,844
I'll admit, it's been very trying...

749
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,644
...but I'm determined
to make something of myself.

750
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:09,881
- You don't like working with the dentist?
- No, I do not.

751
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,026
Well, Ginger said
you're not used to working a job.

752
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:15,788
Well, in that respect,
I was very fortunate.

753
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:17,726
He was a handsome guy with money.

754
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:21,299
He was smooth talker and pampered her.
What's she gonna say, no?

755
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:24,195
I got it.

756
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:28,904
Why does it have to be a decorator?
Why can't you pick something else?

757
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,967
What would you want me to do?

758
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,875
Do you want me to wait tables?
Bag groceries?

759
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,049
Hey, Ginger bags groceries.

760
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:41,312
Well, Ginger and I
are completely different people.

761
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:43,149
Yeah, she got the good genes.

762
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:47,054
It's not genetic. You can't always
blame everything on your genes.

763
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:49,889
If you're prepared to work hard
and not settle-

764
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,360
- What, you mean Augie?
- She means me.

765
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:57,693
Who do I have to sleep with around here
to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?

766
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:05,238
That's what I...

767
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:09,737
What-? What-?
Oh, Christ, I can't remember.

768
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:14,147
So, Chili was telling me that you used
to have a really nice collection of cars.

769
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:15,844
Oh, yes, my husband did.

770
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:21,687
He used to collect vintage
Bentleys and Mercedes.

771
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:25,228
- Wow, those are expensive cars.
- Yes, they are.

772
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:29,026
You know, having wealth
is nothing to be ashamed of.

773
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:32,966
- We were very civic-minded.
- Yeah, with other people's money.

774
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:35,902
This guy lost every penny
of Ginger's money.

775
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,374
I tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing.

776
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:42,047
I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

777
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:45,775
You'll be very happy to know
that I lost every cent of my own money.

778
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:48,681
You know, every home,
every stick of furniture...

779
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:51,448
...every fur, every ring
and every bank account...

780
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:54,557
...and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

781
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,593
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week...

782
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:02,460
- ... I knew he was hitting on her
girlfriend. - I really need to study.

783
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,135
- I need some peace, okay?
- Okay.

784
00:45:05,337 --> 00:45:08,829
I'm not gonna make it
if you turn this place into a nightclub.

785
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:12,066
- I can't. I just can't.
- All right, all right, all right.

786
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:15,974
- Everybody out. The girl's got homework.
- What? Main event's not on yet.

787
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,704
- Out.
- I'm not leaving now.

788
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,350
You know, she's right about you, Chili.

789
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:23,748
- You drink, you become a jerk.
- What about her? She's drink-

790
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:26,015
Jerk? Come here.

791
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,993
I'm sorry I don't drive a Bentley.

792
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,025
- Let's go to the bar.
- Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.

793
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:33,856
Good night.

794
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,498
- Jesus, it's a mess.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

795
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:41,501
Ginger, I'm really- I don't-
I don't know what came over me.

796
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,539
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

797
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,176
Yeah, I know these are not
your kind of guys.

798
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:51,041
I mean, God, don't you wanna meet
some decent man?

799
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:54,046
You know, someone
who can take you out of this-

800
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,753
What? This hole?

801
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,115
Yeah, I know what you think of it here.

802
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,655
I mean, you've got two kids.

803
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,953
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

804
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:09,258
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

805
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:12,265
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

806
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,999
Okay, okay. Do you always have to make
those stupid sarcastic digs?

807
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,336
I'm scared, Hal.

808
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:24,911
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global Innovations...

809
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:29,141
...is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

810
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,411
- Howard Trask is such a pussy.
- No, no-

811
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:35,488
- What do you think I have lawyers for?
- He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

812
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:39,389
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

813
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,895
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

814
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:46,728
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

815
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:50,235
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

816
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,204
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

817
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,900
Is there?

818
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:56,505
No.

819
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,739
So stop worrying and let me spoil you.

820
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:03,248
No, I agree. I mean,
Howard always was a prissy mama's boy.

821
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,889
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

822
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:12,019
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

823
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:14,923
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

824
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,622
All right, 2, 3?

825
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:22,428
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21 st?

826
00:47:22,638 --> 00:47:25,471
- We have nothing open on the 21 st.
- Good night.

827
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:27,231
Well, he wants me in a week.

828
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:30,435
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

829
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:32,375
- Fine. Oh, wait, no.
- Go for 9?

830
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:34,845
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

831
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,608
That's always very special.

832
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:39,616
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

833
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:47,755
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback...

834
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:50,897
...and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

835
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,158
- Sure.
- No, no, no.

836
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:55,266
When you're done, when you're done.

837
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,462
When you're finished. Thank you.

838
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:04,802
Are you feeling more comfortable
in the job?

839
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:09,642
I hope you're pleased,
because I am determined to make it work.

840
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:14,082
- It fits in perfectly with my class.
- Are you getting better on the computer?

841
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:19,248
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student there,
but another girl helps me, so...

842
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,328
I'm glad you're relaxing more
into this job.

843
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:28,093
- I'm trying.
- I must say, I like having you around.

844
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:30,668
- Thank you.
- Since you started working here...

845
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:34,032
...have you noticed I've been wearing
more colorful neckties?

846
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:38,341
- I-
- Since you- I'm just- Just joking.

847
00:48:38,545 --> 00:48:41,776
Can I-? Can I make a confession?

848
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:46,348
I don't know that I should be the one
to hear a confession, doctor.

849
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:48,043
Well...

850
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:53,186
The way you dress...

851
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:57,054
...I sometimes find very...

852
00:48:57,297 --> 00:48:59,231
...arousing.

853
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:03,664
Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

854
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:08,569
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I find you attractive?

855
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:11,422
Dr. Flicker, where is
all this talk leading?

856
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:13,469
Well, I'm not
the kind of person...

857
00:49:13,747 --> 00:49:18,046
...who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

858
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,742
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

859
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:25,650
A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

860
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:28,588
- I shouldn't be hearing this.
- No, don't be upset.

861
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:31,955
- I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
- Don't be upset.

862
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:36,362
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

863
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:37,593
I'm not in a shell.

864
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:39,963
- Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
- No.

865
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:43,335
- It would remove your inhibitions.
- I don't have inhibitions.

866
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:44,600
- Stop.
- Dr. Flicker.

867
00:49:44,843 --> 00:49:47,209
- Stop being standoffish.
- I'm not standoffish.

868
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:49,973
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

869
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:51,706
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

870
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:54,545
This is so embarrassing.

871
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:58,485
I am never coming back here.

872
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:02,421
I don't have to put myself
through this nonsense.

873
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:04,993
I gotta take a deep breath.

874
00:50:05,196 --> 00:50:08,029
Oh, now look what you've done.
I can't breathe.

875
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,394
Oh, God, I can't breathe.

876
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:18,265
I don't blame you for being shaken up.

877
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:22,377
I'd have that dentist reported.
If I told my boyfriend that story...

878
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,243
...he would go to the guy's office
and break every bone in his body.

879
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:28,544
You can sue him. That's harassment.

880
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:31,278
No, I'm never going
into another courtroom.

881
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:32,750
I don't blame you.

882
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:36,552
My boyfriend's a lawyer.
He's got court stories.

883
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:40,162
- Sharon, do you know any men?
- Men?

884
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:43,592
Men that would be good for me.

885
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,668
I just moved here,
so I don't really know anybody.

886
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:52,102
If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,
you can't fall in love anywhere.

887
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:54,140
Someone substantial.

888
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:58,075
Well, what are you doing
Sunday afternoon?

889
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:59,340
Not very much.

890
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,813
Tony and I are going to a party.
Come with.

891
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:05,749
Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready
for a big crowd of strangers.

892
00:51:05,956 --> 00:51:07,651
Oh, come on.

893
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,919
It's a big bash someone's having.
There'll be all kinds of people.

894
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:14,290
Make an effort,
otherwise nothing happens.

895
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:16,340
Then you blame
everything but yourself.

896
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:20,017
No, I want to. It's
not that I don't want to.

897
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:23,104
- Can I bring my sister?
- For moral support? Absolutely.

898
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:24,934
And Tony and I will be there.

899
00:51:25,142 --> 00:51:27,666
You'll have fun. It's a huge party.

900
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,845
Maybe you'll get lucky.

901
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,979
But you have to come,
otherwise I'm not going.

902
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:37,311
- What the hell would I wear?
- Oh, we'll find you something.

903
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,717
Oh, God, I haven't shown my face
socially in so long.

904
00:51:40,956 --> 00:51:43,891
Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

905
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:47,629
I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

906
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:52,233
- Well, you know what I say to Chili.
- It's hard to meet a man you can trust.

907
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,392
Hal.

908
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:57,038
Hey, Nat.
What are you doing out here?

909
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,868
I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

910
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,544
Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

911
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,804
- Jasmine.
- Hello.

912
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:09,212
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.

913
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,011
She's brilliant.
We couldn't have done any better.

914
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,053
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

915
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:17,315
- Free on Tuesday?
- I'll make sure I am.

916
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,617
That's great.

917
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,620
Are you having an affair with Amy?

918
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:26,563
- Amy, my lawyer?
- Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

919
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,998
Of course not.
What makes you think that?

920
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:31,900
- Someone made a remark.
- What remark?

921
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,507
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

922
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,235
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

923
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,176
- That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
- Were you?

924
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:44,147
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

925
00:52:44,352 --> 00:52:46,445
- Lydia was there.
- Did you take her hand?

926
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:50,749
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

927
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,519
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

928
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:54,955
Maybe you were high.

929
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:58,426
- It's obvious she's got crush on you.
- You're building a case.

930
00:52:58,665 --> 00:53:01,532
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

931
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:04,260
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

932
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,668
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

933
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,173
You know, I understand
other women have a-

934
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:14,814
Find you attractive,
but it's their hard luck. I have you.

935
00:53:15,048 --> 00:53:17,573
- Yes, you do.
- No.

936
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,919
So you're not?

937
00:53:21,121 --> 00:53:22,782
No, I'm not.

938
00:53:25,392 --> 00:53:26,950
Good.

939
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,290
Let's make love.

940
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:42,334
You know, if you were having an affair,
I'd be pretty upset.

941
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:46,405
Pretty darn angry. I don't wanna be
made a fool of, you know?

942
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:49,843
- You hear me, Hal?
- Excuse me. Are you talking to me?

943
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:51,606
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

944
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:53,479
Hi.

945
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:56,819
- How are you? I'm so glad you came.
- You must be Tony.

946
00:53:57,023 --> 00:53:59,321
- Yes, this is Tony.
- A pleasure to meet you.

947
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:02,153
- What do you think? Nice party, right?
- Beautiful.

948
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:04,261
It's kind of a mixed bag.

949
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:05,829
Did you bring your sister?

950
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:08,466
Oh, yes, she's dancing.

951
00:54:10,336 --> 00:54:13,100
- Hey, my name's Al, incidentally.
- Ginger.

952
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:14,796
- Ginger?
- Yeah.

953
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:17,271
Ginger, you dance great.

954
00:54:17,477 --> 00:54:19,945
- I never get a chance to, and I love it.
- Yeah?

955
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:21,942
I do, yeah.

956
00:54:22,147 --> 00:54:24,172
You know Sally, the host?

957
00:54:24,382 --> 00:54:26,850
- No, my sister brought me.
- Yeah?

958
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:31,512
Wherever the hell she is. I don't-
I don't know where she is.

959
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:33,986
But you're from San Francisco?

960
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:35,386
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

961
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:37,561
- What about you?
- Marin.

962
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:39,320
- Okay.
- Yeah.

963
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:41,055
Great.

964
00:54:41,566 --> 00:54:42,658
What do you do, Al?

965
00:54:42,868 --> 00:54:46,531
I'm a sound engineer.
I put in people's systems, you know?

966
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:48,636
- I did Mr. Lockman's.
- Okay.

967
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,866
He's the husband of the host,
in case you were wondering.

968
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:54,807
I do concerts and private...

969
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:57,881
- Great.
- I like slow dancing better, don't you?

970
00:54:58,083 --> 00:54:59,880
- Yeah.
- It's more romantic, right?

971
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:01,916
- It is, yeah.
- Yeah.

972
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:03,780
It is.

973
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,779
Hey, you're really pretty.

974
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:11,383
- Yeah, you are. You are.
- Really? Really?

975
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:23,804
I'd rather be someplace else too.

976
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,735
- Do I look that uncomfortable?
- Almost.

977
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:34,050
- I'm Dwight Westlake.
- Jasmine French.

978
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,811
Jasmine French,
that's a very exotic name.

979
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:41,117
Well, my parents named me
after my mother's favorite flower.

980
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:43,618
Night-blooming jasmine.

981
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:46,455
Come to life after it gets dark.

982
00:55:47,765 --> 00:55:50,062
That's the best offer I've had today.

983
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:51,756
I didn't say it was an offer.

984
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:56,132
I saw you in the other room before,
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

985
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:58,937
Well, hope I don't shatter your illusion.

986
00:55:59,142 --> 00:56:01,610
- You have great style.
- Do I?

987
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:05,143
Chanel belt, Herms bag
and Vivier shoes.

988
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:08,612
Vivier- Oh, my goodness.
Do you work in the fashion industry?

989
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:12,252
No, but my former wife was.
She worked at a fashion magazine.

990
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:14,582
- Right.
- She passed away last year.

991
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:17,086
Oh, I'm sorry.

992
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:21,252
- I'm so- And what do you do?
- Nothing as glamorous as fashion.

993
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:24,922
- I work in the State Department.
- Well, no, that's glamorous.

994
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:26,431
In the diplomatic corps.

995
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:29,230
- Don't tell me you're an ambassador.
- No, hardly.

996
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,304
But I wouldn't turn it down.

997
00:56:31,507 --> 00:56:33,303
We knew the ambassador to Mexico.

998
00:56:33,508 --> 00:56:34,998
My husband did.

999
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,444
Your husband? You have a husband?

1000
00:56:37,879 --> 00:56:42,077
No, no. Sadly, like your wife,
he passed away.

1001
00:56:42,284 --> 00:56:46,983
But, you know, we stayed overnight
in the embassy in Mexico once.

1002
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:48,986
- I work in Europe. Vienna.
- Really?

1003
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:50,988
- Oh, I love Vienna.
- Oh, yeah?

1004
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:52,820
We were there once, Hal and I.

1005
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:56,486
I remember it as being two weeks
of young wine and chocolate cake.

1006
00:56:56,698 --> 00:57:00,657
Lovely. My ambition is to come back
after a few years and enter politics.

1007
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:04,099
- I'd like to run for office in California.
- Oh, how exciting.

1008
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:09,141
Yeah, it might just be an inflated ego,
but I think I'd make a good congressman.

1009
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:13,280
I grew up in San Francisco.
I know California. I like challenges.

1010
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:14,506
You from out here?

1011
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:17,782
New York. Park Avenue.

1012
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:20,010
You know, when my husband
passed away...

1013
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:22,348
...I mean, naturally I was very upset...

1014
00:57:22,556 --> 00:57:27,220
...so I decided to come out here
and start a new life for myself.

1015
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:29,694
What did he do?

1016
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,665
He was a surgeon.

1017
00:57:35,803 --> 00:57:40,035
God, that must be incredibly stressful.

1018
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,834
No, I mean, he had a heart attack.
I'm sure that's what gave it to him.

1019
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,945
You have children?

1020
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:52,645
No, no. No, there really wasn't time.

1021
00:57:52,853 --> 00:57:56,721
And what about you? What do you do?
I guessed you were in the arts.

1022
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:59,551
- Am I right?
- Well, you're close.

1023
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,057
I am an interior designer.

1024
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:04,220
I really have hit the jackpot.

1025
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:06,557
- Really?
- I meet this exotic creature...

1026
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:09,530
...not only is she charming
and elegant and single...

1027
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,897
- ... but I just bought a new house.
- Really?

1028
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:14,232
One I've been looking at. It's in Marin.

1029
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:17,034
- Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.
- Beautiful.

1030
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,576
I meet this woman, and she turns out
to be an interior designer.

1031
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,112
Written in the stars.
You have to look at it.

1032
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:25,909
- I would love to.
- Maybe you can help me with it.

1033
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,609
Absolutely.

1034
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:31,749
I never slept with anyone
the first night before, you know?

1035
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:34,619
- Yeah, that-
- But dancing with you...

1036
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:37,557
...got me all hot and bothered,
so, you know...

1037
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,061
Well, you were so sexy.

1038
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,757
I mean, I knew right away
that you were gonna be good in bed.

1039
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,093
- I knew it.
- Did you?

1040
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,100
I said to myself, you know...

1041
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:49,297
You know, I thought for sure
we were gonna get caught.

1042
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,441
I didn't care. I mean, I-

1043
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:55,807
I couldn't wait. There's no way I was-
I had to have you right then and there.

1044
00:58:56,048 --> 00:58:57,538
You know...

1045
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,911
- You know what clinched it for me?
- What?

1046
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,916
Because you were so smooth.

1047
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,022
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1048
00:59:05,624 --> 00:59:08,957
- Well, that's- I just-
- But, you know, I-

1049
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:12,619
I don't want you to think I'm just easy,
because I'm not.

1050
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:15,823
No, I- You know what I think?
You're a fun-loving person.

1051
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:17,296
- I am.
- That's- Yeah.

1052
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:19,026
- Yeah.
- And that's what I am.

1053
00:59:19,238 --> 00:59:20,671
- I can see that.
- That's-

1054
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:22,635
- I'm easygoing by nature.
- Yeah.

1055
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:25,571
That's what I-
I bring music to people's lives.

1056
00:59:25,778 --> 00:59:27,836
You're very sweet, you know?

1057
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,980
I never had a sweet guy before.

1058
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:32,473
- I hope I-
- Never.

1059
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:35,777
I hope I didn't get you in trouble
with your boyfriend.

1060
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:39,320
No. You know, it's not like
we're engaged, so...

1061
00:59:39,557 --> 00:59:43,357
- You know, I'm free. I'm free.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1062
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:46,190
Oh, God, I'd better get back.

1063
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,920
My lunch hour's almost over.

1064
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:50,498
But we- You know what?
We have time, though.

1065
00:59:50,701 --> 00:59:52,999
- For what?
- Let's go in the back seat.

1066
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:54,637
- Again?
- Yeah, come on.

1067
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:56,704
- Jesus, what are you?
- It's just...

1068
00:59:56,941 --> 01:00:00,274
- Are you one of those sex addicts?
- I am for you. Come on.

1069
01:00:00,478 --> 01:00:02,207
- Are you? I thought so.
- One more.

1070
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:04,175
Nobody's around. Not many people.

1071
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:08,352
- We gotta make this quick.
- I got tinted windows. It's perfect.

1072
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:20,856
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty.

1073
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:24,664
- My turn. It's my turn!
- God, he told me he'd call me yesterday.

1074
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:26,028
I wanna play with it!

1075
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:29,364
Can't you two stop fighting
for a second?

1076
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:32,598
- I've got a throbbing headache.
- You gave him both here...

1077
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:35,972
- ... and your cell number?
- Of course I gave him both numbers.

1078
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:38,545
Unless he's been delayed
in Washington.

1079
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:42,514
- Still, he could have phoned.
- Don't think he figured you were lying...

1080
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,018
- ... and bailed out?
- Look, could you stop saying I was lying?

1081
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:50,489
God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few
facts, omitted a few unpleasant details...

1082
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:53,857
...but in the main, I mean,
my feelings, my ideas, my humor-

1083
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:57,191
I mean, isn't that who I am? Christ.

1084
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:00,926
People reinvent themselves, don't they?
Do I have your permission?

1085
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,695
You better take more of those pills.
You're shot.

1086
01:01:03,906 --> 01:01:05,897
Oh, Jesus. Would you please-?

1087
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:11,704
Matthew, turn off that pounding.
Please, Matthew.

1088
01:01:12,448 --> 01:01:14,348
Can't stand it.

1089
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:17,409
- Hey.
- Hey.

1090
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:20,178
- Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?
- Who says?

1091
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:23,381
I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.

1092
01:01:23,592 --> 01:01:25,924
- So?
- So you were dancing with a guy.

1093
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:29,562
- So what?
- I asked her to come with me, okay?

1094
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:33,098
I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1095
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:35,964
Is that so? So the two of you
were in the corner...

1096
01:01:36,205 --> 01:01:38,298
- ... playing kissy-face.
- Give me a break.

1097
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,872
We couldn't go to the ballpark
because you weren't feeling good.

1098
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:45,477
Hey, don't treat me like property.
I had a headache when you called.

1099
01:01:45,713 --> 01:01:48,614
And then I decided
to keep my sister company at a party.

1100
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:49,942
I don't buy that.

1101
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:52,277
Since when am I taking orders
from you?

1102
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:54,421
Can you please not fight in here?

1103
01:01:54,622 --> 01:01:58,388
I don't think I can take it. For some
reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.

1104
01:01:58,593 --> 01:02:00,754
Who's this guy
you're fooling around with?

1105
01:02:00,962 --> 01:02:04,227
I told you, I didn't like you rushing me
into anything, okay?

1106
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,992
- Is seeing other guys her idea?
- No, it's my idea.

1107
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:11,069
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a bum
like your first husband, right?

1108
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,137
- You told me.
- Guys, give me a break.

1109
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:16,435
- By all rights, I should be living here.
- What do you mean?

1110
01:02:16,644 --> 01:02:18,703
Didn't you want a guy here
for the kids?

1111
01:02:18,913 --> 01:02:21,814
- So they grow up with a father?
- I need to clear my head.

1112
01:02:22,016 --> 01:02:25,781
We're talking about getting married.
Now she's taking you to parties...

1113
01:02:25,986 --> 01:02:28,454
...and telling you
I'm not good enough for you.

1114
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:30,780
- If I catch you...
- Give her some space.

1115
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:32,652
- ... with somebody else-
- Get out!

1116
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:36,124
You keep out of this, okay?
It's got nothing to do with you.

1117
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:39,959
You beat it, Chili. You've been drinking.
Hey, maybe that's for you.

1118
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:44,001
Ginger, she's not somebody
you can count on. I am.

1119
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:48,037
Don't pick it up. I don't want him to think
I'm waiting for him to call.

1120
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:50,106
- What the hell's going on?
- It's Al.

1121
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,676
- Hey, give me that.
- That's the guy, Al.

1122
01:02:52,879 --> 01:02:56,007
- Hi. Yeah, but you're calling
at a- Get off! - Give me that.

1123
01:02:56,249 --> 01:02:59,741
You call here again, I'm gonna bust you
in your fat fucking face!

1124
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:03,946
- Hello. No! No!
- Give me that. Give me that.

1125
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:09,819
Look what you did,
you drunken asshole!

1126
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:12,497
You were right,
he's no better than Augie!

1127
01:03:12,698 --> 01:03:15,258
- Don't drag her to parties to meet men.
- Get out!

1128
01:03:15,468 --> 01:03:18,562
I didn't drag her out to meet men,
but if she has a brain...

1129
01:03:18,804 --> 01:03:22,638
...she'll dump you in the garbage
and find someone she deserves for once.

1130
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,639
- When are you moving out?
- Get out!

1131
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:28,712
I'm sorry I don't come from Park Avenue,
but I don't steal people's money.

1132
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:33,146
- I am not some lying jailbird.
- Get out or I'll call the cops, okay?

1133
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,718
She doesn't care about you.
She's a phony.

1134
01:03:35,921 --> 01:03:37,912
- She didn't care about you...
- Get out!

1135
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,387
- ... until she fucking needed you!
- Get out!

1136
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,438
- That's my cell phone.
- Okay.

1137
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:02,307
Where is it?
Oh, God, the kids were playing with it.

1138
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:05,847
Oh, where is my goddamned
cell phone?

1139
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,953
Hello? Dwight?

1140
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:14,352
Yes, can you just hang on a moment?
I'm just in the middle of something.

1141
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,365
Hello, how are you?

1142
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,831
No, no, no, it's just some business
I had to attend to.

1143
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:30,134
Oh, no, no. No, that's fine.

1144
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:34,104
I know how hectic things can get
in the nation's capital.

1145
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:39,338
When?

1146
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:46,910
Well, I'm actually
meeting a client...

1147
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,835
for a drink in the Fairmont...

1148
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,087
...so why don't you pick me up
in the lounge?

1149
01:04:53,564 --> 01:04:54,895
Great.

1150
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,397
No, no, no, 3 is perfect.

1151
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,501
Okay, bye-bye.

1152
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,309
- I'd like to make this wall a little
higher. - Oh, well, it's lovely.

1153
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:15,007
I knew you'd like it.

1154
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:18,015
Oh, and the garden is so established.

1155
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:20,245
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's all right.

1156
01:05:20,456 --> 01:05:23,152
The porch is so charming.
I can see why you love it.

1157
01:05:23,392 --> 01:05:27,522
- I have to get someone to take care of it.
- The orchids, oh.

1158
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:31,797
Oh, this...

1159
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,491
- This is spectacular.
- Right?

1160
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:37,503
- I think it's incredibly cheerful.
- Oh, look at the flow, and the light.

1161
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:40,175
- I mean, it-
- It goes a ways that way as well.

1162
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:42,843
- I have a million ideas immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1163
01:05:43,045 --> 01:05:46,173
Oh, the fireplace. Reminds me
of those places in the Hamptons.

1164
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:48,975
- So delightful.
- You've done work in the Hamptons?

1165
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:50,846
- We have friends out there.
- Yes.

1166
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:54,454
- All right.
- Yes, I've done a number of...

1167
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:55,681
...beach houses.

1168
01:05:55,925 --> 01:05:57,654
Let me show you the view.

1169
01:05:59,328 --> 01:06:00,488
Well, I can see-

1170
01:06:00,696 --> 01:06:03,289
- Oh, my God, it's enormous.
- Right?

1171
01:06:03,498 --> 01:06:06,934
I had no i- You could have
3- or 400 people out here.

1172
01:06:07,135 --> 01:06:09,933
- I don't have that many friends, but sure.
- Look at-

1173
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:12,572
The view, it's just breathtaking.

1174
01:06:12,807 --> 01:06:15,173
Andrea and I used to do
a lot of entertaining.

1175
01:06:15,377 --> 01:06:17,174
I bet you did, living in New York.

1176
01:06:17,379 --> 01:06:20,371
Well, now you're talking
about my specialty.

1177
01:06:20,582 --> 01:06:23,642
You know, I gave the best
dinner parties in the city.

1178
01:06:27,656 --> 01:06:29,089
Come here.

1179
01:06:34,262 --> 01:06:36,093
I'm shocked.

1180
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:37,958
Oh, yeah?

1181
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,494
What's your reaction, really?

1182
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,164
Well, my reaction is...

1183
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:45,838
- ... you can do it again if you like.
- Oh, yeah?

1184
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:38,588
I've always wanted a canopy bed.
Look at this.

1185
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:41,157
- Yeah, that looks interesting.
- It is, right?

1186
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:43,521
Is that mid-19th century?

1187
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:47,325
- I have no idea.
- Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

1188
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:51,298
I do- I love the posts,
but these beds, they're just-

1189
01:07:51,537 --> 01:07:53,266
Well, they're not very wide.

1190
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:57,534
- Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.
- Oh, Dwight.

1191
01:07:59,946 --> 01:08:02,107
We could do the top
in a muslin or linen-

1192
01:08:02,315 --> 01:08:05,250
- Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.
- Well, it's not-

1193
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:07,942
You know, last night
when we were making love...

1194
01:08:08,154 --> 01:08:10,349
...I realized how removed
from the world...

1195
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:14,252
- ... I've been since Andrea died.
- I know, I know. I...

1196
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:17,826
I think when something's right,
you just...

1197
01:08:18,063 --> 01:08:21,294
- You know it immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1198
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:44,287
Do you-? Do you hear that?

1199
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:46,457
- Can you hear the bass, though?
- Yeah.

1200
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:49,786
Like, the bass
and then the high-end definition.

1201
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:52,156
I'm definitely gonna get one. Yup.

1202
01:08:52,364 --> 01:08:54,525
- I'm giving you this one.
- No, you're not.

1203
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,893
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, my God.

1204
01:08:57,134 --> 01:08:58,897
- Come here.
- You're so sweet.

1205
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,366
- You're sweet.
- You're sweet.

1206
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,904
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1207
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:06,166
Isn't this dancing?

1208
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:08,845
Yeah, this is slow dancing,
which is really...

1209
01:09:09,046 --> 01:09:12,345
- What?
- Well, it's the key, I always say...

1210
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,710
...to good lovemaking.

1211
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:15,613
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1212
01:09:16,721 --> 01:09:20,213
- Where do you think Mom is tonight?
- Oh, she's got a date tonight.

1213
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,551
- Oh, that's cool.
- I wonder where she is.

1214
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,524
Well, I don't think
she's at Chuck E. Cheese.

1215
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,690
I'm gonna babysit you.
I'm a good babysitter.

1216
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:30,264
- Yeah.
- You know?

1217
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:33,629
You should babysit.
I used to babysit when I was a teenager.

1218
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:35,396
It's how you make extra money.

1219
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,631
Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

1220
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:43,268
Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

1221
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:47,711
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

1222
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,851
"Blue Moon" was the song that was
playing. You know the song "Blue Moon. "

1223
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:55,286
Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

1224
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,054
You know, I had energy.

1225
01:09:58,595 --> 01:10:01,462
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

1226
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,962
You know, I ran charities
for poor people...

1227
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,397
...and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

1228
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,698
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

1229
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:15,606
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

1230
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:19,270
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

1231
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,575
Tip big, boys.

1232
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:26,915
Tip big, because you get good service
and they count on tips.

1233
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:30,319
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth...

1234
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,550
...you must remember to be generous.

1235
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,958
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

1236
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,189
Yeah, and then you talked to yourself.

1237
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:43,226
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand...

1238
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,806
...until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

1239
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:52,477
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself...

1240
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,478
...and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

1241
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,446
Why Edison?

1242
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:01,646
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

1243
01:11:02,724 --> 01:11:05,591
See, everything unraveled so quickly.

1244
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:09,456
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia...

1245
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,655
...and this acute fear of death.

1246
01:11:11,866 --> 01:11:15,859
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

1247
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:19,163
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

1248
01:11:19,373 --> 01:11:22,536
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

1249
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:27,510
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect...

1250
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:31,741
...that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

1251
01:11:32,019 --> 01:11:34,317
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot...

1252
01:11:34,522 --> 01:11:38,253
...not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true.

1253
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,324
But a cheat is a cheat.

1254
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:45,855
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

1255
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:49,264
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

1256
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:52,661
But that's all history, boys.

1257
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:56,138
I met someone. I'm a new person.

1258
01:11:59,913 --> 01:12:02,211
- Get everything?
- Yes. These in the kitchen?

1259
01:12:02,415 --> 01:12:05,873
- Sure.
- I can't believe how much you paid for it.

1260
01:12:06,086 --> 01:12:08,350
I know it's ridiculous and it's old.

1261
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:10,489
God knows if it even works.

1262
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:15,559
- We have the terrace for a telescope.
- Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.

1263
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:18,228
And the moon will look incredible
through it.

1264
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,195
- Ever seen the moon through that?
- Oh, I can imagine.

1265
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:24,928
Hey, can I ask you something?

1266
01:12:25,839 --> 01:12:27,431
- Sure.
- You ever think...

1267
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:29,938
...you could see yourself
married to me?

1268
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:32,901
Married?

1269
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:38,175
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

1270
01:12:38,384 --> 01:12:41,751
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

1271
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:44,889
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

1272
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,082
And you can have all the chocolate cake
and wine you want.

1273
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:54,232
And then we come back and I get serious
about my political dream.

1274
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:57,027
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house...

1275
01:12:57,236 --> 01:13:00,728
...that you're gonna do
such a fantastic job making beautiful.

1276
01:13:02,474 --> 01:13:06,137
What do you think? Downside for you
is you have to stand next to me...

1277
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:09,404
...and smile at photo ops when
I throw my hat in the ring.

1278
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:13,210
- So you're saying you love me.
- Can't you tell?

1279
01:13:13,419 --> 01:13:17,355
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

1280
01:13:17,556 --> 01:13:20,547
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

1281
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:23,124
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

1282
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:26,075
I'll admit, my heart's
beating a little fast.

1283
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,477
Yeah, your hands are shaking.

1284
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:30,863
I wanted you to want me
and now you do.

1285
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:35,964
Thank you so much.

1286
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:39,974
Have a nice day. You got it?
Okay, I'll take that.

1287
01:13:40,178 --> 01:13:43,238
- What are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.

1288
01:13:43,481 --> 01:13:46,450
- I told you not to bother me.
- You're sleeping with Al.

1289
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:48,642
You're not gonna make a fool
out of me.

1290
01:13:48,886 --> 01:13:51,787
Chili, this is not the place
to discuss this, okay?

1291
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,651
- Sir, is there a problem?
- Sorry.

1292
01:13:53,891 --> 01:13:55,085
No, there's no problem.

1293
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:58,660
- Ginger, Ginger, I love you.
- Ginger, what's going on?

1294
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:00,158
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1295
01:14:00,398 --> 01:14:03,833
No, I just need a- Just need a break
from everything to think.

1296
01:14:04,034 --> 01:14:08,164
- All right, look, I blame this on Jasmine.
- No, she's just looking out for me.

1297
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,203
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?
I don't like her.

1298
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:13,807
You meant nothing to her
until she needed you.

1299
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:16,980
- I'm working, Chili.
- I'm nuts about you, Ging.

1300
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:21,048
I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do
all these things together, big things.

1301
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:23,718
What great things, huh?
You're a grease monkey.

1302
01:14:23,954 --> 01:14:28,482
- And I'll be bagging groceries all my life.
- She"s cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.

1303
01:14:28,692 --> 01:14:30,853
- You told me that yourself.
- I need space.

1304
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:33,325
Just give me some space, okay?

1305
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,623
I can't sleep.

1306
01:14:36,433 --> 01:14:39,459
- I'm a nervous wreck.
- Oh, for chrissake.

1307
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,002
I can't get you off of my head.

1308
01:14:42,205 --> 01:14:45,504
Stop it. Will you stop crying?
There's people around.

1309
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:47,938
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

1310
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:49,236
- Oh, my God.
- I don't.

1311
01:14:49,478 --> 01:14:51,844
- Stop it. Stop it, please.
- I got this, okay?

1312
01:14:52,048 --> 01:14:55,313
- Would you like to sit in my office?
- No. But I appreciate it.

1313
01:14:55,518 --> 01:14:57,986
Look, who's this guy, Al?

1314
01:14:58,187 --> 01:15:00,655
- What does he do?
- You know what he doesn't do?

1315
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:03,882
He doesn't make scenes
where I work in public.

1316
01:15:04,093 --> 01:15:07,085
Come on, brother.
Would you like a Kleenex?

1317
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:11,194
- I love her so much.
- It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?

1318
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,765
Great.

1319
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:21,967
Hello.

1320
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,578
- Hello.
- Hi.

1321
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,214
Hi.

1322
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,579
You seem up.

1323
01:15:34,789 --> 01:15:38,850
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

1324
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,052
- How great.
- What's that smell?

1325
01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:43,992
Did you break a bottle of perfume?

1326
01:15:44,265 --> 01:15:46,995
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

1327
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:48,931
That's sweet. But if I may say...

1328
01:15:49,137 --> 01:15:52,538
...you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

1329
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:55,869
God, I'm always nervous
it will wear off.

1330
01:15:56,077 --> 01:15:58,602
He's taking me to his favorite jeweler.

1331
01:15:58,813 --> 01:16:00,940
You think Al is a step up from Chili?

1332
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:03,913
Anybody is a step up from Chili.

1333
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:05,643
He's such a gentleman.

1334
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:08,788
Well, then he's definitely a step up.

1335
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,753
But in bed, he's no gentleman.

1336
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,826
Wait till he takes a whiff
of my new fragrance.

1337
01:16:15,062 --> 01:16:16,757
It's French.

1338
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:26,262
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Yeah, I'm on my way over right now.

1339
01:16:26,473 --> 01:16:29,271
- You're late.
- Oh, God.

1340
01:16:29,476 --> 01:16:33,469
- I'm still shaking.
- What's the matter?

1341
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:38,179
I think Hal is having an affair.

1342
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,145
With Lisette Boudreau?

1343
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,922
Who is she?

1344
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,693
That French girl. The Jordans' au pair.

1345
01:16:50,964 --> 01:16:52,864
What do you know about this?

1346
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,767
You're the only one who doesn't know.

1347
01:16:55,969 --> 01:17:00,064
I've known about Hal's affairs for years,
but it's not my business.

1348
01:17:00,573 --> 01:17:01,972
How did you find out?

1349
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:06,667
The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

1350
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:09,109
Hal left his Rolex there.

1351
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:13,081
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

1352
01:17:13,286 --> 01:17:15,584
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along...

1353
01:17:15,788 --> 01:17:20,020
...and I didn't know what they were talking
about, so I did some checking and...

1354
01:17:20,226 --> 01:17:22,524
I knew this day would come.

1355
01:17:23,296 --> 01:17:25,662
I'm surprised it took so long.

1356
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:28,862
Who else?

1357
01:17:31,103 --> 01:17:33,230
Victoria Alter.

1358
01:17:34,173 --> 01:17:36,004
Raylene.

1359
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:37,608
This au pair.

1360
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:40,544
That trainer he used to take
to baseball games.

1361
01:17:40,746 --> 01:17:42,872
- Oh, my God.
- You know how many people...

1362
01:17:43,114 --> 01:17:46,709
...have said to me he's doing his lawyer,
the Chinese dragon lady?

1363
01:17:46,918 --> 01:17:49,751
- Can we get the waiter? I need a drink.
- Yes. Waiter.

1364
01:17:49,988 --> 01:17:51,216
- Yes, ma'am?
- This again.

1365
01:17:51,423 --> 01:17:53,391
- Right away. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

1366
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:17,637
Hello?

1367
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:20,241
Yeah, is Al there?

1368
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,279
Al Munsinger, yeah.

1369
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:29,083
I know he works
in the Audio Department, yeah.

1370
01:18:29,693 --> 01:18:31,422
Yeah, I'll hold.

1371
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:36,092
Hello?

1372
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:39,465
Al Munsinger, yes.

1373
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,937
Al, where the hell are you?

1374
01:18:43,674 --> 01:18:45,039
What?

1375
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:48,869
What? I don't get it.
Why couldn't you come?

1376
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:56,276
Who found out what?

1377
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,119
Who's Ellen?

1378
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:10,631
Yeah, I-

1379
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,427
I didn't understand you had a wife.

1380
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:17,305
No.

1381
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:20,134
No, you never said.

1382
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,516
My mother was very impressed
with you.

1383
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,955
- Really?
- Yeah. You two had a discussion...

1384
01:19:40,163 --> 01:19:43,098
- ... about her collection of pewter.
- Yes. I love pewter.

1385
01:19:43,299 --> 01:19:46,268
Hal used to have his beer
out of a pewter mug.

1386
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:47,828
And your dad?

1387
01:19:48,037 --> 01:19:52,030
My dad can be very critical sometimes,
but he was very taken with you.

1388
01:19:52,775 --> 01:19:55,800
Well, don't worry,
I won't pick out too big a stone.

1389
01:19:56,011 --> 01:19:58,445
Yeah, nothing larger
than the Hope diamond.

1390
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:00,877
Hey, Jasmine.

1391
01:20:02,184 --> 01:20:05,051
What? You don't remember me?

1392
01:20:05,854 --> 01:20:08,823
Of course I remember you.
What a surprise.

1393
01:20:09,758 --> 01:20:11,988
Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?

1394
01:20:12,761 --> 01:20:14,956
This is Augie. Dwight.

1395
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:16,994
- Dwight, hi.
- How you doing?

1396
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,860
I was married to her sister.

1397
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:21,298
- Okay.
- Years ago. Years.

1398
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:24,529
Wasn't that many years.
She makes it sound ancient.

1399
01:20:24,773 --> 01:20:28,368
Congratulations. Ginger said
you got a new job up in Alaska.

1400
01:20:29,878 --> 01:20:32,711
I could've had my own company
if it wasn't for you...

1401
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:36,974
- ... and that crook you married.
- I don't think it's the time and place.

1402
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:41,883
Oh, really? You think I wanna lay oil pipe
way the hell up there in Alaska?

1403
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:43,488
I got no money.

1404
01:20:43,691 --> 01:20:47,058
Christ, can't you put this behind you
and move on? I've moved on.

1405
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:51,424
- Take it easy. I don't know who you are-
- Right, you don't, so stay out of it.

1406
01:20:52,033 --> 01:20:53,295
I saw your son.

1407
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:56,869
Yeah, that's right, Danny.
Remember him?

1408
01:20:57,405 --> 01:21:01,739
Lives across the bridge in Oakland,
works at a music store. Antonio's.

1409
01:21:02,309 --> 01:21:05,301
He's doing pretty good. He's married.

1410
01:21:05,846 --> 01:21:08,371
I think he's finally over Hal's suicide.

1411
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:11,247
Danny's in Oakland?

1412
01:21:11,452 --> 01:21:15,252
Let me tell you something,
Jeanette, Jasmine...

1413
01:21:15,456 --> 01:21:18,425
...whatever it is
you call yourself these days.

1414
01:21:18,626 --> 01:21:20,593
Some people...

1415
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:24,319
...they don't put things behind
so easily.

1416
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:34,067
You have a son?

1417
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:39,343
Yes, I have a son. He's not- Biologically
he's not my son. He's my step-

1418
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:41,844
- Hal's suicide?
- I can explain it all later.

1419
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:44,881
- Can we just-?
- Not until you tell me what's going on.

1420
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:46,916
- Not in the street.
- I want to know.

1421
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,782
- I know. We'll go somewhere quiet.
- Get in the car.

1422
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,958
- Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
- Okay.

1423
01:21:57,997 --> 01:22:01,558
Of course we can't get married!
You lied to me up and down the line!

1424
01:22:01,768 --> 01:22:04,395
- No, I wanted to tell you.
- Are you delusional?

1425
01:22:04,603 --> 01:22:06,503
Didn't you think I'd find out?

1426
01:22:06,738 --> 01:22:09,798
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know what I was thinking.

1427
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:13,136
Everything happened in the past.
You and I loved each other.

1428
01:22:13,378 --> 01:22:15,005
What? That it would just vanish?

1429
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:18,978
Didn't you think I would find out,
if not today, eventually?

1430
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:23,746
Like after we were married? Is that what
you wanted, to wait until it was too late?

1431
01:22:23,956 --> 01:22:27,084
For your future plans
where you needed the appropriate wife?

1432
01:22:27,292 --> 01:22:30,784
I won't say it wouldn't be an issue,
but that you could stand by...

1433
01:22:30,996 --> 01:22:34,523
- ... deceive me until I married you-
- No, you mean till I trapped you.

1434
01:22:34,766 --> 01:22:38,998
- Your ethical behavior is equal to your ex.
- I wasn't deceiving you. I loved you.

1435
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:42,970
- I found out by chance, by sheer chance.
- Okay, if it's over, it's over.

1436
01:22:43,175 --> 01:22:46,611
I get it. You're not marrying me.
I brought everything on myself.

1437
01:22:46,812 --> 01:22:51,009
I've only got myself to blame.
I did it to myself again, as usual.

1438
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:53,843
You and your stupid
little French whore.

1439
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:57,851
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Let me out of the car.

1440
01:22:58,055 --> 01:23:00,785
- Let me out of the car.
- How are you gonna get home?

1441
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,927
I'm not going home. Let me out.
Let me out of the car!

1442
01:23:25,683 --> 01:23:29,050
Hey, remember to tell her
when she gets here, okay?

1443
01:23:29,253 --> 01:23:31,084
Believe me, she won't care.

1444
01:23:31,322 --> 01:23:34,051
- She is half out the door.
- Yeah, well...

1445
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:36,225
I didn't start out not liking her.

1446
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:39,451
I think she had it in for me
from the moment she met me.

1447
01:23:40,263 --> 01:23:41,491
Well, I like you.

1448
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:44,599
Now, that's what counts,
not how she feels about you.

1449
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:47,496
You know, I'm sick of her
calling you a loser...

1450
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:51,037
...or always pushing me
to find a better man.

1451
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:54,369
You know, in my book, you're no loser.

1452
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:57,570
You're twice the guy I met at the party
she dragged me to.

1453
01:23:57,781 --> 01:23:59,578
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1454
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:01,341
- Well, I love you.
- I know.

1455
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:05,078
- I love the boys. I think they love me too.
- They do.

1456
01:24:05,288 --> 01:24:09,691
- When I thought I lost you-
- You didn't lose me, baby.

1457
01:24:09,893 --> 01:24:12,088
I almost lost you.

1458
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:42,547
Is this what you gave up
everything for?

1459
01:24:42,758 --> 01:24:46,455
To sell secondhand
musical instruments?

1460
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:51,332
I asked Augie not to tell you
where I was.

1461
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:55,031
Why?

1462
01:24:56,538 --> 01:24:58,529
What happened?

1463
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,970
Why did you disappear like that
and never contact me?

1464
01:25:02,176 --> 01:25:05,668
I couldn't find you when I needed you.

1465
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:11,150
I know the whole story, I found it out,
so don't act so surprised.

1466
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:22,053
Are you having an affair
with Lisette Boudreau?

1467
01:25:22,563 --> 01:25:24,861
Oh, Jasmine,
I can't do this without a drink.

1468
01:25:25,099 --> 01:25:28,000
No, don't tap dance.
You never went to Chicago.

1469
01:25:28,202 --> 01:25:30,568
You took the Jordans' au pair
to Paris.

1470
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:33,002
I know what's been going on.

1471
01:25:33,374 --> 01:25:36,969
- Can we talk about this, please?
- You bet we can talk about it.

1472
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:38,668
Can you do it calmly?

1473
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,509
I wanna talk to you about
what's going on, but you're always so-

1474
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:44,308
How do you expect me to react?

1475
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:47,009
You've been sleeping
with other women for years.

1476
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:51,281
I mean, Raylene,
your secretary, our trainer.

1477
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:54,016
- Amy.
- This is different.

1478
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:56,127
This is serious.

1479
01:25:56,363 --> 01:25:58,490
Lisette and I are in love.

1480
01:25:59,366 --> 01:26:01,334
Wha-? What?

1481
01:26:01,635 --> 01:26:02,966
Are you crazy?

1482
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:07,231
I'm sorry, but I need you to hear
what I'm saying. Lisette and I are in love.

1483
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:11,002
What does that mean?
What does that stupidity even mean?

1484
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:15,147
It means that we are making plans
for the future together.

1485
01:26:15,349 --> 01:26:17,647
I'm sorry.
I'm having trouble understanding.

1486
01:26:17,851 --> 01:26:21,218
I know this comes as a shock,
but I have to be honest with you.

1487
01:26:21,421 --> 01:26:24,822
You wanna be honest.
That's the biggest joke of all.

1488
01:26:25,025 --> 01:26:27,151
I've had casual flirtations in the past.

1489
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,193
They didn't mean anything until now.
This is different.

1490
01:26:30,396 --> 01:26:34,696
Are you out of your mind?
She is a teenager, for chrissake.

1491
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,562
She's an au pair.
I mean, are you crazy?

1492
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:42,230
- Christ, this is hard for me to tell you!
- It's hard for you? What about me?

1493
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:44,341
This is so humiliating for me.

1494
01:26:44,543 --> 01:26:48,070
I mean, it is bad enough that
everyone knows you've been unfaithful.

1495
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,681
But to throw me away for this
stupid-looking little French-

1496
01:26:51,884 --> 01:26:54,717
- I will take very good care of you.
- I'm sorry.

1497
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,356
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1498
01:26:58,557 --> 01:27:01,253
I don't know what I'm-
What am I doing here?

1499
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:05,453
Oh, God, this is unacceptable.
This is not gonna happen.

1500
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:08,189
You're not going anywhere.
This is unacceptable.

1501
01:27:08,401 --> 01:27:12,166
- Jasmine, you're having a tantrum.
- Don't you touch me!

1502
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:15,271
- Don't you touch me!
- You are having a tantrum.

1503
01:27:15,473 --> 01:27:17,964
Stop, stop.

1504
01:27:18,209 --> 01:27:20,905
- What am I doing here?
- Pull yourself together.

1505
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:23,447
- I can't-
- Jasmine.

1506
01:27:26,684 --> 01:27:30,279
When you calm down, we can talk
like two civilized adults...

1507
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:33,082
...about the arrangements
we have to make.

1508
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:48,732
Until then I'm gonna check into a hotel.

1509
01:27:56,146 --> 01:28:01,015
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

1510
01:28:12,963 --> 01:28:17,332
Hello.
Yes, I want the number of the FBl.

1511
01:28:18,101 --> 01:28:19,966
Can you connect me?

1512
01:28:21,538 --> 01:28:23,529
The FBl.

1513
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,168
- Mr. Francis?
- Yes?

1514
01:28:26,376 --> 01:28:28,003
- Hal Francis?
- Yes.

1515
01:28:28,245 --> 01:28:31,305
I'm sorry, sir,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

1516
01:28:31,648 --> 01:28:33,980
- What?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1517
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,652
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No, sir.

1518
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:40,016
- It's best if you come with us now.
- Under arrest for what?

1519
01:28:40,256 --> 01:28:42,816
Sir, come with us now.
We'll settle this downtown.

1520
01:28:43,025 --> 01:28:45,255
- Do you have a warrant?
- I do.

1521
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:47,795
- Gonna handcuff me?
- We are.

1522
01:28:47,997 --> 01:28:51,330
- I wanna talk to my lawyer.
- You'll be able to call your lawyer.

1523
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:54,469
But we'll warn you,
you have the right to remain silent.

1524
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,468
Anything you say can be held
against you in court.

1525
01:28:57,673 --> 01:28:59,538
- Okay, okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

1526
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:03,302
Jesus Christ Almighty.

1527
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:08,849
- What am I being arrested for?
- We can discuss this downtown, sir.

1528
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:16,218
As disillusioned as I was with him,
I hated you more.

1529
01:29:19,295 --> 01:29:22,889
The moment I did what I did,
I regretted it.

1530
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:26,726
I don't wanna discuss it.
It's past. It's over.

1531
01:29:26,935 --> 01:29:29,529
You can't take back that phone call.

1532
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:33,603
I need you, Danny.

1533
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:38,744
I don't wanna see you, Jasmine.
I want the past past.

1534
01:29:38,947 --> 01:29:42,906
I've become a different person,
thanks to my wife. I'm off drugs.

1535
01:29:43,118 --> 01:29:46,815
Just, please, don't spoil everything.

1536
01:29:47,022 --> 01:29:49,855
Just get out of my life
so I can move on.

1537
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:53,822
Definitely.

1538
01:29:55,864 --> 01:29:56,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

1539
01:29:57,132 --> 01:30:00,124
Hey, have some champagne.

1540
01:30:00,835 --> 01:30:03,599
Chili brought some over to celebrate.

1541
01:30:03,838 --> 01:30:05,862
We're back together.

1542
01:30:07,207 --> 01:30:10,108
I'm sorry,
I'm not in a celebratory mood.

1543
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:13,541
I don't think I'd find that news
anything to celebrate about.

1544
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:16,739
Hey, come on, Jasmine,
let's not dig at each other, okay?

1545
01:30:16,951 --> 01:30:19,852
I'm moving in, and she tells me
you found a rich husband.

1546
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:22,545
- Gonna be a big shot in Washington.
- We made up.

1547
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:26,954
- Yeah, she begged for my forgiveness.
- And he cried like a baby and apologized.

1548
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:32,098
- I didn't cry.
- Bullshit. You cry all the time.

1549
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:34,460
But we're moving in.

1550
01:30:34,668 --> 01:30:38,570
It's something we planned for a long time
and maybe if we'd just done it-

1551
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,263
Oh, for chrissake.

1552
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:43,943
What's wrong with your self-esteem?

1553
01:30:44,144 --> 01:30:48,137
There's men who'd never think
about ripping the phone out of the wall.

1554
01:30:48,382 --> 01:30:51,908
Hey, leave him alone.
You're always picking on him.

1555
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:54,018
No, you choose losers, okay?

1556
01:30:54,253 --> 01:30:56,517
Because that's what you think
you deserve.

1557
01:30:56,756 --> 01:31:01,125
That's why you're living like this and
that's why you'll never have a better life.

1558
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,528
I'm- I'm living-

1559
01:31:03,763 --> 01:31:09,497
I'm living like this because
you married the biggest loser of all...

1560
01:31:09,702 --> 01:31:12,000
...and went your own sweet way...

1561
01:31:12,205 --> 01:31:17,768
...while he pissed away my
one big chance to make a better life.

1562
01:31:17,977 --> 01:31:20,468
Come on, let's not ruin
our celebration, okay?

1563
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,343
Come on, she's happy, we're happy.
Let's let sleeping dogs lie.

1564
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:28,008
He's right. I'm not gonna be drawn
into defending myself...

1565
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:32,055
...when all I wanted to do
was bring you in on a good deal.

1566
01:31:34,226 --> 01:31:37,195
I'm moving out of this place today.

1567
01:31:37,696 --> 01:31:39,857
I just gotta get myself together.

1568
01:31:40,065 --> 01:31:44,559
Dwight asked me to move in with him,
as I expected he would.

1569
01:31:44,803 --> 01:31:46,964
He wants me to finish
decorating his home.

1570
01:31:47,172 --> 01:31:49,697
Then we'll marry
and we'll move in together.

1571
01:31:49,941 --> 01:31:52,842
He's one of these men
who's lost without a woman.

1572
01:31:53,045 --> 01:31:56,037
It has to be the right woman,
who's a plus for his career.

1573
01:31:56,248 --> 01:32:00,685
And I have the social skills required
for his future in politics.

1574
01:32:01,053 --> 01:32:05,046
For the next few years,
we'll be living in Vienna.

1575
01:32:05,524 --> 01:32:08,721
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a shower.

1576
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,757
I'll send for my luggage.

1577
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:18,728
I was pretty angry at some of the things
she said, but I kept it on the inside.

1578
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:24,773
I'm tired of her knocking you.
You know?

1579
01:32:33,184 --> 01:32:36,017
Don't even think about taking
that last slice of pizza.

1580
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:39,781
- What? Why?
- That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.

1581
01:32:40,024 --> 01:32:42,390
- Is it really?
- Last slice belongs to the man.

1582
01:32:42,593 --> 01:32:45,892
- You're putting too much on the hips.
- Is that so?

1583
01:32:46,097 --> 01:32:49,089
- Yeah, if you wanna keep me around-
- This slice is yours?

1584
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:55,034
- Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.
- Is this yours? Is this yours?

1585
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:57,503
That slice of pizza is mine.

1586
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:00,403
- That's mine.
- Yeah.

1587
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,737
That's mine. That's mine.

1588
01:33:02,946 --> 01:33:05,744
Oh, that's mine.
Those are definitely mine.

1589
01:33:05,949 --> 01:33:09,544
Is that yours? Yeah?

1590
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:13,646
Yeah, that's yours, okay.

1591
01:33:32,175 --> 01:33:34,837
It's fraught with peril.

1592
01:33:35,612 --> 01:33:38,740
They gossip, you know, they talk.

1593
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,684
I saw Danny.

1594
01:33:43,052 --> 01:33:45,281
Yes, did I tell you?

1595
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,750
He's getting married.

1596
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:54,318
A weekend in Palm Beach
means I can wear...

1597
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:59,500
What could I wear? I can wear
the Dior dress I bought in Paris.

1598
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:03,561
Yes, my black dress.

1599
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:06,866
Well, Hal always used to surprise me
with jewelry.

1600
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:09,939
Extravagant pieces.

1601
01:34:10,379 --> 01:34:13,314
I think he used to buy them at auction.

1602
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:18,447
It's so obvious what you're doing.

1603
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:21,345
You think I don't know.

1604
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,222
French au pair.

1605
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,125
This was playing on the Vineyard.

1606
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,027
"Blue Moon. "

1607
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:43,135
I used to know the words.

1608
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:47,478
I knew the words.

1609
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,218
Now they're all a jumble.

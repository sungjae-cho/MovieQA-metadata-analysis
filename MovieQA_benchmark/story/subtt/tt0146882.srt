of five things you'd do
if qualifications...

1291
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:44,851

want to do anyway.

1293

Well, I did put it
at number five.

1294

record store than be an architect?

- And you wouldn't want to be...

or the king of France?

1297

01:19:52,322 --> 01:19:55,291
Top five things
I miss about Laura.

1310
01:19:55,392 --> 01:19:58,987
One: sense of humor. Very dry,
but it can also be warm and forgiving.

1311
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:02,724
And she's got one of the best
all-time laughs in the history
of all-time laughs.

1312
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:05,198
She laughs
with her entire body.

1313
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:07,997
Two: She's got character.

1314
01:20:08,104 --> 01:20:11,369
Or at least she had character
before the Ian nightmare.

1315
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,374
She's loyal and honest...

1316
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:16,570
and she doesn't even take it out
on people when she's having a bad day.

1317
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,874
That's character.

1318
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:21,041
Three:

1319
01:20:24,254 --> 01:20:26,984
I miss her smell...

1320
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,991
and the way she tastes.

1321
01:20:30,093 --> 01:20:33,153
It's a mystery of human chemistry,
and I don't understand it.

1322
01:20:33,263 --> 01:20:38,496
Some people, as far as your senses
are concerned, just feel like home.

1323
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:46,040
I really dig
how she walks around.

1324
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:49,168
It's like she doesn't care how
she looks or what she projects.

1325
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:53,978
And it's not that she doesn't care,
it's just-- She's not affected, I guess.

1326
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,347
And that gives her grace.

1327
01:20:56,453 --> 01:21:00,355
And five: She does this thing in bed
when she can't get to sleep.

1328
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:03,756
She kind of half-moans
and then rubs her feet together
an equal number of times.

1329
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,351
It just kills me.

1330

a top-five-things about her

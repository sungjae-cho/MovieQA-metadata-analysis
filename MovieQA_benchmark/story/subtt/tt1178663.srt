1
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:00,712
That's not what I'm
saying, you imbecile.

2
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,820
God, you completely
misrepresent my ideas!

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,067
Why am I even bothering
talking to such idiots?

4
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,180
Boris, calm down.

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,300
No, don't tell me to...
I am calm.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Don't jump on us
just because

7
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,504
we don't understand
what you're saying.

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,921
I didn't jump on you.

9
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,729
It's not the idea behind
Christianity I'm faulting,

10
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,855
or Judaism,
or any religion.

11
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,301
It's the professionals who've
made it into a corporate business.

12
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,266
There's big money in the
God racket. Big money.

13
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,649
Here we go.
- We know, Boris.

14
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:22,924
Hey, the basic teachings of
Jesus are quite wonderful.

15
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:25,366
So, by the way, is the original
intention of Karl Marx. Okay?

16
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,763
Oh.

17
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:29,104
Hey, what could be bad?
Everybody should share equally.

18
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:32,309
Do unto others. Democracy.
Government by the people.

19
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:34,477
All great ideas.
These are all great ideas,

20
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:37,652
but they all suffer
from one fatal flaw.

21
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:38,953
Which is?
Yeah, what's that?

22
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:42,131
Which is they're all based
on the fallacious notion

23
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,935
that people are
fundamentally decent.

24
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,318
Give them a chance to do
right and they'll take it.

25
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,584
They're not stupid,
selfish, greedy,

26
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,290
cowardly,
short-sighted worms.

27
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,284
They do the best
they can.

28
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:53,374
Speak for yourself, man.
Speak for yourself.

29
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,963
All I'm saying is
that people make life

30
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:56,865
so much worse
than it has to be

31
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,454
and, believe me, it's a
nightmare without their help.

32
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,747
But on the whole, I'm sorry
to say, we're a failed species.

33
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,076
I wouldn't go
that far.

34
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,485
Not Ed.

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,694
That's why this
woman you like, Joe,

36
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,570
so what if she's
an embalmer's assistant,

37
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,824
so she stinks
from formaldehyde?

38
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,332
For Christ's sake,
you got to take

39
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,334
what little pleasure you can
find in this chamber of horrors.

40
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:18,252
A little formaldehyde,
okay, but she reeks of it.

41
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:19,965
You know, they don't
know your story.

42
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,826
Boris, tell them
your story.

43
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,573
My story is,
whatever works.

44
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:27,501
You know, as long as
you don't hurt anybody.

45
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,113
Any way you can
filch a little joy

46
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,078
in this cruel,
dog-eat-dog,

47
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,664
pointless, black chaos.
That's my story.

48
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:36,224
No. That's not...
Tell them the story.

49
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:37,550
Tell them.
Yeah. Tell them.

50
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,559
You just want me to say
it again, so they can hear.

51
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,111
Who?
- Them.

52
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:42,612
Who?
- Who's them?

53
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,150
You see something out there?
- Where?

54
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,485
What are you?
An imbecile?

55
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,696
There's an audience full
of people looking at us.

56
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:47,845
An audience?
- What's he talking about?

57
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:49,531
You feel you're
being watched.

58
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,429
They paid good money for
tickets, hard-earned money,

59
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:54,485
so some moron in Hollywood
can buy a bigger swimming pool.

60
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,059
Okay, you're saying there
are human beings out there

61
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:59,452
who bought tickets
to watch us.

62
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:02,819
Well, mostly they're
interested in me, I have to say.

63
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:05,247
Yeah, they're just sitting
there. Don't you see them?

64
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,278
Some are eating popcorn, some
are just staring straight ahead

65
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:09,685
breathing through their
mouths like Neanderthals.

66
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,824
So they're there
to listen to your story?

67
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:13,369
Total delusions of grandeur.

68
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,170
Completely.

69
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,197
Why would you want
to hear my story?

70
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:20,381
Do we know each other?
Do we like each other?

71
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,969
Let me tell you
right off, okay?

72
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:28,435
I'm not a likeable guy. Charm
has never been a priority with me.

73
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:32,585
And just so you know, this is not
the feel-good movie of the year.

74
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,744
So if you're one of those
idiots who needs to feel good,

75
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,416
go get yourself
a foot massage.

76
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,580
Mom, that man's
talking to himself!

77
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,622
Come away, Justin.

78
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,758
What the hell does it all mean anyhow?
Nothing. Zero. Zilch.

79
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,002
Nothing comes
to anything,

80
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:48,914
and yet there's no shortage
of idiots to babble.

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,196
Not me. I have a vision.
I'm discussing you.

82
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,828
Your friends, your co-workers,
your newspapers, the TV.

83
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:58,877
Everybody's happy to talk,
full of misinformation.

84
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:02,583
Morality, science, religion,
politics, sports, love.

85
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,263
Your portfolio,
your children, health.

86
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,941
Christ. If I have to
eat nine servings

87
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,835
of fruits and vegetables
a day to live,

88
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:12,758
I don't want to live. I hate
goddamn fruits and vegetables.

89
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:16,139
And your omega-3's and the
treadmill and the cardiogram

90
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:18,531
and the mammogram
and the pelvic sonogram

91
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:21,197
and, oh, my God,
the colonoscopy!

92
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:24,688
And with it all, the day still
comes when they put you in a box

93
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,642
and it's on to the next
generation of idiots

94
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:28,458
who'll also tell
you all about life

95
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:31,350
and define for you
what's appropriate.

96
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:33,464
My father
committed suicide

97
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,142
because the morning newspapers
depressed him.

98
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,431
And could you blame him?

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,642
With the horror and corruption
and ignorance and poverty

100
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:44,147
and genocide and AIDS and
global warming and terrorism

101
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:48,702
and the family-value morons
and the gun morons!

102
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:51,647
<i>"The horror," Kurtz said at the
end of Heart of Darkness.</i>

103
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,320
"The horror."

104
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:55,349
<i>Lucky Kurtz didn't have the Times
delivered in the jungle,</i>

105
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,365
then he'd see
some horror.

106
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,613
But what do you do?

107
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,327
You read about some
massacre in Darfur

108
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,824
or some school bus
gets blown up,

109
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,687
and you go,
"Oh, my God, the horror!"

110
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,108
And then you
turn the page

111
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:09,150
and finish your eggs
from free-range chickens.

112
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:12,393
Because what can you do?
It's overwhelming.

113
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:15,058
I tried to commit
suicide myself.

114
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,613
Obviously,
it didn't work out.

115
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,139
But why do you even want
to hear about all this?

116
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,141
Christ, you got
your own problems.

117
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:22,424
I'm sure you're
all obsessed with

118
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,304
any number of sad
little hopes and dreams.

119
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:28,254
Your predictably
unsatisfying love lives.

120
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,831
Your failed
business ventures.

121
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,097
"Oh, if only I'd
bought that stock!"

122
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,271
"If only I had purchased
that house years ago!"

123
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,406
"If only I had made
a move on that woman."

124
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:40,249
If this, if that.
You know what?

125
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,799
Give me a break with your
"could haves" and "should haves."

126
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:44,392
Like my mother
used to say,

127
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,326
"If my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a trolley car."

128
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,539
My mother didn't have wheels.
She had varicose veins.

129
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,139
Still, the woman gave birth
to a brilliant mind.

130
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,857
I was considered for
a Nobel Prize in physics.

131
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,040
I didn't get it.

132
00:05:58,055 --> 00:05:59,488
But, you know,
it's all politics,

133
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,864
just like every
other phony honor.

134
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:04,165
Incidentally,
don't think I'm bitter

135
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:07,271
because of some
personal setback.

136
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,777
By the standards of a
mindless, barbaric civilization,

137
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:12,630
I've been pretty lucky.

138
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,651
I was married to a beautiful
woman, who had family money.

139
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,894
For years we lived
on Beekman Place.

140
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,359
I taught at Columbia.
String theory.

141
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,771
What's the matter, Boris?

142
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:29,746
I'm dying!

143
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,403
What is it?

144
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:33,570
I'm dying!

145
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:34,946
Should I call
an ambulance?

146
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:39,357
No! No, not now! No, not tonight!
I mean, eventually!

147
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,843
Boris, everybody dies.

148
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,409
It's unacceptable!

149
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,679
Your panic attacks are getting
more frequent and more intense.

150
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,244
You have to go
back on your medicine.

151
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:49,143
I'm not going back
on my goddamn medicine.

152
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,865
I won't have my mind
befuddled by chemicals

153
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,293
when I'm the only one who sees the
whole picture for exactly what it is.

154
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,760
Where's the goddamn vodka?

155
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:55,797
Boris, I have clients to see
tomorrow morning.

156
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,154
It is 4:00 a.m.!

157
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,164
Clients. Right.
Wealthy bankers.

158
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,615
To design their
chic apartment,

159
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,255
to fill it full of art and
expensive possessions,

160
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,713
so they can
flaunt their money

161
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,987
and be in the top 1% of this
shameful, violent, prejudiced,

162
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,613
illiterate, sexually repressed,
self-righteous nation!

163
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:17,362
Christ, it is 4:00 a.m.
Can you spare me this sophomoric tirade!

164
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,029
I'm a man with
a huge worldview.

165
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,389
I'm surrounded
by microbes!

166
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:23,099
And what about me?
Am I a microbe?

167
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:25,422
Is our son at Yale
a microbe?

168
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,624
Let's face it,
Jessica, okay?

169
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:30,133
Our marriage hasn't
been a garden of roses.

170
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:32,763
Botanically speaking, you're
more of a Venus flytrap.

171
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,553
You are a very difficult
man to live with.

172
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:36,503
Is that why you
had an affair?

173
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,127
I didn't have an affair.

174
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:41,028
It was a brief interlude of
infidelity, and it happened years ago.

175
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:43,076
You still can't forget it!

176
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,757
I see everything so
clearly now. Everything!

177
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,739
I married you for
all the wrong reasons.

178
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,020
What's that
supposed to mean?

179
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:53,134
You're brilliant.
I wanted someone to talk to.

180
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,941
You loved classical music, you
loved art, you loved literature.

181
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,882
You loved sex!
You loved me!

182
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,598
Those sound like pretty
good reasons to me!

183
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:04,262
Yes! Exactly! That's the
problem! That's the problem!

184
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,779
It was rational,
it made sense!

185
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,538
I don't know
what went wrong.

186
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,797
When you examine it, there
is so much right about us.

187
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,497
On paper we're ideal.

188
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,433
But life isn't on paper.

189
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,571
Boris?

190
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,919
Boris, what are you doing?

191
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,525
Close the window!

192
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,097
Boris!

193
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:32,286
Can you believe I hit the canopy?
I hit the goddamn canopy.

194
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,881
Months in the hospital! Moron
doctors! Look. Look at this limp.

195
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,230
I never had a limp before.

196
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:42,132
Meanwhile, I divorced Jessica,
moved downtown and gave up.

197
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:46,106
<i>I eke out a meager living teaching
chess to incompetent zombies.</i>

198
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,304
Checkmate,
you little patzer.

199
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,718
Hey! He's only eight years old,
Mr. Yellnikoff.

200
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:50,951
You're supposed to
be teaching him...

201
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,267
He'll be an
incompetent idiot at 58.

202
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,798
More important than
how I make my living,

203
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:59,226
is why I bother
to live at all.

204
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,790
<i>Nights, I have trouble sleeping
and hang out on Mott Street,</i>

205
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,083
<i>trying to explain
to cretins that</i>

206
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,761
<i>while a black man got
into the White House</i>

207
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,826
<i>he still can't get
a cab in New York.</i>

208
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:10,075
Almost 100 years after
the abolition of slavery,

209
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,974
a man couldn't play
a game of baseball

210
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,159
in the big leagues if
his skin color was black.

211
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,736
You're harping
on one point.

212
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,863
Oh, good. Okay, forget
blacks. Take Jews.

213
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:21,032
What?
- Here we go.

214
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,614
For years they restricted
the number of Jews

215
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:24,482
in schools,
medical schools.

216
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,939
In America, as much
as they hated blacks,

217
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,504
they hate Jews
even more.

218
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:30,304
Blacks they were scared
had too big a penis.

219
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,130
Jews they hated,
even with little penises.

220
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,419
For God's sake,
I'm eating here.

221
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,733
You!
I've been looking for you.

222
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,337
I want to talk to you.
- Who are you?

223
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,104
Did you pick up a
chessboard full of pieces

224
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:42,692
and hit my son with it
at his lesson today?

225
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,316
That idiot's your son?

226
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,414
Do me a favor. Don't send
that cretin to me anymore.

227
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,294
I can't teach an
empty-headed zombie chess.

228
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:52,184
I'll have you know that
he is a very bright child.

229
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,458
In your opinion.
In your opinion.

230
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,721
Which is skewed, because
he's your unfortunate issue.

231
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,091
So you threw
a chessboard at him?

232
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,525
I didn't throw it at him.

233
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,066
I picked up the board and
dumped the pieces on his head

234
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:08,188
as an object lesson to shake
him out of his vegetable torpor.

235
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,691
You wait until my husband
gets back from Florida.

236
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,885
What's he doing in
Florida without you?

237
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,593
He will punch you
in the nose.

238
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:16,121
Her husband's in
Fort Lauderdale.

239
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,992
He's probably hanging out with
naked coeds on spring break.

240
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,607
He tells her it's
a business trip.

241
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:24,240
Your son's an imbecile.
Teach him tiddlywinks, not chess.

242
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:30,143
You handled
that beautifully, Boris.

243
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,374
You know,
you should open

244
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,955
the Boris Yellnikoff
Charm School.

245
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,625
Let's get out of here.
It's late. I'm tired.

246
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,148
Good night, Boris.

247
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,283
What? What are you doing?

248
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,933
Where are you going?
That's it?

249
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,190
Sir?
- Hey! What?

250
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,757
What the hell
are you doing?

251
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:56,126
My God, you scared me.
For God's sake!

252
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:58,196
You creep up on me like that,
you little vagrant.

253
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,208
What do you want?

254
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,864
Can you help me
get something to eat?

255
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,696
Oh, God, no,
I don't carry any money.

256
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:05,522
Now, come on, you can tell that to
your partner, wherever he's hiding.

257
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,671
Please, I'm so hungry!

258
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,321
Back up! Back up!

259
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,755
I haven't had anything to eat all day.
I think I'm going to faint.

260
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,720
Yeah, listen, I'm wise to
that scam, little girl, okay?

261
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,472
I know about professional
beggar school.

262
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,931
Please, I'm desperate.

263
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:22,646
God, stop that! You look terrible!
What's wrong with you?

264
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,697
Just... All right.

265
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:27,041
Come up for two minutes.
That's it. And then...

266
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,276
And then go.

267
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,289
Thank you!

268
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,648
Two minutes, okay?
That's it.

269
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,248
# Happy birthday to you

270
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,025
# Happy birthday to you

271
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,786
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

272
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,512
# Happy birthday to you

273
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:42,706
# Happy birthday to you

274
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,289
# Happy birthday to you

275
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,957
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

276
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:47,921
# Happy birthday to you #

277
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,673
Is this your birthday?

278
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,833
<i>You don't know you have to sing
Happy Birthday twice</i>

279
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,519
to get the germs off?

280
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,643
You said you were starving.
What do you like?

281
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:59,254
I like oysters,
blackened redfish,

282
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,639
gumbo, crab legs,
black-eyed...

283
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,210
Are you nuts?
What do you think I'm running?

284
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,712
A Creole restaurant?

285
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,015
How about
a can of sardines?

286
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,262
Oh, yes, please.

287
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:10,338
Gumbo.
So what's your name?

288
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,778
Melody. Melody Celestine.

289
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,875
Melody Celestine.

290
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:17,321
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.

291
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:20,553
It's French.
My mama's family was from New Orleans.

292
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,492
I'm from Mississippi,
Mr...

293
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,262
Um...

294
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,841
Muggeridge.
Lionel Muggeridge.

295
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:32,292
Mr. Muggeridge.

296
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:38,419
Eden, Mississippi.
You ever hear of it?

297
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,110
No, I haven't.

298
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,037
Not even the people who
live there have heard of it.

299
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,189
So...

300
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,125
So what are you
running away from?

301
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,946
Home.

302
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,003
Could you be more specific,
Melanie?

303
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:53,818
<i>Melody. Melanie was
from Gone with the Wind.</i>

304
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:56,836
Oh, yeah. I preferred the
one who played Scarlett.

305
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,045
Why? Melanie was the nice
one. She marries Ashley.

306
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,210
Ashley.
What an imbecile!

307
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,225
I couldn't stand him,
I couldn't stand his wife,

308
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,977
that goody two-shoes,
sexual nothing.

309
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:11,133
Scarlett, bitch that she was,
with those green eyes...

310
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:13,286
You know, I came in first
dressed as Scarlett O'Hara

311
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,758
in one of the pageants.

312
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,929
Pageant?
- Mmm-hmm.

313
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:20,241
My mom always used to keep me
busy in all these beauty contests.

314
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,971
That's why I didn't
get to schooling much.

315
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:26,558
All right, my advice
to you, go back home.

316
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,210
Oh, no,
I'm never going back home.

317
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:30,663
You're a
brainless little twit

318
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,534
who won't last
three days in New York.

319
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:34,223
You'd be dead
now of starvation

320
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,120
if I hadn't a heart
as big as all outdoors.

321
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,375
I can't go back home,
Mr. Muggeridge.

322
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:39,615
All right,
stop calling me Muggeridge.

323
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:41,127
But that's your name.

324
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,932
No, it's not my name.
My name is Boris Yellnikoff.

325
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,691
I was using an alias.
I thought, who knows,

326
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,618
you might be from the
Taliban or something.

327
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:48,705
Can I stay here?

328
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:52,120
Stay here? What are you?
Nuts? How old are you?

329
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,312
I'm 21.

330
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:55,759
Twenty-one? Yeah.

331
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:58,727
You're 21 like I play for
the Yankees. Twenty-one!

332
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,003
You're a professional
athlete with that limp?

333
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,306
Oh, Christ!

334
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,118
All right, look,
I don't want to go back.

335
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,976
Okay? I want to make a
new life here in New York.

336
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,300
You'll wind up a prostitute,
like those Asian girls

337
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,936
who come here
full of high hopes.

338
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,635
And then they wind up
turning tricks to keep alive.

339
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,591
And many of them are
actually good-looking.

340
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:18,476
That's so funny you just mentioned
tricks! You know, I do magic.

341
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,316
I do. I can show you.
I just need...

342
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:21,936
Do you have any
silk handkerchiefs?

343
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,904
Yeah, you know, some
other time, you're...

344
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,181
Look, you're a sweet kid.

345
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,119
Stupid beyond
all comprehension,

346
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,830
but you'll
never survive here.

347
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:34,725
You got nothing going
for you. Zero. Zilch.

348
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:37,707
You know, you may be beauty
contest material in the Deep South,

349
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:40,550
but this is the big time.
Here, you're a three.

350
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:44,299
A five maybe
after you bathe.

351
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,442
Did you get that limp
playing for the Yankees?

352
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,451
Imbecile child.
Brainless inchworm.

353
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:49,633
I didn't play
for the Yankees!

354
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,016
I was being
sarcastic before.

355
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:55,321
Oh, you...
I took it seriously.

356
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:56,949
Yes.

357
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:01,282
I usually get jokes. At the church's
social, I was the comedian twice.

358
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,870
I've a way with jokes. Yes.
- Really?

359
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,100
Spare me
and just get out.

360
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,849
No, Mr. Muggeridge...

361
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:07,877
Stop calling me Muggeridge, okay?
I already explained that!

362
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:11,061
I know, I know.
I'm sorry. I just...

363
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,931
I just need a place to stay for a
few nights, till I get on my feet.

364
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:18,104
I don't have
anywhere to go.

365
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,837
And if you throw me out and
I wind up an Asian prostitute,

366
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:24,249
that's gonna be
on your conscience.

367
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:28,874
I give up.
Sleep on the couch, imbecile.

368
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,053
I'm too tired to prolong
this brutal exchange

369
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,563
between a bedraggled microbe
and a Nobel-level thinker.

370
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,255
Keep out of my way.

371
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,044
I will, I promise.

372
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,504
I'm just gonna use the
little girl's to freshen up,

373
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,776
and then I'm gonna
go right to sleep.

374
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,257
Yes, yes, use the little girl's.
Freshen up.

375
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:45,715
Don't forget to
tip the attendant.

376
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,351
I won't.
Thank you so much, Mr...

377
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,950
Oh, what?

378
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,549
You were going to say Muggeridge again?
- No!

379
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,385
It's Boris Yellnikoff!
You call me Muggeridge one more time,

380
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,836
I'm gonna throw you
out the goddamn window.

381
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,232
Do you mind if
I watch a little TV?

382
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,739
Yes, I do, simpleton.

383
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,877
I just like to turn some
on at night to unwind.

384
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:03,656
Yeah. You touch that dial,
I'll unwind your head with my bare hands.

385
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,207
How about that?

386
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,508
Did you hear about Boris?
- What?

387
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:10,726
I tried to call him
yesterday

388
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,042
and a woman
answered the phone.

389
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,756
No! Who is she?

390
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,718
He got conned into
letting some little runaway

391
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,704
bed down in his apartment while she
looks for a job and gets settled.

392
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,421
Apparently she's never
been to New York before

393
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,617
and she's asked him if
he would show her around.

394
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,225
Boris is going to be sightseeing?
- Yeah.

395
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,490
Not a chance.
- No way.

396
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:25,704
No way.

397
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,841
My whole life
I've lived in New York,

398
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:31,025
I never wanted to
go to Grant's Tomb.

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,369
Now I know why.
- Why?

400
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:36,505
I should never go
to a tomb, ever.

401
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,342
My mom brought me
up to believe that

402
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,565
the good Lord has a plan
that we're all a part of.

403
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:43,065
He has His eye
on the sparrow.

404
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:46,034
Yeah, I pity the sparrow.

405
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:49,247
I'm not getting into
heaven, though. I sinned.

406
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:52,013
You? You're kidding.
You sinned?

407
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,162
I made love
before I was married.

408
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,806
Oh, my God.

409
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:59,772
Plenty of my friends have, but in
my house, that's just unforgivable.

410
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,209
I just couldn't
resist Bobby Klaxon.

411
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,112
All right, okay, spare
me the details, all right.

412
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:04,866
No, it was
really beautiful!

413
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,795
I mean, he was just this pretty boy
guitar player in this amazing rock band.

414
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,933
I mean, if you think
you're a genius,

415
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:10,981
he can double
on the drums.

416
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,537
No! Doubles on drums?

417
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,973
Yeah.

418
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,850
All the girls had a crush
on him, but he liked me.

419
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:20,124
He was so sweet
and sensitive,

420
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:22,594
and he caught the biggest
catfish in Plaquemines County.

421
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,657
I wondered who
caught that catfish.

422
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:25,803
Hey, you know,
my mom always told me

423
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,621
that it was gonna
hurt the first time,

424
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,014
you know, she said it was,
you know,

425
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:33,524
it's a woman's duty to just
lie down, bear it and...

426
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,406
You know, she said there were
a lot of perversions involved,

427
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,191
and that, you know, it's
God's will, you shouldn't do it

428
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,277
unless you were married and
you planned to have kids and...

429
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:42,448
She said it could
be dangerous,

430
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,796
but I just felt
like it was

431
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,675
the most natural
thing in the world.

432
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,324
You know,
it just felt right.

433
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:53,122
And all the little extras were just
fun. It wasn't complicated at all.

434
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:54,391
And I think Bobby
really liked it,

435
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:57,734
because he was going to
dump his Betty Jo Cleary,

436
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:58,764
this girl he was
going steady with.

437
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,785
But I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hear of it.

438
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,128
It was just what it was,
you know,

439
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:07,540
it was a nice moment behind
the tent at the fish fry.

440
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:10,393
That is the most disgusting
story I've ever heard.

441
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,871
You and this adenoidal guitar
player slaking your lust

442
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,667
at some barbaric
social function.

443
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,151
You don't like
to make love?

444
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:19,587
No, I do not. No.

445
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,087
That's crazy!

446
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:24,908
Boris, do you want to
be buried or cremated?

447
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:26,665
All right, I really don't
want to talk about that. Okay?

448
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:27,958
I think I want
to be cremated.

449
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,203
All right,
will you shut up, cretin?

450
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:30,552
There's no worms.

451
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:33,421
What is this?

452
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,476
A knish.

453
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,898
And what's it made of?

454
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,075
I've been eating these things
for years, they're delicious.

455
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,817
I don't know
what's in them.

456
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,212
I don't want to know what's in
them. Don't even talk about it!

457
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,281
Oh, my God!
The horror! The horror!

458
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,787
Boris!

459
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,956
Are you all right? What happened?
- No, I'm not all right.

460
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:52,226
Are you sick?
- No.

461
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,763
Did you have a bad dream?

462
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:55,532
Yeah, it was terrible.

463
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:57,825
Come here. It's okay.
- Oh, I can't...

464
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,675
Oh, baby, you're sweating.
Come sit down.

465
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:02,544
Night sweats.
I get them.

466
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,967
I used to think
it was AIDS,

467
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,572
but it's just that I have
a morbid fear of the dark

468
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,873
and you turned
my night-light off!

469
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:09,352
Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,719
Does your stomach hurt?
Could it be the kwish?

471
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,453
Knish! Not kwish.

472
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:17,912
Well, here,
I'll put something on TV.

473
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,429
I saw the abyss.

474
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,664
Don't worry,
we'll watch something else.

475
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,646
Oh, this is...
- Yeah.

476
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:34,291
Fred Astaire. Yeah.

477
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,512
Leave that.

478
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,666
That's good.
Leave that.

479
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:49,967
There,
that's it, okay?

480
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,093
Can we get
the hell out of here?

481
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:54,781
Oh, my God, that's it!
It's the actual one!

482
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,364
I've only seen it
in pictures!

483
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,157
"Bring me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses..."

484
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,366
I'm surprised you know
that, terrible as it is.

485
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,306
I closed with it for the Miss
Greenwood, Mississippi pageant.

486
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:08,184
I think it's so moving.

487
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,571
But the huddled masses were
never welcomed with open arms.

488
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,606
Soon as they came over,
each ethnic group

489
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,354
was met with
violence and hostility.

490
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,082
Each one had to claw
and fight its way in.

491
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,970
People always hated foreigners.
It's the American way.

492
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:23,617
Our pageants like to focus on
the positive things about America.

493
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,199
Yeah. The blacks were
kidnapped from Africa!

494
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,089
Chained in ships!

495
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,109
My daddy says that America bends
over backwards for the blacks

496
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,725
because we feel guilty,
and it's crazy.

497
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:34,292
Oh, yeah, your daddy.
Your daddy's a cracker.

498
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:36,919
He's a bigot moron.
Your daddy!

499
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,943
Well, you're probably right,
'cause you're a genius,

500
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:43,061
but for a little Mississippi girl
like me, this is really exciting!

501
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:47,132
So what kind of genius
are you, anyway?

502
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,284
What kind?

503
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,701
Yeah, what are
you genius at?

504
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,133
Quantum mechanics.

505
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,534
Yeah, but what field?
Like, music?

506
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,382
When you see
kids tossing a ball,

507
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,184
does it ever make you
miss spring training?

508
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,803
All right, I've never played for
the Yankees. Do you understand that?

509
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,546
I have never
played any sports

510
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,970
whatsoever in my life!
Okay? Ever!

511
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,997
Joe, Leo, you gotta help me
out. I can't take it anymore.

512
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,268
Just kick her out.

513
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:16,579
Can you believe it's
been a month already?

514
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:18,091
A whole month?
God, time flies.

515
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:19,195
Well put.

516
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:20,616
Well, at least
is she pretty?

517
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,856
She's won some
beauty contests.

518
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,104
No.

519
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,488
Tall? Short? Blonde?
Describe her.

520
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:29,725
Well, she's blonde.
Nice height. Nice eyes.

521
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:32,284
Didn't quite realize how blue
they were that first night.

522
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,042
Her face is a little
more symmetrical

523
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,793
than I had
originally conceived.

524
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:40,254
She's not a ten.
In a pinch, six.

525
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:41,343
Good in bed?

526
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:42,994
How would I know?
I just want her out.

527
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:46,877
<i>Can I ask you
to dance with me?</i>

528
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:48,031
<i>It's too crowded.</i>

529
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,950
<i>I don't mean now.
In a few minutes,</i>

530
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:52,439
<i>the dance will be over
and everyone will go home.</i>

531
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,236
<i>Well, the band
will go home, too.</i>

532
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:58,196
<i>Why, there'll just be the two of us left,
and we can imagine the music.</i>

533
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,566
<i>We can pretend there's a
big orchestra of violins</i>

534
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>and they're playing
just for us as we dance.</i>

535
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,192
You know, it's been proven
television eats away the brain.

536
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:10,291
Oh, hi! Shoot,
I was gonna surprise you!

537
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:11,861
What? What's all this?

538
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,527
I'm making you
a special dinner.

539
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:14,891
Really? For me?
- Yeah.

540
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,968
And me, 'cause
we're celebrating.

541
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,783
We are? What is it?

542
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,299
Crawfish!
I found some at the market.

543
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,801
Jesus. It's stinking up
the whole house!

544
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:24,571
No, they're so good.
You'll love them.

545
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:28,668
Listen, Melody, seriously,
we have to talk.

546
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:31,099
Oh, yeah. I know. We'll talk
over dinner. It's almost done.

547
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,530
Melody, you're a very nice
young woman. Really, very nice.

548
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,820
You have a lot of
nice attributes,

549
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,160
but, you know, you just can't
continue to stay here ad infinitum.

550
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:44,147
Yeah, yeah, but that's
my news. Guess what?

551
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,655
I got a job! I can
start paying you rent.

552
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,242
Rent? I don't want
you to pay me rent!

553
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:53,133
I want my life back.
What kind of job?

554
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:56,247
I start tomorrow
as a dog walker.

555
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:59,318
A dog walker? Oh,
my God. Seriously...

556
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:02,890
Melody, don't you think you should
go back home and finish high school,

557
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:04,908
maybe even go to college?

558
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:07,589
I thought the other night you
were talking about how America has

559
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:10,179
one of the worst education
systems in the Old West.

560
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,369
No, no,
the Western world.

561
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:12,884
Yeah, right, exactly,

562
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:16,357
and how most colleges just
turn out mindless zombie morons.

563
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,381
You could benefit
from classes.

564
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,350
I think
the crawfish are ready.

565
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,724
What is that song?

566
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:35,860
They played that song the first
time I went out with Jessica.

567
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,368
Where did you go?

568
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,438
We went to a dance.

569
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,354
We were both students
at the University of Chicago.

570
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:47,027
She had a high IQ
and a low-cut dress.

571
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:50,675
Boy, they really don't
write them like they used to.

572
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:52,989
Oh! That's a cliche.

573
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:55,257
Ah! Good, Melody.
You caught it.

574
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:58,362
Well, you always get
so mad when I do them.

575
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,434
Yeah, I shouldn't really.
Sometimes a cliche

576
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:03,940
is finally the best way
to make one's point.

577
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,929
Boris,

578
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:12,915
what would you say
if I was to say

579
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,948
that I was developing
a little crush on you?

580
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,023
I'd say don't.

581
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,297
Why?

582
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,939
Because anything deeper,
more significant between us,

583
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,755
is out of the question.

584
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:28,875
Because why?

585
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,828
Because it's
too preposterous

586
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:33,048
to even dignify
with an answer.

587
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:34,701
It is?

588
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,003
Every single thing
is against it.

589
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:41,252
Our ages, our backgrounds,
our brains, our interests.

590
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:43,251
Not to mention,
I have no desire

591
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,565
to have a relationship
with a woman, any woman,

592
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:49,105
nor any urge to make love,
nor any desire to be anything

593
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,592
but isolated
from the world.

594
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:54,654
And, you know,
you're a beautiful girl

595
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:59,095
who should be meeting normal
healthy men and going out.

596
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:02,446
Yeah, but I don't like
normal healthy men.

597
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,690
I like you.

598
00:25:05,665 --> 00:25:08,000
I...
You're hallucinating!

599
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,773
I'm sure you'll make
some man very happy

600
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,181
at a fish fry
or a dog fight

601
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,654
or however you
people spend time.

602
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,277
You really think
I'm beautiful?

603
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:23,604
I admit I didn't give you your
full due at first, physically.

604
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:26,326
However, as only
a great mind can do,

605
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,077
I've reassessed
my position,

606
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,923
and changed my mind.

607
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,796
So you could never
think of marrying me?

608
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:39,536
Have you lost your mind?

609
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:42,460
Why on Earth would you even
fantasize about such a thing?

610
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:46,173
What could I offer you, but
a bad temper, hypochondriasis,

611
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:50,921
morbid fixations, reclusive
rages and misanthropy?

612
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:52,356
And what could you
offer me?

613
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:56,693
A character out of
Faulkner, not unlike Benjy.

614
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,482
The answer to
your question is no.

615
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:04,500
I think you should stay here for
a while, accumulate some money,

616
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:07,993
and then find a place of your
own, and move on with your life.

617
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,078
Well, what about your life?

618
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:13,290
Let me teach you
something about love. Okay?

619
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,424
Naturally, there are exceptions
to what I'm going to say,

620
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,100
but they're the
exception, not the rule.

621
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:22,258
Love, despite
what they tell you,

622
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:26,253
does not conquer all. Nor
does it even usually last.

623
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,320
In the end, the romantic
aspirations of our youth

624
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:32,002
are reduced to

625
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:34,144
whatever works. Okay?

626
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:39,622
Why do I think your bark
is worse than your bite?

627
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:41,196
Cliche, Melody.

628
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:45,062
Oh, I don't care! If the shoe fits,
wear it, and that's another one.

629
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:59,196
We need to talk
for a minute.

630
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:02,950
Can you believe this little
inchworm setting her sights on me?

631
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,849
Yes, yes, we had
some pleasant moments.

632
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:09,697
Some dinners,
some walks in the park.

633
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:13,079
I gave her the benefit of my
vast knowledge and experience.

634
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:16,472
Tried to impart to her
the perceptions and values

635
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:19,330
of a truly
original mentality.

636
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:22,144
I only wish I could do
a Pygmalion on her.

637
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,892
But if Henry Higgins
ever tried to

638
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,685
transform Melody
Saint Anne Celestine,

639
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:29,472
he, too, would have
jumped out the window.

640
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,108
Come on.

641
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,994
Oh, boy! New friends.
- I'm sorry.

642
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,516
Oh, yeah.
They like each other.

643
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:53,853
It's okay.
I rather like dogs.

644
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,657
Well, I'm more of
a cat person, myself.

645
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:57,447
I just do this
professionally. Sorry.

646
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,873
I never met a
professional dog walker.

647
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:03,608
Really? It's not really the
career that I want, but...

648
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,354
What do you want to do?

649
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,778
I'd like to work
with children.

650
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,179
You're very pretty,
you know that?

651
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:11,543
Shut up! Thank you.

652
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,419
Can I ask your name?

653
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,710
It's Melody.
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.

654
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,242
What a beautiful name!
Mine's Perry Singleton.

655
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,828
It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

656
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:24,493
May I walk along
with you?

657
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,115
I don't see why not,
you know,

658
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:28,013
since we're all
doomed anyway.

659
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,268
Pardon me?

660
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,681
Well, you know,
everything ends.

661
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,359
I don't think I follow.

662
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:38,482
Well, you know, it's like
the cosmos, or eternity.

663
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:41,406
Whichever's bigger. I just know
that we're all flying apart.

664
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,395
What is that? What is
that? Is that a move?

665
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,614
Well, I thought
your bishop was...

666
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:49,128
My bishop what? What?
You patzer, you earthworm!

667
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,126
How many times do I have to tell
you? You don't take that pawn.

668
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,901
That's called the poisoned
pawn, because look!

669
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,924
Boris!
- Look what happens!

670
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,921
Sorry, Mr. Yellnikoff.
-Yeah, you're sorry, you're sorry.

671
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:59,691
Use your head next time,
you won't be sorry!

672
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:01,517
Boris!

673
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:03,542
Yeah. Do your homework next
week. Don't waste my time.

674
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,258
Hey!
- Poisoned!

675
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,853
I got off work early
today and I thought

676
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:08,386
maybe we could
walk home together.

677
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,556
Maybe I can make black-eyed
peas and crab cakes for dinner.

678
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:11,566
No, I'm not hungry.

679
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:12,622
What's the matter?

680
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:14,279
My ulcer's been
killing me all day.

681
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:15,843
I thought you
didn't have an ulcer.

682
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,347
No, I said they can't find an
ulcer, not that I don't have one.

683
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,344
Those malpractice
medical mental midgets.

684
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,726
They drop that endoscope
down my throat

685
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,067
and probe me
like coal miners,

686
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:25,478
and they always
come up with nothing!

687
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:27,346
Well, guess
what happened today?

688
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,168
I got to talking to
this boy on the job,

689
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:31,258
and he asked me
out on a date.

690
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,311
Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

691
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,611
I could tell he
liked me right off

692
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:40,219
and we went and had coffee and
just had, you know, funny banter.

693
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,036
You know what banter is,
it's like flirty talk.

694
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,258
Yeah, yeah,
I'm familiar with banter.

695
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah, so, anyway, he
asked if I had a boyfriend.

696
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,955
I said, "Not really." He said,
"I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00."

697
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,330
What do you think?

698
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,724
Great. I just hope he's
not a Ted Bundy, you know.

699
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:00,369
A who?

700
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,428
You have to keep an eye
out for serial killers.

701
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,911
He's not a serial killer. At
least he didn't mention it.

702
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,567
Yeah, well,
you have to be careful.

703
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,129
Sometimes they put you in the trunk
of a car and you can't breathe.

704
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,990
I'm not...
I'm serious.

705
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,080
I told him your theory
about capital punishment.

706
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,451
What did you say?

707
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,186
That it should include people that
don't pick up after their dogs,

708
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:22,732
people who ride their
bikes on the sidewalk,

709
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:25,633
people who call
mothers "moms" and...

710
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:28,514
I can't remember them all,
you have so many.

711
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:35,795
How do I look?
- Subnormal.

712
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,549
Why? What's wrong?

713
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,173
That's an awfully
aggressive ensemble.

714
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,773
You looking to wind up
in an abortion clinic?

715
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:44,198
I want
to look nice.

716
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:45,771
Just kind of
give him an idea

717
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:48,507
of what he might be in for
if he plays his cards right.

718
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,062
Oh, yeah?
What's he in for?

719
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,189
All the stuff with a
woman that you reject,

720
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:55,665
because you're a genius
and you're above it all.

721
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:57,596
But I happen to be
pretty sharp, too,

722
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,582
and I have a natural talent
in the field of fooling around.

723
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,727
Yeah, well, I just hope
you're saving your money

724
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:05,804
so you can move out quickly, you
know, now that you're working.

725
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,175
Hi, Perry!

726
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,482
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck on the train.

727
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,362
No, it's fine.
Come on in.

728
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,803
This is Perry.

729
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:15,816
Hi. Your daughter is very
lovely, Mr. Celestine.

730
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:18,219
I'm not her father.

731
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:20,842
Grandfather?

732
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,882
Perry, I told you I was
staying with a friend.

733
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:25,590
So what do you do, Perry?

734
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:29,452
He's studying. Investments
and investing things.

735
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,847
You got any

736
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,291
identification?

737
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,580
Pardon me?

738
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:40,161
You know, driver's
license, birth certificate.

739
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,448
No, sir. I never carry
around my birth certificate.

740
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,319
Why would I?

741
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:47,332
Be careful, Bundy
sometimes posed as a banker.

742
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:49,047
Oh!

743
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,176
I'm just gonna go finish getting
ready. I'll be right back.

744
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,965
Melody tells me you're
a very brilliant man.

745
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,883
If an IQ of 200
is brilliant.

746
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:07,603
She explained to me your theory
about life being meaningless.

747
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:09,742
Don't let it
spoil your evening.

748
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:11,415
Okay, let's go, Perry.

749
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,544
Okay.

750
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,330
Hey! Come here.

751
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,690
Don't give him any
information about me.

752
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,332
Like what?

753
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:20,400
You know, dates, credit card
numbers, blood type, things like that.

754
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,006
Goodbye, Boris.

755
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,837
Oh, and hey, if I'm not
here when you get back,

756
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:25,128
don't worry.

757
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,475
Oh? Where are you going?

758
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,611
Out.
- Okay, fine.

759
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,956
Yeah, I have friends, too.
- Okay. Yeah.

760
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,928
I even heard the opening's
supposed to be good.

761
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,392
Yeah, they are. Have
you seen them before?

762
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:45,760
No, no. This is my first
concert in New York.

763
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:47,353
You didn't tell me that.

764
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:50,547
Get the hell out of here.

765
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,018
In America, they have
summer camps for everything.

766
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:55,484
Rich kids, basketball
camp, magic camp.

767
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:58,181
Tennis camp.
- Tennis camp. Movie director camp!

768
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,553
They should have
a concentration camp.

769
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,129
Two weeks mandatory
for all kids growing up,

770
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:05,988
so they would
finally understand

771
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,076
what the human race
is capable of.

772
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:11,156
Brilliant! Except who'd send
their kid to a concentration camp?

773
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:15,098
A responsible parent who wants
their child to grasp reality.

774
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:17,134
All right, all right, all
right, let's change the subject.

775
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,213
Meanwhile,
Harry Lawson died.

776
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,726
Harry Lawson?
Yeah, I heard.

777
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:22,795
Yeah. Just celebrated his 51st birthday.
- Really?

778
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:24,177
What a great chemist.

779
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,685
But he was a smoker.

780
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:28,090
A smoker. The minute a person dies,

781
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:29,991
he's a smoker
or overweight.

782
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:33,279
Hey, I got news for you, thin
non-smokers die, too. Okay?

783
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,143
Abstinence isn't
going to save you.

784
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:36,329
You're pleasant tonight.

785
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,445
What are you talking about?

786
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,066
Where's Melody tonight?

787
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,802
She's out listening to some
eardrum-busting bilge posing as music.

788
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:44,348
I thought you were
going to kick her out.

789
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:47,748
Well, hopefully this guy tonight
will take her off my hands.

790
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,945
You know, why not?
I mean, she's pretty.

791
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,235
Now she's pretty?

792
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:58,730
What? I'm just saying she's not
atrocious-looking. That's all.

793
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:01,320
I'd say a seven or eight.

794
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,734
Anybody here?

795
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,028
Oh, you're up!

796
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,241
Yeah, I just got in.

797
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:20,008
And what did you do?

798
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:23,371
I went dancing at a Latin
club. It was limbo night.

799
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:25,032
Shut up!

800
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:27,661
You were talking about
people and politics

801
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:30,720
and all that stuff
you guys like to hate.

802
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:32,392
How was your date?

803
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:36,189
It was a big washout! Yeah.
- Really?

804
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,933
This particular rock
band wasn't any good?

805
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:39,290
I don't know how
you can differentiate?

806
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,300
No! No, the music was fine.

807
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:45,220
Just that guy and
his friends! I just...

808
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,324
What?

809
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:51,110
Well, his taste! He just...
He likes everything.

810
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,216
Life, love, human beings!

811
00:35:56,548 --> 00:36:00,317
And the couple that we double-dated
with, they were just protons!

812
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,273
Protons?

813
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,710
Do I mean protons?

814
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:06,189
Cretins!

815
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:07,682
Cretins, that's
what I mean.

816
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:10,586
Yeah, they didn't know the
first thing about string theory.

817
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,821
I think you're
a little drunk.

818
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:16,997
I did have a few drinks.

819
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,136
But can you blame me? Hanging
out with those inchworms?

820
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,133
I mean, they actually think that
love is the answer to everything.

821
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,542
I told them about Jethro
Paige from back home.

822
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:36,167
He got caught doing it with a
sheep. Making love with a sheep.

823
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,975
And they were all
laughing and everything,

824
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,989
but I just looked at them
and said, "Folks,

825
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:45,397
"as Boris would say,
whatever works."

826
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,701
What are you looking at?

827
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:52,063
Unbelievable.

828
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:58,327
The chance factor in life
is mind-boggling.

829
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:01,939
You entered the world

830
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,299
by a random event

831
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:07,561
somewhere along
the Mississippi.

832
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,619
I, having emerged
through the conjoining

833
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,031
of Sam and Yetta Yellnikoff
in the Bronx,

834
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,518
decades earlier.

835
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,768
And through an astronomical

836
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:23,382
concatenation
of circumstances,

837
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,379
our paths cross.

838
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,188
Two runaways

839
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:33,521
in the vast, black,

840
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,370
unspeakably violent

841
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,869
and indifferent universe.

842
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:56,483
Can you believe I married
her? What possessed me?

843
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:58,601
This search in life
for something

844
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,776
to give the illusion
of meaning.

845
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,151
To quell the panic.

846
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,087
All right,
so it's been a year.

847
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,966
Three hundred and sixty-five
days of married life.

848
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,480
And you know what? Not the
worst year of my life, either.

849
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:15,277
What are these?

850
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,480
They're grits.

851
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,663
Seriously?
- Mmm-hmm.

852
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:25,483
They're actually disgusting.

853
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:28,292
<i>She's cheerful,
not demanding.</i>

854
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,641
<i>Okay, not as brilliant
as Jessica,</i>

855
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,410
<i>but not as ambitious
and predatory, either.</i>

856
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:37,264
<i>Jessica's problem was she made up
in ego what she lacked in superego.</i>

857
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:38,769
<i>But not Melody.</i>

858
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:41,838
<i>She likes being a nanny. She's
happy with other people's kids,</i>

859
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,446
<i>so mercifully she doesn't
bother me about having our own.</i>

860
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,229
<i>Once a week we see a movie.</i>

861
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:49,819
<i>Maybe she doesn't understand
everything I take her to,</i>

862
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,812
<i>but she tries and
she's a good sport.</i>

863
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:54,662
<i>She sits up nights with me
when I have my panic attacks.</i>

864
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,445
<i>She keeps me company
at the emergency room</i>

865
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,370
<i>when I'm convinced my
mosquito bite is a melanoma.</i>

866
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,910
Yes, my life
is circumscribed,

867
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,308
but I manage
to avoid stress.

868
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,176
I've achieved
a delicate balance.

869
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:08,231
And as long as
I can maintain it,

870
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,245
I feel less inclined
to ending it.

871
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:31,138
<i># You heard what I said</i>

872
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,023
<i># No turning back now #</i>

873
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:34,747
Oh, no, no, no.

874
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:38,076
Unacceptable. Come on, this is not good.
- What?

875
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,439
I like music
I can dance to.

876
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:41,481
I know, I know,
but this is brutal.

877
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,230
Here, you know
what I want you to do?

878
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,992
Put this on. Okay? And then when
I come out, we'll discuss it.

879
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,770
All right, I'll try.

880
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,681
<i>It's Beethoven's Fifth!</i>

881
00:39:52,663 --> 00:39:56,265
Think of the music
as fate knocking on the door.

882
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:59,184
Maybe a little story
will help you appreciate it.

883
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,352
Fate knocking
on the door.

884
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:43,308
Mother?
- Melody!

885
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,892
Oh, it's you!

886
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:46,225
Oh, my God.

887
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,502
It's my baby!

888
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:51,098
I finally found you,
praise Jesus!

889
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,836
How did you find me?

890
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,162
Oh, my prayers
were finally answered!

891
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:58,502
I can't... You're just the
last person I expected to see.

892
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:00,329
Well, when you
least expect it,

893
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:01,850
fate has a way of
knocking on your door.

894
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,721
Yeah, it does. Okay.
Oh, you have a bag.

895
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:10,850
What are you doing here?

896
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,914
Well, I was trying
to find you, honey.

897
00:41:12,894 --> 00:41:14,428
Why?

898
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:15,830
I came to
find you, honey!

899
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:17,204
You did?

900
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:19,882
Oh, we searched
and searched.

901
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,038
The police looked
for clues.

902
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:22,054
Everything led
to a dead end.

903
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:23,379
Whoa!

904
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,058
How we worried. I developed
crow's feet from the worrying.

905
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,882
Now look here.
I had a little work done.

906
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,405
Mother,
I left you a letter.

907
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,075
I told you
I'd be all right.

908
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,740
Melody Saint Anne, I'd
hardly call this all right!

909
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,623
Well, what's
wrong with it?

910
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:40,044
What's wrong? What's
happened to your senses?

911
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:43,304
Everything's wrong. You're
living like a sharecropper.

912
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:44,766
But it's clean
as a whistle.

913
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,968
I clean it myself
every day.

914
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,519
You clean?
You don't have a woman?

915
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:50,949
Boris can't
really afford help.

916
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,480
Who?
- Boris.

917
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,590
Who's Boris?

918
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:56,986
My husband.

919
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:58,594
What?

920
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,928
That's right, Mama,
I got married.

921
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:02,464
And he's taken you
to live here?

922
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,567
No, no,
I moved in with him.

923
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:06,046
Oh...

924
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,951
I have to have a drink.

925
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:12,503
I need to sit.
I need an anesthetic.

926
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:16,019
Okay, okay, have a seat. We
don't have any bourbon or nothing.

927
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:19,874
Just bring me the drink with the
highest volume of alcohol you have.

928
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:24,070
You know, Mama,
I'm kind of happy.

929
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,614
Kind of happy?

930
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,763
You leave
a loving home in Eden,

931
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,073
run off with
some crazy kid,

932
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,418
I'm guessing
he's a rock musician

933
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:35,724
who can't earn a respectable
living, and you wind up

934
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:39,054
in this decadent city,
living in a rattrap.

935
00:42:38,981 --> 00:42:41,349
This is exactly
why I ran away.

936
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:42,917
Why, why, Miss Sweet Pea?

937
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,450
Why did you forsake
your loving home?

938
00:42:44,453 --> 00:42:47,288
Because, Mama, you're...

939
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:50,506
You're overbearing. That's
it. You're overbearing

940
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:54,007
and you fail to
see the big picture.

941
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:56,661
What big picture
are you talking about?

942
00:42:57,318 --> 00:42:59,118
I don't know.

943
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,812
All I know is that nothing moves
faster than the speed of light,

944
00:43:02,726 --> 00:43:05,695
so you may as well relax.

945
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:07,406
I'm just gonna have
a little moment of prayer.

946
00:43:08,743 --> 00:43:11,811
Mama, you're still caught up
in that Christian superstition?

947
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,441
# Happy birthday to you

948
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:15,907
What's that?

949
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:17,746
That's Boris.

950
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:19,236
It's his birthday?

951
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,873
No, he's just
washing his hands.

952
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,572
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

953
00:43:22,568 --> 00:43:24,101
# Happy birthday to you #

954
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,848
Who's this?

955
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:35,142
Boris,
this is my mother.

956
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:38,144
Mother, my husband.

957
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,635
Mama! Mama!

958
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:45,895
Walk her around, she's
obviously a boozehound.

959
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:47,400
Mama, are you all right?

960
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,002
Did he drug you?
- What?

961
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,370
Are you on sodium pentothal?
- No.

962
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:54,407
That's what they do,
the secular humanists.

963
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:57,648
It's uncanny. She's exactly
the kind of moron you described.

964
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:00,181
You are not the
gentleman I was expecting.

965
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,673
I'm sure not.
I'm sure you'd be happy

966
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:03,676
if she married the guy who
caught the biggest catfish

967
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:04,992
in Plaquemines County.

968
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:07,271
I'd be happier if
she married the catfish.

969
00:44:07,243 --> 00:44:10,245
No, you see, Mama,
Boris is a genius. Okay?

970
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:12,389
He doesn't have a lot of
patience for us inchworms.

971
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,897
We, we inchworms.
- We.

972
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,966
Some genius.

973
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,423
I was almost nominated
for a Nobel Prize.

974
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,656
That's right, Boris. And what
was it for again? Best Picture?

975
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:21,956
I need more booze.

976
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:23,498
You know, you never
said how you found me.

977
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:27,871
Oh, Melody. I have a
sad tale to tell you.

978
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:29,524
What happened, Mama?

979
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:32,566
Your father left me.

980
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:33,625
Oh.

981
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:34,712
Aren't you shocked?

982
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:35,833
No.

983
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:37,554
And with who,
of all people?

984
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,651
My best friend, Mandy.
- Your best friend, Mandy.

985
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:41,464
How did you know?
- Oh, Mama.

986
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:45,190
It was as plain as the nose
on your face. Cliche, sorry.

987
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:46,903
At first I thought he
was acting peculiar,

988
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,197
because things was going
so bad for us, darling.

989
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:51,427
How often did you
have intercourse?

990
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,941
Are you going to close
that insulting mouth?

991
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:57,757
By bad, I mean he
lost a lot of money

992
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:58,877
in the stock market
after you left

993
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,396
and we were forced
to sell the house.

994
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,701
You sold the house?
- I'm sorry, yes. We took a beating,

995
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:04,373
because we were
so desperate.

996
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,869
And then he lost his job, the
company went out of business.

997
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:09,201
And then we spent all our
savings on medical bills,

998
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,737
'cause I came down with
a case of the shingles!

999
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:12,730
Oh, my God.

1000
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,486
Christ, this is like Job.
No locusts?

1001
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,383
Darling, I turned to
Jesus in a deeper way

1002
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,096
than I had ever
done in my life.

1003
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:23,058
I prayed and I prayed,
every day and every night,

1004
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:25,029
asking God to help me.

1005
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:27,445
Let me guess what happened,
your shingles got worse.

1006
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,279
I said, "Lord,
just give me one sign

1007
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:32,227
"that all my suffering
is for a purpose."

1008
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,912
I said, "Please, God,
just say something."

1009
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:37,635
"Break your silence. I
can't take any more misery!"

1010
00:45:37,587 --> 00:45:41,322
Nothing, right? And all that money
you put in the tin box every Sunday.

1011
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,562
Abortion is murder, that's
the long and short of it.

1012
00:46:00,532 --> 00:46:02,133
That's how I feel. Well...
- Even if the woman is raped?

1013
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:03,232
Why are you wasting
your breath, Brockman?

1014
00:46:03,252 --> 00:46:04,587
You're dealing
with an aborigine.

1015
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,597
You don't mind
killing the unborn,

1016
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:08,782
but when some fiend
has raped and murdered,

1017
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:10,658
you're against giving him
that big old injection?

1018
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,280
Well, not me,
Mr. Genius,

1019
00:46:12,277 --> 00:46:14,245
and I don't care how many
Academy Awards you've won.

1020
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,763
I've never won
an Academy Award

1021
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:18,167
and I've never played
for the Yankees!

1022
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:22,337
Where's the little girl's? Thank you.
- It's back there.

1023
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,800
<i>Don't forget to sing The
Star-Spangled Banner before you sit.</i>

1024
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:37,257
Oh.

1025
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:39,802
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1026
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:41,500
I realize
this is forward,

1027
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,998
but who's that beautiful
young girl you're with?

1028
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,162
May I ask why
you want to know?

1029
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,704
Well, because
she's very beautiful.

1030
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,805
And I'm assuming
she's your daughter?

1031
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:56,598
What did you say
your name was, darling?

1032
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:59,604
Randy. Randy Lee James.
- Randy Lee James.

1033
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:01,246
Nice to meet you.

1034
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,375
It's too good. I think they're
putting mayonnaise in here.

1035
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:03,827
No, they can't put
mayonnaise in hummus.

1036
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,201
Hello.
Oh, thank you.

1037
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,237
Who were you
talking to?

1038
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,292
I wasn't talking
to anybody. Nobody.

1039
00:47:09,273 --> 00:47:11,708
Listen, listen, I want
to go someplace fun.

1040
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:14,109
Take me someplace fun!
It's New York! Let's go.

1041
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,975
Boris, where can I
take her that's fun?

1042
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:17,128
How about
the Holocaust Museum?

1043
00:47:17,146 --> 00:47:18,614
Oh, for God's sake, Boris.
- No.

1044
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,619
Oh, the wax! The wax figures.
- Oh, yes.

1045
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:23,305
Yes, yes, let's go. Come on.
- Let's do that.

1046
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:25,326
It was so nice to meet you, Leo.
- You, too. Have a nice day.

1047
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:26,774
Bye. Bye, bye.

1048
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:29,714
Bye. Have fun!

1049
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:33,296
You know, I have to say, even with
a textbook right-wing mentality,

1050
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:36,047
your mother-in-law has
beautifully shaped breasts.

1051
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:38,497
You know,
you're a man of learning,

1052
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:41,595
of cultivation of
aesthetic sensibility.

1053
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:44,100
This is what you take away
from the school-prayer hokum

1054
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,329
and "my country right
or wrong"? Her bosom?

1055
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:51,938
It's not just her bosom. Her behind
is also beautifully contoured.

1056
00:47:51,773 --> 00:47:53,807
Well, I'm sure you'll have no
problem getting her into bed.

1057
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,591
She's vulnerable, she's stupid
and she's been abandoned.

1058
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,176
Personally, I lose
all erotic inclination

1059
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:00,742
when the woman's a member of
the National Rifle Association.

1060
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:02,569
It's pear-shaped.

1061
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:03,958
Degas used to
distinguish between

1062
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:06,668
an apple-shaped behind
and pear-shaped.

1063
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:09,023
And I'm a big fruit eater.

1064
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,125
Melody.
- That's so weird.

1065
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,290
Oh, my God.
Oh, hello.

1066
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:15,871
They're made out
of real wax, too.

1067
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,172
Oh, it's Billy.
Billy...

1068
00:48:17,183 --> 00:48:19,118
Billy Graham!

1069
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:21,038
Oh, sweet pea,
sweet pea,

1070
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,558
this is the kind of man
you should be married to,

1071
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,420
<i>not that Communist
who sings Happy Birthday</i>

1072
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:27,508
every time he
washes his hands.

1073
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,355
How long are
you staying, Mom?

1074
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:31,879
Honey, I don't know
where else to go.

1075
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,574
I have nothing
to hold onto.

1076
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:35,769
Nothing! I have to
have something.

1077
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:39,848
I mean, I'm never going to attract
a man again, but you can. Yes.

1078
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:41,245
I don't want to
get in an argument.

1079
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,285
Honey, I met a young man today
who is perfect for you.

1080
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,692
Mom!
- Yes. Listen to me.

1081
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:47,932
He is talented,
handsome, sweet,

1082
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:51,407
and he has the proper reverence
for life and its higher purpose.

1083
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,864
What are you
talking about?

1084
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,967
Face it, Melody, Boris is
not like a real husband.

1085
00:48:54,946 --> 00:48:57,948
He's more of an outpatient
and you're his keeper.

1086
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,125
I really wish you
hadn't showed up, Mom.

1087
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:03,066
His name is
Randy Lee James.

1088
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:04,111
Who?

1089
00:49:04,131 --> 00:49:05,465
This delightful young actor.

1090
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:06,909
He fell in love with you
at first sight.

1091
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:09,116
He did. He did.
- Mom, I'm married!

1092
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:12,627
I refuse to recognize it. What are
you doing with a gimpy chess bum

1093
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:14,148
who has to sleep
with the light on?

1094
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:16,382
How'd he get that limp?

1095
00:49:16,355 --> 00:49:18,723
He jumped out the window
and his suicide didn't work.

1096
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,293
Well, you can't win
them all. Now, listen,

1097
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,854
I have a good lawyer who
can get all of this annulled.

1098
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:26,848
All of it. Yes. Yes.
- No, no, Mom, no, you're crazy!

1099
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:28,723
Oh, hello.

1100
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:31,477
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

1101
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:33,430
# Happy birthday to you

1102
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:36,091
# Happy birthday to you

1103
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:38,170
# Happy birthday to you

1104
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:41,518
# Happy birthday, dear Boris

1105
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:45,181
# Happy birthday to you #

1106
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,217
Who could be calling
at midnight?

1107
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:51,623
Could be burglars,
casing the place.

1108
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:54,093
To steal what?
Your Flomax?

1109
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:56,088
Hello?

1110
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:57,913
Oh, hi.

1111
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,797
Yeah, just a second.

1112
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:03,143
It's for me?
- Yes.

1113
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:05,379
Don't give away
any information about me!

1114
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:07,019
Hello?
Oh, hello, Leo.

1115
00:50:07,015 --> 00:50:08,115
It's Leo Brockman.

1116
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:09,169
Brockman?

1117
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:10,392
Really?

1118
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,760
Well, that sounds wonderful.

1119
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:19,535
Well, yeah,
Sunday's fine. Yeah.

1120
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,268
3:00? Well, 3:00's perfect.

1121
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:26,208
Okay. Yeah.
See you, darling.

1122
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:31,024
"See you, darling"? "See you,
darling"? Oh, God, poor Brockman!

1123
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:32,390
Good night, y'all.

1124
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:33,960
I'm going to say
my prayers.

1125
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:36,129
I'm praying
Brockman has herpes.

1126
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,984
That was
so wonderful!

1127
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:41,754
I never in my life saw a
movie in Japanese before.

1128
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,340
Did you like it?
- Oh, yes!

1129
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:45,974
I've never seen a movie
made by a foreigner.

1130
00:50:45,931 --> 00:50:48,866
John, my husband, took
me to see stupid movies,

1131
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:50,845
which was
all there was.

1132
00:50:50,827 --> 00:50:52,928
How do you say this?
"Chateau" what?

1133
00:50:52,908 --> 00:50:54,141
Meyney.

1134
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:55,590
The what?
- Meyney.

1135
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,262
Meyney?
- Yeah.

1136
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,556
It is so delicious.

1137
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:00,930
I'm glad you like it.

1138
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:05,811
What do you do?
What do you do, Leo?

1139
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:09,241
I teach philosophy at the
university around the corner.

1140
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:12,868
Tell me something.
Is Boris really a genius?

1141
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:15,483
There was a time when he
was a very fine physicist.

1142
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:17,137
Yeah, your daughter's
very good for Boris.

1143
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:19,535
It's my theory that
she keeps him going.

1144
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:22,603
Would you like to see some
pretty pictures of Melody?

1145
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:23,842
Ooh. Goodness.

1146
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:27,691
Well, all right.

1147
00:51:27,694 --> 00:51:29,395
Okay.

1148
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:32,993
Look, here they are.
Look at these.

1149
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:35,880
Right there, that's where
she is Miss Natchez.

1150
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:39,693
Wow.
- Look at her. And she was Miss Tupelo.

1151
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,300
Oh, God!
Look how gorgeous she is!

1152
00:51:41,295 --> 00:51:43,596
She's so beautiful.
I love her! I love her!

1153
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,301
Very lovely.
- I was so proud of her.

1154
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:46,829
These pictures are
kind of interesting.

1155
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,499
I know!
She's just gorgeous!

1156
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,830
And she has this... She's
just my little sweet pea.

1157
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:53,035
I mean the photos.
Did you take them?

1158
00:51:53,968 --> 00:51:55,702
Yes. Yes.

1159
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,830
And this?

1160
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,120
That's our house.

1161
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,655
Well, it was.
Is there more wine?

1162
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,317
Yeah. You took all these?

1163
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:05,948
Yes, with my
little old Kodak.

1164
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:06,938
Uh-huh.

1165
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,228
These are outstanding.

1166
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:10,943
I mean, there's such a sense
of texture and composition.

1167
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:12,665
In these? No.

1168
00:52:12,657 --> 00:52:14,458
No, I mean it. I know
what I'm talking about.

1169
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,585
I occasionally write about
the aesthetics of photography.

1170
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,856
Oh, my God. I have to
tell you something.

1171
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:20,993
Aside from
Melody's career,

1172
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,211
there is nothing,
nothing in the whole world

1173
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:25,822
that gave me more pleasure
than taking those snapshots.

1174
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,179
Of course, John...
Cheers.

1175
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,989
John hated them and
didn't want me to do it.

1176
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,340
Why?
- Well,

1177
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,909
he actually was fine, and
then I set up this darkroom

1178
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:38,770
and he thought I was, like,
squandering all this time on silliness

1179
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:40,343
and I guess he
had a point, but...

1180
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,607
I mean, nowadays,
who uses a Kodak anymore?

1181
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,516
It's a little Kodak, and I have
to tell you something, it is...

1182
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,722
It is so simple to use.
It's tiny!

1183
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:50,459
I picked it up at,
like, a garage sale

1184
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:54,121
and it just is so much better
than those big foreign ones.

1185
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,272
No, they're pretty good.
They've got a real

1186
00:52:56,244 --> 00:52:58,446
haunting quality.
They're very primitive.

1187
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:01,490
I really think you should talk
to my friend Al Morgenstern.

1188
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:02,829
He runs
a photography gallery.

1189
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:04,038
Why?

1190
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:05,721
Have you got more of these?

1191
00:53:06,262 --> 00:53:07,495
Oh, Lord, yes.

1192
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:09,510
You know, all my travels
with the pageants.

1193
00:53:09,494 --> 00:53:12,396
I have the kids
and the towns

1194
00:53:12,342 --> 00:53:14,276
and the winners.
And the losers!

1195
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:17,364
The losers are the best. And
then I have all these show folk,

1196
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:19,237
the twirlers,
the magicians,

1197
00:53:19,223 --> 00:53:20,824
the fire eaters, you know,
things like that.

1198
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,024
They're amazing. They've
got such an original quality.

1199
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,733
I'll talk to Al
first thing in the morning.

1200
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:27,596
Oh, no. You know, I think
you're making too much

1201
00:53:27,543 --> 00:53:30,078
over a little gift the
good Lord Jesus gave me.

1202
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,441
That's not the only gift
He gave you.

1203
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,143
You know those clean-cut,
churchgoing young men,

1204
00:53:39,064 --> 00:53:40,598
who are model kids,

1205
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,070
and good to their neighbors
and quote the Bible,

1206
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:47,561
and never do a wrong thing,
and then one day,

1207
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,115
for whatever reason,

1208
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:51,181
they grab a rifle,
go to a tower

1209
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,429
and pick off
everyone in town?

1210
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:56,670
Okay, this is her,
but sexually.

1211
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:58,503
She slept with Leo Brockman,

1212
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,124
never having been to bed with
anyone before but her husband,

1213
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:04,218
and suddenly, the genie
was out of the bottle!

1214
00:54:04,155 --> 00:54:05,888
She liked sleeping
with Brockman,

1215
00:54:05,883 --> 00:54:07,884
and she liked sleeping
with Brockman's friends,

1216
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:12,236
Brockman's acquaintances, Brockman's
acquaintances' acquaintances.

1217
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,324
<i>Brockman took
her photos to Morgenstern.</i>

1218
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,766
<i>He loved them.</i>

1219
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:17,638
<i>He decided to show them
in his gallery.</i>

1220
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:19,762
<i>When he did, everyone
thought they were great.</i>

1221
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:21,173
<i>A brilliant primitive.</i>

1222
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:24,215
<i>Soon Morgenstern would
become smitten with her.</i>

1223
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:25,956
<i>First she moved in
with Brockman.</i>

1224
00:54:25,948 --> 00:54:27,982
<i>Then she moved in
with Morgenstern.</i>

1225
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,732
<i>Then she moved in with
Brockman and Morgenstern.</i>

1226
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,053
<i>She started dabbling
with collages.</i>

1227
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,223
<i>Small ones at first,
but they would become bolder.</i>

1228
00:54:37,213 --> 00:54:38,981
<i>She started
dressing differently.</i>

1229
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:40,573
<i>Soon all her
deep-rooted beliefs</i>

1230
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:43,842
<i>went right down the toilet,
where they belonged.</i>

1231
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:49,412
<i>She experimented with exotic
pleasures. A new Marietta was born.</i>

1232
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:53,416
<i>The one thing that remained
constant, she hated her son-in-law.</i>

1233
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,610
Well, there's some
pictures over there.

1234
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:56,923
Yes, maybe that.
Okay.

1235
00:54:58,334 --> 00:54:59,501
What do you think, Mom?

1236
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:01,486
I'm not sure, you know,
it's for this collage,

1237
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:06,876
and I've had this vision in black
and white of nude men, women,

1238
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,554
body parts, squares.

1239
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,847
That sounds confusing.

1240
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,916
Well, it's an homage
to lust. Yeah. To lust.

1241
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:25,893
Excuse me.

1242
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,823
Hi, I need
a female opinion.

1243
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:31,679
Which of these two would a young
woman prefer? I can't decide.

1244
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:35,695
I don't know.
They're both so beautiful.

1245
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,918
It depends.
What type is she?

1246
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,985
Well, she's quite young
and very lovely-looking.

1247
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,523
Blonde hair.
Blue eyes.

1248
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:46,250
Yeah, but what's she like?

1249
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,643
Well, okay.
She's from the South,

1250
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,912
although she lives
here in New York now.

1251
00:55:50,883 --> 00:55:53,283
Really?
- Yeah.

1252
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,051
And she's a nanny. I mean,
well, to tell you the truth,

1253
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:57,010
she's actually
living with some man.

1254
00:55:56,995 --> 00:56:00,030
I mean, they're married, although
he's not the best she can do.

1255
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:01,805
And she thinks she loves
him, but it's only because

1256
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:04,564
she mistakes his pessimistic
despair for wisdom,

1257
00:56:04,515 --> 00:56:06,183
believing he's a genius.

1258
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:11,437
I'd say she's more of a
nurse to him than a wife,

1259
00:56:11,396 --> 00:56:13,931
because he's
much older than she is.

1260
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,727
That sounds so familiar.

1261
00:56:18,693 --> 00:56:21,995
I just can't...
I can't put my finger on it.

1262
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,661
It's sort of like mine, actually. Yeah.
- It is?

1263
00:56:25,574 --> 00:56:29,577
I mean, not exactly, but I can't
help but seeing some similarities.

1264
00:56:30,278 --> 00:56:31,879
I'd say that one.

1265
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:32,945
Okay.

1266
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,783
Here.

1267
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:48,711
Here what? For me?
- It's for you.

1268
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:51,883
Yes, I thought I'd buy
you something lovely.

1269
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:55,085
Oh, no, I can't accept
a gift from a stranger.

1270
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,083
Well, why not?

1271
00:56:56,104 --> 00:56:57,304
I'm married.

1272
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:00,088
Yes, but it may
not last forever.

1273
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,074
Well, you know,
nothing lasts forever.

1274
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:06,660
Not even Shakespeare
or Michelangelo

1275
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:09,472
or Greek people.

1276
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:11,585
I mean, even as we're standing
here talking right now,

1277
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:15,330
we're just flying apart
at an unimaginable speed.

1278
00:57:15,241 --> 00:57:17,342
Gee, I never
thought of it that way.

1279
00:57:17,322 --> 00:57:19,556
Yeah.

1280
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:23,834
Should we be holding each
other so we don't fall?

1281
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:26,524
Well, you have to hold
onto whatever love you can

1282
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:28,242
in this cruel existence.

1283
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:30,269
Speaking of love,

1284
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,986
I've been in love with you ever
since that first moment I saw you,

1285
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:36,174
and met your mother at the
Mogador Cafe many months ago.

1286
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:41,047
Oh, you're... You're...

1287
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,470
Did my mother...
- Randy James.

1288
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:47,672
Oh, the actor! Of course.
I can hear your accent now.

1289
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,398
Oh, my mother talks
about you all the time,

1290
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:51,022
and she's always telling me
I have to meet you

1291
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,754
and I'm saying, "Why?
Why do I have to meet him?"

1292
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,116
"But he's so good-looking!"
And, yeah, you are.

1293
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:57,252
Thank you. I've moved to
New York permanently now

1294
00:57:57,229 --> 00:57:59,564
and I live in a houseboat
with a friend of mine.

1295
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:02,268
You live on a boat?
- Yes, I do.

1296
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:04,923
I'm very romantic by nature,
so I live on a boat

1297
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:07,913
and I read and think
and play my flute...

1298
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:10,155
Mom?
- Oh, be still, Melody.

1299
00:58:10,126 --> 00:58:12,094
There's nothing wrong with
expanding your horizons.

1300
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:14,713
I certainly expanded mine.

1301
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,471
You know what?
I'm really sorry, but...

1302
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,824
I think that my mother badly
gave you the wrong impression,

1303
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,358
because I'm
happily married.

1304
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,426
No, no, no, no, no,
no, she's not, Randy.

1305
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:26,876
She's nursemaid
to a roach. He is.

1306
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,367
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, Mr. James.

1307
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:34,025
I told you you'd
get the hang of it.

1308
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:36,299
Okay, you know what? Let's
just stop. Let's stop.

1309
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:38,673
Let's stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, stop, stop.
- Stop?

1310
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,776
Yeah. I need to sit for a minute.
- All right.

1311
00:58:42,673 --> 00:58:44,306
You know, I'm just doing
it for the aerobics, anyway.

1312
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:45,772
Otherwise, it's moronic.

1313
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,244
I think it's relaxing.

1314
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:50,850
Relaxing? What? Are you
kidding? It's too nerve-wracking.

1315
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:53,437
To mingle with all those
sub-mentals on bicycles?

1316
00:58:53,394 --> 00:58:55,161
It's like driving a car.

1317
00:58:55,154 --> 00:58:58,723
Those hostile, belligerent
morons all get driver's licenses.

1318
00:58:58,641 --> 00:59:01,077
Of course, to have children,
you don't need a license.

1319
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,843
No proof of anything.

1320
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,234
You need a license to fish.

1321
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,843
You need a license
to be a barber.

1322
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,710
You need a license
to sell hot dogs.

1323
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:10,367
You know, you read about these
poor kids, beaten and starved,

1324
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:12,457
you wonder, why are these
parents allowed to even have them?

1325
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:14,869
Okay, Boris, Boris.

1326
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,569
You know, sometimes I
think you're so determined

1327
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:20,299
not to enjoy anything in
life, just out of spite.

1328
00:59:20,211 --> 00:59:22,179
You know, like a child
who's throwing a tantrum,

1329
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:24,031
because he can't
have his own way.

1330
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,554
Wow! Listen to you!

1331
00:59:26,516 --> 00:59:28,417
That's a reasonably
wise insight

1332
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:31,205
for a simple-minded
type like yourself.

1333
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:35,660
Honestly. Yeah, you surprise and
delight me sometimes, you know that?

1334
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:41,046
I really don't know what I'd
do without you, seriously.

1335
00:59:40,949 --> 00:59:43,183
What are you doing
with that?

1336
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:47,760
This? Nothing. I just
got it at the flea market.

1337
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:49,772
Who needs
an antique handkerchief?

1338
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,316
I thought it was pretty.

1339
00:59:51,317 --> 00:59:55,120
Yeah, but God knows throughout
history who blew his nose in it.

1340
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:58,841
Marietta? Honey?
- Yes, darling?

1341
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:01,674
I think you should include these
photos at your opening next week.

1342
01:00:01,622 --> 01:00:03,022
I love those photos.
Al, what do you think?

1343
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,364
I chose those.

1344
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,842
Oh, you did?
- Absolutely.

1345
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:06,880
Sweetheart, you've managed to make...
- Thank you.

1346
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,570
...an existential
statement about

1347
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:10,802
sexual perversity and human freedom.
- Who? Yes.

1348
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:12,609
It's so full of erotic
imagination. Okay, hold on a sec.

1349
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:13,699
Oh, thank you so much!
Thank you!

1350
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,853
Marietta?

1351
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:19,074
Who is it?
- Somebody named Randy Jones?

1352
01:00:18,968 --> 01:00:20,736
Oh, Randy, Randy James.

1353
01:00:20,728 --> 01:00:23,196
Hello? Hello? Hey!

1354
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,795
Young man, hello, hello!

1355
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,854
Listen, she's going to be
at Uniqlo at around 3:00.

1356
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,694
You can run into her
and try your luck.

1357
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:33,608
You know, she saved
the handkerchief you gave her,

1358
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:35,493
so it's not
a hopeless cause.

1359
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:39,284
And I'm telling you, I saw
fire behind her eyes. Fire.

1360
01:00:39,193 --> 01:00:41,495
Yeah. Good luck, darling.

1361
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:44,401
Who was that?
- Oh, nothing. Come on, gumbo! Let's go.

1362
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:45,546
Who'd have ever
thought that gumbo

1363
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:46,662
would become my
favorite dinner?

1364
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:48,916
All this and
she cooks, too.

1365
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:56,980
Oh, my God! Hello.

1366
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,127
So I guess you just happened
to be shopping here. Right?

1367
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:02,918
Well, I was buying this
shirt, if you must know.

1368
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:03,941
Uh-huh.

1369
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,430
You like it?

1370
01:01:05,436 --> 01:01:07,670
It's okay.
- Just okay?

1371
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:09,545
I thought it'd
make me look dashing.

1372
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,467
Looks aren't your problem.

1373
01:01:11,452 --> 01:01:12,752
Oh, no? What is?

1374
01:01:12,764 --> 01:01:13,931
You're too forward.

1375
01:01:13,948 --> 01:01:15,382
I think about you a lot.

1376
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:17,890
Well, I don't
think about you.

1377
01:01:17,852 --> 01:01:21,822
So what's it like
being married to a genius?

1378
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:23,492
Who wants to know?

1379
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,754
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be a boor, I just...

1380
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:28,786
Just that,
well, you know.

1381
01:01:28,766 --> 01:01:31,367
It has its
pluses and minuses.

1382
01:01:31,326 --> 01:01:34,795
Yes?
And what are the drawbacks?

1383
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:36,619
I don't know.
I mean...

1384
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:38,973
Well, naturally,
with a very advanced mind,

1385
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:42,278
you find a lot of things
wrong with everything

1386
01:01:42,207 --> 01:01:43,874
and, mainly, he just
doesn't like people.

1387
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,205
You know, he says at
the rate they're going,

1388
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:46,848
they're going to make
themselves extinct.

1389
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:48,614
Right.

1390
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:52,309
It can just be exhausting being
around a genius all the time.

1391
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:55,893
So what are the pluses of being
the wife of such a dazzling mind?

1392
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,139
Well, he's smart.

1393
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,544
You said that.

1394
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:00,718
He's clever.

1395
01:02:00,736 --> 01:02:02,637
Uh-huh.

1396
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:07,794
He really means well, you know?
He's just a little crazy.

1397
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:11,551
I guess the good part is
that I'm the wife of a genius,

1398
01:02:11,456 --> 01:02:13,758
which I never really
thought I could swing.

1399
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:14,896
Why not?

1400
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,439
I guess I thought
I'd have to be smarter.

1401
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:23,857
You want to see my boat? I mean,
my friend's boat, where I live?

1402
01:02:23,778 --> 01:02:25,879
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1403
01:02:25,857 --> 01:02:28,426
I dreamt about you
last night. I...

1404
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:30,020
Don't use that line.
Because Boris said

1405
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:31,585
that he dreamt
about me last night.

1406
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:33,554
And I really doubt it's
mathematically possible

1407
01:02:33,538 --> 01:02:36,241
for me to be in
two dreams at one time.

1408
01:02:41,444 --> 01:02:44,178
It's down there,
on the right-hand side.

1409
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:48,447
Well, this is it.

1410
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:52,255
It's not much, but it's home
and I don't pay rent, so...

1411
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:54,966
This is kind of sweet,
living on the water.

1412
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,416
It rocks
just the tiniest bit,

1413
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,956
so I sleep
like a baby on it.

1414
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,979
Randy, I don't know what
I'm doing here! I'm married!

1415
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,984
That doesn't mean I can't
have feelings for you.

1416
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:06,499
You don't
really know me.

1417
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:10,037
Yes, but I'm a romantic and I
believe in love at first sight.

1418
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:13,059
Well, that's true. You know,
Boris says that love isn't logical.

1419
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,832
And I adore
the way you talk

1420
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:16,989
and the funny things
you say.

1421
01:03:18,246 --> 01:03:20,381
Where can it lead?

1422
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:22,559
Let's drink to
love at first sight.

1423
01:03:22,534 --> 01:03:26,104
I can't. When I drink, I get
very silly and touchy and...

1424
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:27,756
That's what
your mum said.

1425
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:29,585
That's why I bought the
bottle. She's quite a mum.

1426
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:31,910
Don't use that locution.
It's for inchworms.

1427
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:33,046
Sorry.

1428
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:37,439
Is that you
in the picture?

1429
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:40,284
<i>Yeah. That's me in
Juno and the Paycock.</i>

1430
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:42,566
I bet you're
a really good actor.

1431
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:45,272
I try. Although
I'll never be a genius.

1432
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:49,305
You certainly are handsome
enough to be a star.

1433
01:03:49,256 --> 01:03:52,092
Thank you. I'll cherish
that compliment.

1434
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:00,283
Oh, my God.
- What are you thinking?

1435
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:03,302
Entropy.
- Entropy?

1436
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:05,510
Yeah, entropy.
Boris explained it.

1437
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:08,917
It's why you can't get the
toothpaste back in the tube.

1438
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:11,443
You mean,

1439
01:04:11,402 --> 01:04:16,173
once something happens, it's difficult
to put it back the way it was?

1440
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:19,011
I mean, Boris says
love is all about luck.

1441
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:21,590
I think so, too, but
isn't that just because

1442
01:04:21,547 --> 01:04:23,415
we're young and we think
we're going to live forever

1443
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:25,904
and then we grow old
and get diabetes, and...

1444
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:27,401
Maybe.

1445
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:29,138
Look, I do agree
there's not much

1446
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,833
you can be sure of
in this world, but...

1447
01:04:31,787 --> 01:04:35,324
Have you ever heard of
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle?

1448
01:04:35,244 --> 01:04:36,945
I've heard of it, yeah.

1449
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,308
You know, the observer
influences the experiment?

1450
01:04:40,236 --> 01:04:41,370
Uh-huh.

1451
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:43,189
It's just like

1452
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,582
when my mother makes love to
one of the guys she's living with

1453
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,684
a certain way
when they're alone,

1454
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:52,097
but when she's in front of the
other guy, she does it differently.

1455
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:54,449
Is that Heisenberg?

1456
01:04:54,414 --> 01:04:56,581
I had no idea
he was so sexual.

1457
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:06,326
Wait. I always carry
some Viagra with me.

1458
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:08,857
That's all right.
I eat a lot of red meat.

1459
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:29,083
I really like the way
these pants fit.

1460
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:36,361
Hey, are you okay? You
seem awfully quiet lately.

1461
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:38,979
Yeah.

1462
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:41,463
We're going to be late
for Mom's gallery opening.

1463
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:43,060
I hope you're not
coming down with anything.

1464
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:45,959
You know, Brodsky's
kid's got the measles.

1465
01:05:45,906 --> 01:05:47,373
Can you still
get the measles?

1466
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,679
I had a shot
when I was younger,

1467
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,684
but how long
does it last?

1468
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,950
Who's that?

1469
01:05:55,954 --> 01:05:58,656
I don't know.
I'm not expecting anyone.

1470
01:06:01,842 --> 01:06:03,410
Melody!
- Daddy!

1471
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:05,712
Oh, my little girl,
I found you!

1472
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:07,851
Oh, Lord, your mother and
I searched and searched,

1473
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:09,328
but then we
ran out of leads.

1474
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:11,332
I used every connection
I had at the police force.

1475
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:13,517
We even called the FBI!
But you're okay.

1476
01:06:13,492 --> 01:06:15,994
Things are going to be fine
now. Your ordeal is over.

1477
01:06:15,956 --> 01:06:17,724
What ordeal?

1478
01:06:17,716 --> 01:06:19,617
You were abducted! Tell
me if my theory is correct.

1479
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:21,938
You were chloroformed
by polygamous Mormons.

1480
01:06:21,908 --> 01:06:23,342
They took you off to
be someone's bride!

1481
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:26,384
I was not abducted. Didn't
anybody read my letters?

1482
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:29,394
Yeah, but I assumed you were
forced to write them at gunpoint.

1483
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:30,800
Who's this?
- Who are you?

1484
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:31,972
This is Boris,
my husband.

1485
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,089
Boris, your who?

1486
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,511
He's my husband.
I'm Mrs. Boris Yellnikoff.

1487
01:06:35,477 --> 01:06:37,212
Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

1488
01:06:37,205 --> 01:06:39,273
You want to pass out here
or go in the living room?

1489
01:06:39,254 --> 01:06:40,454
Where's your mother?

1490
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,304
What do you care?
You cheated on her

1491
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,529
and then dumped her for Mandy
Blackburn, of all people!

1492
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:47,103
I made a terrible mistake, I
committed the sin of self-indulgence.

1493
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:48,863
I've come to beg your
mother's forgiveness.

1494
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,021
You might want to
rethink that, Daddy.

1495
01:06:50,038 --> 01:06:51,206
I want to see her.

1496
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:53,158
I see death
by culture shock.

1497
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,611
You can tell me, Melody, she
has every right to hate me.

1498
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:56,942
And she does, believe me.

1499
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,685
I can handle the truth.
Does she hate me?

1500
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,548
Well, it was a pretty awful thing
you did with her best friend.

1501
01:07:01,496 --> 01:07:02,496
Then she hates me?

1502
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,688
Yes, yes, she hates you!
I can't stand this.

1503
01:07:04,664 --> 01:07:06,398
I hate you
and I just met you!

1504
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:08,593
Lord, you tell me this
creature took you to bed?

1505
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:10,202
No, no, no, no.
Actually, she took me.

1506
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,201
Yeah, when I met Boris,
he hated sex.

1507
01:07:12,185 --> 01:07:13,652
Yeah, think of it,
Mr. Celestine.

1508
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:16,358
The absurd choreography,
like a sewing machine,

1509
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:18,547
up and down, up and
down, up and down,

1510
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:20,255
toward what end?
Making more children?

1511
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:21,515
What the hell are
you talking about?

1512
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:24,899
Reproducing the species over
and over. Toward what goal?

1513
01:07:24,825 --> 01:07:26,660
Carrying out
what moronic design?

1514
01:07:26,649 --> 01:07:27,783
What happened to Mandy?

1515
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:28,902
It was a mess,
a nightmare.

1516
01:07:28,922 --> 01:07:31,657
Lord, I've sinned!
Please forgive me.

1517
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,878
Why do all the religious
psychotics wind up

1518
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,551
praying at my doorstep?
Can you tell me?

1519
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:38,114
Lord, in Your infinite
mercy, I've done wrong.

1520
01:07:38,074 --> 01:07:39,475
You want to tell him,
or should I?

1521
01:07:39,482 --> 01:07:40,849
Tell me what?

1522
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:45,663
Daddy, there's
nobody out there!

1523
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:49,098
Honest.
You're praying to no one.

1524
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,153
You're wasting
your breath,

1525
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:52,239
just like you're gonna
be wasting it on Mom.

1526
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:53,920
What? You're telling me
she met another man?

1527
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,950
Not just a man.
- What?

1528
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,466
Daddy, you couldn't
expect her to not,

1529
01:07:57,468 --> 01:08:00,637
you know, move on with
her life and, you know...

1530
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:03,207
Oh, Lord.
What's he like?

1531
01:08:03,165 --> 01:08:05,332
He's got four arms
and two noses.

1532
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:06,742
You better butt out,
stranger!

1533
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:08,316
Melody will tell you
I don't need my shotgun

1534
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,683
to be a whole
passel of trouble.

1535
01:08:09,693 --> 01:08:11,961
Now, I want to
see Marietta!

1536
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,917
Now, Dad,
try and remember,

1537
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:37,537
you haven't
seen Mom in a year.

1538
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:40,704
A year is not forever. How
much can a person change?

1539
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,375
And with that,
they entered the gallery.

1540
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:56,757
I had more people
than I knew what to do with.

1541
01:08:56,737 --> 01:08:58,904
Everybody said,
"I'll be naked with you, Marietta!"

1542
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:00,214
And I was like, "Okay."

1543
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,738
Oh, my God.

1544
01:09:05,026 --> 01:09:06,526
Marietta?

1545
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:10,833
John Celestine! Look
what the cat dragged in.

1546
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,555
Marietta, what happened to you?
- Oh, my God!

1547
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:14,479
Well, darling,
it's you that absconded.

1548
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:16,134
He showed up at the door
today. Whoa, whoa. "Absconded"?

1549
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,898
Yes, yes, with the
promiscuous whore

1550
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:19,458
who called herself my best friend.
- Darling, I'll be...

1551
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:21,159
I'll find you.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1552
01:09:21,155 --> 01:09:23,357
It's over, Marietta. Mandy
and I were a terrible mistake.

1553
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:24,798
I've come back for you.

1554
01:09:24,803 --> 01:09:26,270
Well, honey, I'm in the
middle of my opening.

1555
01:09:26,275 --> 01:09:29,310
Yeah, Dad, this is Mom's
exhibition. Isn't it great?

1556
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:30,784
Exhibition of what?

1557
01:09:30,787 --> 01:09:32,255
Well, the collages.

1558
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,727
What? She's thinking
of buying this pornography?

1559
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:36,725
I got news for you,
she's the pornographer.

1560
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,608
Marietta, who are you?

1561
01:09:38,596 --> 01:09:41,197
John, you never
understood me, honey.

1562
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:43,357
Your vision never extended
beyond the backyard.

1563
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:44,433
You always had
your gun clubs

1564
01:09:44,452 --> 01:09:46,052
and your fishing trips
and football.

1565
01:09:46,052 --> 01:09:48,621
You never took a little
minute to find out about me.

1566
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:50,415
And you were always too
busy putting her in pageants

1567
01:09:50,405 --> 01:09:52,873
and coaching her speeches and
teaching her baton twirling!

1568
01:09:52,837 --> 01:09:55,872
Yes, yes, that's true. I was
sublimating my own creative needs

1569
01:09:55,813 --> 01:09:57,314
and forcing them
on our daughter.

1570
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,418
You were what?
Yes, she was sublimating.

1571
01:09:59,397 --> 01:10:00,564
Sublimating.

1572
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:02,750
Honey, why don't you go
on back to Mandy Blackburn?

1573
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:05,027
Her pygmy mentality is
much closer to you now.

1574
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,299
Much closer.
- Yeah. Well, I can't go back to her.

1575
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,270
Oh, why not?

1576
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:10,195
She cast aspersions
on my manhood.

1577
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:13,519
What are we talking? Size?
Duration? Erectile dysfunction?

1578
01:10:13,446 --> 01:10:15,247
Would you mind
your own business?

1579
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,940
Marietta, how could you
forsake your own family?

1580
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,896
I want us all back home
to start over.

1581
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:22,847
I'm a different woman, John.

1582
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:25,326
I can't believe what
I'm seeing. I mean...

1583
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:28,090
Your clothes are different, your
speech is a little more affected,

1584
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,941
but deep down,
I know you're the same

1585
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:33,364
pretty, small-town, God-fearing,
churchgoing, pie-baking...

1586
01:10:33,288 --> 01:10:34,823
I'm living with two guys.

1587
01:10:34,824 --> 01:10:36,858
...Girl Scout mom.
You're what?

1588
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,843
I'm an artist. I don't bake
pies. I don't go to church.

1589
01:10:40,745 --> 01:10:44,081
I do collages,
sculpture, photography.

1590
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,478
I live in Manhattan
with two men who I love

1591
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,270
in a very happy
menage a trois.

1592
01:10:50,217 --> 01:10:51,317
A what?

1593
01:10:51,337 --> 01:10:55,774
We all sleep together.
A menage a trois.

1594
01:10:55,658 --> 01:10:59,093
I knew we should never
trust the goddamn French.

1595
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:00,886
It's amazing, Melody.

1596
01:11:00,874 --> 01:11:04,911
Thousands of years ago, ancient
peoples, Egyptians, Romans, Mayans,

1597
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,879
were walking home,
just like us,

1598
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:10,988
discussing where should they
eat or making small talk.

1599
01:11:10,923 --> 01:11:14,025
"Hey, we just bought a great
house on the Nile with a yard,

1600
01:11:13,964 --> 01:11:15,765
"overlooking the
Pharaoh's new pyramid."

1601
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:18,658
Boris...
- Or, "My physician says

1602
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:21,372
"peacock tongues are bad for your heart."
- Boris...

1603
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:26,895
Or, "I'm worried I can't get my kid
into a really good Aztec preschool."

1604
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:29,168
What the hell does it
all mean now? Zilch.

1605
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:30,566
But they thought
it was important.

1606
01:11:30,573 --> 01:11:32,174
Boris, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1607
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:34,975
And I was raised
in a religious home.

1608
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:37,493
Job's wife was my favorite
character in the Bible,

1609
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:39,055
because she chose death

1610
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:40,621
rather than
obsequious acceptance,

1611
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:42,623
like that masochist
she married.

1612
01:11:46,671 --> 01:11:49,138
Boris, Boris, can we
sit down for a second?

1613
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:50,269
Well, but we have to
go home.

1614
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,622
I know, but come here.
I have to say something.

1615
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,425
But we always
go home now.

1616
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:56,716
I know. I know. I know we
have a standard routine.

1617
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:00,357
I need to have my drink,
and a shower.

1618
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:02,072
And, you know,
you see it as routine,

1619
01:12:02,064 --> 01:12:05,133
but for me the consistency helps
keep me from becoming unnerved.

1620
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,305
I know you require
a certain ritual.

1621
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:09,013
And then after the shower,
our dinner,

1622
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:10,476
but not crawfish pie
again.

1623
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,080
I got indigestion
from it last time.

1624
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,148
I thought I had
thyroid cancer.

1625
01:12:14,128 --> 01:12:17,464
Boris, I met someone else.
I've fallen in love.

1626
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:20,728
And then some Beethoven, maybe
some Schubert for a change,

1627
01:12:20,656 --> 01:12:22,958
but, you know...

1628
01:12:22,929 --> 01:12:25,397
You met someone else?

1629
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:29,699
I'm not saying I don't have
very deep feelings for you. I do.

1630
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,037
You met someone else?

1631
01:12:35,026 --> 01:12:36,994
Yes.

1632
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,947
And you want us to live in a
threesome, like your mother?

1633
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:43,752
Boris, when you found me,
I was very young.

1634
01:12:45,651 --> 01:12:47,418
You're still very young.

1635
01:12:47,411 --> 01:12:49,813
Yes, but I've grown.

1636
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,815
I've grown so much.
And mainly because of you.

1637
01:12:54,323 --> 01:12:56,525
Yes, it's true.
I have been very patient

1638
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,634
with your
phenomenal ignorance.

1639
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,269
You can always count
on me for anything.

1640
01:13:05,493 --> 01:13:07,127
I just...

1641
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:10,693
I guess I'm at a very
impressionable age, and I...

1642
01:13:11,797 --> 01:13:14,632
I can't think of a way
to say this well.

1643
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:18,037
You don't have
to say it well.

1644
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:19,337
I want to.

1645
01:13:19,349 --> 01:13:22,718
I completely understand.
I do.

1646
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:25,548
This does not run counter
to my convictions that

1647
01:13:25,494 --> 01:13:29,029
love relationships are
almost invariably transient.

1648
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:33,609
I don't really think
that's true if they're right.

1649
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:39,431
Really?
You have your own ideas?

1650
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:43,489
Just a couple. You know,
they're not very deep, but...

1651
01:13:43,383 --> 01:13:48,655
As cruel as life is, I miss
participating in the world.

1652
01:13:48,503 --> 01:13:53,040
And I even miss people, even
the inchworms and the cretins,

1653
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,721
because I don't
really think they're bad,

1654
01:13:55,672 --> 01:13:57,673
I think they're
just scared.

1655
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:01,792
I think you're making
the correct decision.

1656
01:14:01,753 --> 01:14:03,520
Boris...
- I mean it.

1657
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:10,685
I'm a profound and sensitive
soul with an enormous grasp

1658
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:13,187
of the human condition.

1659
01:14:13,145 --> 01:14:15,347
It was inevitable you would

1660
01:14:15,322 --> 01:14:18,757
eventually grow tired of
being so grossly overmatched.

1661
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:21,928
Greatness isn't
easy to live with,

1662
01:14:21,914 --> 01:14:24,782
even by someone of
normal intelligence.

1663
01:14:26,523 --> 01:14:28,357
You're upset.

1664
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:30,982
I don't expect you to
understand. How could you?

1665
01:14:33,372 --> 01:14:34,505
Believe me,

1666
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:39,033
if I can understand
quantum mechanics,

1667
01:14:38,971 --> 01:14:41,973
I can certainly comprehend
the thought process

1668
01:14:43,069 --> 01:14:45,303
of a sub-mental
baton twirler.

1669
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:47,674
Boris...

1670
01:14:47,676 --> 01:14:48,810
It's okay.

1671
01:14:50,556 --> 01:14:54,292
I knew this day would come.
I really did.

1672
01:14:54,205 --> 01:14:57,307
The universe is winding down.
Why shouldn't we?

1673
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:03,437
Again!

1674
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,888
I'll have another, too.

1675
01:15:08,062 --> 01:15:12,098
She left me.
Can you believe it?

1676
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:15,400
What am I talking about?
I left her. She's alone.

1677
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,097
Now, no matter which way she
turns in bed, she's got a husband.

1678
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,915
My wife left me, too.

1679
01:15:22,879 --> 01:15:25,815
I'm sure she was beautiful,
just like my wife.

1680
01:15:27,008 --> 01:15:28,208
Norman?

1681
01:15:29,536 --> 01:15:31,370
Norman was gorgeous.

1682
01:15:34,272 --> 01:15:38,175
He was the greatest runway
model Versace ever had.

1683
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:40,649
I thought you said
your wife.

1684
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:42,443
We were married
in Holland.

1685
01:15:44,929 --> 01:15:46,797
You married a guy?

1686
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,552
What else?

1687
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:51,605
But that would make you...

1688
01:15:51,586 --> 01:15:55,455
What? A widow?
Norman didn't die.

1689
01:15:56,194 --> 01:15:57,828
Not a widow, a...

1690
01:15:59,457 --> 01:16:00,557
Gay?

1691
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:01,712
A member of the...

1692
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:05,295
Of what?

1693
01:16:05,282 --> 01:16:07,316
The homosexual persuasion.

1694
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:10,045
My God.

1695
01:16:10,018 --> 01:16:12,420
You make it sound
like a religion.

1696
01:16:12,387 --> 01:16:16,223
Yes. If it's a religion, you
could call me devout. A fanatic.

1697
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,861
But that's a sin
against God's law.

1698
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:23,238
God is gay.

1699
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,471
He can't be. He made the
whole universe perfect.

1700
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:30,148
The oceans, the skies, the beautiful
flowers, the trees everywhere.

1701
01:16:30,021 --> 01:16:32,222
That's right.
He's a decorator.

1702
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:35,599
But what do you miss about
him? I still don't get it.

1703
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:37,496
Everything.

1704
01:16:38,085 --> 01:16:40,086
His face.

1705
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:42,937
His kindness,
his sense of humor.

1706
01:16:42,885 --> 01:16:45,420
Our mutual passion.

1707
01:16:45,382 --> 01:16:48,784
The way we'd dance and he'd
dip me back and kiss me.

1708
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:51,645
Jesus.

1709
01:16:51,623 --> 01:16:54,725
Why did he leave you?
She leave you. Norman.

1710
01:16:54,662 --> 01:16:56,997
He wants to live in Paris,

1711
01:16:56,966 --> 01:16:59,334
and I can't leave
my sick mother.

1712
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:02,495
Is your mother a woman?

1713
01:17:04,296 --> 01:17:06,964
She used to look
like Marlene Dietrich.

1714
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:10,856
What's the difference? They all
hurt you in the end, every woman,

1715
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,760
whether they're
male or female.

1716
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:16,307
Why did yours leave you?

1717
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:20,433
I left her for her best
friend, but it didn't work out.

1718
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:22,399
Why not?

1719
01:17:24,585 --> 01:17:26,919
Can I be perfectly
frank with you?

1720
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,723
I don't shock easily.

1721
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,667
I couldn't make love to her.

1722
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:34,928
Why not?

1723
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:39,491
It was fine at first, but then I
lost interest. I wanted Marietta back.

1724
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:41,138
Which is funny,
because in the last years,

1725
01:17:41,129 --> 01:17:44,766
I really didn't have a lot of
sexual interest in Marietta.

1726
01:17:44,682 --> 01:17:48,685
That happens with you heteros.
We always have interest.

1727
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:53,894
Christ, if I'm going
to be honest,

1728
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:56,100
you know, I never,
ever really had

1729
01:17:56,075 --> 01:17:58,209
a burning sexual desire
for Marietta.

1730
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:01,610
Why'd you marry her?

1731
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:05,083
It was the thing to do.
Everybody where I lived,

1732
01:18:05,068 --> 01:18:07,502
you had a wife
and children and...

1733
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,253
Can I really level with you?

1734
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:14,518
Of course.

1735
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,308
John. John Celestine.

1736
01:18:16,301 --> 01:18:20,804
Of course, John. I'm Howard
Cummings, nee Kaminsky.

1737
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:25,184
I married Marietta,
because I was afraid.

1738
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,043
Of what?

1739
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:31,649
The way I felt towards the
tight end on the football team.

1740
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:33,033
No.

1741
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:37,074
Every time he got in the line
of scrimmage and bent over.

1742
01:18:36,974 --> 01:18:39,610
Bartender, another round
for my friend and me, please.

1743
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:25,669
Can you believe
I blew it twice?

1744
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:29,355
I jumped out the window and
landed on a woman walking her dog.

1745
01:19:29,267 --> 01:19:32,001
She got hurt.
I got off scot-free.

1746
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:35,211
Don't you realize
the consequences

1747
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:37,588
of your actions
impact on other people?

1748
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:38,689
Oh, come on.
Seriously.

1749
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,776
No. What if you had
committed suicide?

1750
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:42,322
Think, think if
you didn't exist,

1751
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:45,058
how the world would suddenly
change in ways you can't imagine.

1752
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:46,112
Oh, my God.
You know what?

1753
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:47,999
You sound like
that movie they ram

1754
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:49,489
down your throat
every Christmas.

1755
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:51,560
What?
- What if the guardian angel

1756
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,008
had saved Jimmy Stewart,

1757
01:19:53,012 --> 01:19:55,681
and Jimmy Stewart was
the guy who smoked in bed,

1758
01:19:55,636 --> 01:20:00,707
and he lived and caused a
fire that killed 60 people? So?

1759
01:20:00,565 --> 01:20:04,268
How about that? Everybody's
life is still worth saving?

1760
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:06,316
Even if it's Christmas?
Come on, seriously.

1761
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:09,329
You must have a very dim
view of the human race.

1762
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,038
Oh, the human race.
They've had to install

1763
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:14,158
automatic toilets
in public restrooms,

1764
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:17,003
because people can't be
entrusted to flush a toilet.

1765
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,219
Come on, flushing a toilet!
They can't even flush a toilet!

1766
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:22,708
Visiting time is over.

1767
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:24,478
What? You're kicking me out?

1768
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:25,571
Yeah.

1769
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:29,360
Seriously?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1770
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:33,708
All right, listen. Honestly,
I'm really sorry about all this

1771
01:20:34,808 --> 01:20:37,443
and is there anything I can
do to make this up to you?

1772
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,135
Can I get you something?
What can I do?

1773
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,571
If I can ever walk again,
you can buy me dinner.

1774
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:46,272
What do you do, Helena?

1775
01:20:46,265 --> 01:20:47,932
Me? I'm a psychic.

1776
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:52,987
I'm sorry. Really?

1777
01:20:52,954 --> 01:20:56,790
I was born with a very rare
gift. I can see into the future.

1778
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:58,532
If you can see into the
future, how come you didn't know

1779
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,657
I was gonna jump out a
building and land on top of you?

1780
01:21:03,097 --> 01:21:04,498
Maybe I did.

1781
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:19,784
Happy new year to you.

1782
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:27,299
We're so excited.
Howard is selling the gym,

1783
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,895
but we're going to open up an antique
shop in Chelsea. Yeah. Art deco.

1784
01:21:30,812 --> 01:21:33,147
We're going to have a wonderful
collection of movie posters.

1785
01:21:33,117 --> 01:21:34,417
Can you believe
this cracker?

1786
01:21:34,428 --> 01:21:36,529
This red state
Neanderthal?

1787
01:21:36,508 --> 01:21:39,510
This mindless zombie of the
National Rifle Association?

1788
01:21:39,453 --> 01:21:41,254
My shrink says
that the guns were all

1789
01:21:41,244 --> 01:21:43,312
a manifestation of
my sexual inadequacy.

1790
01:21:43,293 --> 01:21:44,794
Yeah, if it weren't
for sexual inadequacy,

1791
01:21:44,798 --> 01:21:48,266
the National Rifle
Association would go broke.

1792
01:21:48,189 --> 01:21:50,924
He's moved in with Howard
Cummings, nee Kaminsky.

1793
01:21:50,878 --> 01:21:52,612
And not only is
he sleeping with a man,

1794
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:54,740
soon he'll be
celebrating Purim.

1795
01:21:54,718 --> 01:21:56,585
More important,
for the first time

1796
01:21:56,574 --> 01:21:59,343
in his adult life,
he's happy.

1797
01:21:59,295 --> 01:22:01,629
I should have known why I
was failing you, Marietta,

1798
01:22:01,599 --> 01:22:03,499
not fulfilling
your womanly needs.

1799
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:06,188
Which turned out to
be quite considerable.

1800
01:22:06,143 --> 01:22:09,612
Mine, too, but not with the sex
I'd been raised to be attracted to.

1801
01:22:09,535 --> 01:22:11,503
You're like
a changed man, John.

1802
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:13,955
Your whole personality
is sunnier.

1803
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,554
If only it had
been that way.

1804
01:22:15,552 --> 01:22:17,586
I couldn't when I was
making love to you.

1805
01:22:17,568 --> 01:22:19,936
I was a square peg
in a round hole,

1806
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:21,704
you should pardon
the metaphor.

1807
01:22:21,696 --> 01:22:22,963
Well, I just hope
you two lucked out

1808
01:22:22,976 --> 01:22:25,044
and found the right person
in each other.

1809
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,925
I know I lucked out.

1810
01:22:26,913 --> 01:22:28,981
What about you, Boris?

1811
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:32,296
As you would say in the crude
fashion of your generation,

1812
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:35,556
I totally lucked out.

1813
01:22:35,522 --> 01:22:40,959
It just shows what meaningless
blind chance the universe is.

1814
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:44,472
Everybody schemes and dreams
to meet the right person,

1815
01:22:44,386 --> 01:22:47,721
and I jump out a window
and land on her.

1816
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:48,984
And a psychic yet!

1817
01:22:48,994 --> 01:22:51,896
I mean, come on, talk
about the irrational heart,

1818
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:55,278
not to mention I've developed
a fondness for grits.

1819
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,973
I have a question, am I
a member of my generation?

1820
01:22:58,883 --> 01:23:01,518
Yes. Don't worry.
I'll explain it to you.

1821
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:04,277
Hey, hey, hold on! Hold on!
The ball's about to drop!

1822
01:23:04,228 --> 01:23:05,428
Come on!

1823
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:06,910
<i>Ten,</i>

1824
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,082
nine,

1825
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,734
eight, seven,

1826
01:23:10,692 --> 01:23:13,061
six, five,

1827
01:23:13,028 --> 01:23:15,529
four, three,

1828
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:17,560
two, one!

1829
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,075
Happy new year!

1830
01:23:34,182 --> 01:23:36,917
I happen to hate
New Year's celebrations.

1831
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:39,338
Everybody desperate
to have fun.

1832
01:23:39,302 --> 01:23:42,204
Trying to celebrate
in some pathetic little way.

1833
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:45,053
Celebrate what?
A step closer to the grave?

1834
01:23:46,471 --> 01:23:48,705
That's why I can't
say enough times,

1835
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:51,247
whatever love
you can get and give,

1836
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:55,310
whatever happiness
you can filch or provide,

1837
01:23:55,208 --> 01:24:00,045
every temporary measure
of grace, whatever works.

1838
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:02,579
And don't kid yourself,
it's by no means

1839
01:24:02,536 --> 01:24:05,205
all up to your
own human ingenuity.

1840
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,697
A bigger part of your existence
is luck than you'd like to admit.

1841
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:11,885
Christ, you know the odds
of your father's one sperm

1842
01:24:11,817 --> 01:24:16,187
from the billions, finding
the single egg that made you?

1843
01:24:16,073 --> 01:24:18,509
Don't think about it,
you'll have a panic attack.

1844
01:24:18,473 --> 01:24:20,241
Boris, what are you doing?
Who you talking to?

1845
01:24:20,233 --> 01:24:22,734
What? There's people
out there watching us.

1846
01:24:22,697 --> 01:24:23,998
They're out there?

1847
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,277
Yeah, yeah,
they're watching. What?

1848
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,191
Please, Boris...
- You know...

1849
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:29,245
Well, there was
when we started.

1850
01:24:29,226 --> 01:24:30,359
I don't know
how many are left.

1851
01:24:30,378 --> 01:24:32,212
Does anybody see
anybody out there?

1852
01:24:32,202 --> 01:24:33,235
Out there? No!

1853
01:24:33,258 --> 01:24:34,392
No!

1854
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:35,811
Boris!
- No!

1855
01:24:37,034 --> 01:24:40,937
See? I'm the only one
who sees the whole picture.

1856
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:44,045
That's what they mean
by genius.

1857
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,247
Come on.
Happy new year, Boris.

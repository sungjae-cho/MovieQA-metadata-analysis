ring his doorbell,

they're just gonna, bang,

right up in his man business

to, like, scrub and scrub and scrub

Then we go to plan B.

00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,857
Mother's third marriage
was to this 20-year-old

744
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,764
club-footed Cuban bartender
who came into a ton of money.

745
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,932
The court said
that if they both wanted the money,

746
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,802
they had to remain married and prove
they can make it work. Sound familiar?

747
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,875
Mother wasn't going to see a cent of that,

748
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,206
but then she proved
that he'd been unfaithful,

749
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,337
and the judge ruled in her favor.

750
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:43,547
And gave her all the money.

751
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,481
And gave her all the money.

752
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,419
See, the judge said that you had to prove

753
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,181
that you were trying
to make the marriage work.

754
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,688
But if we can make it seem like she isn't...

I don't know
why I haven't thought of this before!

- Because you're not a very good lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

There should be a law
against how bad a lawyer I am.

if I ever see him again.

Wow. Thank you, baby.

- Yeah.

And I'll tell you another thing.

- Not unless I kill you first.

- He doesn't do anything all day, okay?

- It's like he's not even a grownup, okay?

- He does nothing...

...all day long!

907

- And I swear to God...
- I think he's trying to drive me crazy!

908
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,789
- The other night, we had this party...
- He peed in the sink!

909
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,454
...and everywhere I look...
- I mean, what kind of man animal...

910

...it's just hot tit and ass everywhere!
...pees in the sink?

- It's like she doesn't even want...

...this marriage to work!
...this marriage to work!

913

All right. You're arguing.

914
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,571
Now that felt like a real married couple.

915
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,577
You're making progress.

What am I doing here?

917
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,192
Oh, we could kidnap her
until after the hearing.

918
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,893
- She could stay at my place.
- HATER: Oh, my God, I got it!

919
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,561
We make it look
like she gave you some kind of disease!

920
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,037
I can have a vial of crabs here
in 30 minutes.

921
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,300
First, we give them to you,

922
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,433
and then, you know,
we get somebody to give them to her

923
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,171
so it looks like she gave them to you.

924
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,738
You really hadn't thought
that one through, had you?

925
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,840
I'll give her the crabs, easily.

926
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,648
- No more ideas from you.
- Oh, I've got it! It's perfect!

- I fell.
- You fell?

00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,419

that's what happened to you?

01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:16,003
This is my niece, and BFF,
the great Sammy Sosa.

1173
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:20,599
Sammy, this is your Aunt Joy.

1174
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,701
- Nice to meet you, Sammy.
- Hi, Joy.

1175
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,439
I didn't know you coached Little League.

1176
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,539
Oh, there's a lot of things you don't know
about me. Isn't that right?

1177
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,178
Jack wore a little fedora
and a leather jacket to school

1178
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,755

- What, are we bonding now?

1183
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,399
She doesn't seem so bad, Uncle Jack.

1184
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,936

split the money and stay married.

- "A wily temptress."

1218
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,619
- Yes!
- You just said "wily temptress."

1219

Yes, I did, because that is what she is.

1221

- Oh...
- Have fun?

1227
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,484
No, I remember when I didn't care
about my career, either.

01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:26,551

this weekend with my husband's family...

1230
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,792
Well, thanks for the invite.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

1231
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,195
Yeah, no, I'm married.
I didn't tell you that?

1232
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,304
No, you didn't.
I guess you're not a big sharer.

1233
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,600
Now, listen, Joy,
I've been in this business for a long time.

1234
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,767
And the thing that I value most
in my employees is honesty.

1235
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,347
So I'm gonna be honest with you.
Right now, you and Chong are tied.

1236
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:48,349
Now, Chonger is bringing her husband
to the retreat.

1237
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,943
- I think you should bring yours, too.
- He will be there.

1238
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,120
- You can count on it, sir.
- Good.

1239

So let me get this straight.

1240
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,990
She asked you
to come to a retreat for her job.

1241
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,397
Yeah.

1242
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,402

to her in the world.

when you have them eating
out of the palm of your hand,

1248
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,457
you make her sign this.

1249
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,125
- What's this?
- This is a document, okay,

1251
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:44,400

you're gonna out her in front of everybody.

01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:47,934
Yeah.

- Okay, look, Jack, the hearing's in a week.

01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,552
Okay? This is our last shot.

- Mr. Banger.

1259
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,146
So, where's this husband of yours?

1260
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,050
I just met Chonger's husband.
He's a very smart guy.

1261
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,214

Hi, Your Honor.

Have you lost weight?

1493
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,074
Gotcha. Let's begin.

1494
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:10,777
Although Ms. McNally ran up $25,000
in credit card debt in my client's name,

1495
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:13,547
my client recently spent the same amount

1496
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,556
for materials
for his new furniture business.

1497
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,951
Therefore, we propose
the following settlement, Your Honor.

1498
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,594
The original $3 million,
deduct half for taxes

1499
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:25,427
and $50,000 that's already been spent,

1500
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,468
that leaves $1.45 million to be divided...

1501
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,635
equally.

1502

Yes, Your Honor, I am.

Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

1538
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,246
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to
let you down.

1539
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,816
Why don't you just give it to Chong,
you know?

1540
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,316
She's good, she deserves it,

1541
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:59,886
and besides,
I think she just enjoys being miserable.

1542
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,448
- Yes!
- You sure you know what you're doing?

1543
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:05,492
No, I don't. But I think that's the point.

1544
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,422
I would rather do nothing and be happy

1545
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,856
than do something that I don't love.

1546
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,711
Well, I lost her at happy.

1547
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:29,510
I don't know what the hell
she was trying to say anyway.

1548
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:32,245
Well done, Chonger. The job is yours.

1549
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,186
Thank you.

1550
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,857
So! Jack made a piece of furniture.

1551
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,294
He finished it.

1552
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,024
Okay. Go ahead, Dad.
What's wrong with it?

1553
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,599
Nothing. It's good.

1554
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,964
It's really good. I'm proud of you.

1555
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,333
- Thank you.
- But...

1556
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,407
Here we go.

01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,066
...you royally screwed up
when it comes to that girl.

1558
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:58,942
It was a big, stupid mistake. Okay?
The entire marriage was a lie!

1559
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,572
The marriage might have been a mistake,
but it was not a lie.

1560
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:04,447
And I think that anybody
who has spent time with you two recently

1561
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:05,644
could tell you that.

1562
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,881
So why don't you get your head
out of your ass

1563
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,151
and go do something about it?

1564
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,126
Or should I tell you not to,
and then maybe you will?

1565
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,128
- TIPPER: She's gone, man.
- Gone? What do you mean, gone?

1566
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:25,536
She, like, lost it. She quit her job,
shut off her phone. She took off.

1567
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,798
Look, I don't really care much for you,

1568
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,706
and I want to cut your friend Hater.
Seriously.

1569
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,039
But for some reason,

1570
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:34,080
you're, like, the only man
that Joy can actually be herself with,

1571
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:38,118
so I wanna tell you where she is,
I really do. I just don't know.

1572
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,754
- What do you know?
- I don't know. If you were miserable

1573
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:44,291
and you wanted to get happy again,
where would you go?

1574
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,152
What?

1575
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,227
Thank you.

1576
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,799
Okay, tell you what. We both go.

1577
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,331
That way, when she sees us both,

1578
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,929
she can make up her mind
on who she wants to be with.

I've loaned you my beer tap.

01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,893
<i>But some totally relate</i>

1673
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:33,327
<i>I'd rather go to hell</i>
<i>than shake your hand or wish you well</i>

1674
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:35,464
<i>In case you couldn't tell</i>

1675
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:41,803
<i>Go ahead, boy, drink your drink</i>
<i>Go ahead, boy, do your thing</i>

1676
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:45,640
<i>Can you learn the words</i>
<i>to every song I sing</i>

1677
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,771
<i>I could pretend</i>

1678
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:53,044
<i>Can't you understand</i>
<i>I hate you my friend</i>

1679
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:15,234
<i>Some call it an obsession</i>

1680
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,908
<i>And some call it a good hate</i>

1681
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,241
<i>And I'll just call it pathetic</i>

1682
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:27,016
<i>But some totally relate</i>

1683
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:33,426
<i>No one here likes you</i>
<i>Go away, get a clue</i>

1684
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:37,395
<i>Go back to your... zoo</i>
<i>or whatever it is you do</i>

1685
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:40,261
<i>I could pretend</i>

1686
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:44,565
<i>Can't you understand</i>
<i>I hate you my friend</i>

1687
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,234
<i>I hate you my friend</i>

1688
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:53,202
<i>I hate you my friend</i>

1689
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:15,546
(EXHALES)

1690
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:19,092
What are you doing later? You know,
there's a meteor shower tonight.

1691
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,626
You know what?

1692
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,322
Jack was our glue.

1693
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:25,830
I feel like the fact that he's gone
makes us a little closer.

1694
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:28,299
No, it makes us a little bit just...

1695
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:30,599
The opposite of that.

1696
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:40,940
You like to party?

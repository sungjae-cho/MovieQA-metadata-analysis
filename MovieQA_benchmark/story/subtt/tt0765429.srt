1
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,394
BUMPY: Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,256
Come here!

3
00:01:58,938 --> 00:01:59,996
Yeah!
MAN: Right here!

4
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:01,767
MAN: Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

5
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,308
WOMAN 1: Bumpy!

6
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:06,576
Yeah!
WOMAN 2: Bumpy! We love you!

7
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,271
There you go, darling.

8
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,679
WOMAN 3: Over here! Over here!

9
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,086
Frank! Come on!

10
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:18,750
Come here.

11
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:35,736
BUMPY: This is the problem.
This is what's wrong
with America.

12
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,067
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,973
The grocery store
on the corner is
now a supermarket.

14
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:48,414
The candy store
is a McDonald's.

15
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:53,452
And this place,
a super-fucking
discount store.

16
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:56,762
Where's the pride
of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,961
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,768
You see what I mean? Shit.

19
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:16,271
I mean, what right
do they have, of cutting
out the suppliers,

20
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,812
pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:23,945
buying direct
from the manufacturer?

22
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,758
Sony this, Toshiba that.

23
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:32,797
All them Chinks
putting Americans
out of work.

24
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:41,600
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,038
You all right?

26
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,943
You can't find
the heart of anything

27
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,786
to stick the knife.

28
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,281
Hey!

29
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,654
Anybody here?

30
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:01,282
Can I help you?

31
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,759
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:04,591
Forget it, Frank.

33
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,362
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,000
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,643
REPORTER: Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

36
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,838
according to the eulogies,
a giving man,

37
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,106
a man of the people.

38
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,876
No one chose to use
in their remembrances

39
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,951
the word most often
associated with

40
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,111
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson,
"gangster,"

41
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,816
whose passing has brought
a who's who of mourners
on this chilly afternoon.

42
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:34,359
Lucchese mob boss
Dominic Cattano,

43
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,155
Harlem crime figure
Nicky Barnes.

44
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:37,320
MAN: Nicky! Nicky!

45
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,556
REPORTER: From the
political arena,

46
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:41,064
<i>the Governor has come down, 
the Mayor of New York, </i>

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,534

Commissioner, sports and
entertainment luminaries. </i>

48
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,840
<i>REPORTER 2: Bumpy Johnson, 
age 62 when he passed, </i>

49
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:52,469

Harlem locals for
over four decades. </i>

50
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,945
<i>Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem, </i>

51
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,913
<i>by others as
a ruthless criminal... </i>

52
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,745
TANGO: I don't understand,
you know.

53
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:03,083
I would've thought that
Bumpy would put out
a better spread, you know?

54
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,053
You want something?
No, thanks.

55
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,816
I want chicken wings
at my funeral.

56
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:09,417
MAN: All right, Nicky Barnes.
NICKY: Who is that?

57
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:11,257
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

58
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,695
I just kept popping him
in the face 'cause
that's what I do.

59
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:17,429
Mmm.

60
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,207
I don't have a lighter.
You have a light?

61
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:26,569
Oh.

62
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:34,375
FRANK: Okay?

63
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,448
TANGO: That's very good.

64
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,287
Hey, Frank.

65
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:43,391
Go get me a light
while you're at it.

66
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,424
Appreciate it.

67
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,631
Don Cattano.

68
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:50,827
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

69
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,234
Good.

70
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,703
BARTENDER: Would you
like a drink, sir?

71
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,570
Give him a scotch
on the rocks.

72
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:03,540
Come on. Come on.

73
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,783
I know you're hurting, Frank.

74
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:16,754
So am I.

75
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,422
I'm all right.

76
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,058
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.

77
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,801
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but
he made me promise

78
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:26,166
that if anything
ever happened to him,

79
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:29,297
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

80
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:32,404
I appreciate that.

81
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:36,743
You know, half the people
in this room owed
Bumpy money when he died.

82
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,977
They think I'm gonna forget
to collect, but I'm gonna
get that money.

83
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:43,179
Well, that's the spirit.
Go get 'em.

84
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,261
PROFESSOR: Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

85
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,126
PROFESSOR: Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

86
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:54,393
<i>give us US v. Mead, 
subject, issues,
what the determination was</i>

87
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,002
and what it means to us today.

88
00:06:57,437 --> 00:07:01,965
Class, you'll be critiquing
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

89
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,403
<i>RICHIE: I hate hearing
my name called, you know? </i>

90
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:09,447
It means I gotta get up
in front of the class,
I gotta turn around,

91
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:13,645
and I know every one of
those people there,
they know more than I do.

92
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:17,745
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying,
it's public speaking.

93
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,256
I get physically ill,
I wanna throw up.

94
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,155
And that's what you
wanna do for a living.

95
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,421
No, I don't wanna be
like that, man,
I wanna beat it.

96
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:24,587
JAY: So, should I do this?

97
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,097
No, he'll take it from me,
he knows me. I've known
him since high school.

98
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,634
From high school?
Good morning. Yeah.

99
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,828
He doesn't take it,
just throw it in.
It's good service.

100
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,439
Throw it in? All right.
Yeah.

101
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,340
JAY: What's up, Susie?
Hey, Jay.

102
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:39,343
How you doing, baby?
All right.

103
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,810
All right. Ready?

104
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:59,489
Hey! That's his head!

105
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:11,104
RICHIE: You're supposed
to be my friend, asshole!

106
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,604
CAMPIZl: I swear
to God, Richie, I
didn't know it was you.

107
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:17,808
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

108
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:19,077
You bit my fucking hand.

109
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:20,880
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

110
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,988
JAY: We're on loan to County.
County?

111
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,148
How's that working
out for you?
RICHIE: Hey, fuck you.

112
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:29,354
Hey, I'm sorry.
Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?

113
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:32,362
Assault on a police officer?
I don't think so.

114
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,728
Hey, for old times' sake.
What can we do?

115
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,199
What do you want?
What can I give you?

116
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,565
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

117
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:40,569
Five years minimum.
RICHIE: Five years.

118
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:44,836
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want?
Who do you want?

119
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:46,406
Who do you got?

120
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:51,142
You want Big Al's bookie?
You want his accountant?
I'll give him to you.

121
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,755
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.

122
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,020
There he is.

123
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,693
That's him.
That's the bookie.

124
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,530
RICHIE: All right,
Carlo, get lost.

125
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:12,228
Get out of the car.

126
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:16,171
CAMPIZl: This is...
I'd rather not.
JAY: Come on. Let's go.

127
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,004
Take it ease.

128
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,621
JAY: Want to stay with him
or the car?

129
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,233
Let's see who comes
for the car.

130
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:58,443
Think he made us?

131
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:01,250
You called in the warrants,
right? So, where are they?

132
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:02,944
I just called, man.

133
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,889
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

134
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:11,227
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

135
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,993
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.
You don't know what's in 'em.

136
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:17,500
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

137
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:20,606
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour,
the warrant will be here.

138
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,642
I got night school, all right?
Guess you're gonna miss it.

139
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:33,915
RICHIE: Fuck this. Come on.
You sure?

140
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,885
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

141
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,372
Fuck.

142
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,509
Jay.
Yeah?

143
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,182
Fuck.

144
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:47,822
<i>MAN ON RADIO: 
WBZ, honey bunch, 
the show they all love! </i>

145
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,225

Saturday Night Show. </i>

147

<i>Stick around,

Back in 10.</i>

149
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,968
It's not just a
couple of bucks, all right?

150
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,706
It's the same thing
in principle.

151
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,010
Oh, are we talking principles?

152
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:14,575
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money,
says one thing.

153
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:18,412
He turns in cops
who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.

154
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:19,990
Yeah, well, then
we're fucked both ways.

155
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,856
Not if we keep it.
Only if we don't, then
you're right, we're fucked.

156
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,862
But not if we keep it.

157
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,165
God damn it, man!
Did we ask for this?

158
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:31,236
Did we put a gun to
someone's head and say,
"Give us your money"?

159
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,101
Cops kill cops
they can't trust.

160
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,736
We can't turn it in, man.

161
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,853
Can you believe that?

162
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,460
How much is it?

163
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,401
$987,000.

164
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:09,772
Well, what happened
to the rest of it?

165
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:13,404
TOBACK: What the hell
are you doing

166
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,706
counting it out here
in front of everybody?

167
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:15,803
Are you nuts?

168
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,620
Get it back in the bags,
seal them up and down
into the property room.

DETECTIVE:
You fucking Boy Scout.

170
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:00,117
What? What?

171
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:26,114
Detective Trupo, sign here.

172
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,086

a lot of fucking money?

MAN 2: Hell, yeah.

00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:38,423
TRUPO: Oh, look at this.

176
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:39,657
There you go.

177
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:43,165
TRUPO: All right,
look at this.
MAN 2: Fucking beautiful.

178
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,133
There's three more boats.

179
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,840
TRUPO: Hey, don't lose
any of that shit.

180
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,278
MAN 1: I know.
TRUPO: All right, be careful.

181
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,783
Hey! Just enough for
the reagent test.

182
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,286
A little less.

183
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,297
<i>ROSSI: This is the
French Connection dope. </i>

184
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,700
<i>Kilos of the same dope
Eddie Egan and
Sonny Grosso took from us. </i>

185
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:21,067
<i>The cops seize it, 
arrest everyone, </i>

186
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,573

of the evidence room, </i>

187
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,167

189
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:32,342
Mr. Rossi,
I have a surprise for you.

190
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:35,477
<i>ROSSI: They've been doing it
for years now. They
live off it, our dope. </i>

191
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:36,577
What do you think?

192
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:38,587
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

193
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,685
Those fucking crooks.

194
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,153
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

195
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,895
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

196
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:53,027
You walk down the street,
nobody bothers you 'cause
Bumpy was making sure of it.

197
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,672
Half a key.

198
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,834
How is your day now?

199
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,903
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for hisself.

200
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,242
Motherfucker!

201
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:10,681
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

202
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,924
That would never
happen with Italians.

203
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:16,755
More important than
any one man's life,
is order.

204
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,130
Frank.

205
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:29,734
Hey. Come on in,
Claude. Sit down.

206
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,808
FRANK: How y'all doing, huh?
Good.

207
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:38,347
So, you see Nate over there?
Yeah?

208
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,747
MAN: Yeah, all the time.

209
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,911
Nate is everywhere. He's good.
Yeah.

210
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,216
He's still over there?
Yeah. He's got himself
a club now.

211
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,757
Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
MAN: Bangkok.

212
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:49,257
Bangkok? I don't think he's
ever coming home.

213
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,291
Come on.

214
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,591
On the house,
for our boys in uniform.

215
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,632
Thank you, sugar.
That's very kind.

216
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,495
REDTOP: Thank Frank.

217
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,102
Thanks, Frank.

218
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,098
Just relax.

219
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:38,575
You have to boot
this shit a couple of times.

220
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:42,311
The cops keep cutting it,
selling the shit.

221
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,519
I don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,

222
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:50,816
but that shit in Nam is way,

223
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,619
way heavy.

224
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:22,612
Did you ain't seen
the jar, Frank, hmm?

225
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,848
I think you walked
right past it.

226
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:29,559
The money jar, Frank.
What do I gotta do,
put a fucking sign on it?

227
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:30,684
Hmm?

228
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:36,159
Look at this nigger
right here. You know, Frank,

229
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,463
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

230
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,467
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in
Harlem right now.

231
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:43,370
I'm the landlord
and the lease is 20%.

232
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:48,208
Look, don't sell dope then,
Frank. Get a real job.

233
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:51,475
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

234
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,914
Well, you can
come work for me.

235
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:56,020
Okay? You can drive me around,
huh? You can open my doors.

236
00:18:56,121 --> 00:19:01,252
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir",
"Right away, sir", "Anything
you want, Massa Johnson".

237
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,052
Twenty percent.

238
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,833
Twenty percent
is my profit, Tango.

239
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:18,902
If I give you that,
then what do I got left?
Nothing, man.

240
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,443
Twenty percent puts
me out of business,

241
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,410
and every somebody
you know out of business.

242
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:25,875
There's legitimate ways of
doing things, Tango,
and then there's this way.

243
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,179
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

244
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:30,221
Bumpy's fucking dead.

245
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:34,956
My man.

246
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:36,724
Twenty percent?

247
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:47,338
Twenty percent.
Doc, let's go.

248
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,404
<i>Out. Good job. Sit. </i>

249
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,945
<i>A leader, like a shepherd, </i>

250
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:17,084
<i>he sends his fastest
nimble sheep, out front. </i>

251
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,015
And the others will follow.

252
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,556
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

253
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,215
Here, boy!
Here we go. Right here.

254
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,815
Bring it here. Yeah.

255
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,993
Now he's got the stick,
and the cane,
he'll use it!

256
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,461
If he has to.

257
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,900
But most times
he doesn't have to.

258
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:39,769
He moves the whole
herd quietly.

259
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:47,080
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

260
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,840
The middleman.
Buying direct.

261
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,516
Putting Americans
out of work.

262
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:57,486
That's the way
it is now, Frank.

263
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,859

Yeah.

You are not moving
to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.

to do with him, leave him
with you? There's a picture.

Hey, guys! Be cool.

good environment?
And around your friends?

00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,467
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate,
all right?

335
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,045
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna
deal with you at all.

336
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,445
I understand that,
but by then it's gonna
be too late.

337
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,143
It'll be already chopped up.
I wanna go get it where
they go get it from.

338
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,310
I wanna go to the source.

339
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:56,478
So, you're gonna
go get it yourself?

340
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,579
Why not?

341
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,056
Huh? I came this far.

342
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,226
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

343
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,693
I'm in the jungle.
Look around.

344
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,593
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

345
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,393
Nigga, I'm talking
about snakes, all right?

346
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,263
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

347
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:14,066
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

348
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:16,367
You wanna go into the jungle?

349
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,102
We're going.

350
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,409
Fuck it. Let's go.
We're going.

351
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:22,741
Why not?
Let's go.

352
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,317
Hey, Frank.

353
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,987
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

354
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:15,158
General Chiang Kai-shek's
defeated army.

355
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,933
How would you get
it into the States?

356
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,038
You ain't got to
worry about that.

357
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,269
Who do you work
for in there?

358
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,936
You ain't got to worry
about that, either.

359
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,911
Who are you, really?

360
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,610
Frank Lucas,
says it right there
in my passport.

361
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,446
I mean, who you represent?

362
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,577
Me.

363
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,521
You think you're going
to take 100 kilos of
heroin into the US,

364
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:19,620
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going
to allow that?

365
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:20,788
That's right.

366
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,571
After this first purchase,

367
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:33,978
if you are not killed
by Marseille importers,

368
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:36,712
or their people in the States,

369
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:39,150
then what?

370
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,776
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

371
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:48,119
And if it's all the same
to you, I don't wanna have to
drag my ass up here no more.

372
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,818
Of course not.

373
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:53,757
My man.

374
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,566
Soul brother, huh?
Soul brother.

375
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:43,606
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover
them and the pilot and
the boys on the other end.

376
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,816
Give them a hundred.

377
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,652
Fifty is gonna
cover it, Frank.

378
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:51,449
Give them a hundred,
give them the
whole thing. Here.

379
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,852
And look,

380
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:58,127
that's all I got.
So, if that dope don't arrive
for any reason...

381
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:05,492
Hey, listen, cousin or
no cousin, I'm
a busy man, all right?

382
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,835
I ain't got no time
to be going
to nobody's funeral.

383
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,468
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

384
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:13,135
My man.

385
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,590

the shots.

393

You gotta do something.

He pulls a piece on a cop?

459
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,995
I had to do it, man.
Kill or be killed.

460

461
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:08,572

doing in the projects?

462
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,843
Investigating stuff,

A fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth.

That guy didn't pull
a gun on a cop, Jay.

467

That guy pulled a gun
on a junkie,

468
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,033
a junkie who was
trying to rob him.

469

What the fuck you say?

470
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:36,270

What are you doing, man?

What the fuck is that?

472
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:38,874
That's my fucking money, man!

473
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:40,604
I earned this shit.
That's mine!

474
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,373
I earned it doing
good cop work!
What the fuck is this?

475
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,209
good cop work!

476
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:45,907
You murdered a guy!
I earned it getting shot at!

477
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,848
You murdered a guy!

478
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,148
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

479
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:51,722
then you called me
to get you out of it.

480
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:53,721
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

481
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:57,817
I'll tell you the facts, man.
Just write the report
the way I say it happened,

482
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:01,990
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

483
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,528
I can't do that.

484
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:09,304
I'm a leper because
I listened to you and
turned in a million bucks.

485
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,171
No one will work
with me after that.

486
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:16,507
I can get off this shit,
Richie. That's easy.

487
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,715
Just write the report

488

489
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,678

(LAUGHS)

504
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:05,115
Typically, what I see is
25% to 45% pure.

505
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:08,386
I mean, there's
no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutants.

no loans, no nothing.

your proclivities, Richie.
Those I only know too well.

514

I don't do that.
It's not my thing.

from the neighborhood?

518

Do you still hang out
with them?
Yeah.

523
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:56,519
What about him?

524
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:59,357
Richie, I'm just trying
to understand things
your wife has said.

525
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:00,794
If they're not true, tell me.

526
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,456
Yeah, he's one of them.

527
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,864
Is he also your
son's godfather?
Yeah.

528
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:06,898
He's definitely fucking her.

529
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:11,699

Or do you just not
want her to win ever?

an interview room
on the second floor.

00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:45,633
Best I ever seen
on the street.

672
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,267
He knows dope,
but he's together,
all right?

673
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:51,777
He's a stand-up
guy all round.

674
00:50:51,879 --> 00:50:55,371
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

675
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,942
He loves a big ass, man.

676
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,654
He's a bulldog. He don't
fuck around, all right.
He's got a bit of a temper,

677
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:07,158
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your
grandmother.

678
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:09,554
Listen, Richie.
We work together.

679
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:12,155
You want me,
you gotta take them, too.

680
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:25,404
When do we start?

681
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:31,552
The man I worked for,
he had one of the biggest
companies in New York City.

682
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:34,315
He ran it for more
than 50 years.

683
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:38,320
Fifteen years,
eight months and
nine days,

684
00:51:38,426 --> 00:51:40,018
I was with him every day.
I worked for him,

685
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:43,892
I protected him,
I looked after him,
I learned from him.

686
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:47,027
Bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich,
you see?

687
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:48,602
He wasn't wealthy.

688
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:51,035
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did,
but he didn't,

689
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:52,730
he just managed it.

690
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:55,240
The white man owned it,
so they owned him.

691
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,741
Nobody owns me, though.
Hey.

692
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:58,812
How you doing, babe?
Good.

693
00:51:58,913 --> 00:52:01,541
That's 'cause I own
my own company, and
my company sells a product

694
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:04,311
that's better than
the competition,

695
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:07,911
at a price that's lower
than the competition.

696
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,487
Well, what are
we selling here, Frank?

697
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:27,932

698
00:52:28,076 --> 00:52:29,839

North Carolina.

FRANK: So they
can't steal nothing.

or you're nobody.
Be right back.

714
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,468
I need these fresh.
'Cause if I have to come
back here and get you,

715
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:32,595
you know what it is.
FRANK: Tango.

I hear you.

00:53:34,342 --> 00:53:36,310

There won't be no problem.

Frank? You need anything?

Redtop gave you the package.

Oh, you got the jar?
That's right.

Oh! What you gonna do?

No street guys.

We're looking for

Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

No powder under 40 kilograms.

Any less than that,
then somebody else
can waste their time.

00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:33,048
We gonna be handling the
big shipments, the big money

JONES: I heard
a story about you.

743
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:37,253
That you found
a million dollars in
unmarked cash

744
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,156
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?

745
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:43,991
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a
problem with that?

746
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,062
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

747
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:53,140
I should be down in South
Florida with a 68-foot cruiser

00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:05,939

I ever seen in the streets.
It's strong enough to smoke.

are scared of needles.

It's a gift. All right?

837
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:23,265
All you did for Bumpy,
we owe you.

838
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:25,935
Keep your chin up.
All right? Okay?

839
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:27,534
All you have which
is down there. Down.

840
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,078
Chin down.

841
01:01:29,614 --> 01:01:31,673
All right. Doc, will
see you, okay?

842
01:01:34,185 --> 01:01:35,618
<i>You play it so cool</i>

843
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,846
Hey!

844
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:40,318
You still owe me
that dance, right?

845
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:41,790
FRANK: Doc, come on.

846
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,293
Frank, check this.

847
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:56,633
How you doing?
Hi.

848
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:57,730
Frank Lucas.

849
01:01:57,842 --> 01:01:58,831
Eva Kendo.

850
01:01:59,644 --> 01:02:00,736
Nice to meet you, Eva.

851
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:02,779
Nice to meet you,
Frank.

852
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:05,806
You're Frank and
this is your place?

853
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,943
That's right.
I'm Frank and
this is my place.

854
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:11,617
Why is it called
Small's?

855
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,553
Why don't you
call it Frank's?

856
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:18,553
When you own something,
you can call it
what you want.

857
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:19,958
Small's.

858
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:22,862
Or Frank's.
Frankie Small's.

859
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:24,993
Small's Frankie.

860
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:27,937
That's right.

861
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,499
You want to let
my hand go?

862
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,170
Okay.

863
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:35,637
You leaving?

864
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:37,146
No, I was going
to my table.

865
01:02:37,248 --> 01:02:39,716
Okay. Need somebody
to go with you?

866
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:43,046
Yes?
EVA: Mmm-hmm.

867
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:47,648
SPEARMAN: All the cheesies.

868
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:49,488
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

869
01:02:49,594 --> 01:02:50,856
ABRUZZO: Wash your hands?

870
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:52,156
I got one print of that,
don't smudge it.

871
01:02:52,263 --> 01:02:54,026
MAN: Yeah.
There you go.

872
01:02:56,724 --> 01:02:57,486
JONES: Hey, Spearman,
what about him?
Who is that?

873
01:02:57,591 --> 01:02:59,684
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.

874
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:01,317
SPEARMAN: Yeah, yeah. Put him
up there by the big man.

875
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:02,827
JONES: He looks
like your uncle, Abruzzo.

876
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,056
Yeah, but he's not
as handsome.

877
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:06,359
JONES: He looks more
like your sister.
MAN: Where's Ice Pick's mug?

878
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,489
ABRUZZO: Yeah, that's funny.

879
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:08,829
Maybe you guys
should take that show
on the road.

880
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:11,336
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

881
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:12,803
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul?
JONES: Yeah.

882
01:03:12,906 --> 01:03:14,373
SPEARMAN: There you go.
Get him up.

883
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:17,068
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

884
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,612
No, Ice Pick Paul,
he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.

885
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:21,874
How's that even
fucking possible?

886
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:23,347
JONES: That's Benny
the Bishop.

887
01:03:24,918 --> 01:03:28,081
That guy is a soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way that guy's on top.

888
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,985
JONES: You thinking of
Benny the Bishop.

889
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,991
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

890
01:03:33,093 --> 01:03:34,185
SPEARMAN: Jonesy's right.

891
01:03:34,295 --> 01:03:36,422
Hey, which one of you guys
has ever actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

892
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:37,895
Actually seen it go down?

893
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:41,460
Yeah, seen it go down.

894
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,222
Been in his place.
Seen him handle drugs.

895
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,232
That rat, Ricky,
has told us...

896
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:48,667
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

897
01:03:49,805 --> 01:03:50,965
He's dead.

898
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:52,062
SPEARMAN: (LAUGHING)
All right, well,

899
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:53,334
we can take him off
the fucking board.

900
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:57,879
I don't think we got
any solid evidence on
anybody on that board.

901
01:03:58,514 --> 01:03:59,879
What you saying, Richie?

902
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,414
This is weeks and
weeks of work, man.

903
01:04:01,517 --> 01:04:03,178
I'm saying, take it down.

904
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:05,013
We got to start again
from the street.

905
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:20,972
<i>Hi, who's this? </i>

906
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:24,416
<i>Hello? Gabe? 
Yeah, it's Scott. 
Yeah. </i>

907
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,054
<i>Scotty! What's going
down, brother? </i>

908
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:28,520
<i>Those snow tires you
gave me last night. </i>

909
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,055
<i>They come in yet? </i>

910
01:07:30,158 --> 01:07:31,921
<i>Oh, the snow tires? </i>

911
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,891
<i>Yeah. I want some
more of them. </i>

912
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:35,220
<i>Give me one-and-a-half
more. </i>

913
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:36,455
<i>One-and-a-half, </i>

914
01:07:36,565 --> 01:07:38,157
that's a pretty big order.

915
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,960
<i>Yeah, I want the
big whitewalls, </i>

916
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:42,434
<i>they better get at least
100,000 miles. </i>

917
01:07:42,537 --> 01:07:44,471
All right,
I'll tell you what.

918
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,574
You come in here
tomorrow morning

919
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,232
<i>I'm gonna set
you up real nice</i>

920
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,968
<i>with a whitewall special, 
all right? </i>

921
01:07:50,078 --> 01:07:51,045
<i>Thanks, bro. </i>

922
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:52,170
<i>No problem. </i>

923
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:58,178
That's considerably
more than one year's
salary, Richie.

924
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,349
If it disappears,
I will not be able to
get it for you again.

925
01:08:04,975 --> 01:08:05,999
That's yours.

926
01:08:06,243 --> 01:08:10,543
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

927
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,441
It has to be
Blue Magic, right?

928
01:08:15,585 --> 01:08:17,553
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's gonna be Blue.

929
01:08:17,654 --> 01:08:18,712
You can pick it up
here tomorrow.

930
01:08:18,822 --> 01:08:19,914
RICHIE: $20,000.

931
01:08:20,023 --> 01:08:21,923
MECHANIC: Just leave it there.

932
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:37,636
How'd you do?
Good.

933
01:08:39,676 --> 01:08:41,143
RICHIE: Here he comes.

934
01:08:41,278 --> 01:08:42,711
That's him?
Yep.

935

(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

936
01:08:44,014 --> 01:08:45,606
That was quick.

937
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,659
Richie, if he goes
in the city, what
do we fucking do?

938
01:08:58,795 --> 01:09:00,387
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

939
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:01,555
We stay with the money,
all right?

940
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:02,927
We can't go
in the fucking city.

941
01:09:03,033 --> 01:09:04,830
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand
in there, all right,

942
01:09:04,968 --> 01:09:06,902
that I'm responsible for.
I ain't losing it.

943
01:09:07,003 --> 01:09:08,595
SPEARMAN: It's out
of our jurisdiction!

944
01:09:08,705 --> 01:09:11,139
RICHIE: Follow the money!
SPEARMAN: All right,
all right, all right!

945
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:27,150

946
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:29,315
SPEARMAN:
All right, here we go.

947
01:09:29,425 --> 01:09:30,756
RICHIE: Let me out here.

948
01:09:33,095 --> 01:09:34,119
RICHIE:
Don't disappear, all right?

949
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,957
I'll circle the block.

950
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:38,360
DRIVER: Move!

951
01:09:56,018 --> 01:09:59,317
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

I'm commandeering

953
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:13,967

Get out of the car.

954
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,661
Who the fuck cares
about you? This is
New York City, man.

955
01:10:16,772 --> 01:10:17,830
Get someone else's car!

956
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:18,929
Get out of the car.

957
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,373

Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

He's about to do something,
huh? He's going bowling?

962
01:12:40,866 --> 01:12:42,390
Look at that. Strike.

963
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:43,728
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

964
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:45,496

Get up, you fucker.
Get the fuck up!

Hey, I'm Richie Roberts,

973
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:15,260
That's my money.

974
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:18,893
What the fuck?
What money, huh?
What money?

975
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,697
The bills are
sequenced, right?

976
01:13:21,807 --> 01:13:24,970
They're registered with the
Essex County Prosecutor's
Office. Just check them out.

977
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,045
They all start with CF3500.
Have a look.

978
01:13:33,585 --> 01:13:34,711
Fucking registers.

979
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,051
I thought I had a fucking
Chris-Craft sitting
in my driveway.

980
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:41,091
Honest mistake.
I'll just get the money.

981
01:13:42,628 --> 01:13:44,653
This time.
All right.

982
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,594
There it is.
RICHIE: All right. Thank you.

983
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:50,463
When was the last time
I was in Jersey? Let me think.

984
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:53,798
Never.

985
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:57,900
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

986
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,443
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

987
01:14:02,144 --> 01:14:04,408
You got your fucking
money, Richie.

988
01:14:05,448 --> 01:14:09,384
And never, ever
come into this city
again unannounced.

989
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:11,851
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

990
01:14:11,954 --> 01:14:15,082
you call ahead first,
see if it's okay with me.

991
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:18,393

01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:28,928
Is that your car?

995
01:14:29,438 --> 01:14:31,463
That's a fucking
great car.

996
01:14:31,574 --> 01:14:34,099
Have a nice fucking
trip back to Jersey.

997
01:14:34,243 --> 01:14:35,369
RICHIE: All right.

998
01:14:35,478 --> 01:14:37,969
Come on, I got
a tee time.
Let's go.

1000
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:43,713
What were you doin' there?

1001
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:45,514
Well, that's where this
dope is coming from.

1002
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:47,349
Blue Magic, it's coming
out of New York.

01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:49,048
What do you expect
me to do, ignore it?

1004
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:52,423
The cab driver has
filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges

1005
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:53,893
which he may reconsider

1006
01:14:53,996 --> 01:14:57,488
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey
offers to settle.

1007
01:14:58,267 --> 01:15:01,065
I showed him my ID.
I told him I was a cop.

1008
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:04,869
(CHUCKLING)
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

1009
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,305
I was chasing
the 20 grand,
all right?

1010
01:15:08,077 --> 01:15:11,171
Next time, knock him out
before you show
him your badge.

1011
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:16,714
Look, I don't want to
hear about you going
into New York again.

1012
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,018
Well, then this
investigation's over.

1013
01:15:19,188 --> 01:15:20,519
You're not
listening to me.

1014
01:15:20,623 --> 01:15:22,921
I said, "I don't want
to hear about you going
into New York again."

1015
01:15:23,025 --> 01:15:24,287
You do whatever
you have to do.

1016
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,722
You go wherever
you have to go

1017
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:28,388
to figure out
who's bringing this
shit into the country.

1018
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:30,266
Just don't tell me
about it.

1019
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:30,493
Just don't tell me
about it.

1020
01:15:35,371 --> 01:15:36,770
FRANK: There's your girl,
right there.

1021
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:43,444
Hey, how'd you do?
Hi.

1022
01:15:43,546 --> 01:15:45,605
I didn't keep you
waiting long, did I?
No. Fine.

1023
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:48,843
Good. A woman
as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.

1024
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:51,716
For anything.

1025
01:15:56,959 --> 01:15:59,757
Thank you, ma'am.
You as pretty as ever.

1026
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,424
Hey, Doc.

1027
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:06,501
Tommy!

1028
01:16:06,602 --> 01:16:08,866
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

1029
01:16:08,971 --> 01:16:10,302
Sure. Sure do make
father proud.

1030
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:11,838
All right.

1031
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,713
This is your father?

1032
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:27,769
That's Martin Luther King.

1033
01:16:28,774 --> 01:16:30,639
It is not. It is.
It is Martin Luther King.

1034
01:16:30,776 --> 01:16:32,243
You know, "I have a dream"?

1035
01:16:32,345 --> 01:16:33,607
Of course.

1036
01:16:33,713 --> 01:16:35,510
No, that's...

1037
01:16:35,648 --> 01:16:39,140
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

1038
01:16:39,285 --> 01:16:41,150
What did he do?

1039
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:44,279
A lot of things.
He was a friend

1040
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,655
and served New York.
New York served him.

1041
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:49,953
He was my boss.

1042
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,491
My teacher.

1043
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:53,098
What did he teach you?

1044
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:55,530
He taught me a
lot of things. He

1045
01:16:57,737 --> 01:17:00,171
taught me how to take my time.

1046
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:05,300
Taught me that if I was
going to do something,
to do it with care, with love.

1047
01:17:06,212 --> 01:17:07,770
Anything else?

1048
01:17:12,218 --> 01:17:14,345
He taught me
to be a gentleman.

1049
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:15,545
That's what you are?

1050
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:17,849
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

1051
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:21,223
Come here. Sit right here.

1052
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:24,689
Look at me.

1053
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:28,825
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

1054
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:34,262
Homes all over the East Coast,
I could have taken you to
any one of them, but I didn't.

1055
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:35,465
I brought you here.
MRS. LUCAS: Frank,

1056
01:17:35,575 --> 01:17:36,974
I was looking for you, boy.

1057
01:17:37,076 --> 01:17:39,101
Because I wanted you
to meet my mother.

1058
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:40,770
How you doing, Ma?

1059
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,006
Is this her?

1060
01:17:42,114 --> 01:17:43,672
Eva, this is my mother.
EVA: Hi, Eva.

1061
01:17:43,783 --> 01:17:44,943
Oh!

1062
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,416
Nice to meet you.

1063
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:48,146
She's beautiful!
FRANK: Yeah?

1064
01:17:48,254 --> 01:17:53,248
Look at her, Frank.
She's an angel come
down from heaven.

1065
01:17:53,392 --> 01:17:54,984
EVA: Thank you.

1066
01:18:02,702 --> 01:18:06,832
Mr. Roberts? I'm here
for our appointment.

1067
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:12,207
Morning.
Morning.

1068
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,280
Sorry. Our appointment?

1069
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:18,576
Child Social Services.

1070
01:18:19,785 --> 01:18:22,083
<i>(POP MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

1071
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:35,566
She did mention
your name, though.

1072
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:36,828
The stewardess?

1073
01:18:36,936 --> 01:18:38,733
No, not the stewardess.

1074
01:18:39,505 --> 01:18:43,100
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1075
01:18:43,276 --> 01:18:47,235
Right after she asked me
if I associated with
any criminals.

1076
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:48,313
BOY 1: All right, go! Go, go!

1077
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:49,574
BOY 2: Yeah!
You wanna see this?

1078
01:18:49,682 --> 01:18:51,274
RICHIE: Hey, boys.

1079
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:53,180
JOEY: Joey. Hey, Joey!

1080
01:18:53,286 --> 01:18:54,981
Get in the pool. Go on.

1081
01:18:56,188 --> 01:18:57,917
Come on. Come on.

1082
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:03,923
So, how'd she get my name?

1083
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,820
Laurie.
Hmm.

1084
01:19:06,799 --> 01:19:09,131
She's been saying
a lot lately.

1085
01:19:09,969 --> 01:19:11,163
A lot.

1086
01:19:15,007 --> 01:19:17,567
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1087
01:19:17,677 --> 01:19:18,837
I took it very seriously.

1088
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:20,843
I know. I know and
I appreciate that.

1089
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,915
And I said yes,
I would take on
this responsibility.

1090
01:19:24,016 --> 01:19:26,576
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something
happened to you.

1091
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:29,587
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to
Child Social Services

1092
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:32,351
made me look really bad,
all right. You know,

1093
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:36,985
out at all kinds of hours at
night time, lowlife informants
around, women.

1094
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:38,994
Old friends like me.

1095
01:19:39,632 --> 01:19:41,930
Old friends like you, yeah.

1096
01:19:43,235 --> 01:19:45,465
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

1097
01:19:45,705 --> 01:19:47,172
(GIRL WHOOPING)

1098
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,633
Okay, I understand.

1099
01:19:50,743 --> 01:19:54,770
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell them.
I'll lie for you.

1100
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,041
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1101
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,311
Just, omit certain details.

1102
01:20:01,053 --> 01:20:02,714
Sure. All right.

1103
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,116
You know, there's something
else I was gonna ask you.

1104
01:20:07,226 --> 01:20:08,193
Something else.

1105
01:20:08,294 --> 01:20:10,319
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

1106
01:20:12,565 --> 01:20:15,056
Blue Magic. Anything?

1107
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:21,670
Just a lot of sorrow,
misery from guys getting
put out of work, that's all.

1108
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:23,969
What, your guys?

1109
01:20:24,076 --> 01:20:25,134
Just guys.

1110
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:29,644
You thinking about
where it's coming from?

1111
01:20:29,749 --> 01:20:32,411
Guys down south.
That's all I heard.

1112
01:20:33,052 --> 01:20:34,713
Cubans?
I don't know.

1113
01:20:35,855 --> 01:20:37,186
Not Mexico.

1114
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:38,982
I don't know.

1115
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:41,551
You're telling me,
it's coming in from
South America?

1116
01:20:41,694 --> 01:20:43,218
I don't know.

1117
01:20:44,096 --> 01:20:48,760
All I can tell you is whoever
it is, they're upsetting the
natural order of things.

1118
01:20:49,101 --> 01:20:51,194
And that's all there is.

1119
01:21:06,218 --> 01:21:07,242
What's up?

1120
01:21:07,386 --> 01:21:09,217
<i>FRANK ON PHONE: 
My man, how we looking? </i>

1121
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:40,244
Frank, I want you to
meet Mike Sobota.

1122
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:41,976
How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
How are you?

1123
01:22:42,114 --> 01:22:43,103
What can I get you?

1124
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:45,274
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me,
your nephew.

1125
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:48,648
Oh, this is the... Yankees,
yeah. Hey, Steve!
Yankees.

1126
01:22:48,787 --> 01:22:50,220
Steve! Come here.
Excuse me one second.

1127
01:22:50,322 --> 01:22:52,187
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him
on the Yankees.

1128
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:53,349
'Cause you good enough,
ain't you?

1129
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:55,586
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on
a bad day, Jack.

1130
01:22:55,694 --> 01:22:57,457
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,

1131
01:22:57,596 --> 01:22:58,995
make it a good day,
you understand?

1132
01:22:59,098 --> 01:23:03,432
NYPD, excuse me,
Police Department.
Back up, baby.

1133
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:06,562
Whoa!
DETECTIVE: Hey! Hey! Hey!

1134
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:08,435
Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
Uh-uh.

1135
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:10,736
Taking your ass in.
Where are the handcuffs?

1136
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:12,834
I got a license for
that, motherfucker.

1137
01:23:12,978 --> 01:23:16,106
You got a license for this?
Excuse me, all right?

1138
01:23:18,217 --> 01:23:20,242
Shit. All right! Yeah!

1139
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:22,146
Now, you know what?
I gotta arrest you
for that shit.

1140
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:23,448
That shit's too good
to be on the street.

1141
01:23:23,556 --> 01:23:27,322
Wait a minute, I got this
for you. You ain't got
to arrest nobody.

1142
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:29,120
Are you bribing me now?

1143
01:23:29,228 --> 01:23:31,822
I'll tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody!

1144
01:23:31,964 --> 01:23:33,761
Now, all you're
under arrest! You first!

1145
01:23:33,866 --> 01:23:35,424
That's my family.
That's my...

1146
01:23:35,534 --> 01:23:36,592
Excuse me, excuse me.

1147
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:40,799
Back it up, baby.

1148
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:41,964
What was that?

1149
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,769
Come on, guys.
What's the matter
with you, man?

1150
01:23:43,876 --> 01:23:45,434
I said, what the
hell was that?
What was what?

1151
01:23:45,544 --> 01:23:47,136
I said what the hell
are you doing, man?
Be cool, man!

1152
01:23:47,246 --> 01:23:48,440
What's your fucking problem?

1153
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:50,276
What the hell's
wrong with you?

1154
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:52,179
DETECTIVE: Goddamn!

1155
01:23:52,985 --> 01:23:55,476
He's all right.
I just shot him in
the leg, is all.

1156
01:23:55,588 --> 01:23:57,385
DETECTIVE: Damn, Jimmy!

1157
01:23:58,257 --> 01:23:59,451
Get up.

1158
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:16,005
All right, everybody,
get out! Get out!

1159
01:24:17,076 --> 01:24:18,566
HUEY: Come on, Frank,
it was an accident.

1160
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:20,372
FRANK: It wasn't no
goddamn accident.
He feels terrible.

1161
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:23,879
He don't feel shit, 'cause
he's coked up all
the motherfucking time!

1162
01:24:24,016 --> 01:24:26,007
He's your driver.
Get rid of him.

1163
01:24:26,118 --> 01:24:27,085
Come on, man,
that's your cousin!

1164
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:28,175
That ain't shit to me!

1165
01:24:28,287 --> 01:24:29,311
He don't mean nothing to me.

1166
01:24:29,421 --> 01:24:30,353
What's he gonna do,
go back home?

1167
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:31,980
I don't give a damn
what he does!

1192
01:26:01,613 --> 01:26:04,104
Of course. Excuse me.

1193
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:08,285
Thank you for a wonderful
lunch. It was delicious.

1194
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:14,251
What do you think
of monopolies?

1195
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:16,821
You mean like the game?

1196
01:26:16,962 --> 01:26:20,591
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in
the country, Frank,

1197
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:22,929
'cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1198
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:26,027
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1199
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:28,765
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1200
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:30,865
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1201
01:26:31,009 --> 01:26:32,476
Just trying to make a living.

1202
01:26:32,578 --> 01:26:34,273
That's your right, I mean,

1203
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,142
it's everyone's right.
It's America.

1204
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:41,680
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable
expense of others.

1205
01:26:42,054 --> 01:26:44,147
'Cause then it becomes
un-American.

1206
01:26:44,256 --> 01:26:46,190
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1207
01:26:46,358 --> 01:26:48,121
could never represent
the true cost of production

1208
01:26:48,227 --> 01:26:52,721
'cause it's got to be
controlled. It's gotta be set.
It's gotta be fair.

1209
01:26:52,831 --> 01:26:55,322
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that
I think is fair.

1210
01:26:55,434 --> 01:26:56,731
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1211
01:26:56,835 --> 01:26:58,302
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1212
01:26:58,403 --> 01:27:00,371
I mean, I know
your customers
are happy, Frank,

junkies that they are.

1214
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:07,836
But we fellow dairy farmers
out here, Frank,
are you thinking of us?

1215
01:27:08,547 --> 01:27:10,071
You thinking of them?

1216
01:27:10,415 --> 01:27:12,076
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1217
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:17,318
I'm thinking of them, Dominic,
about as much as they've
ever thought about me.

1218
01:27:17,422 --> 01:27:19,754
I'm just thinking
out loud now.

1219
01:27:20,259 --> 01:27:22,750
If you took some
of your inventory, Frank,

1220
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:25,393
and you sold it wholesale...

1221
01:27:26,598 --> 01:27:27,792
Sit.

1222
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:32,159
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1223
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:34,600
I don't know.
I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1224
01:27:34,706 --> 01:27:38,642
You know, I got 110th,
155th, river to river.
I'm all right.

1225
01:27:38,744 --> 01:27:41,679
That's kind of a mom
and pop store next to
what I'm talking about.

1226
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,407
I mean, let's go at
least bigger than Kmart.

1227
01:27:43,515 --> 01:27:48,418
I'm talking about LA,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.
Let's go nationwide, huh?

1228
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:53,256
I'm gonna guarantee you
your peace of mind here.
You don't want that?

1229
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,369
You're going to need it.

1230
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,637
I don't know how
you view me, you know.

1231
01:27:58,745 --> 01:28:00,576
I'm kind of a
Renaissance man, Frank.

1232
01:28:00,714 --> 01:28:02,705
You know,
the people I deal with
on a daily basis,

1233
01:28:02,849 --> 01:28:04,646
you know, they're not
enlightened, Frank.

1234
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:07,515
You talk to them
about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

1235
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,644
They're not open to change.

1236
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:12,914
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1237
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:16,392
I talk to them,
there's just no
misunderstandings.

1238
01:28:17,764 --> 01:28:20,756
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

$75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

these people? And the

1243

it's Christmas
and I'm Santa Claus.

1244

like we're the help.

01:34:08,848 --> 01:34:11,316
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Can I get a shot here, Frank?
Right here.

1328
01:34:11,417 --> 01:34:12,850
PHOTOGRAPHER 2:
Looking good, Frank.

1329
01:34:13,686 --> 01:34:14,675
WOMAN: Beautiful.

1330
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:18,088
MAN: Right on, Frank!

1331
01:34:18,191 --> 01:34:19,886
WOMAN: Congratulations!

1332
01:34:25,798 --> 01:34:27,663
She's the most beautiful
bride I've ever seen.

1333
01:34:27,767 --> 01:34:30,031
That's my sunshine
right there, Mr. Williams.

1334
01:34:30,136 --> 01:34:31,364
I wish Bumpy had met her.

1335
01:34:31,471 --> 01:34:32,495
WOMAN: Throw it to me!

1336
01:34:37,877 --> 01:34:39,367
Get a picture.

1337
01:34:49,222 --> 01:34:50,849
Come here, baby.

1338
01:35:15,581 --> 01:35:18,243
What's happening?
FRANK: Sit tight.

1339
01:35:19,418 --> 01:35:21,613
Congratulations, Frank.

1340
01:35:21,754 --> 01:35:22,914
Detective.

1341
01:35:23,022 --> 01:35:26,287
So, you sure you done
the right thing? I mean, she's
beautiful girl and all...

1342
01:35:26,526 --> 01:35:28,653
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1343
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:31,654
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

1344
01:35:31,797 --> 01:35:34,288
understand this is
the most important day
of my life, Detective.

1345
01:35:34,433 --> 01:35:35,923
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

1346
01:35:36,035 --> 01:35:38,469
You know, a man who
walks around in a
$50,000 chinchilla coat

1347
01:35:38,604 --> 01:35:40,799
and never even bought
me a cup of coffee.

1348
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:44,103
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

1349
01:35:45,511 --> 01:35:46,603
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1350
01:35:46,712 --> 01:35:47,736
Do you pay your bills,
I asked you?

1351
01:35:47,847 --> 01:35:49,075
If you're not getting
your share,

1352
01:35:49,182 --> 01:35:50,547
maybe you need
to talk to the
Chief of Police.

1353
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:53,915
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even
fucking know me.

1354
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:56,082
Maybe I'm special.

1355
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:58,020
You are special.

1356
01:35:58,157 --> 01:35:59,784
TRUPO: You see
that right there?

1357
01:35:59,892 --> 01:36:02,156
Special Investigations Unit.

1358
01:36:03,396 --> 01:36:04,658
Special.

1359
01:36:05,531 --> 01:36:06,759
Get it?

1360
01:36:07,567 --> 01:36:10,001
Ten grand.
First of each month.

1361
01:36:10,469 --> 01:36:12,494
Deliver it right here.

1362
01:36:12,638 --> 01:36:15,129
Are you done?
Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1363
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:21,272
TRUPO: Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1364
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,007
FRANK: Let's go.

1365
01:37:22,308 --> 01:37:23,775
<i>RICHIE: 
His name is Frank Lucas. </i>

1366
01:37:23,876 --> 01:37:26,538
<i>Originally from Greensboro, 
North Carolina. </i>

1367
01:37:26,979 --> 01:37:31,882
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and
unlicensed firearm.

1368
01:37:32,551 --> 01:37:36,920
For 15 years, he was
Bumpy Johnson's driver,
bodyguard and collector.

1369
01:37:38,557 --> 01:37:40,286
He was with him when he died.

1370
01:37:40,426 --> 01:37:45,261
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest.
And a lot of cousins.

1371
01:37:46,499 --> 01:37:50,265
They all living up here now,
spread throughout the
five boroughs and Jersey.

1372
01:37:50,503 --> 01:37:52,733
The brothers are Dexter,

1373
01:37:52,838 --> 01:37:55,033
<i>in Brooklyn. 
He's a dry cleaner. 
What can I do for you?</i>

1374
01:37:55,141 --> 01:37:57,803
<i>I'm picking up.
MAN: Yeah. </i>

1375
01:37:57,943 --> 01:37:59,968
<i>RICHIE: Melvin in Queens
has got a custom furniture</i>

1376
01:38:00,112 --> 01:38:01,909
<i>and fire doors business. </i>

1377
01:38:03,349 --> 01:38:04,475
That's it right here?
Right there.

1378
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:07,814
<i>RICHIE: Terrence in Newark, 
he has a hardware store. </i>

1379
01:38:08,754 --> 01:38:11,314
<i>Turner in the Bronx
has got a tire shop. </i>

1380
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:15,756
<i>And Huey Lucas in
Bergen County has a body shop. </i>

1381
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:17,624
Is your manager here?
That's my price.

1382
01:38:17,763 --> 01:38:19,321
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?

1383
01:38:19,465 --> 01:38:22,559
<i>These businesses are
the distribution and
collection points</i>

1384
01:38:22,668 --> 01:38:25,228
<i>for Frank's dope
and Frank's money. </i>

1385
01:38:25,805 --> 01:38:28,330
Everything about
Frank's life seems

1386
01:38:28,474 --> 01:38:31,068
unpretentious,
orderly and legitimate.

1387
01:38:32,011 --> 01:38:33,979
<i>He starts early, 
gets up at 5:00 a.m. </i>

1388
01:38:34,613 --> 01:38:38,413
<i>Has breakfast in a diner
in Harlem every morning, 
usually by himself. </i>

1389
01:38:38,517 --> 01:38:43,113
<i>Then he starts work. 
Takes a meeting with the
accountant or with his lawyer. </i>

1390
01:38:43,222 --> 01:38:46,453
<i>At nights, he usually
stays at home. And
if he does go out, </i>

1391
01:38:46,559 --> 01:38:50,586
<i>it's to one of two clubs
or a handful of restaurants
with his new wife. </i>

1392
01:38:50,696 --> 01:38:52,527
<i>Some ball players. 
That's fucking
Wilt Chamberlain.</i>

1393
01:38:52,665 --> 01:38:56,965
<i>RICHIE: Friends, musicians. 
Never, never with
organized crime guys. </i>

1394
01:38:57,069 --> 01:38:59,833
<i>Sundays, he takes
his mother to church. </i>

1395
01:39:00,373 --> 01:39:01,863
<i>Then he drives out
and he changes</i>

1396
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:06,000
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

1397
01:39:06,879 --> 01:39:09,677
<i>TOBACK: Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, 
Richie. </i>

1398
01:39:09,815 --> 01:39:10,873
<i>RICHIE: No. </i>

1399
01:39:11,016 --> 01:39:14,816
<i>Bumpy Johnson's life
wasn't typical either, and
he ran Harlem for years. </i>

1400
01:39:14,954 --> 01:39:18,481
<i>TOBACK: So you're saying
that Frank Lucas replaced
Bumpy Johnson? </i>

1401
01:39:18,624 --> 01:39:19,989
<i>RICHIE: Yeah. 
TOBACK: His driver? </i>

1402
01:39:20,126 --> 01:39:22,651
<i>TOBACK: Sounds RICHIE: Yeah. 
a little farfetched. </i>

1403
01:39:22,795 --> 01:39:25,320
<i>RICHIE: But is it? Is it? 
Because everything he does... </i>

1404
01:39:25,464 --> 01:39:27,159
JONES: He's handing
out turkeys, man.

1405
01:39:27,299 --> 01:39:29,096
<i>RICHIE: he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right? </i>

1406
01:39:29,201 --> 01:39:32,295
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1407
01:39:32,405 --> 01:39:34,464
The guy he sees every day.

1408
01:39:34,573 --> 01:39:36,871
<i>It's like a Sicilian family. </i>

1409
01:39:37,009 --> 01:39:41,070
He's structured his
organization to protect him
in the same way.

1410
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,579
And if he was with Bumpy
for so long,

1411
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:45,275
that means he would have
spent a lot of time
with Italians.

1412
01:39:45,384 --> 01:39:48,182
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

1413
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,721
But here's the thing.
I don't think it's Frank Lucas
that we're after.

1414
01:39:52,725 --> 01:39:54,215
Who we want is whoever
Frank Lucas is working for.

1415
01:39:56,977 --> 01:39:57,568
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1416
01:39:57,678 --> 01:40:00,670
Okay. So what do
you have on him

1417
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:04,247
that will stick in court?
Because this isn't it.

1418
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:09,553
Without powder,
without informants,
no one's going to jail.

1419
01:40:10,057 --> 01:40:11,217
RICHIE:
That's understood, sir.

1420
01:40:11,325 --> 01:40:14,726
And I don't think we're
gonna get informants,
not from inside the family,

1421
01:40:14,829 --> 01:40:17,593
you know, unless we
get very, very lucky.

1422
01:40:21,402 --> 01:40:23,700
Straight up lab
tests suggesting

1423
01:40:23,871 --> 01:40:26,203
purity's consistent
with Asian dope.

1424
01:40:27,208 --> 01:40:30,268
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other
Europeans

1425
01:40:30,377 --> 01:40:32,311
or with the Turks.

1426
01:40:33,147 --> 01:40:35,672
We got small blue
packets turning up

1427
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:38,410
in neighborhoods all
over the Tri-State area.

1428
01:40:38,853 --> 01:40:41,253
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights,

1429
01:40:41,355 --> 01:40:43,516
Richmond Avenue
and Staten Island.

1430
01:40:43,624 --> 01:40:46,422
They got North Orange,
Princeton, Bayonne,
Newark,

1431
01:40:47,428 --> 01:40:51,057
Syracuse, Rochester,
Buffalo, and all the
way through Connecticut.

1432
01:40:51,165 --> 01:40:53,065
The same dope.

1433
01:40:56,403 --> 01:40:57,734
All right.

1434
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:03,144
That's it, down there.

1435
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,828
<i>MAN ON TV: And it's
Three Counts as they round
the turn for home now. </i>

1436
01:41:47,826 --> 01:41:50,021
Okay, let's all join hands.

1437
01:41:54,366 --> 01:41:57,062
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

1438
01:41:57,169 --> 01:41:59,103
the nourishments
of our bodies.

1439
01:41:59,204 --> 01:42:03,607
Feed our souls with heavenly
grace, in Jesus' name
and for His sake.

1440
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,805
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

1441
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:26,157
MAN: Shh. Shh.

1442
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:29,359
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Come on, now.

1443
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:31,995
It's okay. Shh.

1444
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:34,899
You better get
yourself ready, old man.

1445
01:42:35,007 --> 01:42:37,066
Come on, big man.
Throw the ball.

1446
01:42:37,209 --> 01:42:39,541
Get yourself ready,
old man. All right!

1447
01:42:39,878 --> 01:42:42,676
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you.
Come on!

1448
01:42:42,781 --> 01:42:45,306
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1449
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:47,977
MELVIN: Hey! Watch your mouth,
boy. Throw the ball!

1450
01:42:48,087 --> 01:42:50,920
STEVIE: Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher,
not an outfielder!

1451
01:42:51,056 --> 01:42:53,081
Steve. Steve, come here.

1452
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,484
Come, sit down.

1453
01:42:55,594 --> 01:42:57,687
Uncle Frank.
What's happening?

1454
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,995
How you doing?

1455
01:43:00,099 --> 01:43:01,088
Cool.

1456
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:02,530
You want a drink?

1457
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:04,158
You know better than that.

1458
01:43:04,269 --> 01:43:05,566
Just checking.

1459
01:43:08,107 --> 01:43:11,338
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

1460
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:15,205
I set it up with the
Yankees and Billy Martin.

1461
01:43:17,116 --> 01:43:19,084
Why didn't you show up?

1462
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:23,114
Don't lie to me.

1463
01:43:23,722 --> 01:43:26,213
I don't want to
play ball no more.

1464
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:27,884
I decided.
What you talking about?

1465
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:29,858
You decided? Decided what?

1466
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:31,287
(STAMMERING)
That ain't what I want.

1467
01:43:31,396 --> 01:43:33,796
What you talking about?
You've been playing since
you was a little boy.

1468
01:43:33,932 --> 01:43:35,263
You were ready to go
into the pros. What you...

1469
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,698
Frank! We got a problem, man.

1470
01:43:41,073 --> 01:43:42,734
What do you want?

1471
01:43:44,243 --> 01:43:46,734
I want what you got,
Uncle Frank.

1472
01:43:46,845 --> 01:43:48,540
I want to be you.

1473
01:44:08,026 --> 01:44:09,687
He's been diluting
it so much.

1474
01:44:09,795 --> 01:44:11,456
We're down
2%, 3% pure.

1475
01:44:11,563 --> 01:44:14,054
And you tested it?
You're sure?

1476
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:15,133
Yeah.

1477
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:21,227
Fuck you looking at?

1478
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:15,175
My man.

1479
01:45:15,683 --> 01:45:17,548
Welcome, Frank.
How you doing, Nick?

1480
01:45:20,209 --> 01:45:21,938
How you doing, Nick?
It's all great. Welcome.

1481
01:45:22,178 --> 01:45:24,203
I need to talk to you.
Great. Come on.

1482
01:45:24,313 --> 01:45:26,577
Hey, you all, everybody
get out! Let's go.

1483
01:45:26,749 --> 01:45:27,773
Come on! Hurry up!

1484
01:45:30,553 --> 01:45:32,919
Sit, my brother.

1485
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,585
I take it you
talked to Charlie.

1486
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,160
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

1487
01:45:40,263 --> 01:45:41,787
Let me explain to you...
No, no, no.

1488
01:45:41,898 --> 01:45:43,297
I'm all right.

1489
01:45:43,466 --> 01:45:44,831
That's not what I
came here for, Nick.

1490
01:45:46,202 --> 01:45:47,669
Yeah, everybody's
good, Nick.

1491
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:50,796
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

1492
01:45:50,907 --> 01:45:52,966
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy
except you.

1493
01:45:53,076 --> 01:45:54,270
I'm happy, Frank.

1494
01:45:54,444 --> 01:45:55,638
You happy? Really?

1495
01:45:55,745 --> 01:45:57,372
Well, maybe I'm the
one with the problem.

1496
01:45:57,547 --> 01:45:59,208
Yeah, go on. Get one.

1497
01:45:59,315 --> 01:46:00,373
All right.

1498
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:01,739
I gotta problem 'cause

1499
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:04,012
I don't understand
why you gotta take

1500
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,213
something that's
perfectly good

1501
01:46:06,322 --> 01:46:08,017
and mess it up.

1502
01:46:08,257 --> 01:46:09,383
See, brand names.

1503
01:46:09,492 --> 01:46:10,584
Brand names mean something.
Understand?

1504
01:46:11,861 --> 01:46:13,522
Shut the fuck up!

1505
01:46:14,497 --> 01:46:16,055
Go ahead, Frank.

1506
01:46:16,165 --> 01:46:17,632
I'm sorry about
that bullshit.

1507
01:46:17,767 --> 01:46:19,132
Blue Magic.

1508
01:46:19,802 --> 01:46:21,429
That's a brand name.

1509
01:46:21,604 --> 01:46:23,299
Like Pepsi,
that's a brand name.

1510
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:26,135
I stand behind it.
I guarantee it.

1511
01:46:26,275 --> 01:46:28,402
They know that,
even if they don't
know me any more than

1512
01:46:28,511 --> 01:46:31,071
they know the chairman
of General Mills.

1513
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:32,477
What the fuck are you
talking about, Frank?

1514
01:46:32,582 --> 01:46:35,415
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

1515
01:46:35,518 --> 01:46:37,748
to one, two, three,
four, five percent

1516
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,184
and then you
call it Blue Magic,

1517
01:46:40,289 --> 01:46:41,779
that is
trademark infringement.

1518
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:43,448
You understand
what I'm saying?

1519
01:46:43,559 --> 01:46:46,050
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1520
01:46:46,162 --> 01:46:47,424
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.

1521
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,760
If I buy a car, and I
wanna paint it, I can
paint the motherfucker.

1522
01:46:49,866 --> 01:46:50,992
Yeah, but you
don't have to.

1523
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:52,590
This is what I'm
saying to you, Nick,
you don't have to.

1524
01:46:52,702 --> 01:46:54,135
Good enough the way it is.

1525
01:46:54,237 --> 01:46:55,636
You can make
enough money off it

1526
01:46:55,738 --> 01:46:57,035
the way it is, just by
calling it Blue Magic.

1527
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,971
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1528
01:46:59,075 --> 01:47:00,975
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change
the name on it?

1529
01:47:01,077 --> 01:47:03,068
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1530
01:47:03,179 --> 01:47:05,079
Fine by me, Frank.
I'll call it Red Magic,

1531
01:47:05,181 --> 01:47:07,046
even though that
don't sound as good.

1532
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:08,549
I don't give a fuck
what you call it.

1533
01:47:08,651 --> 01:47:10,016
Put a chokehold
on the motherfucker

1534
01:47:10,119 --> 01:47:12,747
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1535
01:47:12,855 --> 01:47:17,087
I don't care, just
don't let me catch
you doing this again.

1536
01:47:17,193 --> 01:47:19,855
Catch me?
Infringement?
Insist?

1537
01:47:19,962 --> 01:47:21,759
I don't like these
words as much as,

1538
01:47:21,864 --> 01:47:24,594
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother
you, Nicky."

1539
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,827
These are better
words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1540
01:47:26,936 --> 01:47:29,496
without an invitation!
You hear me?

1541
01:47:30,506 --> 01:47:31,734
My man.

1542
01:47:40,349 --> 01:47:42,544
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that
the cops there, man?

1543
01:47:52,686 --> 01:47:54,278
It's all right.

1544
01:47:55,389 --> 01:47:57,880
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1545
01:47:58,392 --> 01:48:00,656
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1546
01:48:02,563 --> 01:48:03,552
What?

1547
01:48:03,697 --> 01:48:05,824
Some of it's in the trunk.

1548
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:09,298
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing,
Detective?

1549
01:48:09,403 --> 01:48:10,893
How was your Thanksgiving?

1550
01:48:11,038 --> 01:48:13,302
Not so good, as a matter
of fact. Why don't you
get out of the car?

1551
01:48:18,946 --> 01:48:20,004
Come on, give me
the fucking keys.

1552
01:48:20,114 --> 01:48:21,979
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone?

1553
01:48:22,082 --> 01:48:23,845
The Shelby's gone, Frank.
Stay right there.

1554
01:48:23,951 --> 01:48:25,851
Yes, sir. Right here.

1555
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,512
TRUPO: You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1556
01:48:28,622 --> 01:48:30,351
RICHIE: Hey, that's
that Trupo guy.

1557
01:48:30,457 --> 01:48:32,049
SPEARMAN: Is that him?
RICHIE: Yeah.

1558
01:48:32,192 --> 01:48:33,682
Fucking prick.

1559
01:48:34,895 --> 01:48:36,726
(EXCLAIMING)

1560
01:48:36,864 --> 01:48:39,264
Come over here a minute,
Frank.
Yeah.

1561
01:48:41,535 --> 01:48:42,593
What are we gonna
do about this?

1562
01:48:42,736 --> 01:48:45,102
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw
it back in the trunk,

1563
01:48:45,239 --> 01:48:47,833
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie,
warm apple cider.

1564
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:49,738
I got a better idea.

1565
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:54,244
Or would you rather me
throw you and your brother
in the fucking river?

1566
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:57,043
Would you rather your
house blows up next time?

1567
01:49:01,622 --> 01:49:03,749
I loved that car.
I know.

1568
01:49:07,227 --> 01:49:10,287
RICHIE: What's he doing?
Shakedown!

1569
01:49:10,998 --> 01:49:13,125
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1570
01:49:13,267 --> 01:49:14,256
SPEARMAN: Look at that shit.

1571
01:49:14,968 --> 01:49:16,265
Sorry, Frank.

1572
01:49:16,403 --> 01:49:18,633
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

1573
01:49:42,029 --> 01:49:44,793
RICHIE: All right,
you call me back.

1574
01:49:48,806 --> 01:49:49,864
INS, IRS, FBI.

1575
01:49:49,941 --> 01:49:50,703
I can't get a damn thing
out of any of them.

1576
01:49:50,775 --> 01:49:52,140
Because they all think
you're on the take.

1577
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:54,972
And you think they are.

1578
01:49:55,079 --> 01:49:58,014
You know,
I don't think they
want this to stop.

1579
01:49:58,116 --> 01:49:59,708
I think it employs
too many people.

1580
01:50:02,487 --> 01:50:03,579
Judges, lawyers,
cops, politicians,

1581
01:50:03,755 --> 01:50:06,724
prison guards,
probation officers.

1582
01:50:07,425 --> 01:50:08,392
They stop bringing
dope into this country,

1583
01:50:08,493 --> 01:50:11,189
about 100,000 people
are going to be
out of a job.

1584
01:50:14,565 --> 01:50:17,534
Spearman.

1585
01:50:17,635 --> 01:50:21,002
FBI. Here to see
Detective Roberts.

1586
01:50:25,643 --> 01:50:29,306
So who took it out?
Somebody I know?
My wife?

1587
01:50:30,681 --> 01:50:32,342
Come on, if somebody's
taking a contract

1588
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,077
out on my life,
I'd like to know.

1589
01:50:34,185 --> 01:50:37,780
I can't say without
compromising our source.
You understand?

1590
01:50:37,889 --> 01:50:40,289
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1591
01:50:40,391 --> 01:50:41,881
If you want we can
assign someone to you.

1592
01:50:42,059 --> 01:50:43,617
FBI protection.

1593
01:50:44,529 --> 01:50:47,930
You know what?
My life is dangerous
enough as it is.

1594
01:50:49,267 --> 01:50:51,098
Well, we'll let you get
back to your business.

1595
01:50:51,202 --> 01:50:53,295
Okay. Larry, Bob.

1596
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:55,632
Thanks for visiting
The Garden State.

1597
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,866
Take care.

1598
01:50:56,974 --> 01:50:59,306
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1599
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:02,811
We know that you keep
calling about him.

1600
01:51:12,523 --> 01:51:17,017
<i>We believe that
peace is at hand. </i>

1601
01:51:19,096 --> 01:51:23,533
<i>We believe that
an agreement is
within sight. </i>

1602
01:51:26,304 --> 01:51:29,467
<i>As I said earlier... </i>

1603
01:51:33,978 --> 01:51:34,945
Yeah.

1604
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:38,114
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1605
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:42,884
All right.
Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1606
01:52:02,807 --> 01:52:03,705
RICHIE: What the fuck
is a microwave?

1607
01:52:03,841 --> 01:52:07,174
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1608
01:52:07,312 --> 01:52:09,143
Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah.

1609
01:52:09,247 --> 01:52:11,374
It rearranges the molecules.

1610
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,882
RICHIE: Of what?
JOEY: Of what? Of popcorn.

1611
01:52:17,055 --> 01:52:19,615
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.

1612
01:52:22,827 --> 01:52:24,852
I can get you one of those.

1613
01:52:24,996 --> 01:52:28,295
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1614
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,190
No, thank you.

1615
01:52:39,911 --> 01:52:41,936
Hey. Where is that?

1616
01:52:42,046 --> 01:52:43,877
Aspen. We just got back.

1617
01:52:44,582 --> 01:52:46,243
Had a great time.
You know who we met?

1618
01:52:46,351 --> 01:52:47,648
Who?

1619
01:52:48,353 --> 01:52:49,843
Burt Reynolds.

1620
01:52:50,254 --> 01:52:53,314
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1621
01:52:54,092 --> 01:52:58,028
A lot people from Hollywood
go up there now. They're
buying up everything.

1622
01:52:58,129 --> 01:52:59,756
This is your place?
Mmm.

1623
01:52:59,897 --> 01:53:03,731
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out.
Five bedrooms.

1624
01:53:03,868 --> 01:53:06,564
Sauna. Everything.
We were guests.

1625
01:53:11,709 --> 01:53:13,336
It's your place.

1626
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:30,950
Isn't there
something we can do,

1627
01:53:32,797 --> 01:53:35,357
about leaving
the big guy alone?

1628
01:53:35,767 --> 01:53:37,701
You know who I mean.

1629
01:53:37,802 --> 01:53:41,363
I don't report what
you just said, I can
get in a lot of trouble.

1630
01:53:41,472 --> 01:53:44,441
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1631
01:53:46,477 --> 01:53:48,775
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1632
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:52,139
Richie, come on.
I'm not taping it.

1633
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:55,116
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1634
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:57,887
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1635
01:53:57,989 --> 01:53:59,889
From who? Your uncle?

1636
01:54:03,594 --> 01:54:06,085
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk
our friendship?

1637
01:54:06,197 --> 01:54:07,562
Because

1638
01:54:09,834 --> 01:54:12,132
I care what happens to you.

1639
01:54:14,205 --> 01:54:16,070
You shouldn't have done this.

1640
01:54:16,174 --> 01:54:19,234
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1641
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:23,911
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1642
01:54:25,616 --> 01:54:27,049
Frank Lucas?

1643
01:54:28,286 --> 01:54:29,412
Yeah.

1644
01:54:32,089 --> 01:54:34,956
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.

1645
01:54:35,793 --> 01:54:37,260
Tell her why.

1646
01:55:20,171 --> 01:55:21,638
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot!

1647
01:55:21,739 --> 01:55:24,037
Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?

1648
01:55:24,976 --> 01:55:26,807
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1649
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:42,548
WOMAN: All right.

1650
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:47,553
(WHISPERING) Laurie.

1651
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:53,397
Look, I'm sorry I never
gave you the kind of life
you wanted, all right.

1652
01:55:53,538 --> 01:55:55,836
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1653
01:55:58,943 --> 01:56:01,571
Don't punish me
for being honest.

1654
01:56:01,712 --> 01:56:03,680
Don't take my boy away.

1655
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:09,383
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1656
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,683
and you didn't take money
like every other cop,
I left you?

1657
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:15,315
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1658
01:56:15,426 --> 01:56:18,224
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1659
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:20,720
And that's worse
than taking money nobody
gives a shit about.

1660
01:56:20,865 --> 01:56:23,834
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1661
01:56:24,235 --> 01:56:27,693
You know,
I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1662
01:56:27,805 --> 01:56:30,501
Or don't take it.
I don't care. But then
don't go cheat on me.

1663
01:56:30,608 --> 01:56:33,702
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.
Don't go out and get laid

1664
01:56:33,811 --> 01:56:36,746
by your snitches
and your secretaries
and strippers!

1665
01:56:36,881 --> 01:56:39,611
I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.

1666
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:40,739
You...

1667
01:56:41,052 --> 01:56:45,352
You think you're going
to heaven because
you're honest, but you're not.

1668
01:56:45,756 --> 01:56:48,350
You're going to the same
hell as the crooked cops
you can't stand.

1669
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:51,185
BAILIFF: All rise.

1670
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,591
JUDGE: Please be seated.

1671
01:56:58,769 --> 01:57:00,464
Miss Dickerson,

1672
01:57:00,605 --> 01:57:03,096
before the court
renders its opinion,

1673
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,902
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1674
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:07,739
Yes, Your Honor.

1675
01:57:07,845 --> 01:57:10,973
Your Honor, a lot has
been said here today
about how unsavory

1676
01:57:11,115 --> 01:57:15,074
Mr. Roberts' environment
is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1677
01:57:15,186 --> 01:57:18,952
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that
responsibility,

1678
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:21,615
but then say, "Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.

1679
01:57:21,759 --> 01:57:23,283
"We don't think
you're fit for that."

1680
01:57:23,394 --> 01:57:24,986
I'm not.

1681
01:57:25,796 --> 01:57:27,263
You're right.

1682
01:57:28,466 --> 01:57:30,900
Being around me
is no place for a kid.

1683
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:34,233
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1684
01:57:37,174 --> 01:57:40,803
Your Honor, I want
to apologize for wasting
the court's time.

1685
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:54,385
FRANK: Doc.

1686
01:57:54,492 --> 01:57:55,891
I see them.

1687
01:57:55,993 --> 01:57:57,483
DETECTIVE: There he is.

1688
01:58:16,013 --> 01:58:17,640
The fuck is this guy doing?

1689
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:19,747
DOC: Hey!
Champagne.

1690
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:22,045
DOC: Merry Christmas,
Detectives.
For us?

1691
01:58:22,153 --> 01:58:23,984
DOC: Yeah. Enjoy that.

1692
01:58:24,355 --> 01:58:26,687
You fellas have a good time.
Mmm-hmm.

1693
01:58:28,092 --> 01:58:29,650
It's Cristal.

1694

<i>MAN ON TV: South Vietnamese
troops called in air strikes</i>

1695

<i>on Communist positions

1696
01:58:40,337 --> 01:58:43,033
Paying off Johnny Law,
that's one thing.

1697
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:44,732
There ain't no problem
with that.

1698
01:58:44,842 --> 01:58:47,538
I've been paying off
the police since I
was 10 years old.

1699
01:58:47,645 --> 01:58:50,307
Put more of their kids
through college than
the National Merit Award.

1700
01:58:50,448 --> 01:58:52,211
Give me one of
them round one... Yeah.

1701
01:58:52,316 --> 01:58:54,250
This is different,
though. These...

1702
01:58:54,351 --> 01:58:58,253
Special Investigative Unit.
That's their problem.
They think they're special.

1703
01:58:58,355 --> 01:59:00,983
Fucking crooks.
No code of ethics.

1704
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:02,149
What do you think?

1705
01:59:02,259 --> 01:59:04,386
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1706
01:59:04,695 --> 01:59:05,821
Good.

1707
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:08,489
The police, that ain't
the only somebody
I'm worried about.

1708
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:11,568
I seeing cars where I ain't
never seen them before,
people I don't know.

1709
01:59:11,702 --> 01:59:12,669
Yeah, me, too.

1710
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:13,532
EVA: Ho, ho, ho.

1711
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:17,433
Merry Christmas,
Charlie.

1712
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,632
Thank you.

1713
01:59:18,741 --> 01:59:20,003
I love you.

1714
01:59:20,176 --> 01:59:21,473
I love you, too.

1715
01:59:22,979 --> 01:59:24,810
Here, take this.

1716
01:59:25,081 --> 01:59:26,776
A quick toast,
and then I'll be off.

1717
01:59:27,116 --> 01:59:29,448
<i>MAN ON TV:

Bumpy ain't hardly
ever go out no more.

1720
01:59:35,358 --> 01:59:37,588
After a certain point
he stayed in the house.

1721
01:59:40,363 --> 01:59:42,524
Watch TV.

1722
01:59:43,833 --> 01:59:45,801
Play chess.
Read the newspaper.

1723
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:49,563
I though he was just trying
to lead the quiet life,

1724
01:59:49,672 --> 01:59:51,731
but no, he couldn't
go nowhere.

1725
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:53,308
Not without
something happening.

1726
01:59:53,476 --> 01:59:54,966
Frankie...

1727
01:59:55,144 --> 01:59:56,736
We can still go out.

1728
01:59:56,913 --> 01:59:58,540
With who? Where?

1729
01:59:58,648 --> 02:00:00,275
Well, with...

1730
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:02,042
But I know he's
under surveillance.

1731
02:00:03,219 --> 02:00:04,880
Ain't gonna be
no Christmas time

1732
02:00:05,054 --> 02:00:06,783
with my family
being here no more.

1733
02:00:06,889 --> 02:00:10,017
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

1734
02:00:10,126 --> 02:00:12,219
I do pay them.
I pay thousands
and millions

1735
02:00:12,395 --> 02:00:14,488
to dope dealers,
crooks, cops.

1736
02:00:14,964 --> 02:00:16,022
I pay everybody.

1737
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:17,291
I pay more than
they should get.

1738
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,561
I can't satisfy
nobody!

1739
02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:21,728
It's like dope!
Everybody's
strung out!

1740
02:00:21,838 --> 02:00:23,863
The more you give 'em,
the more they want.

1741
02:00:24,006 --> 02:00:26,304
They expect more.

1742
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:29,505
Give more and they want more.

1743
02:00:34,217 --> 02:00:36,310
Do you want to go out?

1744
02:00:37,253 --> 02:00:39,221
All right, baby.
Put something of
what you got.

1745
02:00:39,322 --> 02:00:40,516
Should I?
Yeah.

1746
02:00:40,623 --> 02:00:41,817

Mmm-hmm.

1749
02:00:53,736 --> 02:00:55,067

1751
02:00:56,372 --> 02:00:58,932
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.

1752
02:00:59,976 --> 02:01:01,534
It's all clear.

1753
02:01:05,994 --> 02:01:06,722

Nicky!

1754
02:01:06,828 --> 02:01:08,625
NICKY: Who is that?
DOC: There's your boy,
Nicky. See him?

1755
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:09,719
NICKY: Know what I'm saying?

1756
02:01:09,831 --> 02:01:12,425
Yeah, I see him.
Let's keep going.

1757
02:01:13,168 --> 02:01:14,226
Around back?

1758
02:01:14,336 --> 02:01:17,430
FRANK: Hell, no. I ain't
sneaking into my own club.

1759
02:01:17,839 --> 02:01:19,773
Incredible.
Huh?

1760
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:43,429
Come on.

1761
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:47,325
Hold on. Hold on.

1762
02:01:55,777 --> 02:01:56,801
What?

1763
02:01:56,945 --> 02:01:58,742
I want to wait in the car.

1764
02:01:58,847 --> 02:02:01,907
Frank, I got it. I got it.
I'll wait for it. I got it.

1765
02:02:02,317 --> 02:02:04,342
Get that yellow sauce.
Yellow sauce.

1766
02:02:04,486 --> 02:02:06,511
And the chicken.
The Kung Pao chicken.

1767
02:02:12,794 --> 02:02:14,523
Can you turn the heater on?

1768
02:02:20,869 --> 02:02:23,030
Shit. I'm gonna go
get the keys.

1769
02:02:36,985 --> 02:02:39,510
Doc, give me the keys.
DOC: Here you go.

1770
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,522
Doc!

1771
02:02:50,665 --> 02:02:52,462
Get out of the car.

1772
02:02:58,907 --> 02:03:00,841
DOC: You okay?
Yeah.

1773
02:03:00,942 --> 02:03:02,000
DOC: Shit.

1774
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:03,202
Come on.

1775
02:03:03,345 --> 02:03:05,370
Come on, baby. You all right?

1776
02:03:06,348 --> 02:03:07,645
Let's go.

1777
02:03:28,303 --> 02:03:29,770
Was it Nicky?

1778
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:33,771
We'll go right now and
fucking kill him whether
it was him or not,

1779
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:35,843
you say the word, Frankie.

1780
02:03:37,379 --> 02:03:39,711
We got to do something, Frank.

1781
02:03:40,148 --> 02:03:41,172
We can't just sit here.

1782
02:03:41,283 --> 02:03:42,773
We're leaving.

1783
02:03:45,921 --> 02:03:47,582
All right, everybody get out.
TURNER: You all right, man?

1784
02:03:47,722 --> 02:03:49,849
Go on home.
It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

1785
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:51,255
I'm all right.

1786
02:03:51,393 --> 02:03:54,294
Go on. Go ahead.
Be with your kids.

1787
02:03:54,429 --> 02:03:55,726
Go ahead.

1788
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:08,967
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1789
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:10,702
We're gonna go to Spain,
somewhere? China?

1790
02:04:10,812 --> 02:04:14,304
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

1791
02:04:14,983 --> 02:04:17,918
Frank, we can go
anywhere we want.

1792
02:04:18,019 --> 02:04:19,919
No, we can't.
We can live anywhere, Frank.

1793
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:21,716
Where? And do what?
Run? Hide?

1794
02:04:21,823 --> 02:04:24,758
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1795
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,657
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

1796
02:04:26,795 --> 02:04:29,059
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

1797
02:04:29,164 --> 02:04:32,463
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

1798
02:04:32,601 --> 02:04:35,069
My country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1799
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:37,965
I ain't running from nobody!

1800
02:04:39,341 --> 02:04:40,968

1801
02:04:47,782 --> 02:04:50,342

nowhere, either!

Richie.

1808
02:05:14,809 --> 02:05:15,901
Wow.

1809
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:22,980
So, what I hear it was
the Corsican mob took
a shot at Frank.

1810
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:24,949
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

1811
02:05:25,053 --> 02:05:27,419
the exporters that
Frank has put out of business.

1812
02:05:28,823 --> 02:05:30,950
Look, I can take care
of him in New York.

1813
02:05:31,059 --> 02:05:32,526
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

1814
02:05:32,661 --> 02:05:34,128
he drives across
the bridge to Jersey,

1815
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:37,027
someone's gonna take
another shot at him.

1816
02:05:37,165 --> 02:05:40,430
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

1817
02:05:40,902 --> 02:05:43,268
We need to step up
our efforts.

1818
02:05:43,638 --> 02:05:46,300
Next time,
their aim could be better.

<i>This C-130,
loaded down with
its sorrowful cargo, </i>

1982
02:15:42,637 --> 02:15:46,869
<i>a cargo of America's bravest
and best, en route to
their final resting places. </i>

1983
02:16:02,557 --> 02:16:04,024
You guys.
Take this coffin down.

1984
02:16:12,567 --> 02:16:14,194
Open it.
I'm not doing that.

1985
02:16:20,975 --> 02:16:22,943
Great fucking dog, huh?

1986
02:16:30,952 --> 02:16:32,817
You stop this, right now.

1987
02:16:32,954 --> 02:16:35,821
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

1988
02:16:37,124 --> 02:16:38,591
the plane and its cargo.

1989
02:16:39,093 --> 02:16:41,118
Well, you don't have
my permission.

1990
02:16:42,129 --> 02:16:43,596
I don't need it, Captain.

1991
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:47,927
Easy! Easy, boy.
Come on. Hey!

1992
02:16:48,803 --> 02:16:50,771
Frank, move out of the way.

1993
02:16:57,812 --> 02:16:59,109
Damn.

1994
02:17:03,985 --> 02:17:05,179
That's enough!

1995
02:17:12,994 --> 02:17:14,962
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them
out of your sight.

1996
02:17:15,062 --> 02:17:16,359
Got it. Okay.

1997
02:17:17,999 --> 02:17:19,296
TRUPO: Hey.
Help me out with this.

1998
02:17:44,759 --> 02:17:47,193
That was a military
transport plane.

1999
02:17:47,328 --> 02:17:48,488
If there was heroin
was onboard,

2000
02:17:48,596 --> 02:17:50,393
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

2001
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:53,227
Which means that even as
it fights a war that's claimed

2002
02:17:53,367 --> 02:17:57,394
50,000 American lives,
the military is smuggling
narcotics.

2003
02:17:57,538 --> 02:18:00,166
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

2004
02:18:00,274 --> 02:18:01,901
That someone
employed by this office

2005
02:18:02,043 --> 02:18:05,740
believes that the United
States Army is in the
drug trafficking business

2006
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:09,043
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the
remains of young men

2007
02:18:09,183 --> 02:18:11,913
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

2008
02:18:12,053 --> 02:18:14,578
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

2009
02:18:16,057 --> 02:18:19,185
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

2010
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:21,858
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

2011
02:18:21,962 --> 02:18:24,931
of being dismantled
as completely and
enthusiastically

2012
02:18:25,066 --> 02:18:26,863
as that fucking
transport plane?

2013
02:18:26,967 --> 02:18:29,435
That is what you've
accomplished, Mr. Roberts,
single-handedly.

2014
02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:31,197
I had good information.

2015
02:18:31,739 --> 02:18:35,106
That the target of my
investigation was bringing
dope in on that plane.

2016
02:18:35,242 --> 02:18:37,176
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

2017
02:18:37,278 --> 02:18:39,246
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

2018
02:18:39,413 --> 02:18:41,881
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for?
Which family?

2019
02:18:41,982 --> 02:18:44,041
He's not Italian. He's black.

2020
02:18:47,588 --> 02:18:49,954
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

2021
02:18:50,591 --> 02:18:52,821
You're this close
to the end of your career
in law enforcement

2022
02:18:52,927 --> 02:18:54,792
and you're making
fucking jokes?

2023
02:18:55,596 --> 02:18:57,723
My investigation indicates

2024
02:18:58,132 --> 02:19:01,067
that Frank Lucas is
above the Mafia in
the dope business.

2025
02:19:01,569 --> 02:19:03,230
My investigations
also indicate

2026
02:19:03,337 --> 02:19:07,364
that Frank Lucas buys
direct from a source
in Southeast Asia.

2027
02:19:07,475 --> 02:19:10,603
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

2028
02:19:10,745 --> 02:19:14,579
<i>and personnel to transport
pure #4 heroin into
the United States</i>

2029
02:19:14,682 --> 02:19:18,743
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2030
02:19:18,853 --> 02:19:21,754
I have cases against
every member of
Frank's organization.

2031
02:19:21,856 --> 02:19:22,948
Frank's organization?

2032
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:26,821
No fucking nigger has ever
accomplished what the American
Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

2033
02:19:26,961 --> 02:19:29,896
And you would know that how?
Why? 'Cause your head is stuck
up your fucking ass?

2034
02:19:29,997 --> 02:19:32,329
Hey, Lou, do me a favor.
Will you get this fucking
kike out of here?

2035
02:19:32,466 --> 02:19:33,933
Kike? Kike?

2036
02:19:34,034 --> 02:19:35,092
Richie, no.

2037
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:39,765
Hey, Richie!

2038
02:19:41,208 --> 02:19:42,334
Make it stick.

2039
02:19:43,144 --> 02:19:45,612
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a
quarter mile away.

2040
02:20:16,877 --> 02:20:18,174

2041
02:20:20,014 --> 02:20:21,140

2042
02:20:21,682 --> 02:20:24,651

by the house, man. It's bad.

2043
02:20:39,533 --> 02:20:42,559
Frankie, I need to speak
with you a minute. Please?

2044
02:20:42,703 --> 02:20:45,536
I got to go, Ma.
No, sit down just a minute.

2045
02:20:45,673 --> 02:20:48,233
Would you please
come back a little later?

2046
02:20:48,375 --> 02:20:49,569

Listen to me. I got...

2049
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:54,977
Please, sit down.
Just a few words.

2050
02:20:55,583 --> 02:20:57,175
I've been thinking
about some things.

2051
02:20:57,284 --> 02:21:00,811
If you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would
have been preachers.

2052
02:21:00,921 --> 02:21:01,979
Right.

2053
02:21:02,089 --> 02:21:06,025
If you'd been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers.
You know that.

2054
02:21:06,126 --> 02:21:09,755
They came here because
of you. You called and
they came running.

2055
02:21:09,897 --> 02:21:10,886
Right.

2056
02:21:11,031 --> 02:21:14,432
That's because
they look up to you.

2057
02:21:14,568 --> 02:21:18,368
They always expect you
to know what's best.

2058
02:21:19,139 --> 02:21:21,107
But even they know

2059
02:21:21,408 --> 02:21:23,205
you don't shoot cops.

2060
02:21:25,279 --> 02:21:26,906
Even I know that.

2061
02:21:28,082 --> 02:21:29,549
Eva knows it.
All right, Ma.

2062
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:32,141
The only one who
doesn't seem
to know is you!

2063
02:21:32,253 --> 02:21:35,381
All right, Ma. I got to go.
I promise you,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2064
02:21:35,489 --> 02:21:39,255
I never asked you where
all this came from because
I didn't want to hear you lie.

2065
02:21:39,393 --> 02:21:41,486
I didn't want you to
worry about it. Now,
come on, I got to go.

2066
02:21:41,595 --> 02:21:43,062
Don't lie to me!

make things so bad

2069
02:21:54,174 --> 02:21:57,007
for your family
that they'll leave you?
Because they will.

2070

2152
02:28:59,232 --> 02:29:00,665

2153

JUDGE: Ladies and
gentlemen, at this stage
of the proceedings

2207
02:34:04,204 --> 02:34:07,071
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

2208
02:34:07,607 --> 02:34:10,633
For the prosecution,
Mr. Roberts will proceed

2209
02:34:10,777 --> 02:34:13,075
with his opening
statement first.

2210
02:34:13,546 --> 02:34:17,414
Mr. Roberts,
are you ready to proceed?

2211
02:34:19,019 --> 02:34:20,646
Yes, Your Honor.

2212
02:34:24,724 --> 02:34:27,284
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

2213
02:34:31,665 --> 02:34:35,101
the state will show
and you will hear

2214
02:34:35,669 --> 02:34:38,536
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man

2215
02:34:39,606 --> 02:34:41,904
walking the streets
of our city.

2216
02:34:44,644 --> 02:34:48,546
All right, y'all,
get on out. Let me talk to
Mr. Richie alone.

2217
02:34:51,651 --> 02:34:55,052
Come on, come on, come on.
I pay y'all by the hour,
not by the minute.

2218
02:34:57,857 --> 02:34:59,188
Thank you.

2219
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:06,060
You ain't wearing a wire,
are you?

2220
02:35:06,866 --> 02:35:07,890
No.

2221
02:35:09,069 --> 02:35:10,127
All right.

2222
02:35:10,236 --> 02:35:14,570
I was talking to my lawyers.
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.

2223
02:35:16,042 --> 02:35:19,239
Did you really find
a million dollars in
the trunk of a car

2224
02:35:19,379 --> 02:35:21,074
and then turn it in?
Did you do that?
Yeah.

2225
02:35:21,214 --> 02:35:22,579
You did that for real, huh?

2226
02:35:22,716 --> 02:35:25,913
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2227
02:35:26,052 --> 02:35:28,145
You know Johnny Law got,
though, right?

2228
02:35:28,354 --> 02:35:30,345
about it, Mr. Richie.

2229
02:35:30,457 --> 02:35:32,687
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

2230
02:35:32,792 --> 02:35:35,317
he took it and you ain't
get nothing for it. Did you?

2231
02:35:35,428 --> 02:35:36,861
Why did you do that?

2232
02:35:37,263 --> 02:35:39,595
It was the right thing to do.
That's true.

2233
02:35:40,033 --> 02:35:42,001
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

2234
02:35:42,135 --> 02:35:44,330
The question I have,
the question I've been
asking myself is,

2235
02:35:44,437 --> 02:35:46,029
would you do it again?

2236
02:35:47,307 --> 02:35:50,208
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

2237
02:35:50,643 --> 02:35:54,170
Many car payments ago,
many child support
payments ago.

2238
02:35:55,949 --> 02:35:59,783
So I said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out
is to find out.

2239
02:36:01,321 --> 02:36:07,089
RICHIE: Bribery, extortion,
murder, racketeering...

2240
02:36:09,062 --> 02:36:10,791
<i>FRANK: Now, 
you give me an address, </i>

2241
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:14,195
I'll make sure the
car's there, I'll make sure
that money's in that trunk.

2242
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,699
No, thanks.

2243
02:36:16,069 --> 02:36:17,366
You sure?

2244
02:36:19,172 --> 02:36:22,073
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think,
that impresses me?

2245
02:36:22,275 --> 02:36:25,244
You think that you're better
than them? You ain't no better
than them other cops.

2246
02:36:25,345 --> 02:36:27,575
In fact, you're the same
as them. You are them.

2247
02:36:28,314 --> 02:36:29,645
Let me ask you this.

2248
02:36:29,783 --> 02:36:32,911
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

2249
02:36:33,019 --> 02:36:34,919
is going to change
anything on them streets?

2250
02:36:35,021 --> 02:36:36,648
Them dope fiends
is gonna shoot it,

2251
02:36:36,756 --> 02:36:38,883
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

2252
02:36:38,992 --> 02:36:41,756
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

2253
02:36:42,128 --> 02:36:43,390
Then that's the way it is.

2254
02:36:43,496 --> 02:36:45,327
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

2255
02:36:45,532 --> 02:36:47,295
We got me and you
sitting here.

2256
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:50,501
<i>We got that little snitch-ass
driver for my brother. </i>

2257
02:36:50,603 --> 02:36:52,070
<i>You got a little
bit of powder. </i>

2258
02:36:52,372 --> 02:36:54,237
<i>You're going to need
more than that, Richie. </i>

2259
02:36:54,507 --> 02:36:57,999
<i>RICHIE: I got possession, 
supply, conspiracy, </i>

2260
02:36:58,211 --> 02:37:02,307
<i>bribing a law officer. I got
people who'll attest to seeing
you kill in cold blood. </i>

2261
02:37:02,448 --> 02:37:06,350
I got your offshore bank
accounts, your real estate,
your businesses,

2262
02:37:06,486 --> 02:37:08,954
all bought with money
from heroin.

2263
02:37:09,289 --> 02:37:12,019
And I got hundreds of
parents of dead kids.

2264
02:37:12,458 --> 02:37:14,949
Addicts who OD'ed on
your product. And that's
my story for the jury.

2265
02:37:15,061 --> 02:37:18,622
And that's how I make
it all stick. "This man
murdered thousands of people.

2266
02:37:18,731 --> 02:37:20,699
"And he did it
from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."

2267
02:37:20,834 --> 02:37:22,631
Aside from that,
you got nothing
to worry about.

2268
02:37:22,735 --> 02:37:25,602
That's pretty good.
But that's why we go to
court, isn't it, Richie?

2269
02:37:25,705 --> 02:37:27,138
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2270
02:37:27,373 --> 02:37:31,332
I got celebrities.
I got sports figures.
I got Harlem, Richie.

2271
02:37:31,878 --> 02:37:35,678
I took care of Harlem, so
Harlem's gonna take care
of me. You can believe that.

2272
02:37:35,815 --> 02:37:38,283
I got more than that, Frank.
What you got?

2273
02:37:38,384 --> 02:37:41,046
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify
against you,

2274
02:37:41,187 --> 02:37:43,519
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

2275
02:37:43,656 --> 02:37:47,456
<i>You damaged a lot of lives, 
Frank. I got the Mazzano
crime family. </i>

2276
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:49,152
<i>Remember those boys? 
You put them out of business. </i>

2277
02:37:49,262 --> 02:37:50,820
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.

2278
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:51,988
Mazzanos ain't got nothing
to do with me.

2279
02:37:52,098 --> 02:37:53,497
They got everything
to do with you.
What, they...

2280
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:54,658
You know why?
Why?

2281
02:37:54,767 --> 02:37:57,327
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2282
02:37:57,837 --> 02:37:59,168
they hate what you represent.

2283
02:37:59,272 --> 02:38:02,332
I don't represent nothing
but Frank Lucas.
You sure?

2284
02:38:02,742 --> 02:38:04,676
A black businessman like you?

2285
02:38:05,111 --> 02:38:06,635
You represent progress.

2286
02:38:07,380 --> 02:38:10,372
The kind of progress
that's going to see them
lose a lot of money.

2287
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:14,511
With you out of the way,
everything can return
to normal.

2288
02:38:15,655 --> 02:38:16,883
My man.

2289
02:38:21,728 --> 02:38:23,719
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2290
02:38:24,030 --> 02:38:26,931
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2291
02:38:28,568 --> 02:38:31,162
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2292
02:38:31,271 --> 02:38:34,206
dragging my little
12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,

2293
02:38:34,307 --> 02:38:37,435
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2294
02:38:37,577 --> 02:38:40,842
Then they bust two shotgun
shells in his head and
knock his fucking head off.

2295
02:38:40,947 --> 02:38:42,175
That's what normal is to me.

2296
02:38:42,282 --> 02:38:45,342
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2297
02:38:45,451 --> 02:38:48,420
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2298
02:38:48,788 --> 02:38:51,018
You know what, you can do
whatever you want to do.

2299
02:38:51,157 --> 02:38:53,625
So, it don't mean nothing
to me for you to show up
tomorrow morning

2300
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:56,228
with your head blown off.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

2301
02:38:56,763 --> 02:38:59,129
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.

2302
02:38:59,799 --> 02:39:02,029
That one stretches
around the block, too.

2303
02:39:05,438 --> 02:39:06,769
All right.

2304
02:39:10,510 --> 02:39:11,943
What do you want to do?

2305
02:39:18,651 --> 02:39:20,312
You know what you got to do.

2306
02:39:20,486 --> 02:39:22,249
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2307
02:39:22,355 --> 02:39:23,822
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2308
02:39:23,957 --> 02:39:25,424
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2309
02:39:26,025 --> 02:39:29,620
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2310
02:39:30,296 --> 02:39:33,094
They've been bleeding
Harlem dry since they got
off the boat, Richie.

2311
02:39:33,199 --> 02:39:36,999
I don't give a fuck
about no crime figures.
You can have them.

2312
02:39:38,004 --> 02:39:39,437
I'll take them, too.

2313
02:39:39,706 --> 02:39:41,606
You'll take them, too?

2314
02:39:46,779 --> 02:39:50,442
No, you didn't.
You're talking about police.
You want police?

2315
02:39:51,017 --> 02:39:52,143
You want your own kind?

2316
02:39:52,251 --> 02:39:53,513
They're not my kind.

2317
02:39:54,287 --> 02:39:56,847
They're in business with you,
Frank. They ain't my kind.

2318
02:39:57,123 --> 02:40:01,025
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are
not yours. All right?

2319
02:40:04,030 --> 02:40:05,019
Huh.

2320
02:40:14,607 --> 02:40:16,973
What can you
promise me, Richie?

2321
02:40:20,013 --> 02:40:22,982
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2322
02:40:23,349 --> 02:40:25,078
you'll never
get out of prison.

2323
02:40:25,551 --> 02:40:30,648
You lie about one dollar, in
one offshore account, you'll
never get out of prison.

2324
02:40:31,624 --> 02:40:35,856
Now you can live life
rich in jail for the rest
of your born days,

2325
02:40:36,529 --> 02:40:38,588
or be poor outside
for some of them.

2326
02:40:39,866 --> 02:40:42,164
That's what I can promise you.

2327
02:40:45,071 --> 02:40:51,772
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want,
I want them cops

2328
02:40:52,712 --> 02:40:55,647
that took that money
out of my pockets.

2329
02:40:58,651 --> 02:40:59,777
Him, too.

2330
02:41:00,219 --> 02:41:01,880
All right. Okay.

2331
02:41:04,090 --> 02:41:06,183
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2332
02:41:06,993 --> 02:41:09,553
So these guys are
all connected up
to Gywnn, all right.

2333
02:41:09,695 --> 02:41:12,289

You are special.

2357

It's good work, Frank.

2358
02:43:12,785 --> 02:43:14,150
You know...

2359
02:43:14,353 --> 02:43:17,982
You don't want a drink
or something? Celebrate?

2360
02:43:18,591 --> 02:43:19,990
You got any holy water?

2361
02:44:16,148 --> 02:44:18,207
Check your property.
Sign, please.

2362
02:45:09,671 --> 02:45:13,072
Smell better out here?

2363
02:45:31,426 --> 02:45:33,894
Frank. There you are.

2364
02:45:34,729 --> 02:45:35,957
Caffe latte. Yeah.

2365
02:45:36,064 --> 02:45:37,224
Latte?

2366
02:45:37,332 --> 02:45:38,663
Oh, shit. Yeah.

2367
02:45:38,833 --> 02:45:40,198
You all right?

2368
02:45:40,401 --> 02:45:43,302
That's a fancy
way of saying
coffee with milk.

2369
02:45:43,438 --> 02:45:44,803
Yeah.
$2.50.

2370
02:45:48,343 --> 02:45:50,777
So you been talking
to your brothers?

2371
02:45:50,879 --> 02:45:52,437
No, no, I ain't talked
to them in years.

2372
02:45:52,614 --> 02:45:54,206
It's probably
best for them.

2373
02:45:58,219 --> 02:46:00,414
What the hell
am I going to do
out here, Richie?

2374
02:46:00,522 --> 02:46:02,649
I don't know
how I'm gonna live.

2375
02:46:04,893 --> 02:46:07,953
Hey, I told ya,
I ain't gonna let
you starve, all right?

2376
02:46:08,062 --> 02:46:09,689
Obviously,
you ain't starving.

2377
02:46:10,932 --> 02:46:13,833
Bagels and blinches
They will catch up
with you, you know?

2378
02:46:18,039 --> 02:46:19,006
Who's this?

2379
02:46:19,741 --> 02:46:22,437
Expensive sneakers.
About $100 a pair.

2380
02:46:31,886 --> 02:46:33,751
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard.

2381
02:46:34,122 --> 02:46:36,488
This used to
be Eighth Avenue,
why do they call it

2382
02:46:36,591 --> 02:46:40,027
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard now?

2383
02:46:44,299 --> 02:46:45,698
This was me Richie,
right here.

2384
02:46:45,867 --> 02:46:47,300
This was all me.

2385
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:50,997
In my day there
were so many niggers
out here buying dope

2386
02:46:51,105 --> 02:46:53,767
<i>you could've made
a Tarzan movie.</i>

2387
02:46:54,509 --> 02:46:58,036
You know, one phone call,
I'll be right back in
business, you know that.

2388
02:46:58,146 --> 02:46:59,704
You don't do that, Frank.

2389
02:46:59,881 --> 02:47:01,473
These days I keep
all my promises.

2390
02:47:12,727 --> 02:47:15,059
Why'd you come
and get me, huh?

2391
02:47:15,163 --> 02:47:17,131
You're a superstar, Frank.

2392
02:47:17,232 --> 02:47:18,199
A superstar?

2393
02:47:19,634 --> 02:47:23,661
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2394
02:47:24,172 --> 02:47:27,164
Thought the least
we could do is give
you a ride home.

2395
02:47:27,609 --> 02:47:29,440
Yeah, you sure
did that.

2396
02:47:29,611 --> 02:47:31,476
You gave me a ride
home. Free ride.

2397
02:47:31,980 --> 02:47:34,414
Coming to gangsters.

2398
02:47:38,152 --> 02:47:39,119
What?

2399
02:47:41,623 --> 02:47:44,524
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.

2400
02:47:45,360 --> 02:47:47,487
That's life right there.
That's life right there.

2401
02:47:47,962 --> 02:47:51,159
Even a fool gets
to be young once.

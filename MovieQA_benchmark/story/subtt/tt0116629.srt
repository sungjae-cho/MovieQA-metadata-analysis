1
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:07,129
For those who haven't
read the plaque, we'll read the plaque.

2
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:11,895
"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the moon."

3
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,607
"July 1969."

4
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:18,484
"We came in peace for all mankind. "

5
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,695
"It's The End Of The World As We Know It"
by REM

6
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,445

7
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:46,325

8
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,407

9
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,847

10
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,045
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

11
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,366
Sir, I-I think you should listen to this.

12
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:03,564

13
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,085
Agh!

14
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,286
- Goddamn it!
- Sir?

15
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:11,365
Sir?

16
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:15,009
Come on, baby,
come on, baby, come on!

17
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,656
This better not be
another damn Russian spyjob!

18
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,931
Boys at air traffic say the skies are clear.

19
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,768
It's the real thing.

20
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,847
A radio signal from another world.

21
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,415
Let's not jump the gun here.

22
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,568
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...

23
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:31,489
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

24
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,089
Wait, this can't be right.

25
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,851
The calculated distance from source...

26
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,053
..is only 375,000 km.

27
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,727
It's coming from the moon.

28
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,167

29
00:03:56,376 --> 00:04:00,051
- Who else knows about this?
- SETI in New Mexico identified a signal.

30
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:03,651
But, uh...
they're even more confused than we are, sir.

31
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,926
Excuse me.

32
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,414
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,487
Radar reception has been impaired,...

34
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,567
..but we were able to get these.

35
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:20,091
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km...

36
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,691
..and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

37
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,334
What the hell is it?

38
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,407
- A meteor?
- No, sir.

39
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:29,964
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?

40
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,286
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

41
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,412
- It's what?
- It's, uh...

42
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,771
It's slowing down, sir.

43
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:46,167
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

44
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:49,841

45
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,572
- Hello.
- Hi.

46
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,042
- It's me.
- Hi.

47
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:59,091
- What time is it there?
- It's 2.45 in the morning.

48
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:03,132
- I know I didn't wake you.
- As a matter offact, you did.

49
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:04,881
Liar.

50
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,604
I have a confession to make.

51
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:12,288
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

52
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,490
You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?

53
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,485
- Did you?
- Of course not.

54
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,167
- You're coming home after the lunche on?
- Yes, yes.

55
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,721
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

56
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:29,569
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, I miss you.

57
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:34,568
President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40%.

58
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,245
He's good.

59
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,848
Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?

60
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:43,767
Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from leadership in politics.

61
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,684
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

62
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:47,852
Traitor.

63
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,525
The problem is
they electeda warrior and got a wimp.

64
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,687
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr President.

65
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,331
That game couldn't have been pretty.

66
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,969
Thank you, sir.

67
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:01,566
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

68
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,560
They're not attacking your policies,
they're attacking your age.

69
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,006
"Whitmore seems less like the President...

70
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:14,449
..and more like the orphaned child Oliver
asking, 'Please, sir, I'd like some more."'

71
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,886
- That's clever.
- Well, I'm not laughing.

72
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,485
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

73
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,846
You were thought of as young, idealistic...

74
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,604
Now... the message has gotten lost.

75
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:27,603
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

76
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:31,764
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

77
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:39,843
It's a fine line between standing
behind a principle and hiding behind one.

78
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:42,001
You can tolerate a little compromise...

79
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,367
..if you're actually managing
to get something accomplished.

80
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:47,123
Well...

81
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:52,763
The Orange County Dispatch has voted you
one of the ten sexiest men of the year.

82
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,123
That's...

83
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,486
That's accomplishing something!

84
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,960
Mr President, it's the Secretary of Defense.

85
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,519
Yes.

86
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,122
Could... you say that again?

87
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,919
Temperature is 95º in CentraIPark...

88
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:52,560
Let's go to Nick Jones
and get us a travel report for the beaches...

89
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,639
So why are you waiting, hm?

90
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,959
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

91
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,681
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

92
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:12,040
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

93
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:14,562
If you don't move soon,
I'll start to decompose.

94
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,477
Ah!

95
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:22,527
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

96
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,125
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.

97
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,723
It's been... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

98
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,924
- Three years.
- All right, three... four.

99
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,397
You're divorced, move on.
This is not healthy.

100
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:39,480
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

101
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,037
- Checkmate.
- Wait a minute.

102
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

103
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:51,358
- Wait a minute. This is not checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

104
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,439
Just hold on! This is not checkmate.

105
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,845
Oh... Checkmate!

106
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:01,085
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

107
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:04,205
Yeah, I love X-Files, too.
I hope you get to see it.

108
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,047
David! David!

109
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,881
What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?

110
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,959
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.

111
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,118
What's the... What's the big emergency?

112
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,917
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

113
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,568
We got static, snow, all kinds of distortions.

114
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,127
- Marty.
- Nobody knows...

115
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,927
There's a reason
we have bins labelled "Recycle"!

116
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,681
What the hell is going on? My God in heaven!

117
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,805
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

118
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,844
Did you switch transponder channels?

119
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?

120
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,443
OK, let's point the dish at another satellite.

121
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,044
We tried that. It didn't work.

122
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:43,323
It's almost as though they weren't there.

123
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,638
All right. What have we got here?

124
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,919
This is impossible.

125
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,841
We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...

126
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:01,082
- The signal's all screwed up.
- Stop it! Just leave it alone. You'll break it!

127
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,363
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

128
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,403

129
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,357
Oh, no.

130
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:17,803
Good morning, Lucas.

131
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:21,676
You see these?
I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

132
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,521
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes,...

133
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,479
..I'm getting someone else.

134
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,128
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

135
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,801

136
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,166
Agh!

137
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,280
Whoo!

138
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,723
Ya-hoo!

139
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,117
Russell! What are you doing?

140
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,403
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

141
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:11,364
Whoa!

142
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,279
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

143
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,563
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

144
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,959
Are you sure?

145
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,879
Ya lo hizo otra vez!

146
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,399
CNS is running a story that we're covering up
a nuclear-testing experiment.

147
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:07,157
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.

148
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,235
NASA wants to know our position.

149
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:11,315
Our official position is...

150
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,281
..we have no official position.

151
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,161
- Connie!
- What is going on here?

152
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,275
Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

153
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:18,843
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

154
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,596
What? I can't hear you.

155
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:23,482
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

156
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,476
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

157
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,555
What if it doesn't pass us by?

158
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,999
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?

159
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,644
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

160
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:37,433
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

161
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,596
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

162
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,834
But that's not gonna keep.

163
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:45,757
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

164
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:50,315
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the President said.

165
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,281
Isn't that a little premature?

166
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,958
We have over 50% of the armed forces
on weekend leave.

167
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:58,719
Plus the commanders and troops
that are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

168
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:02,479
Our intelligence tells us
the object has settled into a stationary orbit.

169
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:05,124
- Well, that's good news.
- Uh, not really, sir.

170
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,037
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

171
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:10,763
Smaller than the whole, sir,...

172
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:13,312
..yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

173
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,874
Where are they heading?

174
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:22,075
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

175
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,034
Take us to DEFCON 3.

176
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,598
- Please say we're gettin' somewhere.
- There's good news and bad news.

177
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:47,642
- All right. What's the bad news?
- There's a penalty for disturbing my lunch.

178
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,714
And the good news is you won't charge me.

179
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:52,522
No. The good news is that
the problem is not our equipment.

180
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:55,117
It's some weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

181
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,080
And that's the good news?

182
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:02,313
Yeah. This signal has a sequential pattern,
so once I find the exact binary sequence,...

183
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:04,758
..I can calculate the phase reversal
and apply it.

184
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,879
We should be able to block it out.

185
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:11,034
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!

186
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:14,001
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, David! That's why I love you!

187
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,238
Oh! That's not necessary.

188
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:17,041
Too kind.

189
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,791

190
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,034

191
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,469
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

192
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,479
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout
over a 13km area.

193
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,915
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,879
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

195
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,593
Jeez!

196
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,593
Get me Atlantic Command.

197
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,835
Hang on, sir.

198
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,356
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

199
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,955
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,833
Correction, sir.

201
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,036
We have two confirmed visual contacts.

202
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,318
Mr President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

203
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,358
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

204
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are interrupting our regular broadcast...

205
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,429
..to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.

206
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,354
This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.

207
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,398
How would you describe
what you are seeing?

208
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,392
It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly...

209
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,630
..to be a comet ormeteor.

210
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,190
Wide spread panic
has gripped the countryside...

211
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,748
..as thousands have taken to the streets.

212
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,118
It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.

213
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,555
Mr President,
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.

214
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,074
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

215
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,638
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

216
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,188
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

217
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,193
Negative.
We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

218
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,590
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

219
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,673
Captain, the President is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

220
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,876
We still have zero visibility.

221
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,909
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

222
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,672
We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.

223
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,749
Wait a minute.

224
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,952
It maybe clearing.

225
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,789
Pull out!

226
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,078
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

227
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,390
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

228
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,630
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

229
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,517
Alex, organise a military escort.

230
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,433
Mr President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.

231
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,638
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.

232
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,598
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.

233
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,990
We have to maintain a working government.

234
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,835
Take the Vice President, the whole cabinet,
and the Joint Chiefs to a secured location.

235
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,069
I'm staying.

236
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,994
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

237
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,629
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

238
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,711
We'll advise people not to panic.

239
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,837
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

240
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,672
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,435
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

242
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,389
Mr President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

243
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,517
I had a feeling you would.

244
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,553
And what happens
if they do become hostile?

245
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,671
Then God help us.

246
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,314
There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.

247
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,517
It is apparently whatis causing
all the distortions...

248
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,752
- David, are you watching this?

249
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,518
There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.

250
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,670
Thus far, reports of oppression...

251
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,193
Marty, listen to this. I got a lock on
that signal pattern so we can filter it out.

252
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,590
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.

253
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,148
It's reducing itself every time it recycles,...

254
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,118
..so eventually it'll disappear...

255
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,555
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

256
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,634
David, haven't you been watching? David!

257
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,037
Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not causedany damage.

258
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,159
We have to ask you to stay calm,
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

259
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,596
We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...

260
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,478
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

261
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,120
One is headed towards Los Angeles,...

262
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,829
..the other two are headed towards New York
and Washington, DC.

263
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,672
Marty.

264
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,957
Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

265
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,951
We're heading down there now.

266
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,793
OK, everybody! Head down to the basement.

267
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,190
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!

268
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,356
There's no shame in hiding.

269
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,431
Oh, I'd better call my mother.

270
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,071

271
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,950
Well, look who we have here.

272
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,079
Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

273
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,151
Dusted the wrong field.

274
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,431
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

275
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,195
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

276
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,434
Years back, he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

277
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,593
Tell 'em about it, Russ. Get a few beers in him
and he'll tell you all about it.

278
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,511
Won't you, Russ?

279
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,479
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

280
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,918
..sexual things?

281
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,798
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

282
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,711

283
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,909
- What's that?
- Let's get outta here, come on!

284
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,951
Wow!

285
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,473
Mommy, lookit!

286
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,474
It's too early, baby.

287
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,671
Is it an earthquake?

288
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,637
Not even a four-pointer.

289
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,711
Go back to sleep.

290
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,391
Daddy!

291
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,071
What are you doing here?

292
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,357
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?

293
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,232

294
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,915

295
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,875
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

296
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,869
Oh, man! What is that?

297
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,479
The signal!

298
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,798
My God!

299
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,751
Now what do we do?

300
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,197
Address the nation.

301
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,999
There's gonna be
a lot off rightened people out there.

302
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,593
Yeah.

303
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,636
I'm one of 'em.

304
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,031
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

305
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,076
He's just trying to impress you.

306
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,879
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get ajob...

307
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,269
..and stop slobberin' all over my shoes.

308
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,032

309
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,998
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

310
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,993
Neighbours are movin' out. I guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

311
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,191
A little shake and they runnin'.

312
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,031
Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.

313
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,588
There's something on the news
about the quake!

314
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,798
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.

315
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,111
- What you doin' goin' out there?
- Shooting aliens.

316
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,839
Oh, you shootin' aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?

317
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,831
What you got? Turn around.

318
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,036
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

319
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,276
Watch out! Watch it now!

320
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,510
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.

321
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,991
Ow! Dylan!

322
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,671
Come on, honey, let's go!

323
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,751

324
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,232

325
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,910
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

326
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,159
Babe?

327
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,719
Boom! Boom! Boom!

328
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,110
Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived...

329
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,510
..over the capitals
ofIndia, England, and Germany,...

330
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,195
..bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15
of these city-size spacecraft.

331
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,874
(Marty) I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

332
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,871
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

333
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,235
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!

334
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,594
Ma! Ma, listen!

335
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,070
Uh... Get your stufftogether
and head for Aunt Esther's.

336
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,071
Don't argue with me! Just go!

337
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,553
David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

338
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,517
David! David, talk to me.

339
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,672
Didn't you hear me say that
the signal in the satellite feed...

340
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,671
..is recycling down to extinction?

341
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,557
- Not really.
- Countdown.

342
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,757
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?

343
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,916
It's like in chess.
First you strategically position your pieces.

344
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,993
Then, when the timing's right,
you... strike. See?

345
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,674
They're positioning themselves
all over the world,...

346
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,228
..using this one signal
to synchronise their efforts.

347
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,438
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

348
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,999
And then what?

349
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,872
Checkmate.

350
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,119
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

351
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,031
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

352
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,839
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!

353
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,717
Ah, forget my lawyer.

354
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,951
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

355
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,951
Good afternoon.

356
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,996
My fellow Americans,...

357
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,311
..a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.

358
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,392
The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe...

359
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,357
..has been answered.

360
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,638
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear,...

361
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,439
..we must attempt to reserve judgment.

362
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,909
He says he's your husband.

363
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,911
Oh, God...

364
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,718
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.

365
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,076
This is hardly the time
to be having that old discussion.

366
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,639
You gotta leave Washington.

367
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,235
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!

368
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,959
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.

369
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,474
- You are just being paranoid!
- It's notparanoia!

370
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,199
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...

371
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,554

372
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,952
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

373
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,553
- Please?
- OK.

374
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,677
The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.

375
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,509
If you feel compelled to leave these cities,...

376
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,909
..please do so in an orderly fashion.

377
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,989

378
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,071

379
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,671

380
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,831
Excuse me! Coming through.

381
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,997
The arrival of the aliens has caused...

382
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,753
..over 10,000 fenderbenders
in just a few seconds.

383
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,559
But this is just the beginning...

384
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,156
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

385
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,630
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

386
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,029
Yeah, well, they cancelled it!

387
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,351
Look, why are you acting like this?

388
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,672
Why?

389
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,549
That's why!

390
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,436
Look... I really don't think...

391
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,671
..they flew 90 billion light years
to come and start a fight...

392
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,631
..and get all rowdy.

393
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,551
Look, why don't you just relax?

394
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,518
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's goin' on.

395
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,428
- What are you doin' in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just drivin'.

396
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,513
Look.

397
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,192
Hey, I got these for you.

398
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,872
- Fire crackers!
- You be careful.

399
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,154
Steve, wait.

400
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,437
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

401
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,790
You take care of your self, you hear?

402
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,598
Look, um...

403
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,559
Why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

404
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,278
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

405
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,237
Really?

406
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,159
You don't mind?

407
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,154
Well, I mean...

408
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,800
I will have to let
all my other girlfriends know...

409
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,713
..they can't come over.
I got to postpone a freaky weekend.

410
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,236
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

411
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,551
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

412
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,554
Yes, I am.

413
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,992
Them big old Dumbo ears.

414
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,036
Look at you with them chicken legs.

415
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,111

416
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,991
Come on, Dylan.

417
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,838

418
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,558

419
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,674
Look out!

420
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,912
Hey! Whoa!

421
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,878
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.

422
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,952
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?

423
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,759
- David, you don't have a licence.
- You're driving.

424
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,593
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!

425
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,796
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

426
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,269
You're staying there to keep people calm.

427
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,555
I won't let them criticise you for it.

428
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,270
- I appreciate your trying to help me.
- Liar. Stick to the truth. You're good at it.

429
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,715
OK. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.

430
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,190
I'll leave
as soon as the interviews are done.

431
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,068
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're taking you to Nellis.

432
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,469
- And the munchkin?
- She'll meet you there.

433
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,472
All right. I love you.

434
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,354
I love you.

435
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,398
- Bye.
- Bye.

436
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,431
It's the White House!

437
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,592
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this go any faster?

438
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,639
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! She works for the President.

439
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,280
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.

440
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,874
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So are you so smart?

441
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,032
How come you spent eight years
in MIT to become a cable repairman?

442
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,075
Dad...

443
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,833
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.

444
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,797
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

445
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,351
Look at these people, look. Huh?

446
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,476
Vultures. They take and then they go.

447
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,677
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!

448
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,479
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!

449
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,075
- They're getting in front. I can't go faster.
- I don't wanna argue.

450
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,355
Let's just get there as quickly as possible.

451
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,319
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

452
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:51,109
A crop-duster was arrested
as he dropped leaflets from the air.

453
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:54,189
- Everybody's leavin'.
- Can you give us some of your time?

454
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:58,316
We've got to stop them!l was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!

455
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:00,433
They didall kinds of experiments on me!

456
00:33:00,517 --> 00:33:03,509
They've been studying us,
finding out our weaknesses!

457
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:06,714
We've gotta stop 'em.
They're gonna kill us all!

458
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:10,870
Some people attribute
his behaviour to post-traumatic stress...

459
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:13,107
..from his service as a pilotin Vietnam.

460
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:15,586
Others have a more unusual theory.

461
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,429
How would you describe Mr Casse?

462
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:20,031
- Keeps to himself. Quiet.
- Private.

463
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,426
When they took him up in the spaceship,...

464
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:24,985
..the aliens abused him...

465
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,156
..sexually.

466
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,228
Mr Casse is in the county lockup...

467
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:31,308
Pack up. We're leaving.

468
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,351
He maybe released later tonight...

469
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:37,473
Miguel, what about Dad?

470
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,388
This could be our last night on Earth.

471
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:44,745
You don't wanna die a virgin,... do you?

472
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,348
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not goin' anywhere.

473
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:48,836
Miguel!

474
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,434
Stop it!

475
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,027
Thanks a lot, partner!

476
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:01,671
You read my mind!

477
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:03,666
Stay here.

478
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,394
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

479
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:09,470
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

480
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:12,467
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

481
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,193
Come on, boy!

482
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:16,266
We're leavin'... without you.

483
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,753
We're goin' to live with
Uncle Hector in Tucson.

484
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,826
Ph...

485
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:23,668
Hector!

486
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:26,792
Like hell you are! I'm still your father.

487
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,752
No, you're not.

488
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:31,144
You're just the man who married my mother.

489
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,191
You're nothin' to me!

490
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,072
Oh...

491
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:38,507
Oh!

492
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,266
Well, what about Troy?

493
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,266
- Troy?
- Yeah.

494
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:46,984
For once in your life, why don't you
think about what's best for him?

495
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:50,033
Who has to beg for money to buy him
medicine when you screw up? Huh?

496
00:34:50,115 --> 00:34:52,390
Who? Who?!

497
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:53,828
You stop it right now!

498
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:56,706
I'm not a baby any more!

499
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:01,153
I don't want your stupid medicine
because I'm so sick of medicine!

500
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:03,835
Do you know what this stuff costs?

501
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,826
Do you wanna get sick again?

502
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,386
Do you?

503
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:13,424
The LAPD is asking Los Angelenos
not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.

504
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,904
You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.

505
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:21,032
Do you think we can find something better
to do with our time?

506
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:22,833
Where you been, Stevie?

507
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,270
Man, this is unbelievable. This is, like, huge.

508
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:29,746
- They've recalled everybody.
- Looks like the mail's still working.

509
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:33,227
Oh! Oh, oh...

510
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:36,227
Uh... You'll have to
do the honours for me, man.

511
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:38,829
- You're a wuss!
- Whatever. Shut up and read it.

512
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:42,871
It says... "Captain Steven Hiller"...

513
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:43,910
..loser.

514
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,668
- Come on, come on!
- Blah blah blah blah!

515
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,511
"We regret to inform you that...

516
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,314
..despite your excellent record of service..."

517
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:55,989
I'm sorry, man.

518
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,586
You know what you need to do?

519
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:02,270
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world.

520
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,346
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

521
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:06,426
See, I like the one-knee approach..

522
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:10,428
..because it puts the booty,
like, right in front of the lip...

523
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:13,029
- What's this?
- That's nothin'.

524
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:14,104
What is this?

525
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,389
Jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins.

526
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,194
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

527
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,269
I thought you said
you were gonna break it all off?

528
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:29,152
Yes...

529
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:34,065
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

530
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:36,146
You know that, right?

531
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:44,425

532
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:54,351
It could only happen in California.
Here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.

533
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:58,346
Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered
on rooftops in Los Angeles...

534
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,344
..to welcome the new arrivals.

535
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,788
Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!

536
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:06,786
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

537
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:08,829
Oh, I must have been trippin'.

538
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:10,869
It's the party event of the century!

539
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:13,421
Everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.

540
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:16,232
- This is so cool!
- Girl, please!

541
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:18,873
Oh, hey!
I made it before I came in tonight.

542
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,392
Check it out!

543
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,590
Now, I know you're not
thinking about joining those idiots.

544
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:28,665
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

545
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,630
- Do you wanna come?
- Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

546
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,544
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

547
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:38,703
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got
when I went to Las Vegas?

548
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:42,909
Yeah. And I was right. You didn't get the job
and you lost all your money gambling.

549
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:45,983
Yeah, but I wasn't in LA for the earthquake.

550
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:49,301
Tiff, I really don't want you to go up there.

551
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,700
- Now promise me you won't.
- Oh!

552
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,827
Come on, girl! Promise me.

553
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,703
I promise.

554
00:37:57,911 --> 00:37:58,900
OK.

555
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:01,020
Look...

556
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,705
I'm going. I'm out of town for a while.

557
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:06,502
- Later.
- Bye.

558
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:09,302
Hey, there's my angel. Come on.

559
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,462
Come on, Boomer. Let's go.

560
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:13,303
Hey, talk to your boyfriend later.

561
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,428
Hey! What the hell's the kid doin' here? Huh?
Get outta here!

562
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,389
- You try finding a sitter today.
- Hey! Where are you going?

563
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:23,180
- You leave... You're fired.
- Nice workin' with you, Mario.

564
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,901
Come on, Boomer.

565
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:35,343
Everyone is trying to get out of Washington.
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.

566
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,022
What the hell is that?

567
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:48,622
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

568
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,903
Sometimes it's her first initial,
sometimes her nickname...

569
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:54,819
- Sometimes just her...
- Oy, my God!

570
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:56,817
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

571
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:58,339

572
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:01,899
- Pit stops!
- Tell them!

573
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:05,061
Slow down!

574
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:06,905
A ramp!

575
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:10,455
Slow down!

576
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,222
- Oh! We made it! We made it!
- Good.

577
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:18,179
Nice drivin', Pops.

578
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:20,065
Well...

579
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:25,898
- So, not listed, huh?
- No, no. I just haven't found it yet. Um...

580
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:29,615
I tried C. Spano, Connie...
Spano, Spunky... Spano...

581
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:30,855
Spunky?

582
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,779
- College nickname.
- Uh-huh. Cute.

583
00:39:36,426 --> 00:39:38,656
- You tried Levinson?
- She didn't take my name.

584
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:41,419
- Why would she... What do you mean?
- Try it.

585
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,184
OK. Here. Look.

586
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,624
So what do I know? Hm?

587
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:51,696

588
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:01,775
So?

589
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:04,860
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should I?

590
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,663

591
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:10,499
- Oh, perfect, she's using it.
- What? It's busy?

592
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:15,705
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

593
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:18,219
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

594
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:21,024
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

595
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,333
Take care.

596
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:24,416
The President
remains at the White House.

597
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,019
Question. Are Mr Whitmore's actions...

598
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:29,096
..a) ultra brave...

599
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,574
- ..or b) fool hardy?

600
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:34,254
- What?
- Don'thang up, sweetie.

601
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:36,575
David! How did you get this number?

602
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:40,817
- Do me a favour. Walk to the window.
- And I'm looking for what?

603
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,782
You'll see.

604
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:44,776
Over here.

605
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:47,975
See us?

606
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:49,896
How does he do that?

607
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:02,014
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors,...

608
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:05,381
..Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter...

609
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,774
..with a visual communications device.

610
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,858
- Mr President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

611
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:14,584
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing lift off.

612
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,384
..and refitted
with these enormous light panels...

613
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:19,933
..that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

614
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:22,220
Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.

615
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:24,341
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

616
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:27,735
Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.

617
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:30,419
This is something I would never believe
that I would be!

618
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,496
In the White House! Look at this!

619
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:36,137
If I knew I was gonna meet the President,
I would have worn a tie.

620
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:38,216
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

621
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:41,504
Oy, my God!

622
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:46,420
- David, I don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.

623
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,656
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

624
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:52,213
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

625
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,500
- The President!
- He wasn't president then.

626
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,099
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!

627
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:59,096
A fight that you started!

628
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:01,016
David thought I was having an affair.

629
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:03,016
- With the President?
- Which I wasn't!

630
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,380
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

631
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:08,537
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

632
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:11,296
You punched the President?

633
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:12,454
God!

634
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:22,140
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

635
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:26,136
- We're closing in.
- Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.

636
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,214
This I like.

637
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:33,134
Look at this!

638
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:35,657
You know what famous people
have been here? Hm?

639
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:36,653
Yes, Dad.

640
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:38,734
Politicians... Actors...

641
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,893
Baseball players, singers...

642
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:42,780
And now me!

643
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,379
Imagine that! "A poor immigrant like me..."

644
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,499
- "It's a dream!"
- Sh! David, please!

645
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,893
The three choppers are approaching...

646
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,693
..what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...

647
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:58,340
You're leaving now?

648
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,812
Hey, see if they've got
those pens they give away.

649
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:02,052
Dad, what?

650
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:03,735
I don't have a choice...

651
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:07,941
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

652
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:10,617
Mr President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

653
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:13,854
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

654
00:43:13,943 --> 00:43:16,411
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

655
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,817
Uh... I know why we have satellite disruption.

656
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:25,662
All right. Go ahead.

657
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,335
OK.

658
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:19,776
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

659
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:33,816
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

660
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,178
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

661
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:41,176
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

662
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:45,495
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

663
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,700
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...

664
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:51,653
..our own satellite system.

665
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:56,775
Excuse me, Mr President. They're starting.

666
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,971
They're using our own satellites against us.

667
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:06,782
The clock is ticking.

668
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,294
- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon,...

669
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:15,734
..Echo One. Approaching alien ship.

670
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,409
Initiating communication sequence.

671
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:23,294
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

672
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:31,332
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.

673
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,695
- Tell them to evacuate people from the cities.
- Yes, sir.

674
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:37,691
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

675
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:39,929
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

676
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,293
Kim! My daughter.

677
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,134
Uh... There's something happening here.

678
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:50,576
They're responding.

679
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,377
Something is happening.

680
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:58,848
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.

681
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:00,975
We see it, too. Can't identify it.

682
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:16,094
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

683
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,893
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

684
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:25,088
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

685
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,018
Nice. Very nice.

686
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,374
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

687
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,972
We have our own phone.

688
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:36,372
Move outta here.

689
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:41,369
The President's ordered an evacuation.

690
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,178
Our prayers go out to the pilots'families.

691
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,614
- Indeed, God help us all.
- Mrs Whitmore.

692
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:49,259
The visitors responded with terrifying...

693
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:53,093
Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.

694
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:56,410
People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.

695
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:58,490
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me.

696
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:07,216
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

697
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:11,850
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

698
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,733
- Can we move it along?
- Dr Katz's office.

699
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,936
- Hello. Dr Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

700
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,375
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

701
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:47,291
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

702
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:50,975
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

703
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,010
Mrs Whitmore!

704
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:57,250
You mustleave now.

705
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,175
The First Lady's secured. We're on the move.

706
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:16,936
They're opening up!

707
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:30,169
It's so pretty.

708
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,612
Get the hell outta here!

709
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:13,896
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

710
00:48:13,979 --> 00:48:16,129
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

711
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,051
Here.

712
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:36,692
Time's up.

713
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,697
Oh, crap.

714
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:15,094
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

715
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:17,258
Come on, Boomer!

716
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:56,488
Boomer!

717
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:00,969
Boomer!

718
00:52:27,899 --> 00:52:30,811
Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation,...

719
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:34,209
..but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.

720
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:36,449
Good God!

721
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:38,018
I've been sayin' it.

722
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,648
I've been sayin' it for ten damn years!
Ain't l, Miguel?

723
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:43,730
Huh? I've been sayin' it!

724
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:46,973
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.

725
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:48,287
Pull it over, man.

726
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:55,134

727
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:00,174
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

728
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:05,373
Miguel!

729
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:08,130
Look at all that.

730
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,691
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

731
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:37,933
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

732
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,608
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

733
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:45,651
This is just...

734
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,769
..not simple any more.

735
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,650
A lot of people died today.

736
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,530
How many didn't have to?

737
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:02,892
Any news on my wife yet?

738
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:07,177
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

739
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,370
No radio contact.

740
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,810
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

741
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:31,097
Here it is.

742
00:54:54,779 --> 00:54:56,770
What happened, Mommy?

743
00:54:58,779 --> 00:55:00,735
I don't know, baby.

744
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,499
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

745
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:05,570
Our target is to the north,...

746
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:08,856
..centred above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

747
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,850
Our Black Knight Squadron...

748
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:13,248
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

749
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:16,650
- You?
- Nope.

750
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,972
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.

751
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,055
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

752
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:28,654
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.

753
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:30,252

754
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:32,332
You'll get your chance.

755
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:34,776
You'll all get your chance.

756
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:36,577
Good hunting.

757
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,168
Dismissed!

758
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:41,652
Let's kick the tyres and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

759
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,130
Ready to go, sir!

760
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:47,732
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, Captain!

761
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,730
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

762
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:54,290
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

763
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:58,167
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

764
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,851
I'm all ears, brother!

765
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:09,693
You the man!

766
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:18,176
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

767
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:21,452
General Grey here.

768
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:22,574
Al?

769
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:25,332
All communications with the cities are down.

770
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:28,775
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

771
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,373
How about our boys? Where are they?

772
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,094
ETA to target, four minutes.

773
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,537
I shouldn't have left her.

774
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,450
Don't worry about it, big man.

775
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:48,531
I'm sure she got outta here
before it happened.

776
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:51,736
Or, as the good Reverend would say,...

777
00:56:51,819 --> 00:56:55,892
.."Why we're on
this particular mission, we'll never know."

778
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,812
"But I do know, here today,...

779
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:02,050
..that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."

780
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:05,176
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.

781
00:57:18,379 --> 00:57:20,256
Holy God!

782
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:25,497
Lock and load!

783
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:29,049
Roger that.

784
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:31,972
LA attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

785
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:34,698
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock-on.

786
00:57:34,779 --> 00:57:35,768
Fire at will.

787
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:37,850
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

788
00:57:39,419 --> 00:57:42,695
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

789
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:44,937
Knight Three, fox three!

790
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:46,898
Knight Seven, fox three.

791
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,698
Missiles have been fired.

792
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,933
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.

793
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:16,011
Command, Knight One.
Switchin' to Sidewinders, moving in.

794
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:22,497
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

795
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:25,732
Knight Seven, 120.

796
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:28,253
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

797
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,294
Knight Seven...

798
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,088
Come on, come on!

799
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:44,209
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!

800
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,576
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

801
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,331
Pull up!

802
00:58:54,419 --> 00:58:55,772
Agh!

803
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,577
Blow through, blow through!

804
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:06,968
Too many of 'em!

805
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:10,291
They got another one, sir.

806
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:16,371
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

807
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:21,170
I got ya covered, Big Daddy!

808
00:59:24,419 --> 00:59:26,011
Damn, they got shields, too!

809
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:39,089
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

810
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:45,013
Jesus!

811
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,010
They got another one, sir. And two more.

812
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,374
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing it.

813
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:51,415
All right, get 'em outta there.

814
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:56,095
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission right away!

815
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:02,775
We're gonna have to make a run for this one!
Let's get low and fast!

816
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:04,850
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get 'em!

817
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:06,338
Whoo!

818
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:08,174
Watch the deck!

819
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:20,088
- Squadron leader, abort! Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

820
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:21,248
Get 'em out!

821
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:31,096
- The monitor! Where's the picture?
- We've lost the satellite.

822
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,894
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

823
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:41,690
Come on, come on! Move, move, move!

824
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:47,370
- You told me, like, quite all right!
- They ain't got nothin' for us! Let's push it!

825
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:51,577
- I can't shake 'em.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

826
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:54,127
- I'm gonna try somethin'.
- Nothin' stupid!

827
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:55,777
- You know me!
- That's what I mean.

828
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:58,931
- Ahhh!
- Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

829
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:03,091
- Jimmy, he's closing on you!

830
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:07,616
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- I can't breathe!

831
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,537
Jimmy!

832
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:12,089
Jimmy!

833
01:01:14,899 --> 01:01:16,298
Jimmy, no!

834
01:01:16,419 --> 01:01:18,330
Affirmative. We have incoming.

835
01:01:18,419 --> 01:01:20,808
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

836
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:22,218
Friendly?

837
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:24,248
Sergeant?

838
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:26,375
I don't think so.

839
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:30,009

840
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:53,932
Come on and get me!

841
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:00,491
What are you shooting at?

842
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:03,218
Where you at, baby?! Come on! Come on!

843
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:09,573
You can't hit nothin'!

844
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:27,928
Whoa! Low bridge!

845
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:35,133
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

846
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:40,170
Ha-ha! Hope you got an airbag!

847
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:43,537
Whoo!

848
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:05,611

849
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:09,891
Ahh!

850
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:18,210
Son of a bitch!

851
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,897
Ahhhh!

852
01:03:21,979 --> 01:03:23,776
This way! This way!

853
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:25,656
Get off! Get off of me!

854
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:27,650
That's what you'll get! Ha-ha!

855
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:29,092
Look at you!

856
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:32,216
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

857
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:35,132
Huh? Who's the man?!
Wait till I get another plane!

858
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:37,687
I'm linin' all your friends up, right beside you!

859
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:41,819
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

860
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:55,210
Welcome to Earth.

861
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:15,133
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

862
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:25,684
Keys. Come on, keys.

863
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:27,649
Yes!

864
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:30,454
Come, baby, come on. Come on!

865
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:31,365
- Yes!

866
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:36,291
Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world...

867
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,931
..with the same results.

868
01:04:38,693 --> 01:04:42,606
You're just like your mother, you know that?
She was stubborn, too.

869
01:04:42,693 --> 01:04:45,844
I had to twist her arm
to get her to take her medicine.

870
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:46,922

871
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:50,210
- You're gonna be all right.
- You're gonna be fine.

872
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:55,567
See, Troy? You're feelin' better already.

873
01:04:56,293 --> 01:05:00,332
I couldn't find anything.
Everyone's packin' up. They're leavin'.

874
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:03,803
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave, too, then.

875
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:04,723

876
01:05:06,213 --> 01:05:08,408
Penicillin. It'll help keep his fever down.

877
01:05:08,493 --> 01:05:11,610
Thank you. It's really nice of you to help us.

878
01:05:11,693 --> 01:05:14,048
I wish I could do more, but we're moving out.

879
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:16,404
I-I'm going with you.

880
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:23,162
Um... Well... I-I just mean that...
that we're going, too.

881
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,322
Cool.

882
01:05:24,413 --> 01:05:28,691
Tell that punk to shut the door, we're outta
here. He can sniff around somewhere else.

883
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:29,922
- Bye.
- Bye.

884
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,608

885
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,248
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

886
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,241
I don't feel too good.

887
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,207
Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

888
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:47,246
Could be bad weather or good weather.

889
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,048
We could go up or down.

890
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:52,088
We could go back, we could go forwards,
side to side...

891
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,287
What did I say?

892
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,644
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

893
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,924
Julius, with all of this, I, uh...

894
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:07,046
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

895
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,560
All he could think of was getting to you.

896
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,561
There's still love there, I think.

897
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,761
Love was never a problem.

898
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,281
All you need is love.

899
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,766
John Lennon. Smart man.

900
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,841
Shot in the back, very sad.

901
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:32,443
We've moved as many of
our forces away from our bases as possible.

902
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,808
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- I spoke with the Joint Chiefs at NORAD.

903
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:40,087
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.

904
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,649
Over American soil?

905
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:45,962
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

906
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:49,201
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

907
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,246
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

908
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:53,525
- What?
- It's gone, sir.

909
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,282
My God!

910
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:57,600
The Vice President? The Joint Chiefs?

911
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:59,681
Mr President.

912
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,609
We must launch.

913
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:06,081
A delay now would be more costly
than when you waited to evacuate the cities.

914
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:10,527
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them and us. If we fire nukes...

915
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:15,001
- Sir, may I remind you you are a guest here?
- You ever hear of nuclear winter?

916
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,923
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.

917
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,966
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

918
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,008
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

919
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,444
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!

920
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:29,646
None of you did anything to prevent this!

921
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:33,279
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

922
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,600
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.

923
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,648
It was, what?
ln the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

924
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,800
- Dad. Look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

925
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:45,006
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.

926
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:48,799
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!

927
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,120
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.

928
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,279
Where was that?

929
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,723
Area 51. Right?

930
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:57,086
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.

931
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,407
Sir.

932
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,243
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids,...

933
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:07,039
..there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

934
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,564
- Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.
- Psh...

935
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,686
And there's no recovered spaceship.

936
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,762
Uh, excuse me, Mr President...

937
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,640
That's not entirely... accurate.

938
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:25,321
What? Which part?

939
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:32,278
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

940
01:08:53,287 --> 01:08:54,766
The end hath come!

941
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:58,317
He's spaken his word and the end hath come!

942
01:08:58,407 --> 01:09:01,240
Hop on! We're headin' out to El Toro!

943
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:04,158
You cannot defy what hath come!

944
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:08,166
It's the end!

945
01:09:12,847 --> 01:09:14,439
El Toro?!

946
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,363
- Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

947
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,961
Oh, God...

948
01:09:35,887 --> 01:09:37,878

949
01:09:38,727 --> 01:09:40,877
OK, OK, let's get this off.

950
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:42,958
Here, let me help you.

951
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:47,798
She's hurt pretty badly.

952
01:09:51,803 --> 01:09:54,636
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

953
01:09:56,123 --> 01:09:57,761
But, nooo!

954
01:09:57,843 --> 01:10:02,121
You got me out here, draggin'
your heavy ass through the burnin' desert...

955
01:10:02,203 --> 01:10:05,354
..with your dreadlocks
stickin' out the back of my parachute.

956
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:08,352
You gotta come down here with an attitude,...

957
01:10:08,443 --> 01:10:10,434
..actin' all big and bad.

958
01:10:12,443 --> 01:10:14,718
And what the hell is that smell?!

959
01:10:15,563 --> 01:10:17,315
Arrrrgh!

960
01:10:18,683 --> 01:10:20,560
I coulda been at a barbecue!

961
01:10:21,803 --> 01:10:23,395
But I ain't mad.

962
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:26,914
It's all right, it's all right.

963
01:10:41,443 --> 01:10:42,478
Hey!

964
01:10:43,163 --> 01:10:45,313
Hey! Hey...

965
01:10:50,523 --> 01:10:51,512
Hey!

966
01:11:04,243 --> 01:11:06,154
Do you need a lift, soldier?

967
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:09,201
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

968
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:13,236
It ain't on the map.

969
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,439
Trust me, it's there.

970
01:11:31,323 --> 01:11:32,642
Attention!

971
01:11:36,443 --> 01:11:38,354
Mr President. General.

972
01:11:38,443 --> 01:11:41,355
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

973
01:11:42,843 --> 01:11:45,232
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface...

974
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:48,076
..and, uh... here's our main research facility.

975
01:11:48,443 --> 01:11:52,436
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free...

976
01:11:52,523 --> 01:11:54,753
Open... the door.

977
01:11:56,123 --> 01:11:57,522
Yes, sir.

978
01:12:18,483 --> 01:12:19,598
My God.

979
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:21,799
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

980
01:12:21,883 --> 01:12:25,876
Two words, Mr President.
Plausible deniability.

981
01:12:32,563 --> 01:12:34,918
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

982
01:12:35,003 --> 01:12:37,563
How do you get funding
for something like this?

983
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:40,680
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,...

984
01:12:40,763 --> 01:12:42,754
..$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

985
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:46,793
Mr President, this is Dr Okun.

986
01:12:46,883 --> 01:12:50,922
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

987
01:12:52,563 --> 01:12:53,916
How do you do?

988
01:12:54,523 --> 01:12:56,878
Mr President!

989
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:58,840
Wow!

990
01:12:58,923 --> 01:12:59,992
Uh... This...

991
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,074
What a pleasure!

992
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,281
As you can imagine, they...

993
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:06,194
They don't let us out much.

994
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,913
I can understand that.

995
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,277
Well!

996
01:13:12,683 --> 01:13:16,073
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

997
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:17,482
Follow me.

998
01:14:06,203 --> 01:14:08,478
She's a beaut, ain't she?

999
01:14:10,643 --> 01:14:15,763
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

1000
01:14:15,843 --> 01:14:18,755
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about 'em?

1001
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:20,071
Oh, hell, no.

1002
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:22,279
No, no, no, no. We know tons about 'em.

1003
01:14:23,163 --> 01:14:24,994
But the neatest stuff...

1004
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:28,041
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

1005
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:32,560
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

1006
01:14:32,643 --> 01:14:37,512
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

1007
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:41,039
The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!

1008
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,432
Exciting? People are dying out there.

1009
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:46,083
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!

1010
01:14:48,243 --> 01:14:50,598
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

1011
01:14:50,683 --> 01:14:52,992
You said you can repair their technology.

1012
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,712
- Can you tell us anything useful about them?
- Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...

1013
01:14:56,803 --> 01:14:58,919
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

1014
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:03,155
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1015
01:15:03,243 --> 01:15:05,962
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

1016
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,482
Hey...

1017
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:10,076
Hey.

1018
01:15:11,443 --> 01:15:12,956
You guys wanna see 'em?

1019
01:15:22,642 --> 01:15:24,121
Uh, this is...

1020
01:15:24,202 --> 01:15:26,193
This is the vault.

1021
01:15:26,642 --> 01:15:28,712
Or, as some of us have come to call it,...

1022
01:15:29,802 --> 01:15:31,713
..the freak show.

1023
01:15:53,202 --> 01:15:54,999
When we found 'em,...

1024
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:58,358
..they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

1025
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:01,832
Once we got 'em off,
we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

1026
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:04,120
Eyes, ears,...

1027
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:05,874
..no vocal chords.

1028
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:09,318
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

1029
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:13,441
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

1030
01:16:13,522 --> 01:16:17,231
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception. Telepathy.

1031
01:16:17,922 --> 01:16:18,911
So...

1032
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:23,073
It's an organic life form.

1033
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:27,834
Can they be killed?

1034
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:29,958
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

1035
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:32,397
These two died in the crash.

1036
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:34,313
This one a few weeks later.

1037
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:38,281
You just... have to get through
their technology, which is,...

1038
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:41,240
..I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

1039
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:43,472
David,...

1040
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,837
..you unlocked part of their technology.

1041
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:50,393
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All I did was stumble on their, um...

1042
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:53,519
..signal. I don't know
how, uh... helpful I can be.

1043
01:16:54,002 --> 01:16:56,721
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

1044
01:16:57,802 --> 01:17:00,191
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

1045
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:05,513
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1046
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,360
What code?

1047
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:38,635
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1048
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:41,316
I'm sorry, Captain. You don't have clearance.

1049
01:17:42,642 --> 01:17:44,280
OK. Come here.

1050
01:17:44,362 --> 01:17:46,034
You wanna see my clearance?

1051
01:17:48,282 --> 01:17:49,237

1052
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:51,552
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let 'em pass.

1053
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:55,630
- Let 'em pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

1054
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:58,673
Did you see that?

1055
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:01,151
Come on down.

1056
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:02,558
Watch your step.

1057
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,948
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.

1058
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:10,394
Though how they sat on them, I don't know.

1059
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:11,755
Gently.

1060
01:18:11,839 --> 01:18:14,433
- Uh... You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.

1061
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:17,955
We've been workin' around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this.

1062
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:19,950
Some stuffwe figured out right away.

1063
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:24,112
Uh... This we're pretty sure
is the life support for the cabin.

1064
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,077
And, uh...
this doohickey is connected to...

1065
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:32,753
Oh... Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will ya?

1066
01:18:33,399 --> 01:18:37,108
Uh... These configurations... uh...

1067
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:42,998
Well... To be honest,
we don't know what the hell this crap is.

1068
01:18:43,759 --> 01:18:48,833
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.

1069
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:50,910
Ha-ha! Neat, huh?

1070
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:55,356
Uh, could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?

1071
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,315
What?

1072
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,074
These patterns are repeating sequentially,
like their countdown signal.

1073
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,390
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1074
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:06,676
See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.

1075
01:19:06,759 --> 01:19:08,477
You know...

1076
01:19:08,559 --> 01:19:10,914
You're really starting to make us look bad.

1077
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,839
They got one! They got one alive!

1078
01:19:20,919 --> 01:19:22,796
- They got one - alive!
- Jesus!

1079
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,188
Uh... You'll be OK by yourself, Dave?

1080
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:26,668
Fine.

1081
01:19:26,759 --> 01:19:28,750
Uh... Don't touch anything.

1082
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:33,836
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.

1083
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,710
Oh! It's all wet...

1084
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:50,154
Right here! He's in the back of the pickup.

1085
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:58,275
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1086
01:19:58,359 --> 01:19:59,997
Guess who's comin' to dinner!

1087
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:03,671
I need a doctor. I need a doctor!

1088
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,755
Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?

1089
01:20:08,839 --> 01:20:11,228
- About three hours.
- Let's get him in containment.

1090
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:14,755
My son... he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!

1091
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:17,637
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.

1092
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:20,711
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex!
Please!

1093
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,318
If you don't do something right now,
my son will die!

1094
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,555
- Just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.

1095
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,358
You... take us to him, OK? Let's go.

1096
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:37,915
All right! Move it, move it, move it!

1097
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,392
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

1098
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:45,868
- When were you planning to inform us?
- It had been deemed classified.

1099
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:48,712
You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!

1100
01:20:48,799 --> 01:20:51,871
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack...

1101
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:54,427
..that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

1102
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:58,432
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!

1103
01:20:58,519 --> 01:20:59,713
Mr President.

1104
01:20:59,799 --> 01:21:03,428
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

1105
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:06,670
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

1106
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,477
Destroyed.

1107
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:12,677
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

1108
01:21:12,759 --> 01:21:14,158
Then we were hit.

1109
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,276
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

1110
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,429
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15%.

1111
01:21:19,519 --> 01:21:24,434
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,...

1112
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:28,512
..we're looking at the worldwide destruction
of every major city...

1113
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:31,589
..in the next 36 hours.

1114
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:35,510
We're being exterminated.

1115
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:40,837
Mr President!

1116
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:43,194
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

1117
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:44,678
- Captain.
- Mr President.

1118
01:21:44,759 --> 01:21:45,828
Well done.

1119
01:21:45,919 --> 01:21:49,116
- Where is it now?
- It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

1120
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,310
I'd like to go see it.

1121
01:21:57,519 --> 01:22:00,795
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1122
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:05,310
Hasn't anyone told you?

1123
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:10,679
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

1124
01:23:00,997 --> 01:23:03,557
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!

1125
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:06,071
Today was the first time I used the subway.

1126
01:23:06,157 --> 01:23:08,068
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

1127
01:23:08,157 --> 01:23:10,546
These should last us a while.

1128
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:12,787
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

1129
01:23:14,597 --> 01:23:16,588
He's your son?

1130
01:23:16,677 --> 01:23:18,235
He's my angel.

1131
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:21,675
Was his father stationed here?

1132
01:23:21,757 --> 01:23:23,748
Nah, he, uh...

1133
01:23:23,837 --> 01:23:25,828
He wasn't his father.

1134
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:29,556
But I was kinda hopin'
he wanted the job, though.

1135
01:23:33,837 --> 01:23:36,829
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

1136
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:39,590
Oh... Ballet...

1137
01:23:39,677 --> 01:23:42,350
No. Exotic.

1138
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:46,670
Oh... Sorry.

1139
01:23:47,117 --> 01:23:49,153
Don't be. I'm not.

1140
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:51,626
It's good money. Besides...

1141
01:23:51,717 --> 01:23:53,548
..my baby's worth it.

1142
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:55,753
Dylan! Come here.

1143
01:23:55,837 --> 01:23:57,873
I want you to meet the First Lady.

1144
01:24:01,317 --> 01:24:04,275
- Hello.
- Hi.

1145
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:06,666
I didn't know that you'd recognised me.

1146
01:24:06,757 --> 01:24:08,748
Well, I didn't want to say nothin'.

1147
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:10,714
I voted for the other guy.

1148
01:24:13,317 --> 01:24:17,788
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So ifwe screw up, it's all on tape.

1149
01:24:17,877 --> 01:24:19,105
Come on, come on.

1150
01:24:19,197 --> 01:24:20,869
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

1151
01:24:20,957 --> 01:24:23,471
Put the spreader right here, along the ridge.

1152
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:27,345
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

1153
01:24:28,037 --> 01:24:30,597
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

1154
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:32,554
Let me get in.

1155
01:24:38,437 --> 01:24:40,428
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

1156
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:43,353
Run this right in...

1157
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:49,306

1158
01:24:49,397 --> 01:24:50,591
All right. OK.

1159
01:24:50,997 --> 01:24:52,112
Let's proceed.

1160
01:24:52,877 --> 01:24:55,789
Now comes the... the really icky part.

1161
01:24:56,117 --> 01:24:57,755
Ugh!

1162
01:24:57,837 --> 01:24:59,748
Oh, boy.

1163
01:24:59,837 --> 01:25:03,227
This is one smelly, disgusting...

1164
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:12,472
Oh, look at it.

1165
01:25:12,557 --> 01:25:14,468
It doesn't look alive, does it?

1166
01:25:18,957 --> 01:25:20,470
The arm is moving.

1167
01:25:27,157 --> 01:25:28,988

1168
01:25:29,077 --> 01:25:32,035
- Agh!
- Doctor? Doctor?

1169
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:35,867
Doctor?

1170
01:25:37,357 --> 01:25:39,109
- Agh!
- Don't move!

1171
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:44,465

1172
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,271
Dr Okun?

1173
01:26:46,517 --> 01:26:49,827
Release... me.

1174
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:52,112
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.

1175
01:27:06,357 --> 01:27:08,552
Release me.

1176
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:23,277
I know there is much
we can learn from each other...

1177
01:27:23,357 --> 01:27:25,746
..if we can negotiate a truce.

1178
01:27:26,557 --> 01:27:28,787
We can find a way to coexist.

1179
01:27:30,597 --> 01:27:32,588
Can there be a peace between us?

1180
01:27:33,757 --> 01:27:35,873
Peace...

1181
01:27:37,077 --> 01:27:39,227
No peace.

1182
01:27:44,837 --> 01:27:46,828
What is it you want us to do?

1183
01:27:49,237 --> 01:27:51,034
Die.

1184
01:27:59,877 --> 01:28:01,549
Die!

1185
01:28:06,437 --> 01:28:08,029
Mr President.

1186
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:11,306
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.

1187
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,435

1188
01:28:30,317 --> 01:28:32,433
- Are you all right?
- I saw...

1189
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:34,030
..his thoughts.

1190
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:36,908
I saw what they're planning to do.

1191
01:28:39,157 --> 01:28:41,466
They're like locusts.

1192
01:28:41,557 --> 01:28:43,548
They're moving from planet to planet.

1193
01:28:43,637 --> 01:28:45,707
Their whole civilisation.

1194
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:49,346
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.

1195
01:28:51,277 --> 01:28:52,790
And we're next.

1196
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:56,550

1197
01:29:04,037 --> 01:29:05,709
Nuke 'em.

1198
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:08,828
Let's nuke the bastards.

1199
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:21,668
Just my luck. No ice.

1200
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,827
I take it you've heard?

1201
01:29:25,517 --> 01:29:27,075
Hey, toast.

1202
01:29:27,157 --> 01:29:29,148
To the end of the world.

1203
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:31,592
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

1204
01:29:31,677 --> 01:29:33,713
He didn't have any other choice.

1205
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:36,708
Well, you still believe in him.

1206
01:29:36,797 --> 01:29:38,753
Well, he's a good man.

1207
01:29:39,237 --> 01:29:40,352
Whoa... 

1208
01:29:40,437 --> 01:29:42,905
He'd better be. You left me for him.

1209
01:29:42,997 --> 01:29:45,875
Or, you know... for your career.

1210
01:29:45,957 --> 01:29:48,425
You know, it wasn'tjust my career.

1211
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:50,906
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

1212
01:29:50,997 --> 01:29:55,036
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

1213
01:29:55,117 --> 01:29:58,268
And, um... I wasn't, um...

1214
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,313
..ambitious enough for you?

1215
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:04,390
David, you could have done anything
you wanted. Research, development...

1216
01:30:04,477 --> 01:30:06,069
Honey, I was happy where I was.

1217
01:30:06,157 --> 01:30:08,830
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

1218
01:30:12,477 --> 01:30:14,547
I was part of something special.

1219
01:30:29,197 --> 01:30:31,188
Well, if it makes any difference,...

1220
01:30:31,277 --> 01:30:33,268
..I never stopped loving you.

1221
01:30:34,557 --> 01:30:36,548
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1222
01:30:54,317 --> 01:30:56,308
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

1223
01:30:56,397 --> 01:30:58,388

1224
01:31:03,437 --> 01:31:05,792
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule!

1225
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:07,390
Pick it up, man!

1226
01:31:07,477 --> 01:31:09,627
Pick it up!

1227
01:31:12,037 --> 01:31:14,631
What the hell are you doin'? Get outta there!

1228
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:17,997
I got something I gotta handle.
I'm borrowin' it.

1229
01:31:18,077 --> 01:31:19,226
No, you're not, sir.

1230
01:31:19,757 --> 01:31:21,748
Do you really wanna shoot me?

1231
01:31:23,757 --> 01:31:25,429
Just tell 'em I hit you.

1232
01:31:31,517 --> 01:31:33,553
Command, this is Retal Op.

1233
01:31:33,637 --> 01:31:36,993
Squadron is in the air.
We are on station and awaiting instructions.

1234
01:31:37,077 --> 01:31:38,795
Break formation. Head to targets.

1235
01:31:43,597 --> 01:31:45,030
Sir.

1236
01:31:45,117 --> 01:31:46,914
They're breaking formation.

1237
01:31:46,997 --> 01:31:51,115
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1238
01:31:51,197 --> 01:31:52,915
Which city will be reached first?

1239
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:56,307
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1240
01:31:56,397 --> 01:31:59,195
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

1241
01:31:59,277 --> 01:32:03,748
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1242
01:32:06,557 --> 01:32:08,468
Command, this is Neighbourhood Watch.

1243
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:09,956
We are in position.

1244
01:32:10,517 --> 01:32:12,508
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1245
01:32:12,597 --> 01:32:15,270
We are going to visual recon.

1246
01:32:15,357 --> 01:32:16,949
Roger.

1247
01:32:20,877 --> 01:32:23,471
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1248
01:32:23,557 --> 01:32:26,754
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1249
01:32:29,517 --> 01:32:31,587
Laser targeting.

1250
01:32:31,677 --> 01:32:33,076
Locked on.

1251
01:32:33,677 --> 01:32:36,396
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

1252
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:43,150
Mr President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

1253
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:51,714
- Mr President?
- Deploy.

1254
01:32:51,797 --> 01:32:54,516
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1255
01:32:54,597 --> 01:32:55,996
Here we go.

1256
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:05,430
Bird's away.

1257
01:33:05,517 --> 01:33:08,589
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.

1258
01:33:09,277 --> 01:33:10,790
Approaching.

1259
01:33:11,437 --> 01:33:13,348
May our children forgive us.

1260
01:33:13,437 --> 01:33:16,554
Five seconds to impact. Three, two,...

1261
01:33:16,637 --> 01:33:17,706
..one.

1262
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:21,509
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!

1263
01:33:26,077 --> 01:33:28,193
Get down! Get down!

1264
01:33:28,277 --> 01:33:30,916
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

1265
01:33:30,997 --> 01:33:33,795
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

1266
01:33:33,877 --> 01:33:34,866
Yes, sir!

1267
01:33:34,957 --> 01:33:38,108
- Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

1268
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:41,155
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have lost visual.

1269
01:33:41,237 --> 01:33:43,626
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1270
01:33:50,437 --> 01:33:51,950
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1271
01:33:52,037 --> 01:33:54,915
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

1272
01:33:56,877 --> 01:34:00,187
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

1273
01:34:00,277 --> 01:34:01,869
Has the target been destroyed?

1274
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:16,666
Negative.

1275
01:34:19,597 --> 01:34:21,667
Target remains.

1276
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:27,114
I repeat, targetremains.

1277
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,153
(sighs) Call the other planes back.

1278
01:34:32,237 --> 01:34:35,912
One of the bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1279
01:34:35,997 --> 01:34:38,192
I said call them back!

1280
01:34:40,797 --> 01:34:43,311
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1281
01:34:43,397 --> 01:34:47,185
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1282
01:35:24,757 --> 01:35:26,748
(Hiller) Jasmine!

1283
01:35:38,237 --> 01:35:39,909
You're late!

1284
01:35:39,997 --> 01:35:42,591
You know I like to make an entrance.

1285
01:35:51,357 --> 01:35:53,666
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

1286
01:35:53,757 --> 01:35:57,033
Mr President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1287
01:35:57,117 --> 01:36:01,554
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

1288
01:36:03,677 --> 01:36:07,511
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

1289
01:36:07,597 --> 01:36:11,067
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

1290
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:13,548
We can't stop the bleeding.

1291
01:36:14,157 --> 01:36:16,193
If we'd...

1292
01:36:16,277 --> 01:36:18,347
There's nothing we can do for her.

1293
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:22,671
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1294
01:36:27,837 --> 01:36:29,748
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1295
01:36:29,837 --> 01:36:31,828
I did?

1296
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:35,987
You just keep growing and growing.

1297
01:36:38,277 --> 01:36:39,710
I can't...

1298
01:36:41,357 --> 01:36:42,790
Hey.

1299
01:36:42,877 --> 01:36:47,155
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

1300
01:36:47,237 --> 01:36:48,716
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1301
01:36:57,997 --> 01:37:01,512
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1302
01:37:01,597 --> 01:37:03,349
Oh...

1303
01:37:04,317 --> 01:37:05,466
It's OK.

1304
01:37:07,517 --> 01:37:09,155
The doctors...

1305
01:37:10,597 --> 01:37:12,508
..think that you're...

1306
01:37:12,597 --> 01:37:14,588
..gonna be just fine.

1307
01:37:17,077 --> 01:37:18,908
Liar.

1308
01:38:12,717 --> 01:38:14,753
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1309
01:38:16,677 --> 01:38:18,076
Yeah.

1310
01:38:19,437 --> 01:38:21,428
Mommy's sleeping.

1311
01:38:24,637 --> 01:38:26,275
Hey.

1312
01:38:53,317 --> 01:38:54,545

1313
01:38:55,837 --> 01:38:56,826
David!

1314
01:38:57,357 --> 01:39:00,315
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm makin' a mess!

1315
01:39:00,397 --> 01:39:01,989
Yeah. This I can see.

1316
01:39:02,077 --> 01:39:04,637
We gotta burn this toxic waste,...

1317
01:39:04,717 --> 01:39:06,912
..pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1318
01:39:06,997 --> 01:39:09,465
Cos maybe if we screw
this planet up enough,...

1319
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:12,433
..they won't want it any more.

1320
01:39:12,517 --> 01:39:14,109
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.

1321
01:39:14,197 --> 01:39:17,314
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1322
01:39:17,397 --> 01:39:20,469
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1323
01:39:20,557 --> 01:39:22,752
David! Even myself.

1324
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:26,631
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1325
01:39:32,157 --> 01:39:34,068
You see, sometimes...

1326
01:39:34,157 --> 01:39:36,227
..we have to remember what we still have.

1327
01:39:37,557 --> 01:39:39,070
Like what?

1328
01:39:41,797 --> 01:39:44,516
Well... you still have your health.

1329
01:39:46,557 --> 01:39:48,388
David, David, you need your rest.

1330
01:39:48,477 --> 01:39:52,186
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1331
01:39:55,077 --> 01:39:57,352
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1332
01:39:57,437 --> 01:40:00,031
- Well, you see, a man...
- No, no, no.

1333
01:40:00,117 --> 01:40:04,633
- No, the other part.
- What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1334
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,469
Dahhh!

1335
01:40:09,557 --> 01:40:11,912
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1336
01:40:11,997 --> 01:40:14,830
- Genius.
- Genius?

1337
01:40:15,437 --> 01:40:17,712
My dad. A total genius.

1338
01:40:19,477 --> 01:40:21,308
Jerry, wake up.

1339
01:40:21,397 --> 01:40:24,275
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1340
01:40:28,237 --> 01:40:29,590
Look at that!

1341
01:40:29,677 --> 01:40:32,953
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1342
01:40:33,037 --> 01:40:36,393
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1343
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:38,593
They're here.

1344
01:40:38,677 --> 01:40:41,191
- All right, what's this all about?
- I have no idea.

1345
01:40:41,277 --> 01:40:42,551
Get everybody off.

1346
01:40:42,637 --> 01:40:45,788
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1347
01:40:46,317 --> 01:40:47,306
Major Mitchell.

1348
01:40:47,397 --> 01:40:49,149
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1349
01:40:49,237 --> 01:40:52,149
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1350
01:40:53,637 --> 01:40:56,390
See that, uh... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1351
01:40:56,477 --> 01:40:58,593
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1352
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,395
Do it. Shoot it.

1353
01:41:00,477 --> 01:41:03,355
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1354
01:41:09,117 --> 01:41:11,073
What the hell are you doing?!

1355
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:13,193
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1356
01:41:13,277 --> 01:41:16,508
You see, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

1357
01:41:16,597 --> 01:41:19,065
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?

1358
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:23,548
My point is, if we can't beat their defences,
then we gotta get around them.

1359
01:41:23,637 --> 01:41:27,107
Major. One more time... Any time.

1360
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:40,750
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1361
01:41:41,877 --> 01:41:45,187
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1362
01:41:45,797 --> 01:41:48,072
Are you telling us you can send out a signal...

1363
01:41:48,157 --> 01:41:50,113
..that will disable all their shields?

1364
01:41:50,197 --> 01:41:53,314
That's right.
Just like they used our satellites against us,...

1365
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:55,513
..we can use their own signal against them.

1366
01:41:55,597 --> 01:41:58,270
If we plant a virus into that mother ship,...

1367
01:41:58,357 --> 01:42:01,872
..it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1368
01:42:01,957 --> 01:42:03,788
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1369
01:42:03,877 --> 01:42:08,109
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?

1370
01:42:08,877 --> 01:42:11,152
We're... We're gonna, uh...

1371
01:42:11,757 --> 01:42:16,148
..have to... um... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1372
01:42:16,237 --> 01:42:20,025
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1373
01:42:20,117 --> 01:42:24,633
We then upload the virus, set off
some kind of explosion which'll disable it.

1374
01:42:24,717 --> 01:42:30,394
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to, uh...

1375
01:42:31,117 --> 01:42:33,870
to... take 'em... take 'em out. Take 'em down.

1376
01:42:33,957 --> 01:42:36,551
Do your... Do your stuff.

1377
01:42:36,637 --> 01:42:40,425
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1378
01:42:41,317 --> 01:42:44,195
Uh... I dunno. A matter of minutes.

1379
01:42:44,277 --> 01:42:47,508
You want us to coordinate
a worldwide counterstrike...

1380
01:42:47,597 --> 01:42:49,508
..with a window of a few minutes?

1381
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:52,953
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1382
01:42:53,037 --> 01:42:56,712
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1383
01:42:56,797 --> 01:42:59,152
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan...

1384
01:42:59,237 --> 01:43:02,866
..depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1385
01:43:03,517 --> 01:43:05,473
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1386
01:43:05,557 --> 01:43:09,266
I've seen them in action.
I'm aware of their manoeuvring capabilities.

1387
01:43:10,077 --> 01:43:13,387
With your permission, General,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1388
01:43:14,277 --> 01:43:16,472
That thing is a wreck.

1389
01:43:16,557 --> 01:43:18,548
It crash-landed back in the '50s.

1390
01:43:18,637 --> 01:43:20,912
We don't even know if it's capable off lying!

1391
01:43:20,997 --> 01:43:23,352
Jim, uh... remove the clamps.

1392
01:43:44,917 --> 01:43:46,350
Any questions?

1393
01:43:51,037 --> 01:43:52,834
Let's do it.

1394
01:43:56,037 --> 01:43:57,755
All right, you heard the President...

1395
01:43:57,837 --> 01:44:01,193
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr President.

1396
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:03,268
A virus.

1397
01:44:03,717 --> 01:44:05,548
Your idea.

1398
01:44:05,637 --> 01:44:07,628
That's right.

1399
01:44:13,117 --> 01:44:15,995
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1400
01:44:16,077 --> 01:44:19,467
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1401
01:44:26,557 --> 01:44:27,626
Whoo!

1402
01:44:27,717 --> 01:44:30,277
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1403
01:44:30,357 --> 01:44:33,155
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1404
01:44:33,237 --> 01:44:37,674
No, my mistake was to appoint a snivelling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1405
01:44:37,757 --> 01:44:40,430
- You don't understand!
- However...

1406
01:44:40,517 --> 01:44:44,032
..that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.

1407
01:44:44,117 --> 01:44:46,108
- Mr President...
- Mr Nimsiki,...

1408
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:47,596
..you're fired.

1409
01:44:51,037 --> 01:44:54,996
Let's organise every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly 'em.

1410
01:44:55,077 --> 01:44:56,396
Yes, sir.

1411
01:44:56,477 --> 01:44:57,990
He can't do that.

1412
01:44:58,077 --> 01:45:00,796
Well, he just, uh... did.

1413
01:45:04,477 --> 01:45:08,709
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1414
01:45:08,797 --> 01:45:11,516
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1415
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:15,590
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1416
01:45:15,677 --> 01:45:18,475

1417
01:45:18,557 --> 01:45:22,391
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1418
01:45:30,277 --> 01:45:32,268

1419
01:45:34,797 --> 01:45:36,788
It's from the Americans.

1420
01:45:38,117 --> 01:45:40,312
They want to organise a counter offensive!

1421
01:45:40,397 --> 01:45:43,309
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1422
01:46:04,677 --> 01:46:07,794
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions...

1423
01:46:07,877 --> 01:46:12,871
- ..in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Impressive. Considering it's all done with...

1424
01:46:12,957 --> 01:46:14,231
Morse code.

1425
01:46:14,677 --> 01:46:18,226
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1426
01:46:18,317 --> 01:46:21,468
- But what?
- Pilots are comin' up short.

1427
01:46:21,557 --> 01:46:23,468
Well, then, find 'em.

1428
01:46:23,557 --> 01:46:27,948
Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumours of military forces in hiding,...

1429
01:46:28,037 --> 01:46:32,110
..unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

1430
01:46:33,077 --> 01:46:35,432
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1431
01:46:35,517 --> 01:46:37,109
With our depleted manpower,...

1432
01:46:37,197 --> 01:46:40,428
..we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1433
01:46:40,517 --> 01:46:45,352
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1434
01:46:46,197 --> 01:46:48,552
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1435
01:46:51,117 --> 01:46:52,869
All right, guys! Listen up!

1436
01:46:52,957 --> 01:46:56,632
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1437
01:46:56,717 --> 01:46:58,867
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression,...

1438
01:46:58,957 --> 01:47:01,755
..but this is a crash course
in modern avionics.

1439
01:47:01,837 --> 01:47:04,351
- Keep it comin'.
- OK, you got it!

1440
01:47:04,437 --> 01:47:06,587
All right, listen up. Before we begin,...

1441
01:47:06,677 --> 01:47:09,874
..we need some background information
on your experience.

1442
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:11,948
Let's start with you.

1443
01:47:12,037 --> 01:47:13,231
Who, me?

1444
01:47:15,037 --> 01:47:17,346
Well, I'm, uh, Russell Casse, sir.

1445
01:47:18,597 --> 01:47:22,476
And, uh... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1446
01:47:23,157 --> 01:47:25,671
And, uh... been doing that ever since.

1447
01:47:26,197 --> 01:47:30,429
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh...

1448
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:34,671
..ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,...

1449
01:47:34,757 --> 01:47:36,713
..I have been dyin' for some payback.

1450
01:47:36,797 --> 01:47:40,870
I just want you to know
that, uh... I won't let you down.

1451
01:47:42,357 --> 01:47:44,348
You have one tactical nuclear missile...

1452
01:47:44,437 --> 01:47:47,634
..we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1453
01:47:47,717 --> 01:47:49,673
This is the firing mechanism.

1454
01:47:49,757 --> 01:47:52,225
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1455
01:47:52,317 --> 01:47:54,467
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1456
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:57,025
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1457
01:47:58,077 --> 01:48:00,875
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1458
01:48:01,837 --> 01:48:03,395
Good luck, gentlemen.

1459
01:48:04,397 --> 01:48:05,750
30 seconds.

1460
01:48:05,837 --> 01:48:09,910
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1461
01:48:09,997 --> 01:48:12,830
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1462
01:48:12,917 --> 01:48:16,512
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1463
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:20,108
Why you? David!

1464
01:48:20,517 --> 01:48:22,985
I don't... I don't understand...

1465
01:48:23,077 --> 01:48:26,672
..why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1466
01:48:26,757 --> 01:48:28,475
No, no. Something may go wrong.

1467
01:48:28,557 --> 01:48:31,355
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1468
01:48:31,437 --> 01:48:34,986
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1469
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:41,588
Here's my chance.

1470
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:45,908
Now he gets ambitious.

1471
01:48:46,477 --> 01:48:49,196
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1472
01:48:49,277 --> 01:48:51,950
OK. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1473
01:48:52,037 --> 01:48:54,073
So. How do I look?

1474
01:48:55,237 --> 01:48:57,705
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1475
01:48:59,757 --> 01:49:02,715
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1476
01:49:02,797 --> 01:49:05,595
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1477
01:49:06,237 --> 01:49:09,832
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1478
01:49:09,917 --> 01:49:11,908
Sorry for what, babe?

1479
01:49:12,557 --> 01:49:15,629
I should have done this a long time ago.

1480
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:18,993
- Do you have the ring?
- Uh... Yes, sir.

1481
01:49:19,077 --> 01:49:21,910
- Here, make yourself useful.
- Ow!

1482
01:49:24,277 --> 01:49:25,266
Witnesses?

1483
01:49:25,357 --> 01:49:27,348
Um...

1484
01:49:28,277 --> 01:49:32,111
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1485
01:49:32,197 --> 01:49:35,872
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God...

1486
01:49:35,957 --> 01:49:38,710
..and in the presence of these witnesses...

1487
01:49:38,797 --> 01:49:41,675
..to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1488
01:49:41,757 --> 01:49:45,591
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,...

1489
01:49:45,677 --> 01:49:49,067
..please speak now
or for ever hold your peace.

1490
01:49:51,517 --> 01:49:54,987
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,...

1491
01:49:55,077 --> 01:49:58,035
..to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1492
01:49:58,877 --> 01:50:03,473
Will you love her, comfort her, honour
and keep her in sickness and in health,...

1493
01:50:03,557 --> 01:50:05,787
..and, forsaking all others,...

1494
01:50:05,877 --> 01:50:09,711
..keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1495
01:50:10,157 --> 01:50:12,148
I will.

1496
01:50:12,997 --> 01:50:14,316
Whoo!

1497
01:50:23,077 --> 01:50:25,068
Good morning.

1498
01:50:28,437 --> 01:50:30,428
They're a little young.

1499
01:50:31,077 --> 01:50:33,068
That they are.

1500
01:50:34,277 --> 01:50:36,268
They look a little nervous.

1501
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:39,869
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1502
01:50:41,197 --> 01:50:43,836
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1503
01:50:45,237 --> 01:50:46,829
Good morning.

1504
01:50:48,437 --> 01:50:49,870
Good morning.

1505
01:50:52,597 --> 01:50:54,827
In less than an hour,...

1506
01:50:54,917 --> 01:50:59,433
..aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1507
01:50:59,517 --> 01:51:04,875
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1508
01:51:06,637 --> 01:51:07,672
Mankind.

1509
01:51:07,757 --> 01:51:11,466
That... word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1510
01:51:12,957 --> 01:51:16,029
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1511
01:51:17,917 --> 01:51:20,511
We will be united in our common interest.

1512
01:51:21,317 --> 01:51:25,196
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1513
01:51:26,357 --> 01:51:29,508
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1514
01:51:30,757 --> 01:51:33,829
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1515
01:51:36,317 --> 01:51:38,308
But from annihilation.

1516
01:51:39,237 --> 01:51:41,467
We're fighting for our right to live.

1517
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:44,436
To exist.

1518
01:51:45,557 --> 01:51:47,548
And should we win the day,...

1519
01:51:48,397 --> 01:51:52,549
..the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,...

1520
01:51:53,677 --> 01:51:56,589
..but as the day
when the world declared in one voice,...

1521
01:51:56,677 --> 01:51:59,066
.."We will not go quietly into the night!"

1522
01:51:59,877 --> 01:52:02,710
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

1523
01:52:03,637 --> 01:52:05,628
"We're going to live on!"

1524
01:52:06,197 --> 01:52:08,188
"We're going to survive!"

1525
01:52:08,957 --> 01:52:12,870
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1526
01:52:12,957 --> 01:52:14,948

1527
01:52:15,597 --> 01:52:16,746
Yeah!

1528
01:52:36,797 --> 01:52:39,357
- Let's go!
- Mr President. Right this way, sir.

1529
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:41,953
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1530
01:52:42,037 --> 01:52:46,189
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here.
You've got your choice of helmets.

1531
01:52:48,597 --> 01:52:51,270
Mr President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1532
01:52:51,797 --> 01:52:53,867
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1533
01:52:56,037 --> 01:52:58,107
I belong in the air.

1534
01:53:04,397 --> 01:53:06,911
OK, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1535
01:53:10,037 --> 01:53:13,074
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1536
01:53:20,477 --> 01:53:22,707
Here. Take these.

1537
01:53:26,237 --> 01:53:27,795
Just in case.

1538
01:53:28,197 --> 01:53:29,471
Where's... Where's...

1539
01:53:40,077 --> 01:53:41,795
Just in case.

1540
01:53:44,157 --> 01:53:45,909
I'm very proud of you.

1541
01:53:57,277 --> 01:53:59,347
Be careful, OK?

1542
01:54:05,557 --> 01:54:06,910
It's time.

1543
01:54:12,237 --> 01:54:13,431
I love you.

1544
01:54:13,797 --> 01:54:15,469
I love you.

1545
01:54:20,317 --> 01:54:22,785
Oh, damn! Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1546
01:54:22,877 --> 01:54:25,550
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't...
- Here! Here!

1547
01:54:25,637 --> 01:54:27,628
Take these. My last two.

1548
01:54:28,557 --> 01:54:30,707
You are a lifesaver.

1549
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:33,552
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1550
01:54:50,317 --> 01:54:51,636

1551
01:55:00,197 --> 01:55:02,313
- Missile launch.
- Oh, crap!

1552
01:55:02,957 --> 01:55:04,470
What do I hit? Which one?

1553
01:55:06,637 --> 01:55:09,231
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinkin'.

1554
01:55:23,957 --> 01:55:26,187
This is our victory dance.

1555
01:55:26,277 --> 01:55:28,268
Not until the fat lady sings.

1556
01:55:28,357 --> 01:55:30,825
Oh. Yes, OK.

1557
01:55:30,917 --> 01:55:32,316
This is important.

1558
01:55:32,397 --> 01:55:34,752
Fat lady. I gotcha.

1559
01:55:36,677 --> 01:55:38,668
Open launch tunnel.

1560
01:55:57,357 --> 01:56:00,155
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1561
01:56:00,237 --> 01:56:02,956
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.

1562
01:56:03,037 --> 01:56:04,436
Yeah. Is it?

1563
01:56:07,957 --> 01:56:09,185
Let's rock'n'roll.

1564
01:56:11,557 --> 01:56:12,672
Ohh!

1565
01:56:15,637 --> 01:56:16,831
Oops.

1566
01:56:16,917 --> 01:56:19,067
Oops? What does that mean?

1567
01:56:19,157 --> 01:56:21,990
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1568
01:56:22,077 --> 01:56:24,875
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1569
01:56:24,957 --> 01:56:27,346
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1570
01:56:27,837 --> 01:56:30,226
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

1571
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:31,830
That away!

1572
01:56:38,557 --> 01:56:40,752
I have got to get me one of these!

1573
01:56:49,317 --> 01:56:53,754
- No, no. What was that? Don't do that!
- Just tryin' to get a feel for the old girl.

1574
01:56:53,837 --> 01:56:55,589
No, no, don't. Leave her alone.

1575
01:56:56,157 --> 01:56:58,034
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!

1576
01:56:58,117 --> 01:56:59,345

1577
01:57:02,357 --> 01:57:04,825
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1578
01:57:04,917 --> 01:57:08,193
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1579
01:57:08,277 --> 01:57:10,950
- Which way they headed?
- I think our secret's out.

1580
01:57:11,037 --> 01:57:12,834
They're headed straight for us.

1581
01:57:12,917 --> 01:57:15,306
ETA, 26 minutes.

1582
01:57:15,397 --> 01:57:17,388

1583
01:57:18,317 --> 01:57:20,069
You still with me over there?

1584
01:57:20,157 --> 01:57:22,387
What the hell was I thinking? Ohh!

1585
01:57:32,957 --> 01:57:35,630
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1586
01:57:46,677 --> 01:57:48,668
Head straight for it.

1587
01:57:54,277 --> 01:57:56,632
- What the hell...?
- Don't touch 'em. Don't, don't!

1588
01:57:56,717 --> 01:57:58,309
I was counting on this.

1589
01:57:58,397 --> 01:58:00,388
They are bringing us in.

1590
01:58:01,317 --> 01:58:05,071
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1591
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:09,386
We've got to work on our communication.

1592
01:58:23,757 --> 01:58:25,827
We have visual.

1593
01:58:25,917 --> 01:58:28,033
Do not engage until we've confirmed...

1594
01:58:28,117 --> 01:58:30,187
- ..the package has been delivered.
- Roger.

1595
01:58:35,437 --> 01:58:37,997
Major, what happens ifthat thing gets here...

1596
01:58:38,557 --> 01:58:40,593
..before the virus is planted?

1597
01:58:40,677 --> 01:58:43,237
This facility's buried
deep within a mountain.

1598
01:58:43,317 --> 01:58:46,115
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1599
01:58:46,197 --> 01:58:48,188
What about the people outside?

1600
01:58:55,637 --> 01:58:57,753
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1601
01:59:54,677 --> 01:59:56,030
Oh, my God.

1602
02:00:27,837 --> 02:00:29,236
Look at that.

1603
02:00:38,717 --> 02:00:40,514
There must be thousands of 'em.

1604
02:00:40,597 --> 02:00:43,157
Millions of 'em. What the hell are they doing?

1605
02:00:43,917 --> 02:00:46,192
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1606
02:01:12,597 --> 02:01:15,430
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1607
02:01:15,517 --> 02:01:17,473
No, no. This thing comes fully loaded.

1608
02:01:17,557 --> 02:01:20,390
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...

1609
02:01:20,477 --> 02:01:22,433
..power windows.

1610
02:01:37,597 --> 02:01:39,110
Come on, baby.

1611
02:01:41,477 --> 02:01:43,468
We're in.

1612
02:01:48,517 --> 02:01:50,235
Do it. Do it.

1613
02:01:50,517 --> 02:01:51,666
Do it.

1614
02:01:51,757 --> 02:01:53,952
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1615
02:01:54,037 --> 02:01:56,153
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1616
02:01:56,237 --> 02:01:58,228
Stand by to engage.

1617
02:01:59,557 --> 02:02:01,707
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1618
02:02:05,677 --> 02:02:07,872
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1619
02:02:07,957 --> 02:02:10,152
We need you to grab everything you can.

1620
02:02:10,237 --> 02:02:13,946
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1621
02:02:16,957 --> 02:02:18,470
The virus is in.

1622
02:02:24,117 --> 02:02:26,790
All we can do now is... pray.

1623
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:31,386
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!

1624
02:02:31,477 --> 02:02:33,707
Eagle One. Fox three.

1625
02:02:37,637 --> 02:02:39,309
Gentlemen, this is it.

1626
02:02:42,557 --> 02:02:44,275
Come on, come on, come on.

1627
02:02:56,717 --> 02:02:58,514
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1628
02:02:58,597 --> 02:03:00,474
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.

1629
02:03:00,557 --> 02:03:02,548
Rear flank, followsuit.

1630
02:03:03,797 --> 02:03:06,311
Hold on, Command.

1631
02:03:06,397 --> 02:03:09,753
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1632
02:03:09,837 --> 02:03:13,307
Eagle One. Fox three.

1633
02:03:26,797 --> 02:03:29,595
- Direct hit!
- It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!

1634
02:03:29,677 --> 02:03:31,076
Fire at will!

1635
02:03:31,157 --> 02:03:33,796
We're going in. Squadron leaders, take flight.

1636
02:03:35,357 --> 02:03:37,154
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1637
02:03:37,237 --> 02:03:39,193
Eagle One. Fox two.

1638
02:03:39,277 --> 02:03:40,710
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1639
02:03:49,317 --> 02:03:52,514
Evasive manoeuvres!
Squadron leaders, evasive manoeuvres!

1640
02:03:53,117 --> 02:03:54,550
Prepare to engage!

1641
02:03:59,317 --> 02:04:02,548
All right, Mr President! Here we go!

1642
02:04:02,637 --> 02:04:04,593
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1643
02:04:06,557 --> 02:04:08,752
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

1644
02:04:10,597 --> 02:04:12,792
OK. Job's done. Let's go home.

1645
02:04:13,277 --> 02:04:14,949
Gladly.

1646
02:04:18,357 --> 02:04:19,392
What's up?

1647
02:04:19,957 --> 02:04:21,072
It's stuck.

1648
02:04:21,157 --> 02:04:23,227
- What?
- It's not responding. It's stuck.

1649
02:04:23,317 --> 02:04:24,591
Try it again.

1650
02:04:38,837 --> 02:04:41,032
Come on, come on!

1651
02:04:56,637 --> 02:04:58,434
Come on, come on! lnside!

1652
02:04:58,517 --> 02:05:01,395
- Go to the elevator!
- Hurry!

1653
02:05:12,157 --> 02:05:13,636
Steve! Steve!

1654
02:05:19,037 --> 02:05:21,790
- What are you doin'?
- They're overriding the system.

1655
02:05:22,677 --> 02:05:24,110
Oh, shit!

1656
02:05:24,197 --> 02:05:26,108
Um... Hide.

1657
02:05:28,554 --> 02:05:30,112

1658
02:05:31,914 --> 02:05:34,303
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1659
02:05:35,194 --> 02:05:36,309
Come on in.

1660
02:05:37,314 --> 02:05:39,350

1661
02:05:39,874 --> 02:05:41,273
I'm not Jewish.

1662
02:05:41,354 --> 02:05:42,469
Nobody's perfect.

1663
02:05:44,594 --> 02:05:45,663

1664
02:05:46,554 --> 02:05:49,022
God! Where are they?

1665
02:05:49,114 --> 02:05:51,105

1666
02:05:57,634 --> 02:05:59,943
This could be our last night on Earth.

1667
02:06:02,794 --> 02:06:04,785
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1668
02:06:10,394 --> 02:06:13,431
If we do, we'll both die virgins.

1669
02:06:13,914 --> 02:06:15,905
But at least we'll be together.

1670
02:06:24,154 --> 02:06:25,985
Are you scared?

1671
02:06:26,594 --> 02:06:27,743
Me, too.

1672
02:06:29,474 --> 02:06:31,624
Eagle Seven, fox two.

1673
02:06:31,714 --> 02:06:33,944
Eagle Three, fox two.

1674
02:06:39,074 --> 02:06:42,589
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.

1675
02:06:42,674 --> 02:06:44,232
It's directly over us.

1676
02:06:53,034 --> 02:06:55,309
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

1677
02:06:55,394 --> 02:06:57,783
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.

1678
02:07:03,034 --> 02:07:04,865
Target at 12 o'clock!

1679
02:07:06,874 --> 02:07:08,387
My God! They're everywhere!

1680
02:07:09,874 --> 02:07:12,149
- Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
- I see 'em.

1681
02:07:15,394 --> 02:07:17,589
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1682
02:07:19,194 --> 02:07:21,662
You're outta time!
You've gotta disable it now!

1683
02:07:24,914 --> 02:07:27,303
I'm in range. Locking on.

1684
02:07:27,874 --> 02:07:30,388
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1685
02:07:39,714 --> 02:07:41,386
That is a negative impact.

1686
02:07:41,474 --> 02:07:43,510
That is an N1. Negative impact.

1687
02:07:44,154 --> 02:07:46,429
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1688
02:07:46,514 --> 02:07:47,993
I'm on it.

1689
02:07:50,394 --> 02:07:51,952
Oh, Jesus!

1690
02:07:54,194 --> 02:07:57,584
- Sir, all missiles have been fired.
- Outta time! Get your ass outta there!

1691
02:07:57,674 --> 02:08:00,063
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1692
02:08:00,154 --> 02:08:02,065
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1693
02:08:02,154 --> 02:08:04,224
Sorry I'm late, Mr President!

1694
02:08:07,874 --> 02:08:09,227
I got hung up back there!

1695
02:08:09,314 --> 02:08:12,545
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1696
02:08:12,634 --> 02:08:14,113
I'm packin'!

1697
02:08:15,474 --> 02:08:17,544
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1698
02:08:17,634 --> 02:08:19,864
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- It's me!

1699
02:08:19,954 --> 02:08:21,546
Russell Casse, sir.

1700
02:08:22,314 --> 02:08:24,270
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1701
02:08:24,354 --> 02:08:27,391
Just keep those guys off me
for a fewmore seconds, will ya?

1702
02:08:27,474 --> 02:08:32,389
OK. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take
flanking positions. Look after this guy, OK?

1703
02:08:32,834 --> 02:08:36,747
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr Casse some cover!

1704
02:08:36,834 --> 02:08:38,984
Gentlemen! Let's plough the road!

1705
02:08:46,634 --> 02:08:48,511
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1706
02:08:49,114 --> 02:08:51,628
Oh-ho! Look out! Comin' through!

1707
02:08:53,194 --> 02:08:54,547
I've got tone.

1708
02:08:56,594 --> 02:08:59,028
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1709
02:09:05,914 --> 02:09:07,666
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1710
02:09:10,834 --> 02:09:12,153
It's jammed.

1711
02:09:13,114 --> 02:09:14,866
It won'tfire.

1712
02:09:17,874 --> 02:09:19,273
Dammit!

1713
02:09:29,554 --> 02:09:31,545
Do me a favour.

1714
02:09:33,434 --> 02:09:37,109
Tell my children... I love them very much.

1715
02:09:40,034 --> 02:09:42,150
All right, you alien assholes!

1716
02:09:43,154 --> 02:09:45,668
In the words of my generation,...

1717
02:09:45,754 --> 02:09:49,588
..up yours!

1718
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,427
Dad! What's he doing?

1719
02:09:51,514 --> 02:09:52,833
Come on, baby!

1720
02:09:52,914 --> 02:09:54,905
Come on, baby, come on!

1721
02:09:57,794 --> 02:09:59,193
Good luck, buddy.

1722
02:10:05,754 --> 02:10:11,351
Hello, boys! I'm back!

1723
02:10:31,474 --> 02:10:33,226
He did it!

1724
02:10:33,314 --> 02:10:35,350
The son of a bitch did it!

1725
02:10:38,194 --> 02:10:39,343
All right!

1726
02:11:00,954 --> 02:11:02,945
What your father did was very brave.

1727
02:11:04,674 --> 02:11:06,471
You should be proud of him.

1728
02:11:07,154 --> 02:11:09,145
I am.

1729
02:11:25,634 --> 02:11:29,707
We know how to take 'em out, General.
Spread the word.

1730
02:11:32,594 --> 02:11:35,950
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1731
02:11:36,034 --> 02:11:39,151
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1732
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:53,743
What do you think?

1733
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:57,065
Checkmate.

1734
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:24,786
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.

1735
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,825

1736
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:39,308
It's been a pleasure.

1737
02:12:40,230 --> 02:12:42,061
Steve, you too.

1738
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:47,742
Only one thing left to do.

1739
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:54,942
Ready?

1740
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:56,668
Yes, sir.

1741
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:05,867
Hey, all right! Look at us!

1742
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:09,181
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1743
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:12,228
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for ya!
- Goodbye!

1744
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:16,265
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1745
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:18,659
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!

1746
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:25,470

1747
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:26,539
Peace!

1748
02:13:40,190 --> 02:13:42,385
We're loose.
Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds?

1749
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:43,823
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1750
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:46,344
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us outta here!

1751
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:56,299
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?

1752
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:08,025
- Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!

1753
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:13,985
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit left!

1754
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:16,823
- Where the hell do you think I'm goin'?
- OK, OK. We're...

1755
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:37,060
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!

1756
02:14:37,150 --> 02:14:40,426
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1757
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:43,980
Ahhhhh!

1758
02:14:51,590 --> 02:14:52,864
Ohhh!

1759
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:55,066
Elvis has left the building!

1760
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:57,141
Thank you very much.

1761
02:14:57,230 --> 02:14:59,221
Oh, I love you, man.

1762
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:29,621
They're goin' down all over the world, Tom.
We got 'em beat.

1763
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:32,383
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1764
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:41,309
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1765
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,979
Hold it!

1766
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:48,230
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1767
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:35,307
Sorry, sir.

1768
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:37,304
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1769
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:40,029
- Well done, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1770
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:48,305
David...

1771
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:52,382
Not bad.

1772
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:57,950
Thank you, Mr President.

1773
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:00,542
Not too bad at all.

1774
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:03,661
Oh, so this is healthy?

1775
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:06,101
Oh... I could get used to it.

1776
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:25,738
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1777
02:18:25,830 --> 02:18:27,821
Same to you, Munchkin.

1778
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:31,865
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1779
02:18:31,950 --> 02:18:33,303
Yeah.

00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:57,065
LEGENDS FOCÃO

2
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:59,751
Hi, Mike Enslin, enrolling.

3
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,451
- Wanted.
- Mr. Enslin.

4
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,954
- We feared that you didn't come.
- It is a honor to have you here.

5
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:08,152
Terrible night!

6
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:10,562
If it could feel the key,
we could speak in the morning.

7
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:12,893
He/she probably wants to know all
the history of this here.

8
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:17,232
In this stairway and where the servant if
he/she played repeatedly in 1860.

9
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,136
- There is a picture.
- We can speak about this in the morning.

10
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:21,000
This is one of the pamphlets.

11
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,644
- You wanted one.
- Probably.

12
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,507
- Does he/she see in the window?
- Yes, there this.

13
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,809
That is a picture that
a guest removed in 1986.

14
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,011
In the letter you mentioned that the
rooms with more paranormal activity...

15
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:35,647
...they were in the attic, me
could he/she give one of those rooms?

16
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:40,021
Exact, because the attic this in the 3rd floor
that was where the employees lived.

17
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,533
People say that all of the children
they died there from tuberculosis.

18
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,430
- All of them?
- The guests listen strange things.

19
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,935
After the midnight,
there is many strange noises.

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,873
The best thing than she can do is
to close the door from within.

21
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,136
Even so, it is careful and
he/she closes from within.

22
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,681
I will make this, as soon as
feel the key.

23
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,589
Here this, I number it 14.

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,021
- I come from a distance.
- Good luck.

25
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:14,289
We will see what brings the night.

26
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,127
You Clark says that she hears
people crying,

27
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:31,706
...while he/she sleeps at night
in this room and me I believe.

28
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:34,999
No, no, I have her feather.

29
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,710
She will make many delicious things.

30
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:43,007
And if he/she asks she makes you one
I plan delicious chocolate cake.

31
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:46,710
That would be very good for you.

32
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,726
Deteriorate, five skulls.

33
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,037
- Hi.
- Do I have, how this?

34
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,735
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I am here for the event.

35
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,607
This well.

36
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:17,784
- I am Michael Enslin.
- Do excuse?

37
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,388
- The signature of the book.
- Oh, yes, it is you.

38
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:26,493
- Similar, good picture.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,492
This well, wait.

40
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,592
Attention, lovers of the books.

41
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,792
This night we have a notable writer.

42
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:39,303
He/she is Michael Enslin, in the
I sing of the author, today the night.

43
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,534
He/she is the author of the best seller on
how to survive to the ghosts.

44
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:48,513
The title is 10 hotels, 10 cemeteries,

45
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,083
...and 10 cursed lights.

46
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,313
Today the night at 7 o'clock.

47
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:57,219
Good, I liked to write this,
and that is the whole history of the book.

48
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:02,964
I wait that they like, have fun
and get scared.

49
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:06,924
- Some question?
- The most frightening place that was already?

50
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,972
The most frightening place, never
they had asked me that.

51
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:15,405
That is a joke, all these
places have a lot of history.

52
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,615
If he/she had to decide, the big
top one would say the Bar Hoober.

53
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:24,984
The place of Grizzli
Mctee in the night of the murder.

54
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,485
That is an intense place,
or in San Clair, Minesota.

55
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,792
Where all of the widows threw the
babies for the well, that has an a lot, a lot.

56
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:36,494
- And the poltergeists?
- Look I am a good investigator.

57
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:42,601
I had of the whole work type, I travel
with all of the necessary equipments.

58
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:46,596
Anything I would do happier than
to try a paranormal activity.

59
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,708
To see the light at the end of the tunnel.

60
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:55,007
Then he/she says that there are no ghosts.

61
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:58,118
I only say that I didn't see none.

62
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,517
But healthy very convenient for
those hotels when they are going the bankruptcy.

63
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05,152
- This came out badly.
- Who has a pen?

64
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,555
- I have.
- Do catch one?

65
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,560
In the farm of Mike I saw a ghost
real, I give my word.

66
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:16,563
- Guarantee! There is many crazy in Orlando.
- I understood, thank you.

67
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:20,471
- Get afraid.
- Thank you.

68
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:26,573
Shit.

69
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:29,577
- Where did devils remove this from?
- Of the And-bay.

70
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:32,686
And - bay, in how much you auctioned?

71
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,287
- There was not an auction.
- That thought.

72
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:39,092
THE LONG ROAD OF HOUSE

73
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,885
A fascinating book,

74
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:46,596
...so only it is inspiring.

75
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:49,602
- And honest.
- Thank you, as if he/she calls?

76
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,103
- Ana
- OK.

77
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:56,009
- Will he/she write other as this?
- No, no longer I am the same.

78
00:07:58,413 --> 00:07:59,812
- Can I ask you a question?
- Clear.

79
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:06,049
In the book the son's relationship
and the father, maybe it is very personal.

80
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:13,054
Is it so sincere, is it true?

81
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:15,647
No.

82
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,465
Thank you, I appreciate him/it.

83
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,563
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

84
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:55,795
This well, friend? This breathing?

85
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,312
It is this, sign here.

86
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:27,425
- Hi, face, comes early.
- Do I have Jackson, as it goes?

Happy birthday, have
a good morning, David.

91
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,326
It is beautiful.

92
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,728

Factory owner

I have to eat lunch with an idiot.

103
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:46,430

Two parts for a free, you go

He sought and it found you,
a federal civil law.

116
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,935
As if somebody discriminated you,
a good and white face.

The law, is the law, Clay is not? Room no

00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:11,485

It is only work.

00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,290

Only one minute.

141
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,759
Good night Mister,

There is something that can do for
you while this here.

00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:18,203
Reservations to have dinner, for the theater,
maybe the game of Knicks.

146
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,774
Any thing, I will be to his/her service.

- 1408, please.
- You insist.

150
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:37,789
I could accompany myself to my office
for a private conversation?

151
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,831
Clear.

152
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,096
Among, be the will.

153
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,939
- Are the 1408 a room of smokers?
- In fact it is, yes.

154
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:56,248
Well, a concern

155
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,444

- No, thank you I don't smoke.

156
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,815
Yes, in case of a war
nuclear, I left at a long time behind.

157
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,921
Part inhabits, it breaks superstition,
you know writers' things.

158
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,689
- But does he/she drink, not?

00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:17,767
Wisky 1939, exquisite.

160
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,767
To 800 dollars to be
the bottle.

161
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,408
I appreciate all this but
I intend to be at that room.

162
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,576
- How long?
- How long?

163
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,573
The normal would be one night.

164
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,683
Nobody never lasted more than one hour.

165
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:39,415
Jesus! He/she should paint the hair of blond
and to scrape the brows, it is intended...

166
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,491
...that I believe him/it in that crop
holed, to scare children.

167
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:46,293
Why this removing tartar, when
am I trying to help you?

168
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:50,401
No, you this playing,
selling the mystery.

169
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:55,131
But eventually, he/she knows that goes
to give me the key, and I will go to the room.

170
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,240
Then I will write my history
and their sales will fall in 50%.

171
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,210
He/she matters her if me if I record
our conversation?

172
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,213
You don't understand the situation.

173
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:13,091
I know that Delfim doesn't have one
salary of Plaza or of Carlile.

174
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:17,259
But we are always operating with
90% of our capacity, always.

175
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:22,662
My concern is not for it
the hotel, and less for you.

176
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:28,263
Frankly, I don't want
that is in the 1408,

177
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,375
...because I don't want to clean later.

178
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,576
The hotels sell her more for the
presentation and structure.

179
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:41,581
My training is of
manager, not of accountant.

180
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,984
And since I am here,
there were 4 deaths.

181
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:50,493
4, after the last, I prohibited
that somebody is in the 1408 again.

182
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:57,029
The last, was an addicted maniac in
medicines, that it was operated there even.

183
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,740
- I see that he/she had been investigating.
- I am also a professional.

184
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,005
In the 95 years of existence of the hotel
we saw 7 jumpers for overdoses.

185
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:10,215
5 hung, 3
mutilations, 2 strangled...

186
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,146
The manager counts the
tragic history of the hotel.

187
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:17,882
Reciting the numbers, as one
accountant that makes the numbers.

188
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,456
- You are smart.
- I know the game.

189
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,792
In his/her investigation
he/she also found the...

190
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:28,694
...22 natural deaths,
in the room 1408.

191
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,060
Natural deaths?

192
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,567
You don't know because the newspapers
they don't say anything on them.

193
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,674
In the total they had 56
deaths in the room 1408.

194
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,584
- 56, if ta playing.
- He/she doesn't know about anything.

195
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:52,381
The death cause in the 1408 goes from
infarcts, attacks, drownings.

196
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,420
Done drown?

197
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,787
Yes, a right Miller if
he/she drowned in the chicken soup.

198
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,996
Is that very difficult, as he/she made this?

199
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,431
Everything is very interesting
and this everything here.

200
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:08,095
I will leave you this and
I will give access to my office.

201
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,799
It can put in his/her book,
my only condition is...

202
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,906
...that is not at that room.

203
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,440
Had he/she let to see me all this?

204
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:31,728
Me of the a drink?

205
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,040
Uh that is good.

206
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,380
Be, courtesy of the house.

207
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,965
- Of any way I am.
- Drug.

208
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,063
I feel a lot.

209
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,306
Light, read all this.

210
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:19,501
I guarantee that when he/she reads,
he/she won't want to be in the 1408.

211
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,642
The first victim Kevin O'Mally,
salesperson of sound machines.

212
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,546
He/she enrolled in the first week
that he/she opened in October of 1912.

213
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,649
- He/she cut the throat.
- That is not the best.

214
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:37,262
In the middle of his/her madness, he/she treated
of sewing with an old needle.

215
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,521
- Before bleeding.
- Go calmly.

216
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,931
Look doesn't have to be in the 1408,

217
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:46,801
...it can take pictures of the 1404
and to remove pictures of the in the same.

218
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,966
Nobody had noticed.

219
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,472
My readers expect the truth.

220
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:56,147
Their readers? They only wait
grotesque things and cheap stories.

221
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,947
The ghost without head
still vacancy in the barn...

222
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,751
...marking the place
of the old cemetery.

223
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,381
This mentioning, of where removed this?

224
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,354
Their books are not
difficult to find.

225
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,087
They are in the shop window of
discounts of any bookstore.

226
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,231
Pure cynicism written by one
intelligent and talented man...

227
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:19,027
...that he/she doesn't believe in anything
plus than in himself.

228
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,900
I am totally blamed.

229
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,738
I have, the meeting ended,
because no me of the the...

230
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:28,844
Don't act as a girl of
school, in fact surprised me.

231
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,714
It is not the idiot that he/she was waiting.

232
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,215
I liked the first more,
the one of the hard layer.

233
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:42,158
- As he/she called if? The road...
- The long house road.

234
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:45,660
Even so, but I think,
the father was the best.

235
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,129
Yes, it was.

236
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,730
- He/she looks feels only the key.
- Mr. Enslin.

237
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,428
Feel the key.

238
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,239
I stayed the home of Vigsby,

239
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:03,040
...I brush the teeth to the side where
Mr. David Smith caressed all his/her family.

240
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,276
I don't fear the vampires
since I have 12.

241
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,986
Why knows he/she can be in the
his/her room of the fear? Sr. Olin.

242
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:14,925
Because I know that the ghosts as
many other things, don't exist.

243
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,823
Died without any god,
that protects us of them.

244
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,096
- Then I won't convince him.
- I think we are understanding each other.

245
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,232
Very well, it comes with me.

246
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:47,823
Most of the hotels uses cards
magnetic, a truth key.

247
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,652
Very old.

248
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:53,228
We have cards also, but the equipments
electronic, they don't work in the 1408.

249
00:23:53,437 --> 00:24:00,137
- The manager believes in the ghosts.
- I never used the ghost word.

250
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:04,070
- I feel a lot, spirits, spectra.
- He/she understood me badly.

251
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,134
What is that he/she has
in the 1408, it is not anything of that.

252
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,273
What then?

253
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:14,079
It is a damned room. Please.

254
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:34,395
He/she thought that there were only
closed the room.

255
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:38,905
The main concern
it is of protecting the personnel.

256
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,702
As he/she didn't say
that there is a 13rd floor.

257
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:47,209
The room should be dirty, the sheets
they are not changed there are years.

258
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,717
No, we are very professional.

259
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:55,658
1408, it is clean once a month,
I supervise the cleaning.

260
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:59,928
And if he/she works in couple, it is treated as
if it went a poisonous gas chamber.

261
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,966
Only for 10 minutes and I insist that the
door is open.

262
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,134
And that is everything.

263
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,742
There are some years ago an employed youth
he/she was arrested in the bathroom.

264
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,472
It was only there during some minutes
but when we removed her...

265
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:18,706
- Dead.
- No, it blinds.

266
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:24,521
He/she caught some scissors and it removed the
eyes and laugh histericamente.

267
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,020
His/her walk.

268
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:35,094
Here we separated, that is the close than
I arrive 1408, I hope doesn't import you.

269
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,293
I see you in the morning.

270
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,202
Mr. Enslin, please don't make this.

271
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,304
I will call him/it for the entrances
of the game of Knicks.

272
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,913
My brother was devoured by the
wolves in Connecticut.

273
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:30,673
That is everything, they should be playing.

274
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:53,028
The first round wins Mr. Olin,
I should admit that was afraid.

275
00:28:53,733 --> 00:29:01,198
For one moment, but where this the terror?
Show me the rivers of blood.

276
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,604
It is only a room.

277
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,588
So much for anything.

278
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:00,293
This room is...

279
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,399
...the hotel is full of histories
on creatures, it is a good lie.

280
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:11,495
But I ask myself if it exists
something of truth like this. He/she sounds something family.

281
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,804
Yes, I am in the walk...

282
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,513
...and it is safe.

283
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,619
There is a closet of old style.

284
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:27,923
Good wallpaper, the
rugs are with stains.

285
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:30,816
It is as if they were wet,
and to I square was restored...

286
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,619
It is a lost ship in the sea.

287
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,730
This form decoration
impeccable and even foolish.

288
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:42,568
The second painting is an old one
woman that read histories the some children.

289
00:30:42,668 --> 00:30:47,436
While other boy if
he/she approximates for behind,

290
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,076
...he/she has form finds strange.

291
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,580
The third are last,
painting really foolish.

292
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,845
It is the most popular of the house.

293
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,250
Full of horses and afraid
British gentlemen.

294
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:03,257
Who will speak on
the banality of the evil.

295
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,597
It is right, we are in the
I center of the hell.

296
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,765
Yes he/she has their disturbances.

297
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,342
The window for the city doesn't reveal anything.

298
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:28,811
Big buildings around
and many car noises.

299
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,979
That is a little strange.

300
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,329
Somebody this in the room.

301
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,438
Hi, hi.

302
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,214
That this finds strange.

303
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:42,352
Finally something that to write,
ghosts that make the cleaning.

304
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:50,059
Well, let us see
the witches' encyclopedia.

305
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:54,528
When I went to the window,
it put that in the bed.

306
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,736
When I see the bed,
he/she is going to the closet.

307
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:05,046
Houdini would have time of coming
here and to do the trick of the paper.

308
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,748
And this in the livinroom.

309
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:39,614
Hello.

310
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:51,521
They will have to try this
more again, stupid.

311
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,721
He/she comes here for low.

312
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,137
Let us go.

313
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:25,584
- Reception.
- Hi, it is Enslin, he/she guesses that room.

314
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,292
- Good night Mister.
- Ready to leave?

315
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,898
To leave, no, because he/she would leave?

316
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,696
Especially, with this service
wonderful, so discreet,

317
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:39,706
...no, I need that orders somebody to repair
the thermostat, is very hot here.

318
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,104
- Clear, we will send somebody.
- Truth?

319
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,613
- Clear.
- Thank you.

320
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,111
You are welcome.

321
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,494
How many fine walls
did they put committees?

322
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:34,991
Oh, God.

323
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:39,025
How many apocalyptic cameras?

324
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,374
The rooms of the hotel
they are by nature frightening.

325
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:49,808
Don't believe? How many people
they slept there before you.

326
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:54,040
How many were sick,
how many sick of the head.

327
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:59,447
Many died.

328
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,461
We are here to count the
history and it scares us.

329
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,682
All that that I see is not right,
they only want that is.

330
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:45,088
- Hello.
- Problems with the temperature?

331
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,296
Yes.

332
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,512
This very hot one or very cold?

333
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,711
What do you find? Among.

334
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:14,886
The box this for here,
this locked in 38.

335
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,159
I spoke that the box was here.

336
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,592
I know where this it but Im not
enter in this room.

337
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:26,393
- He/she only has to walk a little.
- He/she said that I don't enter.

338
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,663
- What does the one know happened here?
- Yes, I know.

339
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:33,506
He/she looks, I will tell you what to do, any
idiot does, just remove the panel.

340
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,277
Good, now, beside that cable,

341
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:45,177
...there is a tube with mercury,
that and the contact lighter.

342
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,290
This hotel is so old that the
half of the things doesn't work.

343
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,584
Beat in the tube, only gown.

344
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:57,998
Oh, oh this, the Mister, it is a genius.

345
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:03,396
- A well educated gentleman.
- Thank you he/she lets to give me...

346
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:08,031
...his/her tip, Mister.

347
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,100
This no this well, counts regressive.

348
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,605
Very effective.

349
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,000
Mister, we communicated that there is
a delay in the kitchen.

350
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,308
The sandwich that asked
it had delayed some minutes.

351
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,309
Sandwich, I didn't ask
any, that this speaking.

352
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:34,511
Excuse, we can change for...

353
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,610
...French fries or pasta and salad.

354
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,315
Listen to me, you won,
I leave, I am wounded.

355
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:44,655
- He/she understands me, I hurt my hand.
- I understand.

356
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:49,323
If he/she leaves their clothes it had been 10 in the morning
we washed ourselves and we gave the 17 hours.

357
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:52,832
Shit, prostitute, call me one
taxi to go to the hospital.

358
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:55,028
I am wounded,
does he/she understand him/it what say?

359
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,129
Mister I won't tolerate
that he/she speaks to me in this tone.

360
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:01,735
That! I will process you,
for illegal actions.

361
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:06,943
- What has wrong with you.
- If he/she wants step for the manager Olin.

362
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:11,142
Good, good, pass, I will put this
son of the prostitute in his/her place.

363
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:14,385
Pass, I will put him in the
his/her place now.

364
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:34,632
I haul! furious!

365
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:39,309
You won ok.

366
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:38,432
Does anybody listen to me, help?

367
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,107
You Mister, help.

368
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,406
I have, you, I help Mister, help.

369
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:52,418
Do I help, does he/she listen to me?

370
00:44:55,825 --> 00:45:00,056
The door this locked,
call her polices.

371
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:02,955
Help.

372
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,633
Help.

373
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,170
Help.

374
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,219
I am being crazy.

375
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,692
Dad, dad where you this?

376
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:55,599
Dad comes.

377
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:12,717
He/she calms, this no this happening.

378
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:20,666
I am losing common sense.

379
00:47:24,873 --> 00:47:26,365
I am losing.

380
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:28,008
Damned structure

381
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:32,469
Vibrations Psicocineticas.

382
00:47:33,982 --> 00:47:37,008
Never underestimate the power the suggestion.

383
00:47:37,386 --> 00:47:42,688
Ok, don't lose temper, there is
a reason for all this.

384
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:50,324
What is that? What is that?

385
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,003
A camera spy, who is.
You made this.

386
00:47:56,138 --> 00:48:00,406
The sadistic owner of the hotel.
Manager Olin.

387
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:13,144
Wait, he drugged me, me
did he/she drug? I don't remember.

388
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:19,988
He drugged me, the alcohol
with the chocolate.

389
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:22,162
They can make a bad reaction, ok.

390
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:26,263
Well, I am having hallucinations.
I am having hallucinations.

391
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:30,370
I will write on this, you will see.

392
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,177
This finished, it comes here.

393
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,279
He/she comes here..

394
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:45,483
Does he/she want to sit down?

395
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:48,912
Good he/she sits down.

396
00:48:56,431 --> 00:49:00,424
Ladies and gentlemen the person
uglier in the competition.

397
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:06,235
That am in the fourth place, the fish of gold.

398
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:11,702
Well done, we will see better.

399
00:49:12,214 --> 00:49:14,944
That yes it is an ugly fish.

400
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:21,247
His/her face is as ours.
The 3rd place belongs to my father...

401
00:51:06,962 --> 00:51:08,554
Mrs. he/she listens to me?

402
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:16,398
Mrs. I need his/her help, he/she listens to me.

403
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:22,143
He/she drinks quiet, please.

404
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,109
Quiet.

405
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:33,305
Where my garden?

406
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,814
I hate this place.

407
00:52:46,128 --> 00:52:47,720
I Don't like it of here?

408
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:58,436
Dad, is Michael?

409
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:12,779
Like you,

410
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,881
...I was,

411
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:20,224
...like me,

412
00:53:23,832 --> 00:53:25,993
...you will be.

413
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,847
This is not real.

414
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:55,322
Maybe it is only a nightmare.

415
00:53:58,132 --> 00:54:01,966
A very clear and lucid nightmare.

416
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:07,730
When it was the last time
what did I go to the bed?

417
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:15,278
It was, yesterday or today.

418
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:20,882
I don't remind, it should be a dream.

419
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:28,388
I wake up somewhere
and volume breakfast.

420
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:31,425
Where was it, what did eat?

421
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:41,004
Oh it comes.

422
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:08,231
They say that one cannot die
in the dreams, will it be true?

423
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:31,289
Shit, I should wake up.

424
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,924
And if I die?

425
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:47,902
Good, other options, the corridor
or the room of you accommodate.

426
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:51,909
Stairway of escape of fires.

427
00:55:52,713 --> 00:55:55,113
Next window.

428
00:55:55,616 --> 00:56:00,218
Next room.
All measures.

429
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:16,963
9 more 9, 18 crossed steps.

430
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:24,271
Ok, I can make this.

431
00:56:30,017 --> 00:56:31,814
This should be that happened
to the previous ones.

432
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:35,284
They want them to think
that was an accident.

433
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:40,221
The room won.

434
00:56:44,298 --> 00:56:45,788
Ok, can make this.

435
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:49,596
We will see where I step.

436
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:33,078
Where this, where this?

437
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,600
Burn alive.

438
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:11,802
He/she calms, everything that you see is not right.

439
01:00:15,342 --> 01:00:18,140
The rooms of the hotels
they are frightening by nature.

440
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,247
That strange that the
room doesn't have windows.

441
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:50,136
The doctors don't make everything.

442
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:53,241
We can seek others
treatments, listen to me...

443
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:55,247
- He/she looks at me.
- miraculous cures.

444
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:02,644
We have to do this.

445
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:12,758
Katie.

446
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,234
Katie.

447
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:10,389
Ok, will call somebody.

448
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:21,291
Among, among.

449
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:23,797
Good night Mike.

450
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:24,954
Yes.

451
01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:35,740
Mike, are you, do I hardly see you?

452
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:40,151
- He/she seems a ghost.
- Yes, yes, I am me Mike.

453
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:45,255
That is a little strange, suddenly
you appear in my computer.

454
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:48,459
I feel a lot, this late, listen to me, fast.

455
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:53,757
- Because he/she doesn't call me home?
- I am arrested in the room.

456
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,628
Mike always this arrested inside of
rooms, it is his/her work.

457
01:02:56,728 --> 01:02:58,134
No, no, please, listen to me.

458
01:02:58,238 --> 01:03:02,870
Who is? Hi, yes I already have them,
wait go down already.

459
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:06,344
No, no, Lily, please
call the police.

460
01:03:06,947 --> 01:03:09,438
Order to the Hotel Delfim.

461
01:03:13,286 --> 01:03:17,222
- This in the city?
- Yes, 2254 Lexington.

462
01:03:17,424 --> 01:03:18,789
- What does make in New York?
- I speak later.

463
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:21,586
The Hotel Delfim, room 1408.

464
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,630
Mike, you abandoned me,
he/she disappeared...

465
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,389
...nor divorce, nor separate,
I don't know, no this clear one.

466
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:31,503
Lily, I am in danger.

467
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,431
Mike calms, slowly,
I don't understand him/it.

468
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,642
Something kills me.

469
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:45,206
No, no, not.

470
01:04:46,913 --> 01:04:48,244
I have a knife.

471
01:05:04,164 --> 01:05:07,156
Where am I, where?

472
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:12,532
Good.

473
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,271
Mrs. he/she listens to me,
I help, help.

474
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,370
Help.

475
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:25,381
Mike, Mike, can me
to help? where were you?

476
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:28,779
You want something.

477
01:05:31,324 --> 01:05:32,621
Jesus Cristo.

478
01:05:37,898 --> 01:05:39,092
Help.

479
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:44,094
Does anybody listen to me?

480
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,706
It is good to be of turn.

481
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,478
It was already enough.

482
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:42,721
Drink.

483
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:48,599
I am only checking to be seen those
comforts, exceed their expectations.

484
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:51,895
You know albeit yes
what does want from me?

485
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:54,802
No, not!
What do you want?

486
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:59,710
What does want Mr. Enslin?
You sought this room.

487
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,503
A work, he/she was making my work.

488
01:07:01,714 --> 01:07:03,514
- Do excuse?
- My work, I am a writer.

489
01:07:03,614 --> 01:07:08,152
Oh, certain, you don't believe in anything, it likes
of destroying the hope of the other ones.

490
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:11,346
- Oh, that is bullshit.
- Because the people believe in ghosts?

491
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:17,362
For amusement? It is not for the hope
that there is something after the death.

492
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,563
How many spirits did you find?

493
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,768
What do you want from me?

494
01:07:27,873 --> 01:07:31,365
What does want from me? Yours...

495
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,410
What, what, what?

496
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:50,323
I want my drink.

497
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:03,904
You won.

498
01:08:12,751 --> 01:08:16,915
Mom because the Bible is purple?

499
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:21,056
I don't know because it is purple,
it was a present.

500
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:25,489
My grandmother brought me of the
Hungary, some day will be yours.

501
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,467
Those people know
for where am I going?

502
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:42,173
I have you are not going to place none,
you will be here with us.

503
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:46,577
Dad, all die.

504
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:52,521
- When they get old.
- Very old.

505
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:54,315
They are going to a better place.

506
01:08:56,195 --> 01:09:00,427
It is very beautiful there, all
their friends will be there.

507
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,465
- All?
- Yes.

508
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:16,614
- Do you believe in that dad?
- Yes.

509
01:09:19,418 --> 01:09:21,752
You know that think
we could have done more.

510
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:24,955
- We made all that that we were able to.
- No, we would must help her/it to struggle.

511
01:09:25,056 --> 01:09:25,850
Oh, my God.

512
01:09:26,058 --> 01:09:29,550
Instead of filling the head of
histories of the sky and of crowns.

513
01:09:32,664 --> 01:09:35,155
- She likes histories.
- I will look for cigarettes.

514
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:15,758
In these situations.

515
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:21,528
Describe...

516
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,599
...what sits down.

517
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:29,703
The light, the light that does with
that the deads appear.

518
01:11:30,315 --> 01:11:32,215
Everything this mixed.

519
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:38,815
At this level, 9, it is it more
deep of the hell.

520
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:43,922
Where was the whole light that heats up.

521
01:11:46,131 --> 01:11:51,068
The six, and in the five
I don't see improvement.

522
01:11:53,005 --> 01:11:55,235
But it is already better.

523
01:11:58,143 --> 01:11:59,838
Mike, do you hear me?

524
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:02,742
Micheal.

525
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:04,141
Lily.

526
01:12:08,153 --> 01:12:10,246
Michael, do you listen to me?

527
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:17,822
Oh, God, mine. I am
trying to communicate.

528
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,191
- Did you call the police?
- Yes, they are already at the hotel.

529
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:23,790
- Did he/she say in Delfim?
- Yes, yes in the 1408.

530
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:27,699
Mike they are
in the room 1408.

531
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:29,831
The room this emptiness.

532
01:12:30,509 --> 01:12:34,445
Mike, Michael, do you listen to me?

533
01:12:34,814 --> 01:12:37,908
Michael, where devils was?

534
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:40,508
I am not capable of me
to express with this climate.

535
01:12:40,608 --> 01:12:42,209
He/she calms, we go will solve this.

536
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:44,452
- Don't panic.
- I will die.

537
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:49,216
Mike, for, you won't die,
I will be oh in 15 minutes.

538
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:54,491
Mike.

539
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:58,227
15 minutes, not of on time.

540
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:00,933
- It will be very late.
- No, it won't be late.

541
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:02,666
1408.

542
01:13:02,766 --> 01:13:06,937
15 minutes it is perfect,
but it comes, it comes now.

543
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:10,981
I need you
for helping me.

544
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:15,243
I know that we didn't speak to each other a lot in this
time, but I need you love.

545
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:19,082
He/she only has to come,
they come here, they come with me.

546
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,890
No, no, not.

547
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,790
Don't count anybody only
come to the 14th floor.

548
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:29,299
- He/she comes wanted.
- No, no, no, not.

549
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:32,529
- I will be waiting for you.
- No, don't listen this.

550
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:35,432
- It is a trap.
- I will be a¡.

551
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:42,837
Lily, Lily.

552
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:18,700
This well friend,
does he/she get to breathe?

553
01:16:41,993 --> 01:16:44,791
Do I have, as he/she sits down?

554
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:49,198
Where am I?

555
01:16:49,434 --> 01:16:53,393
This well, this in the hospital.

556
01:16:54,306 --> 01:16:56,604
Hospital where, in New York?

557
01:16:56,808 --> 01:16:58,537
New York, no this in L.The.

558
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,212
He/she beat in the head
with his/her surfboard.

559
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:06,212
- Don't I believe that still surfs?
- This here for me.

560
01:17:06,312 --> 01:17:09,614
Yes, they called.

561
01:17:11,523 --> 01:17:13,423
I will return as soon as you get better.

562
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,960
- Ok I was in New York to I work.
- Because that says?

563
01:17:21,766 --> 01:17:25,862
In Delfim of New York,
I was arrested and dying.

564
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:30,808
In the hotel, Delfim.

565
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:35,072
In the hotel Delfim, in 45 and
Lexington, I spoke to you...

566
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,809
- 45 and Lex.
- I called you.

567
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:38,674
I never heard this.

568
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:43,176
This well, only has to rest.

569
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:03,435
Oh, we have a winner.

570
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:21,555
Incredible.

571
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,786
He/she seems lie that lives here.

572
01:18:31,369 --> 01:18:32,666
Because he/she left?

573
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:44,478
Because when he/she looked at her
he/she saw his/her face.

574
01:18:56,695 --> 01:19:01,092
I believe that this very clear one, in the dream, the
room was a trick of the subconscious.

575
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,190
That was good for you.

576
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:07,496
This was as a hole of
a rabbit, was in shock.

577
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:11,105
I cannot stop thinking in this, I believe
that is better to drop me off at the hospital.

578
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:13,336
In the psychiatric unit.

579
01:19:16,748 --> 01:19:21,049
You are very good, I don't believe
that am seating with you here.

580
01:19:21,453 --> 01:19:23,045
Nor speak to me.

581
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:26,057
This all well, can he/she bring something more?

582
01:19:26,992 --> 01:19:29,358
A glass of wine, of the same.

583
01:19:33,765 --> 01:19:37,963
- Mike?
- Other, tequila, with lemon.

584
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:49,180
Katie was there.

585
01:19:54,285 --> 01:19:57,482
You could imagine, to feel this,

586
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:02,458
...the real sensation of
what did speak to her two days ago?

587
01:20:02,558 --> 01:20:05,028
I spoke to her, I played her, I saw her.

588
01:20:06,297 --> 01:20:10,794
Yes, I see her/it all of the nights
when I close the eyes.

589
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:15,501
Yes, but it was so real.

590
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:21,606
- Maybe he/she should write of that?
- On Katie, this playing.

591
01:20:21,713 --> 01:20:23,440
It is not work for me.

592
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,207
Because no, it seems that this
ready to work with this.

593
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,113
Can you be?

594
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:44,362
I feel a lot.

595
01:21:08,793 --> 01:21:12,991
Factory owner is played of a bridge.

596
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:23,199
My experience in the
room was frightening.

597
01:21:24,042 --> 01:21:26,704
Moments of madness and despair.

598
01:21:27,712 --> 01:21:32,206
1408 were a terrible dream
and somehow I left him.

599
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:34,748
Renewed.

600
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:41,153
I have, I have a package
to send tonight.

601
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:44,321
I need New York arrives
tomorrow in the morning.

602
01:21:44,629 --> 01:21:46,529
I feel a lot Mister but we are closed.

603
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:34,099
I was out, I left, I left.

604
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:39,404
I left, by God.

605
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:41,940
I know that I left.

606
01:24:38,502 --> 01:24:39,842
Open.

607
01:25:12,436 --> 01:25:13,535
Dad.

608
01:25:14,839 --> 01:25:17,103
No, he/she is not Katie.

609
01:25:17,408 --> 01:25:21,003
I need help, please.

610
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,873
- You are not real.
- I am with cold.

611
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:26,811
- He/she is not Katie.
- I am with cold.

612
01:25:45,436 --> 01:25:49,930
He/she looks at dad, no longer he/she loves me more.

613
01:25:51,209 --> 01:25:53,006
Of course yes, wanted.

614
01:25:55,546 --> 01:26:03,043
He/she comes I hold you, I already caught you.
Oh my god.

01:26:03,221 --> 01:26:05,851
- They don't let to be me.
- Yes, they will leave.

616
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,022
They don't let to be me.

617
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:09,124
They don't let to be me.

618
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:12,421
No, no, I will remove you of here.

619
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:15,324
I already have her, ok, oh my God.

620
01:26:17,101 --> 01:26:20,298
- Do you love me dad?
- Plus than everything in this world.

621
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:24,304

Yes, we can, we can

No, no, I am not able to.

625
01:26:58,309 --> 01:27:00,334
You are not able to.

626
01:27:02,013 --> 01:27:03,605
Oh, my God.

627
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:14,072
No.

628
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:16,757
Return.

629
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:38,090
Because it doesn't kill me?

630
01:29:38,168 --> 01:29:41,360
Because all accommodate them of this
hotel does what to want.

631
01:29:41,471 --> 01:29:44,271
This same one can live
hour, once and again.

632
01:29:44,374 --> 01:29:47,866
Or it can use ours
excellent departure system.

633
01:30:18,608 --> 01:30:19,802
Mr. Enslin?

634
01:31:02,652 --> 01:31:04,847
This ready one to leave, Mr. Enslin?

635
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:12,359
- No, I will be.
- I understand.

636
01:31:18,401 --> 01:31:21,695
To purpose Mr. Enslin, his/her wife
he/she called, it will be here in 5 minutes.

637
01:31:21,738 --> 01:31:24,604
- And we will order her to arise.
- Her no this involved.

638
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:27,001
No there is can have.

639
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:35,508
I got tired of speaking with
you, I will finish this.

640
01:31:35,618 --> 01:31:38,849
Five, five, ignore the siren.

641
01:31:39,322 --> 01:31:42,120
Does he/she want to leave this room?
Nobody leaves this room.

642
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:46,523
Nate, this is Nate,

643
01:31:47,263 --> 01:31:50,360
...we can kill their friends.

644
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:54,763
All their friends are dead now.

645
01:32:06,082 --> 01:32:08,477
I lived the life as a selfish man.

646
01:32:10,086 --> 01:32:12,153
But I don't have to die
this way.

647
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:17,351
If I die, I will take him/it with me.

648
01:32:22,432 --> 01:32:26,793
This cannot be real and
maybe until me am not real.

649
01:32:26,836 --> 01:32:28,736
But this fire.

650
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:34,701
He/she has to be real.

651
01:32:45,555 --> 01:32:46,647
They are going for hell.

652
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:18,985
What does happen he/she?

653
01:33:19,085 --> 01:33:23,318
I don't know Mrs., it can be that is long
something this happening.

654
01:33:35,205 --> 01:33:36,695
Be quiet bastard.

655
01:33:40,109 --> 01:33:42,737
He/she has to help me mine
husband this inside.

656
01:33:45,014 --> 01:33:49,114
He/she has that help-lo,
this in the 14th floor.

657
01:33:49,218 --> 01:33:51,509
Please, help him/it.

658
01:33:54,424 --> 01:33:55,652
This wasting time.

659
01:34:03,733 --> 01:34:06,133
I make my work and I don't get scared.

660
01:34:10,473 --> 01:34:12,236
The decoration is horrible,

661
01:34:13,743 --> 01:34:16,473
I am sure...

662
01:34:16,746 --> 01:34:22,380
In the scale of the fear,
and the top of the world, give 10 skulls.

663
01:34:48,111 --> 01:34:49,738
What did you make?

664
01:34:58,922 --> 01:35:01,322
Dad, dad.

665
01:35:19,876 --> 01:35:22,674
He/she had been well, friend, had been well.

666
01:35:28,484 --> 01:35:31,009
How this?
He/she will be well.

667
01:35:31,588 --> 01:35:34,785
Remove him/it of here.

668
01:35:45,401 --> 01:35:50,839
Well made Mr. Enslin, well done.

669
01:35:54,043 --> 01:35:58,502
- Katie, I saw Katie.
- No Mike, Katie no this here.

670
01:35:58,848 --> 01:36:03,416
- This in the hospital.

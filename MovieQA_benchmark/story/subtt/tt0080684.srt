1
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,517
Echo Three
to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,437
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,357
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,469
I finished my circle.

5
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,079
I don't pick up
any life readings.

6
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,918
<i>There isn't enough life
on this ice cube...</i>

7
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,359
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,198
<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,958
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,832
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,076
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,599
[Braying]

13
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,075
Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

14
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,077
You smell something?

15
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,394
Rrraaah!

16
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,313
Chewie!

17
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,670
Chewie?

18
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,994
Chewie!

19
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,479
All right!
Don't lose your temper.

20
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,636
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

21
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,555
Solo?

22
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,830
No sign of life
out there, General.

23
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,154
The sensors are in place.

24
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,349
You'll know if anything
comes around.

25
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,959
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

26
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,150
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,236
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

28
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,952
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

29
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,196
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

30
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,309
I'm sorry to hear that.

31
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,429
Well, there's
a price on my head.

32
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,879
If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,319
I'm a dead man.

34
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,271
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

35
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,719
You're a good fighter, Solo.

36
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,717
I hate to lose you.

37
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,637
Thank you, General.

38
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,352
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

39
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,277
That's right.

40
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,676
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

41
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,313
So long, Princess.

42
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,954
Han!

43
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,877
Yes, Your Highnessness?

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,911
I thought you had
decided to stay.

45
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,917
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

46
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,870
changed my mind.

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,911
Han, we need you!

48
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,870
<i>We need?</i>

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,035
Yes.

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,229
<i>Well, what about
you need?</i>

51
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,475
<i>I need?</i>

52
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,431
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,118
You probably don't.

54
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,912
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

55
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,712
Come on!

56
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,990
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

57
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,712
Yes! You're
a great help to us.

58
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,670
You're a natural leader.

59
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,234
No! That's not it.

60
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,679
Come on.

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,074
A-ha!

62
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,599
You're imagining things.

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,392
Am I? Then why are
you following me?

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,273
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,719
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

66
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,159
I can arrange that.

67
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,748
You could use
a good kiss!

68
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,395
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

69
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,751
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

70
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,155
How will we
dry out her clothes?

71
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,110
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

72
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,719
Oh, switch off!

73
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,273
Why did you
take this apart now?

74
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,072
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both--

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,155
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,349
Put them
back together now!

77
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,230
Might I have a word
with you, please?

78
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,270
What do you want?

79
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,674
It's Princess Leia.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,233
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,998
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

82
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,917
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

83
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,916
He hasn't
come back yet.

84
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,870
She doesn't know
where he is.

85
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,830
I don't know
where he is.

86
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,915
Nobody knows
where he is.

87
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,189
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,673
- Well, uh, you see--
- Deck Officer!

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,313
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I--

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,589
Yes, sir?

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,948
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

92
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,479
I haven't seen him.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,874
It's possible he came through
the south entrance.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,830
<i>It's possible?</i>

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,518
Why don't you
go find out?

96
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,595
It's getting
dark out there.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,073
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,031
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,275
Why not?

100
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,549
Impossible man.

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,193
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,594
Between ourselves...

103
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,676
I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

104
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,189
[Braying]

105
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

106
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,155
He might have
forgotten to check in.

107
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,599
Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,631
We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,954
We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

110
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,559
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,671
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,434
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,994
Then I'll see you
in hell. Hyah!

114
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,469
Rrraaah!

come along now, R2.

There's really
nothing more we can do.

121
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,875
And my joints
are freezing up.

Don't say things
like that!

124
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,719
Of course we'll see
Master Luke again.

125
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,115
And he'll be quite
all right.

126
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,070
You'll see.

127
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,952
Stupid little short circuit.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,036

Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,271
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

134
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,789
although he does admit
that his own range is far too weak...

135
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,353
to abandon all hope.

136
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,471
Your Highness, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

137
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,750
The shield doors
must be closed.

138
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,950
Close the doors.

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,910

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,315
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

183
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,629
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

184
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,069
This is Rogue Two.

185
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,519
<i>Han: Good morning.</i>

186
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,870
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,275
Echo Base,
this is Rogue Two.

188
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,719
I've found them.

189
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,512
Repeat, I've found them.

190
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

191
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,109
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

192
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,070
Thanks, 3PO.

193
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,076
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

194
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,792
R2 expresses
his relief also.

195
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,559
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

196
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,999
You look strong enough...

197
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,917
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

198
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,359
Thanks to you.

199
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,914
That's two
you owe me, junior.

200
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,758
Well, Your Worship...

201
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,348
looks like you managed to
keep me around for a little while longer.

202
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,959
I had nothing
to do with it.

203
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,718
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

204
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,955
for any ships
to leave the system...

205
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,308
until we've activated
the energy field.

206
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,237
That's a good story.

207
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,634
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

208
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,115
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,391
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

210
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,078
Hah hah hah!

211
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,197
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

212
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,551
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

213
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,989
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

214
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,394
My--

215
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,318
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

216
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,874
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,912
Who's scruffy-looking?

218
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,356
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

219
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,391
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

220
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,070
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

221
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,117
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

222
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,917
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

223
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,950
Take it easy.

224
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,355
Excuse us, please.

225
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,151
Princess, we have a visitor.

226
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,511
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

227
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,834
It's metal.

228
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,995
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

229
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,599
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

230
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,675
No.

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,074
Wait.

232
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,714
There's something very weak
coming through.

233
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,798
[Radio Static]

234
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,878
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

235
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,594
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

236
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,080
It could be
an imperial code.

237
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,718
It could be
an imperial code.

238
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,712
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

239
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,637
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

240
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,832
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

241
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,589
Grrr!

242
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,592
Gahhh!

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,549
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

244
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,510
What was it?

245
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,039
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

246
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,230
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

247
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,679
An imperial probe droid.

248
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,678
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

249
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,677
We'd better start
the evacuation.

250
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,952
Admiral.

251
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,399
Yes, Captain?

252
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,590
I think we've got
something, sir.

253
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,792
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system...

254
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,558
but it's the best lead we've had.

255
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,558
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

256
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,715
I want proof,
not leads.

257
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,432
The visuals indicate
life readings.

258
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,595
It could mean anything.

259
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,358
If we followed up
every lead--

260
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,914
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

261
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,149
You've found something?

262
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,315
Yes, my lord.

263
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,875
That's it.
The rebels are there.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,278
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

265
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,230
It could be smugglers--

266
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,032
That is the system.

267
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,435
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

268
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,438
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

269
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,630
General Veers,
prepare your men.

270
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,079
Admiral.

271
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,751
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

272
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,472
As soon as each transport is loaded...

273
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,477
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

274
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,510
Right, sir.

275
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,511
All right!
That's it.

276
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,595
Try it.

277
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,312
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

278
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,510
Turn it off!

279
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,110
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

280
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,070
Forget the heavy equipment.

281
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,474
There's plenty of time...

282
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,953
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

283
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,910
Take care, sir.

284
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,950
Thanks.

285
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,872
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O.K.?

286
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,117
O.K., O.K.!

287
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,993
Hi, kid.

288
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,109
There's got to be
a reason for it.

289
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,514
Check it
at the other end.

290
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,755
Wait a second.

291
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,154
You all right?

292
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,508
Yeah.

293
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,875
Be careful.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,638
You, too.

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,199
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

296
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,073
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

297
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,953
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

298
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,833
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

299
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,359
Prepare for ground assault.

300
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,637
What is it, General?

301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,239
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

302
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,430
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

303
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,835
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

304
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,428
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

305
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,120
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

306
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,993
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

307
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,917
He-- He felt surprise
was wiser.

308
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,395
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

309
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,671
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

310
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,199
Yes, my lord.

311
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,632
Lord Vader.

312
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,671
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to--

313
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,313
Aaugh!

314
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,955
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

315
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,195
Captain Piett.

316
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,833
Yes, my lord?

317
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,793
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

318
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,753
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

319
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,952
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

320
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,399
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

321
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,078
[Gagging]

322
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,118
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

323
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,879
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

324
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,036
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

325
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,754
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

326
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,189
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

327
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,595
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

328
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,995
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

329
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,998
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

330
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,076
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

331
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,191
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

332
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,639
Understood?

333
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,079
Good luck.

334
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,997
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

335
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,235
Let's go.

336
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,911
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

337
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,519
Prepare to open shield.

338
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,236
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

339
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,316
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

340
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,831
Stand by, ion control.

341
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,230
Fire.

342
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,793
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

343
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,196
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

344
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,552
Feeling all right, sir?

345
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,318
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

346
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,352
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,516
I know what you mean.

348
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,189
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

349
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,958
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

350
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,230
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

351
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,716
[Thudding]

352
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,155
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

353
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,271
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

354
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,436
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

355
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,959
Steady, Dak.

356
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,832
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

Hobbie,
you still with me?

359
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,236
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

360
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,670
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.

361
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,395
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

362
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,351
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

363
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,153
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

364
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,191
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

365
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,754
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

366
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,916
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

367
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,915
Ah!

368
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,030
Dak?

369
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,115
Dak!

370
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,998
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

371
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,519
The shield will be down
in moments.

372
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,200
You may start your landing.

Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

376
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,434
You'll have to
make this shot.

377
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,198
I'll cover for you.

378
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,630
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

Activate harpoon.

382
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,033
Good shot, Janson.

383
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,035
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

384
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,550
Cable out.
Let her go!

385
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,432
Detach cable.

386
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,629
Cable detached.

387
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,758

Hah! That got him!

389
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,758
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

390
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,191
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

391
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,470
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

392
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,875
We have no choice.

393
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,876
Launch patrol.

394
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,718
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

395
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,273
Gahhh!

396

No, no! No.

Why are you

Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,112
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

687
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,117
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

688
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,593
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,075
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

690
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,272
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

the negative power coupling.

Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

701

Occasionally... maybe...

702
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,314

I like the sound of that.

706
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,270
Stop that.

707
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,992
Stop what?

708
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,076
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

709

My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

I'm not trembling.

713
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,433

00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,712
No, you're not. You're--

718
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,319
Sir, sir!

719
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,954
I've isolated the reverse power
flux coupling.

720
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,269
Thank you.

721
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,674
Thank you very much.

722
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,472
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

723
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,392
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

724
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,953
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

725
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,229
they must have been
destroyed.

726
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,874
No, Captain.
They're alive.

727
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,831
I want every ship
available...

728
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,439
to sweep
the asteroid field...

729
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,788
until they are found.

730
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,868
Lord Vader.

731
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,797
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

732
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,239
The emperor
commands you...

733
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,679
to make contact
with him.

734
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,677
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

735
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,394
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

736
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,919
Yes, my lord.

737
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,114
What is thy bidding,
my master?

738
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,714
There is a great
disturbance...

739
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,990
in the Force.

740
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,350
I have felt it.

741
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,869
We have a new enemy...

742
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,834
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

743
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,111
I have no doubt this boy...

744
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,279
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

745
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,516
How is that possible?

746
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,996
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

747
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,112
You will know it to be true.

748
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,595
He could destroy us.

749
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,756
He's just a boy.

750
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,189
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

751
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,790
The Force is strong with him.

752
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,991
The son of Skywalker...

753
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,793
must not become a Jedi.

754
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,990
If he could be turned...

755
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,839
he would become a powerful ally.

756
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,394
Yes.

757
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,393
He would be a great asset.

758
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,750
Can it be done?

759
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,668
He will join us or die, master.

760
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,879
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

761
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,673
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

762
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,630
Patience!

763
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,079
For the Jedi...

764
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,918
it is time
to eat as well.

765
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,837
Hmm? Heh heh.

766
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,952
Eat, eat.

767
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,069
Hot!

768
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,391
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

769
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,432
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

770
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,198
Not far.
Yoda not far.

771
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,357
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

772
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,233
Root leaf.

773
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,634
I cook.

774
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,958
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

775
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,116
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

776
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,389
Ah, father.

777
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,795
Powerful Jedi was he.

778
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,717
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

779
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,432
Oh, come on.

780
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,913
How could you
know my father?

781
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,678
You don't
even know who I am.

782
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,597
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

783
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,392
We're wasting our time!

784
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,192
I cannot teach him.

785
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,595
The boy has no patience.

786
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,188
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

787
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,355
Hmm...

788
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,155
Much anger in him...

789
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,111
like his father.

790
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,789
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

791
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,838
No.

792
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,678
He is not ready.

793
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,028
Yoda.

794
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,434
I am ready.

795
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,710
Ben--
I can be a Jedi.

796
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,717
Ben, tell him I'm--

797
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,159
Ready, are you?

798
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,430
What know you ready?

799
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,757
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

800
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,269
My own counsel will I keep...

801
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,119
on who is to be trained.

802
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,631
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

803
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,557
The most serious mind.

804
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,119
This one a long time
have I watched.

805
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,118
All his life
has he looked away...

806
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,152
to the future,
to the horizon.

807
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,670
Never his mind
on where he was...

808
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,789
hmm?

809
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,751
What he was doing.

810
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,359
Hmph!

811
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,515
Adventure.

812
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,595
Ha!

813
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,039
Excitement. Ha!

814
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,674
A Jedi craves
not these things.

815
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,314
You are reckless!

816
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,273
<i>So was I,
if you remember.</i>

817
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,119
He is too old.

818
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,800
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

819
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,309
But I've learned so much.

820
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,994
Ahh...

821
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,273
Will he finish
what he begins?

822
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,958
I won't fail you.

823
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,032
I'm not afraid.

824
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,669
Oh...

825
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,031
You will be.

826
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,391
You will be.

827
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,319
[Squealing]

828
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,634
Aah!

829
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,557
Sir, if I may venture
an opinion--

830
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,511
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

831
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,868
There's something
out there.

832
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,115
Where?

833
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,150
Outside in the cave.

834
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,679
[Banging]

835
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,074
There it is.
Listen. Listen!

836
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,155
I'm going out there.

837
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,315
Are you crazy?

838
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,634
I just got this bucket
back together.

839
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,671
I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

840
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,392
Then I'm going
with you.

841
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,033
I think it might
be better...

842
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,116
- if I stay behind and guard the ship.
- [Roar]

843
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,116
Oh, no.

844
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,592
Leia: This ground
sure feels strange.

845
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,075
It doesn't feel like rock.

846
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,710
Han: There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

847
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,558
Leia: I don't know.

848
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,558
I have a bad feeling
about this.

849
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,715
Yeah.

850
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,236
Watch out!

851
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,594
It's all right.

852
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,755
It's all right.

853
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,598
Yeah, that's what
I thought-- mynock.

854
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,392
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship...

855
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,750
and make sure there are
no more attached...

856
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,677
chewing on the power cables.

857
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,313
Mynocks.

858
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:07,869
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

859
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:13,905
Han!

860
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,947
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing!

861
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:19,028
Shoo! Shoo!

862
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:27,430
Wait a minute...

863
00:57:48,393 --> 00:57:49,712
Let's get out of here!

864
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,789
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think--

865
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,983
No time to discuss this
in committee!

866
00:57:54,113 --> 00:57:55,990
I'm not a committee!

867
00:58:01,753 --> 00:58:04,506
You can't make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field.

868
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:07,193
Sit down, sweetheart!
We're taking off!

869
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:11,749
Look!

870
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:13,101
I see it.
I see it.

871
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:14,109
3PO: We're doomed!

872
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:15,507
Leia: The cave is collapsing.

873
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,430
- This is no cave.
- What?

874
00:58:48,713 --> 00:58:49,907
Run!

875
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:53,662
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

876
00:58:53,793 --> 00:58:56,307
But beware
of the dark side.

877
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,991
Anger, fear,
aggression--

878
00:58:58,113 --> 00:59:01,071
The dark side of
the Force are they...

879
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:03,991
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

880
00:59:04,113 --> 00:59:06,707
If once you start down
the dark path...

881
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,789
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

882
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,232
Consume you it will...

883
00:59:10,353 --> 00:59:12,025
as it did Obi-Wan's
apprentice.

884
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:13,472
Vader.

885
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,709
Is the dark side stronger?

886
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,152
No, no.

887
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:18,547
No.

888
00:59:18,673 --> 00:59:20,982
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

889
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:23,832
How do I know
the good side from the bad?

890
00:59:23,953 --> 00:59:27,025
You will know
when you are calm...

891
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:28,950
at peace...

892
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:30,586
passive.

893
00:59:30,713 --> 00:59:33,785
A Jedi uses the Force...

894
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,505
for knowledge and defense...

895
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,703
never for attack.

896
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:38,743
But tell me why I can't--

897
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,829
No, no.
There is no why.

898
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:43,547
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

899
00:59:43,673 --> 00:59:46,062
Clear your mind

01:13:56,633 --> 01:14:00,023
Other places.
The future. The past.

1083
01:14:00,153 --> 01:14:02,462
Old friends long gone.

1084
01:14:04,753 --> 01:14:05,947
Han?

1085
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:08,268
Leia!

1086
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:09,428
<i>[Eee!]</i>

1087
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,505
Hmm...

1088
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:13,952
Control, control.

1089
01:14:14,073 --> 01:14:15,825
You must learn control!

1090
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:17,705
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1091
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,906
I saw... I saw a city
in the clouds.

1092
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,386
Hmm...

1093
01:14:23,513 --> 01:14:25,981
Friends you have there.

1094
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,990
They were in pain.

1095
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:31,264
It is the future you see.

1096
01:14:31,393 --> 01:14:32,621
Future?

1097
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:42,630
Will they die?

1098
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:47,025
Difficult to see.

1099
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:50,225
Always in motion
is the future.

1100
01:14:51,313 --> 01:14:53,986
I've got to go to them.

1101
01:14:55,473 --> 01:14:58,226
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

1102
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:00,913
If you leave now,
help them you could...

1103
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:02,864
but you would destroy all...

1104
01:15:02,993 --> 01:15:06,144
for which they have
fought and suffered.

1105
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:22,064
No, I don't have
a landing permit.

1106
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:25,902
I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

1107
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:28,069
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

1108
01:15:28,193 --> 01:15:29,512
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

1109
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:31,112
3PO: Rather touchy,
aren't they?

1110
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,791
I thought
you knew this person.

1111
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:34,710
Gaah!

1112
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,551
That was
a long time ago.

1113
01:15:36,673 --> 01:15:38,265
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1114
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:49,990
<i>Permission granted to land

1115
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:51,466
Thank you.

1116
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,390
Nothing to worry about.

1117
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:55,071
We go way back,
Lando and me.

1118
01:15:55,193 --> 01:15:56,785
Who's worried?

1119
01:16:42,553 --> 01:16:44,987
3PO: Oh. No one to meet us.

1120
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:46,910
I don't like this.

1121
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:49,308
Well, what would you like?

1122
01:16:49,433 --> 01:16:51,708
<i>They did let us land.</i>

1123
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:53,630
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1124
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:55,072
Trust me.

1125
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:01,748
See? My friend.

1126
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:08,307
Keep your eyes
open, huh?

1127
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:10,230
Gahhh!

1128
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:11,706
Hey!

1129
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,425
Why, you slimy...

1130
01:17:13,553 --> 01:17:16,750
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1131
01:17:16,873 --> 01:17:19,182
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1132
01:17:19,313 --> 01:17:20,905
after what you pulled.

1133
01:17:28,473 --> 01:17:30,862
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1134
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:34,303
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1135
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:37,345
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1136
01:17:37,473 --> 01:17:38,349
Yes.

1137
01:17:38,473 --> 01:17:40,429
Very friendly.

1138
01:17:40,553 --> 01:17:41,827
What are you doing here?

1139
01:17:41,953 --> 01:17:44,148
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1140
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:46,184
What have you done
to my ship?

1141
01:17:46,313 --> 01:17:47,143
Your ship?

1142
01:17:47,273 --> 01:17:48,262
Hey, remember...

1143
01:17:48,393 --> 01:17:50,304
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1144
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,469
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1145
01:17:52,593 --> 01:17:53,787
Gahh!

1146
01:17:53,913 --> 01:17:55,392
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1147
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:57,743
Gahhh!

1148
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,103
Hello.
What have we here?

1149
01:18:00,233 --> 01:18:01,427
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1150
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:04,192
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1151
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,110
And who might you be?

1152
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:07,268
Leia.

1153
01:18:07,393 --> 01:18:08,872
Welcome, Leia.

1154
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:15,144
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1155
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,504
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1156
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:19,986
My facilities
are at your--

1157
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,387
Well, really!

1158
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:23,231
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1159
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:24,502
Hyperdrive.

1160
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,430
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1161
01:18:26,553 --> 01:18:28,145
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1162
01:18:28,273 --> 01:18:31,026
She's the fastest hunk of junk
in the galaxy.

1163
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:34,145
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1164
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:35,626
Not as well as I'd like.

1165
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,709
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1166
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,152
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1167
01:18:39,273 --> 01:18:40,592
I've had labor difficulties.

1168
01:18:40,713 --> 01:18:42,226
Ha ha ha!

1169
01:18:42,353 --> 01:18:43,832
What's so funny?

1170
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:45,386
You. Listen to you.

1171
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,469
You sound like
a businessman...

1172
01:18:47,593 --> 01:18:48,867
a responsible leader.

1173
01:18:48,993 --> 01:18:51,063
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1174
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,627
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1175
01:18:53,753 --> 01:18:54,742
Yeah.

1176
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:56,591
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1177
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:58,544
It's the price you pay...

1178
01:18:58,673 --> 01:19:00,504
for being successful.

1179
01:19:02,713 --> 01:19:05,068
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1180
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:06,512
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1181
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:07,952
How rude!

1182
01:19:08,073 --> 01:19:09,392
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1183
01:19:09,513 --> 01:19:11,310
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1184
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:12,832
I wonder if-- Hello?

1185
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:15,832
How interesting.

1186
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:17,466
Who are you?

1187
01:19:17,593 --> 01:19:18,912
Oh, my! I--
I'm terribly sorry.

1188
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:20,466
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1189
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:21,628
No, please don't get up.

1190
01:19:27,873 --> 01:19:29,226
Gahhh.

1191
01:19:39,353 --> 01:19:41,821
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1192
01:19:41,953 --> 01:19:43,545
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1193
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:45,550
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1194
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:47,709
You must not go.

1195
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,791
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1196
01:19:50,913 --> 01:19:52,392
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1197
01:19:52,513 --> 01:19:55,232
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1198
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:57,389
But I can help them.

1199
01:19:57,513 --> 01:19:58,912
I feel the Force.

1200
01:19:59,033 --> 01:20:00,386
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1201
01:20:00,513 --> 01:20:02,902
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1202
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:06,628
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1203
01:20:06,753 --> 01:20:09,825
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1204
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,865
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1205
01:20:12,993 --> 01:20:16,110
But I've learned
so much since then.

1206
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,430
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1207
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:20,781
You have my word.

1208
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:22,232
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1209
01:20:22,353 --> 01:20:23,945
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1210
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:27,349
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1211
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:29,270
That's why
I have to go.

1212
01:20:29,393 --> 01:20:32,544
<i>Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor...</i>

1213
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:34,550
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1214
01:20:34,673 --> 01:20:36,106
You won't.

1215
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:38,064
Stopped they must be.

1216
01:20:38,193 --> 01:20:40,388
On this all depends.

1217
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:42,708
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1218
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,551
with the Force
as his ally...

1219
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,141
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1220
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:49,264
If you end
your training now...

1221
01:20:49,393 --> 01:20:53,511
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1222
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:56,147
you will become
an agent of evil.

1223
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:57,183
<i>Patience.</i>

1224
01:20:57,313 --> 01:20:59,383
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1225
01:20:59,513 --> 01:21:03,392
If you honor
what they fight for... yes.

1226
01:21:03,513 --> 01:21:05,071
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1227
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,467
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1228
01:21:06,593 --> 01:21:08,504
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1229
01:21:09,753 --> 01:21:11,664
I understand.

1230
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:17,262
R2.

1231
01:21:17,393 --> 01:21:18,712
<i>[Blip Beep]</i>

1232
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,585
Fire up the converters.

1233
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:23,668
<i>Luke!</i>

1234
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:26,671
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1235
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:29,432
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1236
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:30,906
Strong is Vader.

1237
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,706
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1238
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,232
I will.

1239
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:36,991
And I'll return.

1240
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:38,432
I promise.

1241
01:21:44,953 --> 01:21:46,750
Told you, I did.

1242
01:21:46,873 --> 01:21:48,511
Reckless is he.

1243
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:49,622
Now...

1244
01:21:49,753 --> 01:21:51,391
matters are worse.

1245
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:54,266
<i>That boy
is our last hope.</i>

1246
01:21:54,393 --> 01:21:56,349
No, there is another.

1247
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:28,272
The ship's almost finished.

1248
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:30,384
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1249
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:32,026
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1250
01:22:32,153 --> 01:22:34,542
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1251
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:36,823
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1252
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:39,228
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1253
01:22:39,353 --> 01:22:41,628
and see what
I can find out.

1254
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,550
I don't trust Lando.

1255
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:45,903
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1256
01:22:46,033 --> 01:22:48,422
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1257
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:50,350
we'll soon be gone.

1258
01:22:50,473 --> 01:22:53,590
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1259
01:23:25,553 --> 01:23:26,827
Gaahh!

1260
01:23:26,953 --> 01:23:28,022
What happened?

1261
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:29,552
Gahhh gahhh.

1262
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:30,901
Where?

1263
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:32,261
Gahhh!

1264
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:34,145
Found him
in a junk pile?

1265
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:36,867
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1266
01:23:36,993 --> 01:23:38,824
Gahhh!

1267
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:40,511
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1268
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:42,032
No, thanks.

1269
01:23:42,153 --> 01:23:45,589
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1270
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:47,590
Not really.

1271
01:23:50,953 --> 01:23:52,909
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1272
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:56,184
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1273
01:23:56,313 --> 01:23:57,666
Thank you.

1274
01:23:57,793 --> 01:24:00,546
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1275
01:24:00,673 --> 01:24:02,186
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1276
01:24:03,553 --> 01:24:05,305
Having trouble
with your droid?

1277
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:06,786
No, no problem.

1278
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:07,868
Why?

1279
01:24:15,753 --> 01:24:17,948
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1280
01:24:18,073 --> 01:24:19,950
we don't fall into...

1281
01:24:20,073 --> 01:24:22,268
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1282
01:24:22,393 --> 01:24:24,953
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1283
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:27,064
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1284
01:24:27,193 --> 01:24:28,990
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1285
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,388
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1286
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,504
attracting attention
to themselves.

1287
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,624
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1288
01:24:35,753 --> 01:24:37,789
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1289
01:24:37,913 --> 01:24:40,188
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1290
01:24:40,313 --> 01:24:42,543
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1291
01:24:42,673 --> 01:24:47,303
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1292
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,626
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1293
01:25:03,913 --> 01:25:05,232
I had no choice.

1294
01:25:05,353 --> 01:25:07,503
They arrived
right before you did.

1295
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:09,066
I'm sorry.

1296
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,671
I'm sorry, too.

1297
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:18,545
Gahhh.

Here?
We're in danger!

1310
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:44,510
I must
tell the others.

1311
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,510
Oh, no,
I've been shot!

Aaaaahhh!

1315
01:27:12,673 --> 01:27:13,992
Lord Vader.

1316
01:27:14,113 --> 01:27:17,344
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1317
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:19,225
after I have Skywalker.

1318
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:21,105
He's no good to me dead.

1319
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:23,827
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1320
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:26,148
Aaaahhh!

1321
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:29,504
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1322
01:27:29,633 --> 01:27:31,863
They must never again
leave this city.

1323
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:33,472
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1324
01:27:33,593 --> 01:27:35,072
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1325
01:27:35,193 --> 01:27:40,142
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1326
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:41,228
No.

1327
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:42,547
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1328
01:27:42,673 --> 01:27:46,063
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1329
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:50,345
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1330
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:54,303
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1331
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:55,707
Oh!

1332
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:58,108
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1333
01:27:58,233 --> 01:28:02,146
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1334
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:03,592
Wait! Wait!

1335
01:28:03,713 --> 01:28:05,510
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1336
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:07,430
I'm backwards...

1337
01:28:07,553 --> 01:28:09,350
you flea-bitten
furball!

1338
01:28:09,473 --> 01:28:11,270
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1339
01:28:11,393 --> 01:28:12,951
would be
stupid enough--

1340
01:28:25,953 --> 01:28:27,432
I feel terrible.

1341
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,906
Gahhh.

1342
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:44,268
Why are they
doing this?

1343
01:28:47,273 --> 01:28:50,504
They never even asked me
any questions.

1344
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:55,306
Lando.

1345
01:28:57,953 --> 01:28:58,908
Grrr!

1346
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,102
Han: Get out of here, Lando.

1347
01:29:00,233 --> 01:29:01,985
Shut up and listen!

1348
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:04,183
Vader's agreed to turn
Leia and Chewie over to me.

1349
01:29:04,313 --> 01:29:05,905
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1350
01:29:06,033 --> 01:29:07,148
Leia:
What about Han?

1351
01:29:07,273 --> 01:29:08,262
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1352
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:09,462
Vader wants us all dead.

1353
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:10,708
He doesn't want you at all.

1354
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,710
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1355
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,630
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1356
01:29:14,753 --> 01:29:16,630
And we're the bait!

1357
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:18,505
He's on his way.

1358
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:21,545
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1359
01:29:21,673 --> 01:29:22,788
My friend.

1360
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,102
Stop!

1361
01:29:28,073 --> 01:29:29,506
I've done all I can.

1362
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:30,952
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1363
01:29:31,073 --> 01:29:32,586
but I've got
my own problems.

1364
01:29:32,713 --> 01:29:33,987
Yeah.

1365
01:29:34,113 --> 01:29:35,831
You're a real hero.

1366
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:48,267
You certainly have
a way with people.

1367
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:53,426
Ah... Ah...

1368
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:04,109
This facility is crude...

1369
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:07,031
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1370
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:09,428
for his journey to the emperor.

1371
01:30:09,553 --> 01:30:12,226
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1372
01:30:12,353 --> 01:30:14,548
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1373
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:16,550
and allow him to land.

1374
01:30:16,673 --> 01:30:19,870
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1375
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:22,223
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1376
01:30:22,353 --> 01:30:23,672
I do not want...

1377
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,112
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1378
01:30:25,233 --> 01:30:27,588
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1379
01:30:49,273 --> 01:30:51,912
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1380
01:30:52,033 --> 01:30:53,864
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1381
01:30:53,993 --> 01:30:55,312
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1382
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:57,230
you have a responsibility for me...

1383
01:30:57,353 --> 01:30:59,071
so don't do anything foolish.

1384
01:31:11,353 --> 01:31:13,025
What's going on...

1385
01:31:13,153 --> 01:31:14,552
buddy?

1386
01:31:14,673 --> 01:31:17,471
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1387
01:31:17,593 --> 01:31:20,903
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1388
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,352
The Empire
will compensate you...

1389
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:23,462
if he dies.

1390
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:25,390
Put him in.

1391
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:26,468
Rrrah!

1392
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:28,902

I'm not ready to die!

1395
01:31:34,393 --> 01:31:36,748
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me, Chewie.

1396
01:31:36,873 --> 01:31:38,784
This won't help me.

1397
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:40,062
Hey, save your strength.

1398
01:31:40,193 --> 01:31:42,661
There will be another time.

1399
01:31:42,793 --> 01:31:44,749
The princess--

1400
01:31:44,873 --> 01:31:46,545
You have to
take care of her.

1401
01:31:48,713 --> 01:31:50,908
Do you hear me?
Huh?

1402
01:31:51,033 --> 01:31:52,227
Gahhh...

1403
01:32:03,953 --> 01:32:05,068

1404
01:32:05,193 --> 01:32:06,785

1405
01:32:26,993 --> 01:32:28,346
Gahhh!

1406
01:32:34,793 --> 01:32:36,829
What's going on?
Turn around!

1407
01:32:36,953 --> 01:32:38,227
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1408
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:53,983
Gahhh.

1409
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:36,904
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1410
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:38,591
He should be quite
well-protected...

1411
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:40,544
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

1412
01:33:40,673 --> 01:33:43,392
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1413
01:33:43,513 --> 01:33:45,265
Yes, he's alive.

1414
01:33:45,393 --> 01:33:47,384
And in perfect hibernation.

1415
01:33:47,513 --> 01:33:50,346
He's all yours,
bounty hunter.

1416
01:33:50,473 --> 01:33:52,828
Reset the chamber
for Skywalker.

1417
01:33:55,193 --> 01:33:56,911
Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

1418
01:33:57,033 --> 01:34:00,742
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

1419
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:09,065
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1420
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:11,229
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1421
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:13,309
I am altering the deal.

1422

alter it any further.

What do you think
you're doing?

1436
01:37:58,713 --> 01:37:59,907
We're getting
out of here.

1437
01:38:00,033 --> 01:38:01,785
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1438
01:38:01,913 --> 01:38:04,552
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1439
01:38:04,673 --> 01:38:05,389
Grrr!

1440
01:38:05,513 --> 01:38:07,071
I had no choice.

1441
01:38:07,193 --> 01:38:08,672
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1442
01:38:08,793 --> 01:38:11,671
We understand, don't we,
Chewie? He had no choice.

1443
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:13,272
I'm just
trying to help.

1444
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:15,588
We don't need
any of your help.

1445

Haaa...

1446
01:38:17,113 --> 01:38:18,944
Grrr!

1447
01:38:19,073 --> 01:38:20,062
Ha... Ha...

1448
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:21,148
What?

1449
01:38:21,273 --> 01:38:22,262
Han...

1450
01:38:22,393 --> 01:38:23,462
It sounds like Han.

1451
01:38:23,593 --> 01:38:25,026
There's still
a chance...

1452
01:38:25,153 --> 01:38:26,791

1453
01:38:26,913 --> 01:38:29,143

Chewie.

1456
01:38:34,433 --> 01:38:36,901
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1457
01:38:37,033 --> 01:38:38,705
After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1469
01:39:56,993 --> 01:39:59,712
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1470
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:00,982
No.

1471
01:40:05,273 --> 01:40:06,069

01:40:22,993 --> 01:40:24,346
Most impressive.

Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1479

You have
controlled your fear.

01:42:49,113 --> 01:42:51,229

This way.

1492
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:17,108
Well, don't blame me.

01:54:12,273 --> 01:54:13,945
You don't know how
to fix the hyperdrive.

1614
01:54:14,073 --> 01:54:15,392
Chewbacca can do it.

1615
01:54:15,513 --> 01:54:16,832
I'm standing here
in pieces...

1616
01:54:16,953 --> 01:54:19,990
and you're having
delusions of grandeur!

1617
01:54:22,393 --> 01:54:24,429
You did it!

1618
01:55:18,993 --> 01:55:21,461
Luke, we're ready
for take-off.

1619
01:55:21,593 --> 01:55:22,662
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1620
01:55:22,793 --> 01:55:24,829
<i>When we find
Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1621
01:55:24,953 --> 01:55:25,942
<i>and that
bounty hunter...</i>

1622
01:55:26,073 --> 01:55:27,472
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1623
01:55:27,593 --> 01:55:30,107
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1624
01:55:30,233 --> 01:55:32,224
Princess,
we'll find Han.

1625
01:55:32,353 --> 01:55:33,502
I promise.

1626
01:55:33,633 --> 01:55:35,749
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1627
01:55:35,873 --> 01:55:37,511
Take care, you two.

1628
01:55:37,633 --> 01:55:39,385
<i>May the Force
be with you.</i>

1629
01:55:39,513 --> 01:55:40,946
Gahhh.

1630
01:55:41,073 --> 01:55:43,428
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1631
01:55:52,193 --> 01:55:53,103
Ow.

1632
01:56:14,433 --> 01:56:17,186
<i>[Beep Blip Blip Beep]</i>

1633
01:56:35,033 --> 01:56:36,864
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

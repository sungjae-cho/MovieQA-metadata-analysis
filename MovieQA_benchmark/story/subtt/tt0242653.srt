1
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:19,790
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,458
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:25,421
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.

4
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:28,674
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

5
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,301
I was afraid you'd say that.

6
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,137
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

7
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,764
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

8
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:41,145
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.

9
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,904
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,990
Any change?

11
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,202
No.

12
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,206
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

13
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:02,917
At least until he wakes up.

14
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:07,296
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

15
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,632
He'd better have some good answers.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,968
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

17
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:17,181
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

18
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:22,144
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

19
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,024
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

20
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,527
- For what?
- For Neo.

21
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,947
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

22
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,824
Please, for me.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,545
This is what keeps bothering me.

24
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,297
What?

25
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:53,592
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

26
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:56,720
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

27
00:02:56,929 --> 00:03:01,600
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

28
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:15,197
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

29
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:17,575
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

30
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:22,246
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

31
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:25,583
Jesus H. Christ.

32
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,879
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

33
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:33,465
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

34
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:37,469
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

35
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:42,057
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

36
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,518
Operator.

37
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,897
It's Seraph.

38
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:53,027
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

39
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,998
Good morning.

40
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:10,794
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

41
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:15,299
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

42
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:19,678
Are you lost, Neo?

43
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:26,894
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

44
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,482
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

45
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,986
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

46
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:39,949
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

47
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:43,827
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

48
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:47,331
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

49
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,920
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

50
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:11,188
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

51
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,524
One thing I've learned in all my years...

52
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:16,902
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

53
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,532
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

54
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:27,538
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

55
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:30,124
I'm sorry this had to happen.

56
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,878
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

57
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:37,381
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

58
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,219
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

59
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,971
What choice?

60
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,974
To help you, to guide Neo.

61
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:52,062
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...

62
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:56,066
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

63
00:05:56,275 --> 00:06:00,321
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

64
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,324
...because here I am, at it again.

65
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:07,411
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

66
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,333
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

67
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,629
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

68
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:21,425
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

69
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,762
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

70
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,349
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

71
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,685
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

72
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:33,687
The Merovingian.

73
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:38,734
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

74
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:43,197
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

75
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:47,034
For years he has protected me.

76
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:50,663
I hope he can do the same for you.

77
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:55,084
Please, follow me.

78
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,130
Oracle...

79
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,508
I know, Morpheus.

80
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:06,470
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

81
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:11,267
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

82
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,143
I don't.

83
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,980
I expect just what I've always expected:

84
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:20,484
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.

85
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:26,115
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

86
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:29,869
He needs all our help.

87
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,746
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

88
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,164
No.

89
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:39,044
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

90
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,840
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

91
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,468
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

92
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:49,597
Yes, Papa.

93
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:56,979
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

94
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:00,524
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

95
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:05,738
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

96
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:07,990
We are most honored to meet you.

97
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,826
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

98
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:15,039
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

99
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:19,293
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

100
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,962
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

101
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:28,135
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

102
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,929
It's okay.

103
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:31,639
I don't have an answer.

104
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:35,559
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

105
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:39,813
It is between your world and our world.

106
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:43,108
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

107
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,236
Why did I know you would say that?

108
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:49,573
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

109
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:52,368
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

110
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:56,497
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

111
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,875
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

112
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,669
Is that what you're doing here?

113
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:05,798
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

114
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:09,176
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

115
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,761
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,723
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

117
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:18,686
The answer is simple.

118
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,109
I love my daughter very much.

119
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,821
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

120
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,740
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

121
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:34,577
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

122
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:38,122
If it does not, it is deleted.

123
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,419
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

124
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,881
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

125
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,009
Heard a program speak of love.

126
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:54,555
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

127
00:09:54,763 --> 00:10:00,603
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

128
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,982
I see that you are in love.

129
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:09,195
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

130
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,696
Anything.

131
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:17,745
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.

132
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,837
That's him.

133
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:29,882
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

134
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,968
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

135
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:38,224
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

136
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:30,442
Oh, no!

137
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,039
Damn it!

138
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,254
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

139
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,090
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

140
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,719
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.

141
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,722
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

142
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,725
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

143
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,686
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

144
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,397
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

145
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,524
Goodbye?

146
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,360
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

147
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:17,573
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

148
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:21,327
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

149
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:24,455
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

150
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,833
Karma is a word, like love.

151
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:29,793
A way of saying:

152
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:32,213
"What I am here to do."

153
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:36,008
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

154
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:39,720
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

155
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:45,434
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

156
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,774
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

157
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,985
Can I carry that for you?

158
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:58,656
All right.

159
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:05,287
Hurry it up, I'm late!

160
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,795
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.

161
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:15,756
I know you.

162
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:20,636
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

163
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,180
I'll pay you whatever you want.

164
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,808
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

165
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,685
Oh, no, no, no.

166
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,771
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

167
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,481
If I know him...

168
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,360
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

169
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:40,406
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

170
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:43,200
I built this place.

171
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:49,164
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

172
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,673
Down here, I'm God.

173
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:03,804
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

174
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:21,071
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

175
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,492
No. We know what has to be done.

176
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,551
Shit.

177
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,830
You gotta be kidding.

178
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,625
Holy shit, it's wingless.

179
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,335
I get it.

180
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:19,547
You must be ready to die.

181
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,257
I need to speak with him.

182
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:26,720
Only way you're getting through this door
is over my big, dead ass.

183
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,682
So be it.

184
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:53,873
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

185
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:57,501
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

186
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,088
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

187
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:03,132
And if we're unlucky?

188
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,635
There will be many men.

189
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:11,140
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.

190
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:35,409
What in the hell?

191
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:39,997
I don't believe this.

192
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:47,254
Hey!

193
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:54,595
The prodigal child returns.

194
00:18:55,721 --> 00:19:00,768
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

195
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,230
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

196
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:07,566
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

197
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,569
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

198
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:16,325
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

199
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,494
I'll tell you what I will do.

200
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:22,873
Put down the guns, and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.

201
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:26,335
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

202
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:29,839
Of course.

203
00:19:54,405 --> 00:20:00,369
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?

204
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,414
The Fates are too kind, eh?

205
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:07,084
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

206
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:12,089
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

207
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,551
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

208
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,221
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

209
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,725
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

210
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:27,980
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

211
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:31,400
You know why we are here?

212
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,737
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.

213
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:36,989
It is my business to know.

214
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,659
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

215
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:47,166
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

216
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:49,460
- Do you know?
- No.

217
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,378
No?

218
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,714
I did not think so.

219
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,800
But it is always best to ask, huh?

220
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:00,471
We want to make a deal.

221
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:04,934
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

222
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:09,438
Okay. I have something you want.

223
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,565
To make a deal...

224
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:17,279
...you must have something
I want, yes?

225
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:21,784
And it so happens
there is something I want.

226
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:26,330
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

227
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,542
It is said they cannot be taken...

228
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,044
...they can only be given.

229
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:34,964
What?

230
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,052
The eyes of the Oracle.

231
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,891
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

232
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,811
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

233
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,648
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

234
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:55,109
Where others see chance...

235
00:21:55,317 --> 00:22:00,239
...I see cost.

236
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:04,577
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

237
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:08,163
...and I will give you back your savior.

238
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:13,335
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

239
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,213
Yes? No?

240
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:20,384
I don't have time for this shit.

241
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,417
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

242
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:58,422
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

243
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:03,010
Interesting deal.

244
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:09,517
You are really ready to die
for this man?

245
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:12,645
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

246
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:15,648
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

247
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,067
She's in love.

248
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:23,572
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

249
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,324
Time's up.

250
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:28,536
What's it gonna be, Merv?

251
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:35,584
Okay. You got yourself in here...

252
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:39,797
...you can get yourself out.

253
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,303
Are you ready for us?

254
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:30,472
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

255
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,766
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

256
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:37,354
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

257
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:43,444
I can't leave yet.

258
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,823
I have to see her.

259
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:51,160
Now?

260
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:54,205
It's my last chance.

261
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:57,666
That's it. That's the secret.

262
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,336
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

263
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:04,590
Cookies need love like everything does.

264
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,550
Neo!

265
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:12,515
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

266
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:15,893
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

267
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,938
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

268
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,690
Okay.

269
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:25,861
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

270
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,617
So do you recognize me?

271
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,995
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

272
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:37,998
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

273
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:43,504
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

274
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,049
...but I still love candy.

275
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:49,385
No, thank you.

276
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:52,721
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

277
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,893
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

278
00:25:58,102 --> 00:26:01,564
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

279
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:04,775
You gave me a few surprises too.

280
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:07,236
I hope I helped.

281
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,906
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

282
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,783
Where is this going?

283
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:15,619
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

284
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:19,540
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

285
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:25,171
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.

286
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:29,216
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

287
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:32,011
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

288
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:35,139
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

289
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:38,851
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?

290
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,023
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

291
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:48,360
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

292
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:51,780
You know who.

293
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:55,951
Know Thyself

294
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,414
I did.

295
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:03,918
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

296
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:05,961
So do I.

297
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,924
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

298
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:13,302
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

299
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:18,599
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

300
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:22,728
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

301
00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:26,482
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

302
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,901
- Where?
- The source.

303
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:34,073
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.

304
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:41,372
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

305
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:46,669
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.

306
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:51,131
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

307
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,385
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

308
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:58,222
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

309
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,100
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

310
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:05,354
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

311
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:09,441
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

312
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,735
What's your purpose?

313
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:13,946
To unbalance it.

314
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:16,657
Why? What do you want?

315
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:20,327
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

316
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:23,706
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

317
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:26,834
The end of the war.

318
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:29,044
Is it going to end?

319
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:31,714
One way or another.

320
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:35,551
Can Zion be saved?

321
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,223
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

322
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:46,228
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

323
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:50,608
- Where?
- You know where.

324
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:54,195
And if you can't find the answer...

325
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:59,325
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

326
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:03,621
What does that mean?

327
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:09,793
Everything that has a beginning...

328
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:12,421
...has an end.

329
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,549
I see the end coming.

330
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:18,594
I see the darkness spreading.

331
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,763
I see death.

332
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:24,600
And you are all that stands in his way.

333
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:26,769
Smith.

334
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:31,273
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

335
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,193
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

336
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:37,571
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

337
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,114
What is he?

338
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:41,242
He is you.

339
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,827
Your opposite, your negative.

340
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:47,748
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

341
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:52,461
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

342
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,881
...this war is going to end.

343
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,970
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

344
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:04,473
...or in his.

345
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:23,534
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

346
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:33,002
I need time.

347
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:39,758
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

348
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,261
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

349
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:46,056
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

350
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,524
I love that smell.

351
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:59,195
I sure am going to miss it.

352
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:02,489
- Oracle.
- I know.

353
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:03,866
I know.

354
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:07,661
Sati, honey.

355
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,206
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

356
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:13,125
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

357
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:18,214
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

358
00:31:19,173 --> 00:31:23,385
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

359
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,409
I'm scared, Seraph.

360
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:50,955
Come.

361
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,834
He's following us.

362
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:44,800
Well, well, it's been a long time.

363
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:48,053
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

364
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,306
I have beaten you before.

365
00:32:50,514 --> 00:32:56,687
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

366
00:32:56,896 --> 00:33:00,274
And you must be the last exile.

367
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:03,986
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

368
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:06,322
What did she say about me?

369
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,324
That you were a bad man.

370
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:14,705
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

371
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:47,947
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

372
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:53,702
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

373
00:33:53,911 --> 00:34:00,084
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.

374
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:04,421
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

375
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,175
Why wouldn't she leave?

376
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,723
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

377
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:18,435
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

378
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,312
...deliberately, purposefully...

379
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:25,359
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

380
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:27,945
What did you do with Sati?

381
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:34,201
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

382
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,829
You are a bastard.

383
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:40,875
You would know, Mom.

384
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,921
Do what you're here to do.

385
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,592
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:38,766
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

387
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:43,312
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

388
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:46,065
Yeah, definitely.

389
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:48,859
You're right about that, sir.

390
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:52,404
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

391
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:56,825
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

392
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:01,747
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

393
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:08,087
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

394
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:16,011
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

395
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,348
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

396
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:22,893
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

397
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:27,064
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

398
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:33,362
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

399
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:54,925
Sir, we found her.

400
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,177
- The "Logos"?
- Yes, sir.

401
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:59,847
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

402
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:32,379
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

403
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:34,215
No, sir. Nothing yet.

404
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:38,010
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.

405
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:42,723
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:56,987
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

407
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:14,797
Careful, sir.

408
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:20,761
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

409
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:48,289
What was that?

410
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:53,460
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

411
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:58,132
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

412
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,887
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

413
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:07,391
We didn't know what happened after...

414
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:10,895
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

415
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:13,814
I'm happy to see you too.

416
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,858
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

417
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:18,194
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

418
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:21,280
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

419
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:26,702
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

420
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:30,915
Exactly what I needed to hear.

421
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:34,293
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

422
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:38,881
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...

423
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:41,634
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

424
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:43,844
Thus, our primary objective must be...

425
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:47,473
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

426
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:51,894
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.

427
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:55,189
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

428
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:57,525
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

429
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:00,444
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

430
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:03,906
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

431
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:07,076
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

432
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:08,619
That is correct.

433
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:13,165
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?

434
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:16,877
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

435
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:20,089
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

436
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:23,551
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

437
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:25,594
...and march them into that dock.

438
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:28,514
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

439
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,766
Time will tell, councillor.

440
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,602
Commander, just one more question.

441
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,063
Has there been word
from the "Nebuchadnezzar"?

442
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:39,692
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

443
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,861
Perhaps.

444
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,654
But we can hope.

445
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:48,534
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

446
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:01,839
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

447
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:04,675
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

448
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:07,511
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

449
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,349
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

450
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:18,480
Kids, you stay here.

451
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:21,275
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

452
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,485
- I have to.
- Why?

453
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:26,322
Because I love him.

454
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,866
I love him the same as he loves me.

455
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:33,078
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.

456
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:38,292
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

457
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:42,171
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

458
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:46,217
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

459
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:50,012
...what would you do?

460
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:57,061
Make shells.

461
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,198
What the shit is going on over here?

462
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:12,868
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

463
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,204
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

464
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:18,082
A unit volunteer, sir.

465
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,503
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

466
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:27,383
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

467
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:29,635
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

468
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:33,305
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

469
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:34,473
Okay, I'm 16.

470
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:38,310
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

471
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,774
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

472
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:46,110
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

473
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,155
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

474
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:57,079
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

475
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:12,511
Okay, charge the igniter.

476
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:19,310
She lives again.

477
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:22,479
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

478
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:27,568
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

479
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:33,490
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

480
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:37,953
Looking good, except...

481
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:40,331
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

482
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,709
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

483
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:48,214
{y:i}- What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

484
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:51,133
The machines have taken Junction 21.

485
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:54,428
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

486
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:57,598
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

487
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:01,894
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.

488
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:07,566
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

489
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,488
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

490
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,156
No, it's not.

491
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:17,368
There's another way. A support line.

492
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:21,413
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

493
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:25,501
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.

494
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,920
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

495
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:30,172
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

496
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:31,841
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

497
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,886
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

498
00:44:36,095 --> 00:44:42,184
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

499
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:46,272
Hi.

500
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,026
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

501
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:54,989
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

502
00:44:55,197 --> 00:44:57,283
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

503
00:44:57,491 --> 00:45:00,661
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

504
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,497
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

505
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:06,166
To go where?

506
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:09,211
To the machine city.

507
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:14,466
I know it's difficult to understand.

508
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:17,344
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

509
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:18,888
I still have to go.

510
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:22,224
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

511
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:25,102
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

512
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:28,731
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

513
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,775
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

514
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:34,069
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

515
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:37,156
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

516
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:40,534
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

517
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:46,040
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

518
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:53,088
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

519
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:56,217
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

520
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:58,594
...with my ship
after that little speech.

521
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:03,599
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

522
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:07,353
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.

523
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:10,105
That's as good a plan as any.

524
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:15,486
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

525
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:22,743
Two ships, two directions.

526
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:26,580
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

527
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:29,917
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

528
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:33,254
Then why are you doing this?

529
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,465
I believe in him.

530
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,344
Thank you.

531
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:46,767
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

532
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:50,271
To make it easier for you to remember.

533
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:53,482
What if I don't want to remember?

534
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,734
Why would you want that?

535
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,822
What if I blew that EMP?

536
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,907
What if I did destroy those ships...

537
00:47:02,116 --> 00:47:08,372
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

538
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:11,917
If I did that...

539
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:17,339
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

540
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:31,478
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

541
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,905
I'm ready.

542
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:43,866
Trinity...

543
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:48,162
...there's something I have to say.

544
00:47:49,788 --> 00:47:53,584
Something you need to understand.

545
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,629
I know I'm supposed to go.

546
00:47:56,837 --> 00:47:59,840
But beyond that...

547
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,468
...I don't know. I...

548
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:08,057
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

549
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:13,395
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

550
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:19,193
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.

551
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:22,571
I'm scared, Trin.

552
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,366
So am I.

553
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:29,995
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

554
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:32,248
But I'll tell you something.

555
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:35,417
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

556
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:40,047
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

557
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:43,676
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

558
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:45,928
No.

559
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,764
Nothing.

560
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:02,903
{y:i}- Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.

561
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:05,406
Let's move it. We are out of time.

562
00:49:05,614 --> 00:49:07,908
You're not leaving them anything?

563
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:11,704
He said he didn't need it.

564
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:17,793
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

565
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:21,297
Thank you.

566
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:27,553
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

567
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:30,639
Me too.

568
00:49:33,392 --> 00:49:36,437
It was an honor, sir.

569
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,735
No, the honor is still mine.

570
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:59,251
{y:i}- We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.

571
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,507
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

572
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,636
Bye, baby.

573
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:12,139
Take good care of them.

574
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:35,788
Ready?

575
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,088
Engine's still firing.

576
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:48,384
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

577
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:04,650
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.

578
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,945
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

579
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:10,114
Every time, I thought it was the last.

580
00:51:10,322 --> 00:51:14,118
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

581
00:51:14,326 --> 00:51:19,415
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

582
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:22,251
What are you talking about?

583
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:29,133
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

584
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:47,443
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

585
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:51,197
You're gonna pay for that.

586
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:54,283
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
{y:i}- We got an emergency.

587
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:56,994
- What is it, AK?
{y:i}- It's Maggie, sir.

588
00:51:57,203 --> 00:51:59,288
{y:i}She's dead, murdered.
{y:i}I think it was Bane.

589
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:03,459
Goddamn it.

590
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:07,296
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

591
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,256
He fired that EMP.

592
00:52:09,465 --> 00:52:13,093
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

593
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:17,681
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

594
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,685
- I know where he is.
- The "Logos".

595
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:23,604
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

596
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:26,690
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

597
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:28,776
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

598
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:32,029
...he'll control another EMP.

599
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:37,409
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

600
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:39,870
Mr. Anderson.

601
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,291
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

602
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,001
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

603
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,129
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

604
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:52,174
...that appearances can be deceiving.

605
00:52:52,383 --> 00:52:56,178
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

606
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:59,515
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

607
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,767
Don't do it.

608
00:53:01,976 --> 00:53:06,188
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

609
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:10,568
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

610
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:14,822
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

611
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,493
- He can't.
- Do it.

612
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:30,546
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

613
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:38,846
Let her go.

614
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:53,611
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

615
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:57,907
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

616
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:03,204
I do. I think of nothing else.

617
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,419
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

618
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:15,090
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

619
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:23,098
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

620
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:25,643
Disgusting.

621
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:33,067
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

622
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:41,742
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

623
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:47,748
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

624
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,875
Look past the flesh.

625
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:56,882
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

626
00:54:57,508 --> 00:55:00,636
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

627
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:03,681
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

628
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:06,767
There is nowhere I won't find you.

629
00:55:06,976 --> 00:55:11,397
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

630
00:55:11,605 --> 00:55:14,608
Inevitable.

631
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:16,944
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

632
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:20,281
This is it. It's gotta be.

633
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:06,994
Oh, no.

634
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:29,058
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

635
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:35,773
Blind messiah.

636
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:43,364
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

637
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:48,369
Helpless.

638
00:56:49,245 --> 00:56:52,915
Pathetic.

639
00:56:54,375 --> 00:57:00,047
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

640
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:06,846
I can see you.

641
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:17,022
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

642
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:20,609
It's not over.

643
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:37,501
- Trinity!
- Neo.

644
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,504
Neo.

645
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:45,176
Oh, no. Your eyes.

646
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:48,637
I'll be okay.

647
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:52,516
It's all right, Trin.

648
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:57,146
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

649
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:05,321
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

650
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:09,200
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

651
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:14,038
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

652
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:17,166
Yes, sir.

653
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:49,823
Come on, move.

654
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:22,064
All right!

655
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:24,066
This is it.

656
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:29,905
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

657
00:59:30,114 --> 00:59:33,909
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

658
00:59:34,118 --> 00:59:39,582
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

659
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:42,668
...we give them hell before we do!

660
00:59:42,877 --> 00:59:46,255
Yeah!

661
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:03,314
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

662
01:00:03,522 --> 01:00:05,566
But I'll make you a deal.

663
01:00:05,774 --> 01:00:10,237
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

664
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:14,366
Deal.

665
01:00:22,374 --> 01:00:25,628
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

666
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:28,756
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

667
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:33,636
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

668
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:39,058
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

669
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:52,404
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

670
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:57,618
If we can just get close enough...

671
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:02,831
Six hundred meters.

672
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,210
There.

673
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:15,344
Shit!

674
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,639
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

675
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:21,600
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

676
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:26,939
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

677
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:46,792
I'm coming, baby.

678
01:01:54,175 --> 01:01:57,595
Here they come.

679
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:05,978
{y:i}- Slow down, this ain't the "Logos".
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

680
01:02:13,235 --> 01:02:17,823
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

681
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:11,168
Breach! The dock is breached!

682
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:34,191
Knuckle up!

683
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:49,123
For Zion!

684
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:58,961
Shit.

685
01:06:02,298 --> 01:06:05,885
Come on, let's go.

686
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:13,058
Knuckle up!

687
01:06:26,697 --> 01:06:29,533
Reload!

688
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:33,204
Reload nine!

689
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:41,170
Go, go! Move, move!

690
01:06:52,056 --> 01:06:54,642
Watch your left!

691
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:58,521
Don't let them through!

692
01:07:00,022 --> 01:07:03,025
Zuka!

693
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:41,814
Oh, my God.

694
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:59,081
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

695
01:08:31,572 --> 01:08:34,241
Dig this!

696
01:08:37,077 --> 01:08:39,747
Oh, shit!

697
01:08:59,058 --> 01:09:02,811
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

698
01:09:27,378 --> 01:09:31,006
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

699
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:43,769
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

700
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:18,345
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

701
01:10:24,768 --> 01:10:27,438
Damn it!

702
01:10:50,836 --> 01:10:53,756
Yeah.

703
01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:07,353
Grab my belt.

704
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,240
Just give me one clean shot.

705
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:27,206
Damn it!

706
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:51,605
Charra!

707
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:57,695
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

708
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:00,823
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

709
01:12:01,031 --> 01:12:02,741
I think it's one of ours, sir.

710
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:05,870
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

711
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:07,788
Contact them.
I want access codes.

712
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:11,667
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

713
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:14,545
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

714
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:20,009
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

715
01:12:28,851 --> 01:12:33,522
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

716
01:12:35,107 --> 01:12:39,612
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

717
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:45,492
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

718
01:13:03,928 --> 01:13:06,972
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the "Hammer", sir.

719
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:08,474
How can that be?

720
01:13:08,682 --> 01:13:10,643
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

721
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:13,604
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

722
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:16,857
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

723
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:20,444
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

724
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:23,239
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

725
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:26,825
Sir, we already lost the dock.

726
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,331
Open the gate.

727
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:36,877
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

728
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:40,756
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

729
01:13:49,473 --> 01:13:50,432
There's the exit.

730
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:54,311
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

731
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,480
Full power...

732
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:59,358
...ninety degrees.

733
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:06,949
Now!

734
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:16,458
Hold on, baby.

735
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:21,463
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

736
01:14:21,672 --> 01:14:25,134
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

737
01:14:26,343 --> 01:14:29,263
Sentinels are inside the dock.

738
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:32,016
Are we too late?

739
01:15:00,044 --> 01:15:02,755
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

740
01:15:02,963 --> 01:15:06,425
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

741
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:34,703
Reload!

742
01:15:34,912 --> 01:15:37,623
He's pissing metal.

743
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:42,628
Go!

744
01:15:55,683 --> 01:15:58,477
Go!

745
01:16:18,873 --> 01:16:22,126
Heads up! They're coming around!

746
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:36,682
Behind you!

747
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:52,114
It's jammed!

748
01:16:56,327 --> 01:16:59,955
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

749
01:17:00,164 --> 01:17:03,250
Got it!

750
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:33,656
Captain Mifune.

751
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,618
Oh, no.

752
01:17:37,826 --> 01:17:40,538
They're coming.

753
01:17:41,372 --> 01:17:44,208
They're coming.

754
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:46,001
The "Hammer".

755
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,795
What?

756
01:17:48,003 --> 01:17:51,340
You have to open that gate.

757
01:17:51,549 --> 01:17:54,677
Cut the counterweights.

758
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:57,388
You can do it.

759
01:17:57,596 --> 01:18:01,183
Hurry. There's no time.

760
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:03,018
Captain...

761
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:07,022
...I didn't finish the training program.

762
01:18:08,941 --> 01:18:12,027
Neither did I.

763
01:18:32,923 --> 01:18:35,301
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

764
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:38,596
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

765
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:43,350
Come on, someone, please.

766
01:18:56,697 --> 01:18:59,909
Keep the weight forward.

767
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:03,704
Light as a feather.

768
01:19:06,624 --> 01:19:12,087
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.

769
01:19:16,675 --> 01:19:20,179
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

770
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,440
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

771
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:34,944
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

772
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:38,906
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

773
01:19:39,114 --> 01:19:40,533
Mifune...

774
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:42,368
...this is Lock.

775
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:45,412
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

776
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,332
{y:i}... the "Hammer"'s two minutes away.

777
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:54,213
{y:i}You've got two minutes, captain,
{y:i}to get that gate open.

778
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:56,090
Link.

779
01:19:56,298 --> 01:20:00,010
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

780
01:20:35,212 --> 01:20:38,299
Do it, kid.

781
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:45,264
Neo. I believe.

782
01:20:52,855 --> 01:20:56,025
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

783
01:20:56,233 --> 01:20:59,695
We ain't come this far.

784
01:21:10,414 --> 01:21:14,168
Almost home, almost home.

785
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:34,772
Burn it, Link!

786
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,923
- You did it.
- No.

787
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:03,634
We did it.

788
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:06,637
You're a hell of a pilot.

789
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:11,267
Some things in this world never change.

790
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:14,353
But some things do?

791
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:16,146
Luckily...

792
01:22:16,355 --> 01:22:19,692
...some things do.

793
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:31,704
Link!

794
01:22:31,912 --> 01:22:34,999
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

795
01:22:40,546 --> 01:22:43,883
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

796
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:47,553
I made a promise.

797
01:22:54,852 --> 01:22:57,730
You did wear it.

798
01:22:58,105 --> 01:23:02,985
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

799
01:23:11,202 --> 01:23:13,245
Three captains, one ship.

800
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:17,416
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

801
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,210
Good to see you too, Jason.

802
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:21,712
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

803
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:26,592
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

804
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,345
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

805
01:23:29,553 --> 01:23:31,388
That's the problem with you people.

806
01:23:31,597 --> 01:23:34,266
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

807
01:23:34,475 --> 01:23:38,020
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.

808
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:41,273
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

809
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:46,570
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

810
01:23:50,866 --> 01:23:54,328
Come on, get it cut.

811
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:57,248
The bridge is clear.

812
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:01,710
Do you hear that?

813
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:04,088
Get that cable run!

814
01:24:04,296 --> 01:24:09,218
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

815
01:24:09,426 --> 01:24:11,762
Order everyone to fall back.

816
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:15,224
Seal the shaft. Now.

817
01:24:15,432 --> 01:24:18,561
Move it!

818
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:23,524
Oh, my God.

819
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,408
- All clear.
- Do it.

820
01:24:32,616 --> 01:24:36,287
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

821
01:24:51,135 --> 01:24:53,637
Your move.

822
01:24:53,846 --> 01:24:55,848
So you gave them your ship?

823
01:24:56,056 --> 01:25:01,562
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

824
01:25:01,812 --> 01:25:04,440
The Oracle said nothing of this?

825
01:25:04,648 --> 01:25:09,320
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

826
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:13,949
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

827
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,328
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

828
01:25:17,536 --> 01:25:21,832
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

829
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:26,253
No, he wasn't.

830
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:30,549
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

831
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:33,969
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

832
01:25:34,178 --> 01:25:36,764
...if he'll reach the machine city.

833
01:25:36,972 --> 01:25:41,352
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

834
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:47,733
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

835
01:25:47,733 --> 01:25:50,819
...he will not give up.

836
01:25:51,028 --> 01:25:54,031
And neither can we.

837
01:25:58,994 --> 01:26:01,830
Temperature's dropping.

838
01:26:03,999 --> 01:26:06,669
Here we go.

839
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:47,710
We're over the fields, aren't we?

840
01:26:47,918 --> 01:26:49,795
How do you know that?

841
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:53,382
I can feel them.

842
01:27:00,598 --> 01:27:02,850
Over there.

843
01:27:03,058 --> 01:27:06,937
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

844
01:27:07,146 --> 01:27:09,231
Power lines.

845
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,651
Follow them.

846
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:29,960
What are they doing?

847
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:32,588
I don't know.

848
01:27:32,796 --> 01:27:35,216
Lieutenant?

849
01:27:49,813 --> 01:27:51,398
Goddamn it.

850
01:27:51,607 --> 01:27:54,276
What do we do now?

851
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,115
It is now a matter of time.

852
01:28:00,324 --> 01:28:03,953
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

853
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:09,124
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.

854
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,918
How long do we have?

855
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:15,297
Two hours. Maybe less.

856
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:21,262
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.

857
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,515
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

858
01:28:24,723 --> 01:28:29,645
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

859
01:28:29,895 --> 01:28:33,315
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

860
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:35,526
I would ask him.

861
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:40,865
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

862
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:49,915
There. Those mountains.

863
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,626
That's it.

864
01:28:55,337 --> 01:28:57,506
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

865
01:28:57,715 --> 01:29:00,342
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

866
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:03,637
We'll make it.

867
01:29:05,181 --> 01:29:08,350
We have to.

868
01:30:20,256 --> 01:30:23,384
Sentinels.

869
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,188
There's too many!

870
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,247
Gotcha!

871
01:30:53,455 --> 01:30:55,624
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

872
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:58,252
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

873
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,882
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

874
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:06,594
Then up we go.

875
01:31:40,419 --> 01:31:43,756
Beautiful.

876
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:08,197
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

877
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:18,123
Again. Slowly.

878
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:22,586
Now!

879
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:49,655
Trin?

880
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,908
Trinity?

881
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:55,703
Trinity?

882
01:32:55,911 --> 01:32:57,997
- I'm here.
- Where?

883
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:00,875
Here.

884
01:33:09,967 --> 01:33:12,595
We made it.

885
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:16,223
You said we would.

886
01:33:17,057 --> 01:33:20,269
It's unbelievable, Trin.

887
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:22,271
Light everywhere.

888
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,816
Like the whole thing was built of light.

889
01:33:26,025 --> 01:33:29,653
I wish you could see what I see.

890
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:33,282
You've already shown me so much.

891
01:33:34,116 --> 01:33:38,621
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

892
01:33:38,829 --> 01:33:42,750
I can't go with you, Neo.

893
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,960
I've gone as far as I can.

894
01:33:45,169 --> 01:33:47,880
What?

895
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:51,550
Oh, no.

896
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:54,011
Oh, no. No, no.

897
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:57,306
It's all right.

898
01:33:57,306 --> 01:34:00,267
It's time.

899
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:03,938
I've done all that I could do.

900
01:34:04,146 --> 01:34:07,066
Now you have to do the rest.

901
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:09,485
You have to finish it.

902
01:34:09,693 --> 01:34:12,154
You have to save Zion.

903
01:34:12,363 --> 01:34:14,281
I can't.

904
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:18,160
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

905
01:34:18,369 --> 01:34:20,913
You will.

906
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:25,709
I believe it. I always have.

907
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:29,797
Trinity.

908
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:35,511
Trinity, you can't die.

909
01:34:36,136 --> 01:34:38,305
You can't.

910
01:34:38,514 --> 01:34:40,057
You can't.

911
01:34:40,266 --> 01:34:43,853
Yes, I can.

912
01:34:45,563 --> 01:34:49,483
You brought me back once.

913
01:34:50,234 --> 01:34:53,779
But not this time.

914
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:01,537
Do you remember...

915
01:35:01,871 --> 01:35:06,250
...on that roof, after you caught me...

916
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:09,628
...the last thing I said to you?

917
01:35:10,921 --> 01:35:13,549
You said, "I'm sorry".

918
01:35:13,757 --> 01:35:17,344
I wish I hadn't.

919
01:35:18,929 --> 01:35:22,683
That was my last thought.

920
01:35:23,642 --> 01:35:27,188
I wished I had one more chance...

921
01:35:27,396 --> 01:35:31,066
...to say what really mattered.

922
01:35:32,234 --> 01:35:36,488
To say how much I loved you.

923
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:42,286
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

924
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:50,044
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

925
01:35:54,632 --> 01:35:58,594
But you brought me back.

926
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:03,724
You gave me my wish.

927
01:36:05,601 --> 01:36:11,065
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

928
01:36:14,318 --> 01:36:17,655
Kiss me.

929
01:36:19,156 --> 01:36:22,409
Once more...

930
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:25,496
...kiss me.

931
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,985
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

932
01:36:56,193 --> 01:36:59,446
Get that damn thing mounted!

933
01:37:03,033 --> 01:37:06,996
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

934
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:21,927
Neo...

935
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:26,015
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

936
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:35,394
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

937
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:40,900
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

938
01:39:43,694 --> 01:39:45,446
Speak.

939
01:39:45,654 --> 01:39:48,574
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

940
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:52,161
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

941
01:39:52,369 --> 01:39:55,122
You cannot stop him.

942
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:58,959
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

943
01:39:59,168 --> 01:40:02,338
We need nothing!

944
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:07,968
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

945
01:40:11,555 --> 01:40:14,683
What do you want?

946
01:40:14,892 --> 01:40:17,603
Peace.

947
01:40:41,961 --> 01:40:45,381
What are they doing?

948
01:40:49,468 --> 01:40:52,930
What are you doing?

949
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:58,060
Morpheus!

950
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:24,378
And if you fail?

951
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:28,591
I won't.

952
01:41:48,652 --> 01:41:50,154
Neo.

953
01:41:50,362 --> 01:41:53,532
He fights for us.

954
01:42:33,739 --> 01:42:36,617
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

955
01:42:36,825 --> 01:42:40,412
We missed you.

956
01:42:43,082 --> 01:42:46,377
You like what I've done with the place?

957
01:42:46,585 --> 01:42:49,046
It ends tonight.

958
01:42:49,255 --> 01:42:52,216
I know it does. I've seen it.

959
01:42:52,424 --> 01:42:56,178
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

960
01:42:56,387 --> 01:43:01,392
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

961
01:44:52,294 --> 01:44:55,172
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

962
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:57,716
...closing in on you?

963
01:44:57,925 --> 01:45:01,220
Oh, I can.

964
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:05,516
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

965
01:45:05,724 --> 01:45:09,562
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

966
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:14,733
The purpose of life is to end.

967
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:51,033
Why, Mr. Anderson?

968
01:48:51,242 --> 01:48:55,162
Why, why, why?

969
01:48:55,371 --> 01:48:57,164
Why do you do it?

970
01:48:57,373 --> 01:48:59,250
Why? Why get up?

971
01:48:59,458 --> 01:49:02,711
Why keep fighting?

972
01:49:02,795 --> 01:49:05,256
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

973
01:49:05,464 --> 01:49:08,092
For more than your survival?

974
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:13,055
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

975
01:49:15,057 --> 01:49:16,809
Is it freedom or truth?

976
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:19,311
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

977
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,148
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

978
01:49:23,357 --> 01:49:26,402
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

979
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:31,407
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!

980
01:49:31,615 --> 01:49:35,035
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

981
01:49:35,244 --> 01:49:42,835
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

982
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:47,298
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.

983
01:49:47,506 --> 01:49:52,178
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

984
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:58,225
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

985
01:49:59,977 --> 01:50:03,731
Because I choose to.

986
01:51:07,211 --> 01:51:11,715
This is my world! My world!

987
01:51:34,947 --> 01:51:36,657
Wait.

988
01:51:36,866 --> 01:51:40,035
I've seen this.

989
01:51:40,244 --> 01:51:43,998
This is it. This is the end.

990
01:51:44,248 --> 01:51:48,085
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

991
01:51:48,294 --> 01:51:50,588
And I...

992
01:51:50,796 --> 01:51:56,594
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

993
01:51:56,802 --> 01:51:58,387
I say:

994
01:51:58,596 --> 01:52:03,559
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

995
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:16,071
What? What did I just say?

996
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:25,289
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

997
01:52:31,295 --> 01:52:32,922
Get away from me!

998
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:35,257
What are you afraid of?

999
01:52:35,466 --> 01:52:37,092
It's a trick.

1000
01:52:37,301 --> 01:52:40,262
You were right, Smith.

1001
01:52:40,471 --> 01:52:43,849
You were always right.

1002
01:52:45,684 --> 01:52:48,812
It was inevitable.

1003
01:53:19,134 --> 01:53:22,137
Is it over?

1004
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,128
Oh, no, no, no.

1005
01:53:54,336 --> 01:53:57,256
No, it's not fair.

1006
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:53,938
It is done.

1007
01:55:24,385 --> 01:55:28,138
It doesn't make sense.

1008
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:32,893
He did it.

1009
01:55:33,102 --> 01:55:35,396
He saved us.

1010
01:55:35,604 --> 01:55:38,148
He saved us.

1011
01:55:38,357 --> 01:55:41,610
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1012
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:43,112
He did it! It's over!

1013
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,781
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1014
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,493
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1015
01:55:49,702 --> 01:55:51,120
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1016
01:55:51,328 --> 01:55:53,247
The machines, they're gone.

1017
01:55:53,455 --> 01:55:58,252
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1018
01:55:58,335 --> 01:56:01,714
Zion! Zion!

1019
01:56:01,922 --> 01:56:03,799
Zion, it's over!

1020
01:56:04,008 --> 01:56:05,467
It's over!

1021
01:56:05,676 --> 01:56:08,304
The war is over!

1022
01:56:08,512 --> 01:56:12,766
The war is over!

1023
01:56:32,703 --> 01:56:35,956
I have imagined this moment...

1024
01:56:36,165 --> 01:56:39,919
...for so long.

1025
01:56:42,338 --> 01:56:45,591
Is this real?

1026
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:56,519
Neo, wherever you are...

1027
01:56:56,727 --> 01:57:00,189
...thank you.

1028
01:57:42,773 --> 01:57:45,401
Good morning.

1029
01:58:05,171 --> 01:58:09,300
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1030
01:58:09,508 --> 01:58:11,635
You played a very dangerous game.

1031
01:58:11,844 --> 01:58:14,513
Change always is.

1032
01:58:14,722 --> 01:58:19,185
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1033
01:58:19,393 --> 01:58:23,063
As long as it can.

1034
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:28,360
What about the others?

1035
01:58:28,569 --> 01:58:29,945
What others?

1036
01:58:30,154 --> 01:58:32,364
The ones that want out.

1037
01:58:32,573 --> 01:58:35,034
Obviously, they will be freed.

1038
01:58:35,242 --> 01:58:36,869
I have your word?

1039
01:58:37,077 --> 01:58:42,291
What do you think I am? Human?

1040
01:58:54,845 --> 01:58:57,932
Oracle!

1041
01:59:03,229 --> 01:59:05,356
We were afraid we might not find you.

1042
01:59:05,564 --> 01:59:08,526
Everything's okay now.

1043
01:59:08,734 --> 01:59:10,861
Look, look.

1044
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:13,948
Just look at that.

1045
01:59:14,156 --> 01:59:17,535
Beautiful.

1046
01:59:17,743 --> 01:59:20,329
Did you do that?

1047
01:59:20,538 --> 01:59:22,831
For Neo.

1048
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,000
That's nice.

1049
01:59:25,209 --> 01:59:27,336
I know he'd love it.

1050
01:59:27,545 --> 01:59:29,922
Will we ever see him again?

1051
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:32,842
I suspect so.

1052
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:36,220
Someday.

1053
01:59:39,557 --> 01:59:41,308
Did you always know?

1054
01:59:41,517 --> 01:59:45,104
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1055
01:59:45,312 --> 01:59:48,607
But I believed.

1056
01:59:48,816 --> 01:59:52,695
I believed.

- [chuckles]
- Do... Do you want these?

00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,833

- No, please.

36
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,799
It's the last one.

37
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,754
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?

38
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,426
Whatever's out is what we have.

39
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,548
You don't have a stockroom?

40
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,890
- No.
- Or a basement?

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,634
No. We don't have an attic, either.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,221
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.

43
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,224
No, no, no.
You saw them first. I...

44
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,600
Please. I insist.

45
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,817
I mean, here. Take 'em.

46
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,107
- Oh, oh!
Hey, wait a minute.

47
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!

48
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,442
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,406
- These are ours.
- Oh. Your gloves?

50
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,491
- Yes.
- Well, how come? I mean...

51
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,658
They're just sort of hanging there,
sleeping with their little price tag on.

52
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,530
We were just discussing them, all right?
This is, uh...

53
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,203
Well, I have news for you.

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,872
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.

55
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,164
Calm down, all right?
Just calm down.

56
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,912
Calm down?
It's five days before Christmas.

57
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,414
I'm in the middle of a New York
department store.

58
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,586
He's asking me to calm down.

59
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,676
Well, listen. These were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,216
Yeah, we've put quite a lot
of thought into those.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,429
- MAN: Ah.
- Isn't that right?

62
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,139
Who are you?
And who were they for?

63
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,178
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.

64
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,852
- His girlfriend.
- Her boyfriend.

65
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,721
One pair of gloves for two people?

66
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,556
- This is hard to explain.
- Well, try.

67
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,104
All right. Go ahead.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,905
Oh. Uh, well, he is at the present time
my boyfriend.

69
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,566
But in 18 months...

70
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,243
after the operation...

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,831
- he will be...
- she will be...

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,997
...my girlfriend.
Do you understand?

73
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,920
That didn't really work out.

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,380
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.

75
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,248
MAN: All right.

76
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,253
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.

77
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,472
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.

78
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,350
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well...

79
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,844
Ah, well.

80
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,854

81
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,223
HOST: They're ready for you guys.

82
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,350
WOMAN: Thank you.

83
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,228
I don't know if what you said to that guy
makes any sense.

84
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,279
It was helpful. I think we scared
the bejesus out of him.

85
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,272
Oh, you were pretty fierce.

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,946
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,781
No, but I'm serious about the check.

88
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,778
It's the least I can do.

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,452
Well, thank you, but, see,

90
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,747
now I have to go find something else
for my girlfriend.

91
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,120
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,296
Oh, I can't accept them then.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,460
Well, you have to.
Otherwise you won't treat.

94
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,674
Really.

95
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,260
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blended drink.

96
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,924
Where did you find this place?

97
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,513
I first came in because of the name.

98
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,757
- Hmm.
- Serendipity.

99
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,474
- It's one of my favorite words.
- It is?

100
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,718
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

101
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,761
'Cause it's such a nice sound
for what it means:

102
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,309
A fortunate accident.

103
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,724
- Mm.
- Except I don't really believe in accidents.

104
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,441
I think fate's behind everything.

105
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,355
Oh, you do?

106
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,149
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?

107
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,738
Well, I think so.

108
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,697
Everything's predestined?
We don't have any choice at all?

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,650
No, I think we make our own decisions.

110
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,119
I just think that fate sends us
little signs,

111
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,202
and it's how we read the signs

112
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,617
that determines whether
we're happy or not.

113
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,035
Little signals.

114
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,705
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.

116
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,203
Like Columbus and America.

117
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,797
Yeah, or Fleming discovering...

118
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,132
- ...penicillin.
- Penicillin. Yeah.

119
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,130
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.

120
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,422
Or "Jonathan and the Gloves."

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't know that one.

122
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,174
You don't know that story?
It's an old folk tale. Classic.

123
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,223
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.

124
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,188
And in a perfect act of
serendipiocity

125
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,727
or serendipaciousness,

126
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,397
he runs into a beautiful,
attractive English girl

127
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,394
with a boyfriend.

128
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,522
You have a boyfriend, right?

129
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,903
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.

130
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,446
And you have the glove lady.

131
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,784
Yes, I do.

132
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,205
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.

133
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,120
Well, I hope you enjoy the gloves
you bought yourself.

134
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,338
Oh, I'm sure I will.

135
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,332
I usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness.

136
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,550
What do you want for Christmas?

137
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,419
- Golf clubs.
- Oh.

138
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,755
So you're gonna meet
your boyfriend now or what?

139
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,348
No, I think he's probably out
doing what you're doing.

140
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,475
Getting a crush on
someone else's girlfriend?

141
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,603
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
that I had a really great time, and...

142
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,395
Um...you know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,

143
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,437
you know, just in case.

144
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,107
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.

145
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,072
I just had a great time,
and I'd never be able to find you again.

146
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,775
Well, if we're meant
to meet again, then...

147
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,821
we'll meet again.

148
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,490
It's just not the right time now.

149
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,112
Maybe we were supposed
to meet on British time

150
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,080
- and we're five hours too early.
- [laughs]

151
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,245
Come on.
I don't even know your name.

152
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,834
My name is Jonathan.

153
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,878
Does that make you
wanna tell me something?

154
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,751
Yeah, it does.

155
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,297
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.

Here's the story:

225
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,104
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

226
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,603
there was this queen
named Cassiopeia,

227
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,653
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,

228
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,197
and there wasn't anybody in the kingdom
who wasn't offended

229
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,536
by this woman's relentless vanity.

230
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,448
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.

231
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,369
I don't remember what she did

232
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,457
and I don't remember
who she offended.

233
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,292
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.

234
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,830
But anyway,
Poseidon, the sea god,

235
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,295
punished Cassiopeia
by placing her in the heavens

236
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,793
upside down in her throne,

237
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,717
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders,

238
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,214
and all the blood rushing to her head.

239
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,676
And now she's just
a constellation in the sky,

in the shape of a throne.

241
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,813
So she made one tragic mistake.

242
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,653
And paid for eternity.

00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,273

Hey, Sara.
Oh, I'm sorry.

- Hey. I'm sorry.
- What?

MAN: Usually, I have to beg
to be a part of weddings.

359
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,195
And If I do get into the wedding,

360
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,285
of course, they've postponed it
and it's overseas somewhere,

361
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,871
and they've canceled my passport
and I can't be a part of it,

362
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,411
and it's ridiculous and all for naught.

363
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, thank you.
I take this very seriously.

364
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,915
It's a gift to be the best man.

you're absolutely meant to be with.

370
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,845
For my friend Jonathan Trager,

371
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,138
that person...

372
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,135
was me.

[laughter]

374
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,857
But as you know,
Jonny and I were simpatico.

375
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,270
We were brothers
from another mother.

376
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,519
We were friends since freshman year.

377
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,737
I watched him go out
with woman after woman,

378
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,153
and he'd always come crawling...

379
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,109
He would come crawling back to me.

380
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,035
It was embarrassing.

381
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,244
You loved it.

382
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,331
But then one night he came home
and things were different.

383
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,667
His adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker

384
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,535
was a thing of the past.

385
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,706
Thank God.

386
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,417
He hardly even responded to my playful
yet tormenting flicks of my finger

387

against the soft part of his skull

388
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,343
as he studied for finals.

389
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,465
And that is because
he had found her:

390
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,307
the woman
he was meant to be with.

391
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,845
And if anyone is qualified to know
when he met his soul mate,

392
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,845
it would be me,

393
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,268
his first wife.

394
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,528
She's smart, she's funny,
she's beautiful.

395
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,274
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.

396
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,444
And I think we all have.

397
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,943

if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

404

on a scale of one to ten?

409
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,391
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?

410
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,142
I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.

We... We have a pomegranate souffle,
which is amazing,

414
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,490
which is different than the sorbet.

415
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,447
Listen, we'd love to join you guys,
but Courtney has to wake up,

416
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,824
so I got to be good.

417
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,996

It's not too late to back out.

- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?

Hold on, hold on.
Listen, listen.

I read it.
I read it a long time ago.

446
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,345
I'll throw in the screenplay
to the <i>Bridges of Madison County.</i>

449
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,945
And nothing. I mean...

450
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,160
I mean, I did nothing.
I... I just let her walk out of the party

451
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,653
and I didn't say anything to her.

452
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,327
And now she's gone forever.

453
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,206
I mean, she was my soul mate.

454
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,540
Kenny, I honestly think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."

455
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,423
It implies there's some magical element
that we have no control over,

456
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,045
like fate or destiny.

457
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,303
I think holding onto beliefs like that
stops us doing the real work.

458
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,556
And the fact is,
if your therapy here stays on track,

459
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,395
I think you'll find there are
many, many people out there

00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,560
- Thank you.
- We're off to a bad start here.

683
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,178
All I really need, if you could, is just

684
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,226
if you could enter this account number
in the computer

685
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,349
and just tell me her name.

686
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,646
Oh, I see.
When you put it that way...

687
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,734
No.

688
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,818
All right.

689
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,654
Would 20 bucks help?

690
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,865
It might if I was a health inspector.

691
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,859
Listen, this is really important.

692
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,656
Oh, boy, did it again.
Crossed the line.

693
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,201
You have to remain on the other side
of the register.

694
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,450
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.

695
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,168
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?

696
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,252
I have to have the name.

697
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,801
Well, I was a little short
on my weekly sales draw.

698
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,260
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.

699
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:10,559
Okay. Um, I'm going to, uh...
[muttering]

700
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,725
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are. All right?

701
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,690
- A lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.

702
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,448
The account number was 029351...

703
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,785
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.

704
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,951
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.

705
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,243
$700?

706
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,331
- 700.
- That's extortion.

707
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,078
- That's good salesmanship, sir.
- [sighs]

708
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,171
What do I need?
Ring it up.

709
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,916
- Well, we have a purple tie.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,792
What would go with a purple tie?

711
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,136
I look like a magician.

712
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,882
All right, you horrible little man.

713
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,805
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?

714
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,052
Now, look her up.

715
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,599
I already did.

716
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,099
It was a dead account.
There's no information in our computers.

717
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,441
- You give me that!
- Hey, chase me.

718
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,936
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!

719
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,439
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that or I will cut you!

720
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,112
Now, you better find a way
to help me right now!

721
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,031
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.

722
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,870
When our customers
apply for a credit card,

723
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,365
the hard copies go to
our storage facility in Queens.

724
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,210
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,

725
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,545
and you can find her application.

726
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,460
However, you need an employee
to get you in.

727
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,551
You need an employee...

728
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,215
to get you In.

729
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,930

- Halley.

737
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,417
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.

738
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,429
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?

739
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:02,056
The problem is you can't fend off an army
of bloodthirsty Vikings with a shehnai.

740
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,057
- It's illogical.
- No, see... no, no.

741
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,026
See, you're lulling them into submission
with the music.

742
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,488
That's the whole point of the song, really.
Mystic Surrender.

743

You don't think he looks like
he hates the music?

744
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,405
No. Hey.

00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,493
Hey, baby.

All right, right here, what are they doing?
What's their attitude?

750
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,304
What are they thinking?
Who are these people?

751
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,515
I tell you, they're in awe
and they're speechless.

752
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,852
And they're just grateful and underfed.
Underpaid. [chuckles]

753
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,472
Why don't they ask me
to stay in the village and have a feast?

754
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,442
- Yeah. Sara, hey.
- Hey.

755
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,936
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.

756
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,939
Okay, yeah, I'm going to split, guys.

757
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,282
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director,

758
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,448
and I'm gonna have him tweak
that whole section.

759
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,538
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.

760
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,286
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.

761
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,662
Oh, that's a drag.

762
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,006
And I've just found them in the freezer.

763
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,375
I don't get it. Is that a joke?

764
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,721
No, Lars, it's not a joke.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

765
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,888
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.

766
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,476
It's just a bit too much to deal with.

767
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,644
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning...

768
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,937
- ...so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

769
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,569
And that's why I think I need a little break.

770
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,105
What do you mean, a little break?

771
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,903
No, not that kind of little break.

772
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,994
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries and clear my head.

773
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,411
Hey, this has nothing to do
with the other night.

774
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,002
I just need this.
I need it for me.

775
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,291
But I won't go unless you say It's okay.

776
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,799
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

777
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,671
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?

778
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,933
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.

779
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,685
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God. [gasps]

780
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,359
Are you serious?
Get out of town.

781
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,106
Yeah, that's the idea.

782
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,530
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.

783
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,244
This is unbelievable. Oh, my God.

784
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,785
Sara, really, this is
way too generous of you.

785
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,410
Oh, come on. Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?

786
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,377
And there's no ulterior motives?

787
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,131
Well, yeah.

00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,500

It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.

and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.

848
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,474
- Hi.
- Hey.

849
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,723
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?

850
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,976
Uh, okay, take us...

851
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,069
- ...anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?

852
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,155
Anywhere.
Wherever you feel like going.

853
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,649
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?

854
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,245
- Um, okay, Eve, please don't get mad at me.
- What?

855
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,955
Oh, no. I cannot believe this.

856
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,369
I need a borough here, ladies.

857
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,743
Look, I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.

858
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,040
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

859
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:03,587
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait! Wait!

860
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,084
Hold on one second.

861
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,054
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.

862
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,388
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.

863
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,007
And I needed my best friend with me.

864
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,599
What are you doing, Sara?

865
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,687
Honestly, Sara, I don't understand
you anymore, okay?

866
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,182
Please, tell me something.
Tell me anything that makes

867
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,730
just a little bit of sense.

868
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:30,027
I've just spent the entire flight
staring into the sky, thinking.

869
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,201
Not about my fiancé,
but about this mystery guy I met

870
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,290
a million and a half hours ago.

871
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,961
A guy I don't even remember,
except for this...

872
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,831
vague picture I have inside my head.

873
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,543
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.

874
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,217
And it was like...

875
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:55,935
in that moment, the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.

876
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,813
That's why I'm here.

877
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,730
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.

878
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,228
Because when all this is over,

879
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,481
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.

880
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,992
Let's just pray he's a bald fascist

881
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,738
who picks his nose and wipes it
under the car seat.

882
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,162
- Hi.
- Hi.

883
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,755
Could you hold on?

884
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,021
Where ya goin'?

885
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,359
You better be buying me one friggin'
big birthday cake, that's all I gotta say.

886
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,103
Could I get your destination, please?

887
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,197
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.

888
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,491
Okay, we are going... that way.

889
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,114
And I'm gonna follow you.

890
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,292
Come on, you can do it yourself.
Just open up the computer and look into it.

891
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,207
I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.

892
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,455
Yes, you can. Why can't you?

893
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,003
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.

894
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,797
Couple of months out of college, you're acting
like you're part of the establishment.

895
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,343
No, no, no, no, no...
What about privacy law, huh?

896
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,841
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?

897
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,592
- No.
- They protect millionaires.

898
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,719
Do you know who those millionaires are?

899
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,721
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.

900
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,723
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.

901
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,318
Pimple-faced college dropouts
who have made unhealthy sums of money

902
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,313
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,

903
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,157
provide no viable services
and still manage to generate profits

son-of-a-bitch shareholders.

of the disenfranchised proletariat,

- You guys want the tenant on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.

00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,396
- There's your tenant.

912
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,186
No. Mignon. It's French.

913
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,434
No, we're looking for someone
named Sara in that apartment.

914
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,357
You got the right one?

915
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,275
Maybe he was her boyfriend.

916
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,776
Thanks. Hey, you did the right thing.
Really, you did.

917
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,277
Good work, pal.

Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.

Aren't you forgetting about something?

00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,959
- Uh, what?
- Wedding rehearsal. Bachelor party.

926
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,631
- Plenty of time. Plenty of time. Come on.
- You sure?

- Yes. Gotta go to Brooklyn. Come on.

Ooh! Prada!

931
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,981
[gasps] Ooh, I love this stuff.

932
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,321
- That's $20.
- 20 bucks?

933
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,816
Eve, that's a horrific knockoff.

934
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,319
At least my fake says Prada.
Yours says Prado.

935
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:04,244
Yeah? Well, I say for a dollar,
I can buy a little magic marker and fix that.

936
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,663
I'll take it. 20 bucks?

937

Two buckets of balls for the price of one

00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,166
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.

940
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,089
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like... I feel something.

941
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,961
- Wanna play golf? Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.

942
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,929
Hey! Who are you?

943

Can you believe that?
Two bucket of... Whoa!

Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.

945
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,267
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?

946
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,109
Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?

947
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,105
Oh, my. Goodness gracious.

948

I'm all right. Thank you.
Can you get the flyers?

949
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,446
- Here you go.
- All right.

950
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,699
- It's a signal.
- Two buckets of balls.

951
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,080
- Taxi!
- Sara!

952
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,034
They should make pills for this.

00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,886
He's gotta be here.

954
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,804
He's got to be here. I can feel it.

- Yeah?

Thank you for letting us in.

979
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:37,060
Now, Mr. Mignon, we have an odd
and somewhat personal question to ask you.

980
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,561
Mignon.

981
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,818
Mr. Mignon.

982
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,816
Mignon. Like the meat.

983
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,908
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl, first name Sara?

984
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,498
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,

985
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,584
you know, really amazing girl.

986
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,747
<i>Oui.</i>

987
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,620
Do you know where we can
locate this individual?

988
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,672
No, I do not.

989
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,418
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.

990
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,544
Oh, come on. You don't even remember
the last name of your ex-girlfriend?

991
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,886
I mean, I find that hard to believe.

992
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,676
[scoffs]
You don't understand anything.

993
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,972
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.

994
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,014
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.

995
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,014
- She was placed with me by...
- A roommate finder's service?

996
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,768
<i>Oui, oui, oui.</i> She stayed with me
with her boyfriend for a few months...

997
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:22,863
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out very quickly.

998
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,528
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too. That's it.

999
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,697
Yeah, but did she leave
anything behind,

1000
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,287
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?

1001
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,622
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.

1002
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,491
Anything would help, really.
Anything.

1003
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,916
I remember she sat on me.

1004
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,674
She... She sat on you?

1005
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:46,637
Yes. She sat on me for a while.

1006
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,506
I found her...

1007
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,474
inspiring.

1008
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,804
I guess this is why I started
painting her in the first place.

1009
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,398
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.

1010
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,189
That is what I said.

1011
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,107
- That's what he said.
- Right.

1012
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,571
- That's what I said.
- Clearly.

1013
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,328
Do you happen to have the painting?

1014
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,537
Hey, now you're gonna see
what it's all about.

1015
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,833
You know, you see her face.

1016
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,252
Okay. Yeah.

1017
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,839
This is her, yes?

1018
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,765
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.

1019
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,885
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing,

1020
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,012
you know, with the crown
and the scepter.

1021
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,438
Do you have a name
for the roommate finder's service?

1022
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,773
- They would have the information.
- Absolutely.

1023
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,235
- Yes. You have that name?
- No, I do not.

1024
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:48,191
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.

1025
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,908
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?

1026
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,247
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

1027
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,535
On 60th Street.

1028
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:01,037
- Eastside or Westside?
- It was just next to that...

1029
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:05,382
on the left of that splendid
little patisserie,

1030
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,921
Serendipity.

1031
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,466
That's it.

1032
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,721
[police siren in distance]

1033
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,266
Get... Get ready.

1034
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,474
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.

1035
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,726
Thank you.

1036
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,022
Thanks. [laughs]

1037
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,323
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

1038
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,160
- No, you will be if you sing.
- [laughs]

1039
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,160
Eve, thanks so much
for coming with me.

1040
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,578
You're welcome.

1041
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,454
Sara, you know,
it's a wonderful thought.

1042
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,005
The idea that all of life,

1043
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,341
that every single event
is all part of some master plan

1044
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,087
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate.

1045
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,841
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?

1046
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,184
Or making decisions?

1047
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,098
Hell, why should we even get out of bed
in the morning?

1048
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:00,972
For the cake?

1049
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:04,146
No. Not for the cake.

1050
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,268
So that you make mistakes.

1051
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,192
Mistakes like this trip.

1052
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,362
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.

1053
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,701
You figure it out.
You... You think.

1054
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:18,118
You... You realize that life isn't
some elaborate stage play

1055
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,288
with directions for the actors.
Life's a mess, Sara.

1056
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,458
It's... It's chaos personified.

1057
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,629
I have to give it all up now, don't I?

1058
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:35,723
Sara, you have a fiancé
who, despite his weird Eastern music,

1059
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,719
which we hope is just a phase,
let's hope,

1060
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,062
loves you very, very, very much.

1061
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,056
It's not giving up. It's growing up.

1062
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,267
[sighs]

1063
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,815
Let's get out of here.

1064
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,733
Yeah.

1065
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,426
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.

1066
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,269
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.

1067
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,437
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

1068
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,855
- Why?
- Stay here.

1069
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,990
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.

1070
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,325
Right. Right.

1071
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,627
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.

1072
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,374
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.

1073
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,297
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.

1074
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,761
What?

1075
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,221
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?

1076
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,635
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

1077
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,725
- What?
- It can't get any more clearer than this.

1078
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,515
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.

1079
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,060
It's just...
Hey, it's another one of your clues, man.

1080
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,807
Let's talk about it in the cab
on the way over. Let's go.

1081
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,561
It's not a clue. It's a sign.

1082
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,686
Well, what's the difference?

1083
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,735
A clue is what a detective uses
to find a suspect.

1084
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,482
The receipt, the warehouse,
that French guy...

1085
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,155
- Uh-huh.
- Those are clues. This is a sign.

1086
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,323
Me never finding the book, that's a sign.

1087
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,663
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.

1088
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,079
How could something not happening
be a sign?

1089
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,119
Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.

1090
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,459
Isn't it?

1091
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,255
That's lucid.

1092
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,251
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.

1093
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,924
And if there is,
it's not working for me.

1094
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,553
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.

1095
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,268
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?

1096
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,638
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.

1097
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,685
My wedding rehearsal starts
in less than an hour.

1098
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,354
My bride is waiting for me.

1099
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,942
Let me... Let me ask you
something here, okay?

1100
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,278
If Sara were here right now,
poof, came down,

1101
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:56,772
what would she tell you to do?

1102
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,865
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf

1103
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,359
because all the signs point to me
getting married.

1104
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,952
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.

1105
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,571
Okay, I hate to state the obvious...

1106
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,538
- State it.
- Okay.

1107
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,085
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.

1108
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,542
Maybe I was never supposed to.

1109
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,332
Maybe all this is just a maze

1110
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,835
designed to lead me directly back
to where I started.

1111
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,469
Which Is getting married.

1112
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,101
They should make pills for this.

1113
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,973
[elevator bell dings]

1114
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,775
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!

1115
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:41,651
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?

1116
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,071
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

1117
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,449
Sara, can you believe
that I was Halley's R.A. in college?

1118
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,667
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.

1119
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,831
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1120
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,751
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years or something.

1121
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,715
Eve was, uh...
I went to B.U. with Eve.

1122
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,927
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?

1123
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,137
So what are you doing here?

1124
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,677
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are?

1125
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,470
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

1126
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,059
- Congratulations.
- Wow!

1127
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,770
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?

1128
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,935
Yeah, at 12 noon.
We're actually going to rehearsal.

1129
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:16,527
- Why don't you come watch?
- Why don't you go?

1130
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,277
Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.

1131
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,695
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.

1132
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,286
- Oh!
- Oh! [laughs] No, no.

1133
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,826
I have to go upstairs and call my fiancé...

1134
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:33,210
- ...who's a man. [laughs]
- Oh! You must be very proud.

1135
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,171
- Okay, so have a good one.
- Okay.

1136
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,584
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, good. Okay, bye.

1137
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,464
Good-bye, my sweet lesbian lady lover.

1138
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,883
I'm just kidding.
It's a joke between us.

1139
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,643
Lars?

1140
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,604
What are you doing?

1141
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,153
How did you know where I was?

1142
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,244
- Intuition.
- Really?

1143
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,407
No. I went through
the New York hotel guide.

1144
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:14,581
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."

1145
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,045
Sara, I missed you so much.

1146
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,504
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.

1147
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:27,010
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.

1148
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,807
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley,
to be my wife,

1149
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,600
and I promise to love and sustain you

1150
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,645
in the bonds of marriage
from this day forward.

1151
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,483
[dialogue fades out]

1152
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,372
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.

1153
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,463
[laughter]

1154
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:04,460
And that's when the actual ceremony
will conclude.

1155
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,677
- Excuse me.
- What?

1156
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,886
Well, look, I need some help over here.

1157
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,882
And then... then you're married.

1158
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,384
- Hal, who's that girl over there?
- Huh?

1159
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,558
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.

1160
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,430
WOMAN:
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.

1161
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,728
And now make sure to be here
tomorrow morning

1162
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,146
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

1163
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,486
Yes, yes. I hate to break up a good thing,

1164
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,481
but we have half a dozen strippers
waiting for us. We're late.

1165
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,653
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I actually mean "strippers,"

1166
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,573
- the women who take off everything.
- Listen, I'll see you men at 9:00.

1167
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,071
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.

1168
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,039
Fantastic, Mr. McKinley.
It gives you an hour to get crazy.

1169
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,159
- Okay, let's get into it.
- WOMAN: Hello, darling.

1170
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,754
Uh, Dean, before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,

1171
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,088
I need to talk to him.

1172
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,174
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.

1173
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:50,802
- Hi. I want you to meet Jon.

I would love for you
to come tomorrow.

1175
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,436
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?

- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.

And it's tomorrow at noon?

1178
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,190
Yeah, and you can bring
your friend if you want.

1179
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,775
- Okay.
- Be there.

1180

Wow. I'll be there.

Thank you. That's so nice.

- See you tomorrow. Nice to meet you.

1183

Okay, bye. Bye. See you.

1184
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,119
- Halley, what is it? What's wrong?
- It's you.

1185
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,788
What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?

1186
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,753
Nothing, exactly.
It's just this feeling I have, like...

1187
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,123
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.

1188
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:28,002
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

1189
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,386
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and... and...

1190
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,227
I've imagined the dress and the flowers

1191
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,063
and even the music
the band was gonna play.

1192
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,354
And everything is
exactly the way I want it,

1193
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,476

1194
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,819

to Never-Never Land.

a little bit out of it the past week,

Doesn't mean I don't love you.

my fiancé's feet to be warm,

1199
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,162

from going down the aisle.

I'm sorry, Hal. Really, I am.

1201
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:10,882
Whatever it is that you're holding on to,
please just let it go.

It's the traditional groom's gift.

01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,229
Jonathan.

1340
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,698
Sorry. You know what? I'm gonna...

1341
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:38,069
Thank you. Excuse me.
Sorry. Whoo! I'm sorry!

1342
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,907
Hi. Yeah. It's in New York City.

1343
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,503
Um, I need the address of a Jonathan Trager.

1344
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:49,247
Yeah. T-r-a-g-e-r.

1345
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,336
34 Charles Street?
Thank you.

1346
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,883
34 Charles Street.

1347
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,139
Okay.
Hi.

1348
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,641
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- I'm looking for a Jonathan Trager.

1349
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,608
Is this his building?

1350
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,148
You must be late.

1351
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,235
Late for what?

1352
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,400
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.

1353
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,820
- He's getting married?
- Yeah. Might be already.

1354
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,041
Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!

1355
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,409
- [tires screech]
- Excuse me!

1356
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,371
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria

1357
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:31,714
as fast as you can go, please?

1358
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,549
Can you see what it is?

1359
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,899
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!

1360
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,332
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.

1361
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:10,999
Stop!

1362
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,209
Stop?

1363
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,923
Is it over?

1364
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,926
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

1365
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,841
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.

1366
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,723
But don't worry.

1367
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,066
You'll get your present back.

1368
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,231
- Excuse me?
- They always return the presents.

1369
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,283
You asked If it was over.

1370
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:45,113
The truth is, it never even began.

1371
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,910
What?

1372
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,954
Yeah, he called the whole thing off
this morning.

1373
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,918
He called it off?

1374
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:03,173
[stifling tears, sniffling]

1375
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,599
That's terrible.

1376
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,269
Were you a friend of the bride...

1377
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,561
or the groom?

1378
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:20,482
[bell tolling]

1379
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,239
- What's up with this weather, huh?
- Yeah, what happened to spring?

1380
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:27,071
DEAN: So, all right, let's get into it.

1381
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,539
What kind of pep talk
do you want?

1382
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,531
What do you got?

1383
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,742
Well, I've got the inspirational,

1384
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,745
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."

1385
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,088
It's very popular,
but not appropriate for this.

1386
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,584
Of course, there's the "Don't worry.
There's more fish in the sea" pap.

1387
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,584
No.

1388
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,129
Uh, we can always fall back on the classic,

1389
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,008
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."

1390
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,311
How about telling me
I did the right thing?

1391
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,471
I don't have to tell you.

1392
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,224
I wrote it.

1393
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,189
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.

1394
01:16:58,197 --> 01:16:59,983
Nice.

1395
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,652
Turns out I had writer's block
penning your best man speech,

1396
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,945
and that's what ended up coming out.

1397
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,243
Blame it on the day job.

1398
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,746
- 20, right?
- Thanks.

1399
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,203
You going to see Courtney?

1400
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,250
Absolutely.

1401
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:21,542
I needed this.
[sighs]

1402
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,880
You know, the Greeks
didn't write obituaries.

1403
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,391
They only asked one question
after a man died:

1404
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,479
"Did he have passion?"

1405
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,018
How do I look?

1406
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,649
Like a jackass.

1407
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,904
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

1408
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,426
DEAN:
Jonathan Trager,

1409
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,721
prominent television producer for ESPN,

1410
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:13,311
died last night from complications
of losing his soul mate and his fiancée.

1411
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,809
He was 35 years old

1412
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,227
and soft-spoken

1413
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,600
and obsessive.

1414
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,399
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.

1415
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,740
But in the final days of his life,

1416
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,655
he revealed an unknown side
of his psyche.

1417
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,284
This hidden quasi-Jungian persona

1418
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,249
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit

1419
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,538
for his long-reputed soul mate,

1420
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,879
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.

1421
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,839
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night

1422
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:49,134
In complete and utter failure.

1423
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,099
Yet even in certain defeat,

1424
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,969
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief

1425
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,186
that life Is not merely

1426
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,023
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.

1427
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,484
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events

1428
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:06,401
that culminate in an exquisite,
sublime plan.

1429
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,658
Asked about the loss
of his dear friend,

1430
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:10,902
Dean Kansky,

1431
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,323
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author

1432
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,071
and executive editor
of the <i>New York Times,</i>

1433
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,540
described Jonathan
as a changed man

1434
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,249
in the last days of his life.

1435
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,704
"Things were clearer for him,"
Kansky noted.

1436
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:24,673
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life

1437
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,008
in harmony with the universe,

1438
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,377
we must all possess a powerful faith

1439
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,425
in what the ancients
used to call <i>fatum,</i>

1440
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,261
what we currently refer to...

1441
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,767
- ...as destiny.
- Destiny.

1442
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:49,857
So what are you gonna do?

1443
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,735
I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.

1444
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,945
Oh, you know what?
I don't think you should do that.

1445
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:54,945
I really don't.

1446
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,743
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- I think you should just be here.

1447
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,575
I feel it. I feel it In the air.

1448
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,826
Eve, what's happened to you?

1449
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:04,001
You've become your own worst
nightmare right there.

1450
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:07,632
Bye.

1451
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,890
But please put a jacket on.
It's freezing out here.

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,850
<i>Kevin Flynn: The Grid.</i>

2
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,890
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,750
<i>I tried to picture clusters of information,
as they moved through the computer.</i>

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>What did they look like?</i>

5
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,190
<i>Ships, motorcycles?</i>

6
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,930
<i>Were the circuits like freeways?</i>

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>I kept dreaming of a world,</i>

8
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,010
<i>I thought I'd never see.</i>

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,440
<i>And then, one day.</i>

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,640
Sam: You got in.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,860
Ha, ha, ha, that's right, man.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,560
I got in.

13
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:17,968
-The CollectorZ -
2011

14
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:23,768
1989...

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,820
And the world was more beautiful
than I ever dreamed.

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,570
And also, more dangerous
than I've ever dreamed.

17
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,440
Get in bed now, come on.

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,050
Now, I met a brave warrior.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,850
-Tron.
-Ba, ba, bom, bom, bommm.

20
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,440
TRON!

21
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,950
He fights for the users.

22
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,230
He sure does.

23
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh man, he showed me things that no
one had ever imagined.

24
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:54,780
Here at least. This battle was fought
in spectacular arenas.

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,810
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,760
-So radical, and together,
-You built the grid.

27
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,520
We built a new grid.

28
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,599
And programs and users.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,714
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time.

30
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:12,861
So, I created a program in my own image.

31
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,853
That could think, like you or me.

32
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:19,747
And I called him,
CLU.

33
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:22,797
Codified Likeness Utility.

34
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:24,196
That's right.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,010
And CLU Tron and I, we built the
system where all information was free,

36
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:33,498
And hope, beautiful.

37
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,019
And then, one day.

38
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:40,520
Something happened.

39
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:46,957
Something...extraordinary.

40
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,104
A miracle.

41
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,565
What was it?

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,215
That'll have to wait until next time.

43
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,747
How 'bout I get to work.

44
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,727
I'm gonna go with you, Dad.

45
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,665
Yeah, well.

46
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,357
On day, you will.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,094
I promise.

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,495
Okay.

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,055
Good night, Sam.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,452
All right, what do you say tomorrow,
you and I hit the arcade?

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,811
You can have a crack at the old man's
high score.

52
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,715
First games on me.

53
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:28,700
You want to play doubles?

54
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,249
Are we on the same team?

55
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,095
We're always on the same team.

56
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,051
Good evening, our lead story.

57
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,390
ENCOM CEO and video game Icon,
Kevin Flynn.

58
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:03,613
has disappeared.

59
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:06,992
He was best known for designing Tron,
and Space Paranoids.

60
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,725
The two best selling video games in history.

61
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:12,882
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982.

62
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:16,478
And the company skyrocketed to the
top of the tech industry.

63
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,929
But things changed in 1985.

64
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,038
With the untimely death of Flynn's wife,
the mother of his young son, Sam.

65
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:28,087
Recently ENCOM board members have been
concerned by the reports of Flynn's erratic

66
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:30,090
even obsessive behavior.

67
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:33,186
With Flynn missing, the company
is now in Chaos.

68
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:39,103
This afternoon ENCOM's board moved to
seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley.

69
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:42,090
Vowing to return the company to
profitability.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,395
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing.

71
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,365
And is instead pursuing his dream of quote:

72
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:53,858
"A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition".

73
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:58,104
In there is a new world.

74
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,179
In there is our future.

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,755
In there,

76
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:04,555
is our destiny.

77
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:14,471
Even Flynn's most ardent supporters are
now acknowledging a difficult truth.

78
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:17,512
Kevin Flynn may have simply, run away.

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,729
And often lows
for his imminent return.

80
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,780
There is perhaps no one....

81
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:30,990
He's coming.

82
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,394
He promised.

83
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:33,941
Sam, you have to eat.

84
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,064
Let go of me.

85
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,552
Sam.

86
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:39,240
What will become of Flynn's legacy,
and the future of ENCOM.

87
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:43,226
Will most likely depend on what becomes
of this now orphaned little boy.
-SAM!

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,191
SAM, come back.

89
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,599
Well that is a big door.

90
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,595
Welcome everybody, please settle.

91
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:51,667
I know it's late so I'll skip the pleasantries
and hand things over to our chairman.

92
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,147
Richard Mackey

93
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,224
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

94
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,068
Tonight I am pleased to announce that
ENCOM's last fiscal year,

95
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,560
was our most profitable, ever.

96
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,100
Yes.

97
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:33,089
And at midnight tonight, the 12th version of our pledge
of operating systems will hit the shelves.

98
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,519
Around the world.

99
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,249
I'm sure it comes as no surprise,

100
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,668
who we have to acclaim. The head of
our software design team.

101
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,733
A man who's father own uh, notable
history with ENCOM,

102
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,255
helped make this company, what it is today.

103
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,350
Edward Dillinger.

104
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:55,527
Well done.

105
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,603
We will be making our Debut on
Tokyo's Nikkei index.

106
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:13,188
ENCOM's stock will now trade around the world.

107
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:14,684
24/7

108
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:17,120
Huh? We did it.

109
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,601
Excuse me,

110
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,685
Yes, Allan.

111
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:48,843
Given the prices we charge to students, schools.

112
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:53,035
What sort of improvements have been made
in Flynn

113
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:56,556
I mean, uh, ENCOM O.S. twelve?

114
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,372
This year we put a twelve on the box.

115
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:07,670
O.S. 12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

116
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:11,967
The idea of sharing our software or
giving it away for free.

117
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,485
Disappeared with, Kevin Flynn.

118
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,862
We know you're here.

119
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,371
Let's make this easy.

120
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,092
Come on, come on.

121
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
FREEZE!

122
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,465
Okay, I hope I have no more questions.

123
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,199
I would like you to meet,
our next blockbuster.

124
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,083
ENCOM O.S. Twelve.

125
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,070
Whoa!

126
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:02,751
Oh, a few bugs.

127
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:09,908
Bare with us, one second.

128
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,897
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, will you just stop.

129
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:15,900
For one second.

130
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,962
Nikkei will be open in thirty seconds.

131
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,758
Does anyone know where the master
file is?

132
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,766
I do.

133
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:28,970
It's on the web.

134
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,958
This is mad, gotta stop this.

135
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,927
We got to bring that opener, now.

136
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,312
How is this happening, we've got to stop this now.

137
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,847
No, let's just, shut it down.

138
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,160
-Shut it down, NOW!
-Relax.

139
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,327
Relax, it's under control.

140
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:50,483
Relax?

141
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:55,308
Our most valuable and most secure
operating system is out there for free.

142
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,769
How am I suppose to explain that?

143
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,126
I don’t' know. Say it was all part of the plan.

144
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:03,566
A little uh, a little gift
from ENCOM.

145
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,267
Apparently ENCOM technologies is
having technical difficulties.

146
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,660
No.

147
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,598
Hey, Dad.

148
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,709
What are you doing?

149
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,777
Where are you going to run to now?

150
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,670
Now you don't want to do that.

151
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,270
Didn't anyone tell you, stealing is wrong.

152
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,803
Can't steal something that was
designed to be free.

153
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:58,895
Now I got you.

154
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,187
Don't sweat it, your boss is
okay with it.

155
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:04,579
-The hell he is.
-Your boss works for the CEO.

156
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,411
The CEO works for the shareholders.

157
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,650
Now do you know who the
biggest shareholder is?

158
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,198
I don't know, some kid.

159
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,011
You're Mr. Flynn.

160
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,303
Why?

161
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,911
This is your father's company.

162
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,786
Not anymore.

163
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,169
Wha..., hey, hey kid.

164
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,959
No, NOOOOOOO!

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,546
Woo, hoo, hoo, hooo.

166
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,658
Yeah!

167
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:51,779
O...kay.

169
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,180
Hey, there he is, get him.

170
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,583
HEY!

171
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:24,237
Hold it right there, freeze!

172
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:30,142
Okay boys, you got me.

173
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:32,880
Hey.

174
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,828
Enjoy it Marv, you earned it.

175
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,873
Why are you in my apartment, Allen?

176
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,409
You won't answer your phone.

177
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:20,673
How you been, Sam?

178
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:24,175
Well you know, when I was twelve,
I really appreciated the surrogate father thing.

179
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:25,512
But come on, Allen.

180
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,742
We're all under control now.

181
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:30,050
Oh, clearly.

182
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,969
What is it? You want to
help me with my home work?

183
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,520
Like old times, care to catch.

184
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,134
Well you got a, pretty nice view here.

185
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,376
Why'd you do the triple axel off
of a few hours ago?

186
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,328
Rough landing, huh?

187
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,747
Hmm, could have been worse.

188
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,867
I also thought your message to the
board was very clever.

189
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,178
Oh, you like that?

190
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,793
Well, that was Marv's idea.

191
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,876
Allan, we really gonna do this again?

192
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,960
Do I really look like I'm ready to run a
fortune 500 company?

193
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,444
No.

194
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:14,254
But truthfully, your father's pretty
happy with where you are.

195
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,172
Clearly they can just keep doing
whatever they want.

196
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:25,452
Well I guess what I find curious is
the crazy charities,

197
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:27,553
the annual prank on the company.

198
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,512
Sure have an interesting way of being
disinterested, Sam.

199
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:31,766
Why are you here, Alan?

200
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,329
I was paged last night.

201
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,038
Oh man, still rocking the pager, hey?

202
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,680
Good for you.

203
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:46,001
Yeah, your Dad once told me I
had to sleep with it, I still do.

204
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,488
Page came from your Dad's office, in the arcade.

205
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,898
So.

206
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:59,003
So, that numbers been disconnected
for twenty years.

207
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,204
He was talking about genetic algorithms,

208
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:06,040
Quantum teleportation. He said he was
about to change everything.

209
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,678
Or science, medicine, religion.

210
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,600
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

211
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,132
He wouldn't have left you.

212
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,637
Al, you're the only one who
still believes that.

213
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:23,233
He's either dead, or chillin' in Costa Rica.

214
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,631
Probably both.

215
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,069
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,333
I'm tired.

217
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,649
I smell like jail.

218
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,608
Let's just reconvene in another couple
of years, huh? What do you say?

219
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:40,911
Here.

220
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,067
These are the keys to the arcade.

221
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,257
I haven't gone over there, yet.

222
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,366
I thought you should be the one.

223
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,182
Alan, your acting like my father's
sitting at work.

224
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,970
Hey kiddo, lost track of time.

225
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,042
Wouldn't that be something.

226
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,415
What?

227
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:12,989
Huh.

228
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,836
You got a backdoor.

229
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:22,223
This isn't happening.

230
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh man, this IS happening.

231
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,406
This program has no disk.

232
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:55,913
Another spread.

233
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,762
Wait, I'm not a program.

234
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,851
He actually did it.

235
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,250
I'm on the grid.

236
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,939
Does the name Kevin Flynn mean
anything to you?

237
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,886
Be quiet if you want to live.

238
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:55,166
Game, games, the games.
Not the games.

239
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:56,608
What's his problem?

240
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:49,797
Rectify.

241
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:54,810
Rectify.

242
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:00,845
-Games.
-NO!

243
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:02,853
-Please.
-Rectify.

244
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,489
Look, I know you probably get this a lot,

245
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,995
But there's been a big mistake.

246
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:06,996
Games.

247
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,370
Please, no, no, no.

248
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,815
Whoa, hey!

249
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:13,961
Erase me!

250
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:15,706
AHHHHH!

251
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:19,859
No!

252
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,621
How soon will come .....

253
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,887
Hey, hey!

254
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:12,133
That's got a zipper.

255
00:27:29,702 --> 00:27:31,387
He is different.

256
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:41,440
This can't be good.

257
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:55,710
Attention, program. You will receive
an identity disc.

258
00:27:56,505 --> 00:28:01,086
Everything you do or learn, will
be imprinted on this disc.

259
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:04,123
If you lose your disc,

260
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:06,113
or fail to follow commands.

261
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,588
You will be subject to immediate,
deresolution.

262
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:20,373
Nearly complete. Disc activated and synchronized.

263
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,984
Proceed to games.

264
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,448
Games?

265
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:29,915
Where you going?

266
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:39,029
What am I suppose to do?

267
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:40,952
Survive.

268
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,155
Platform eight.

269
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,608
I have a strange version of you on my shelf.

270
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:22,463
Combatants 3 and 11.

271
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,370
Please duel.

272
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,019
When did ..., do that?

273
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,779
Damn it.

274
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:19,325
So that's how it is.

275
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:39,518
Combatant 11, 3 resolution.

276
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:41,636
I won!

277
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:43,519
Now let me out.

278
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,104
No unusual activity on the grid.

279
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:52,827
Security sweeps patrolling and
intensifying.

280
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,777
Right to par, on schedule.

281
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,391
Your initiate should be fully operational
within twelve cycles.

282
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:02,935
Perhaps if you were to include me.

283
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:06,156
In this mission, I could be be even greater.

284
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,449
Commence 3, and 7.
Disc closed.

285
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:15,981
Initiate

286
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,543
Yeah.

287
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,035
I'm out of this.

288
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:32,066
Combatant 3, entry.

289
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:39,493
Combatant 3, violation.

290
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:45,255
What is that program?

291
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:48,627
Combatant three.

292
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:49,825
Violation.

293
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:57,729
Initiate by-land brow.

294
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,795
Combatant 3, versus Rinzler.

295
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:09,832
(Crowd chants, Rinzler)

296
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:13,933
You gotta be kidding me.

297
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:36,228
Aw, come on, is that even legal?

298
00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:58,855
Yeah!

299
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,741
Why did it feel like I just got
tongue tied.

300
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:20,535
Come on, huh?

301
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,469
Come on.

302
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:15,914
User.

303
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,393
Identify yourself, program.

304
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,377
I'm not a program.

305
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,120
Identify....(Echoes)

306
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,710
My name is Sam Flynn.

307
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,153
Bring him here.

308
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:55,539
Let me go.

309
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:00,817
Reach.

310
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:03,850
Where am I?

311
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:08,071
Am I on the grid?

312
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,642
Who are you?

313
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,117
Dad.

314
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:20,739
Sam.

315
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,851
Look at you, man.

316
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:24,462
Look at the size of you.

317
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:27,727
How did you get in here?

318
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:29,692
I got your message.

319
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,390
Oh.

320
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,631
So it's just you?

321
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,104
Yeah.

322
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,587
Look at you.

323
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:40,952
Wow, isn't this something.

324
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:43,509
You look the same.

325
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,150
Oh, a lot has happened, Sam.
More than you can imagine.

326
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,167
This.

327
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,615
Let's have a look.

328
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,467
Got it.

329
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,236
Don't expect anymore.

330
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:19,549
So, you were trapped in here.

331
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:21,155
That's right.

332
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:25,949
You're in charge.

333
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,949
Right again.

334
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,331
So, can we just go home now.

335
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:34,081
Not in the cards.

336
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:36,983
Not for you.

337
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,981
That's a hell of a way to treat your son.

338
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,865
Oh, that.

339
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:53,819
I'm not your father, Sam.

340
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,393
But I'm very, very happy to see you.

341
00:38:02,853 --> 00:38:04,162
CLU.

342
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:08,968
Where is he?

343
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:10,177
What'd you do to him?

344
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,998
Same thing I'm going to do to you.

345
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:15,311
User.

346
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,188
Greetings programs.

347
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:45,910
Oh what a location we have here
before us.

348
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:51,108
Because, your rumors are true.

349
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:55,465
We do indeed have in our midst,

350
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,557
a user.

351
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,905
Aaa uuuser.

352
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,643
So, what to do.

353
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:12,726
What can this User reserve.

354
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,144
Might I suggest perhaps,

355
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,170
the challenge of the grid.

356
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:27,534
And who best to battle this
senior opponent.

357
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:32,577
Perhaps someone who has some experience
in these matters.

358
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,302
Oh yes, indeed programs.

359
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:44,139
Your liberator, your luminary.

360
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:47,290
Your leader.

361
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:52,545
The one who vanquished the
tyranny of the user.

362
00:39:52,546 --> 00:39:55,455
Those many cycles before.

363
00:39:56,422 --> 00:39:58,376
I've been waiting a long time for this.

364
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:02,398
CCCCLLLLLLUUUUU.

365
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,814
You wanna play?

366
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,461
I'll play.

367
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:13,827
Excellent work, sir.

368
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,391
Were you pleased with my execution?

369
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,751
The crowd seemed quite energized.

370
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:22,981
It wasn't meant for them.

371
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,510
What's this?

372
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:39,550
What do I do with this?

373
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:41,651
I'll give you a hint.

374
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,564
Na, nat.

375
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:55,581
Grid is live.

376
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:58,516
Initiate light-cycle battle.

377
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,246
You got no chance, User.

378
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,510
Their bots are faster than ours.
Use the littlest.

379
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,668
Now this I can do.

380
00:41:58,575 --> 00:41:59,843
Here we go.

381
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:56,783
Whoa.

382
00:43:06,345 --> 00:43:08,895
Hoh, oh!

383
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:10,589
AAAAAH!

384
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:24,764
Hey.

385
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,029
We gotta work together.

386
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,229
It's the only way.

387
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,042
That's it, you got me.

388
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:48,498
Boo!

389
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,943
Whoo, hoo hoo, keep out.

390
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:54,408
Now that's what I'm talking about.

391
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,056
Another customer.

392
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:58,198
Let's go.

393
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:17,301
Hang on buddy, I'm coming.

394
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,044
Come on.

395
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:32,332
(Laughter)

396
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:42,503
This is it.

397
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:43,780
Come on.

398
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:09,687
NO!

399
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,330
Illegal combatant on grid.

400
00:45:15,366 --> 00:45:16,501
Get in.

401
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:18,670
Illegal combatant on grid.

402
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,671
GET IN!

403
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:28,552
System failure, release Rinzler.

404
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:30,604
Game on old friend.

405
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:41,617
Who are you?

406
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,278
Hang on.

407
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,122
Oh man, you can't make that.

408
00:46:22,972 --> 00:46:24,145
Made it.

409
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:34,731
I'm, Quorra.

410
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:41,667
They're turning around.

411
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,028
Not by choice.

412
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,227
Their vehicles aren't designed to go off grid.

413
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:46,999
They'll mal-function on this terrian.

414
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,009
What about us?

415
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,029
Hah, obviously not.

416
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:54,610
Where are you taking me?

417
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,702
Patience, Sam Flynn.

418
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,600
All your questions will be answered soon.

419
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,676
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

420
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:14,252
Wait here.

421
00:48:18,197 --> 00:48:19,778
Quorra.

422
00:48:20,737 --> 00:48:22,705
I dreamed of Tron.

423
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,615
First time in years.

424
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:27,722
A sign.

425
00:48:29,497 --> 00:48:32,279
A sign my dear friend, is
of a weary soul.

426
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:35,581
I'm afraid something's happened.

427
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,076
Something has happened.

428
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,388
We have a guest.

429
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,863
There are no guests here.

430
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:09,113
Sam.

431
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:11,962
Long time.

432
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:16,046
You have no idea.

433
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:25,394
You're, you're here.

434
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,897
You're here.

435
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:33,028
I'm here.

436
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:43,076
You're big.

437
00:49:47,181 --> 00:49:48,183
Old.

438
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:53,979
How did you get here?

439
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:56,615
Alan came over.

440
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:59,275
Apparently

441
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:02,576
He got your page.

442
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,927
From your office at the arcade.

443
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:08,647
Page?

444
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:13,946
Page, of course.

445
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:20,396
CLU had him on the Light-Cycle grid.

446
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:21,911
I intervened.

447
00:50:23,282 --> 00:50:24,583
My.

448
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,098
We may soon,

449
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,008
go find him.

450
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,484
He never thought he'd see you again.

451
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:51,243
Yeah.

452
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:00,430
Vintage.

453
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,756
Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games.

454
00:51:04,388 --> 00:51:07,164
It doesn't get out as much
as it used to, but.

455
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,088
Still the fastest thing on the grid.

456
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:34,839
Do you know it?

457
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,787
His patience usually beats out my more,

458
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:40,774
aggressive strategy.

459
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:47,020
Flynn shared them with me.

460
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:49,035
I've read them all.

461
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:52,548
Wow, you like reading.

462
00:51:53,183 --> 00:52:00,150
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Lee Chang,
Caring without goal.

463
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,858
Must have a killer ending.

464
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,553
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless.

465
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:09,399
It's about, removing oneself from the equation.

466
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:12,027
But, between you and me.

467
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,834
Jules Verne is my favorite.

468
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,712
You know Jules Verne?

469
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:18,972
Sure.

470
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:21,033
What's he like?

471
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:34,273
Your move Flynn, come on.

472
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:36,458
Come on.

473
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:00,839
How old are you now, Sam?

474
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,176
Uh, you should be 27.

475
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,399
27, yeah.

476
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,260
Did you attend a college?

477
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,585
Cal-Tech.

478
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,888
Cal-Tech.

479
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,113
My Alma-Mater.

480
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Yeah.

481
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:18,563
That's why I dropped out.

482
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:29,107
Work?

483
00:53:29,577 --> 00:53:33,050
A job? ENCOM or you, uh...

484
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:36,479
I check in once a year.

485
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:40,680
-Life
-A dog.

486
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:42,361
I have one.

487
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:44,645
Rescue.

488
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:47,043
Well, dogs are cool.

489
00:53:56,558 --> 00:54:00,274
I'm sure you must have a few questions
of your own, Sam.

490
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,355
Actually, just one.

491
00:54:07,975 --> 00:54:09,822
Why I never came home?

492
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:16,238
Those nights when I went to the office

493
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,973
I'm sure you figured it out by now,

494
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:19,974
was to come here.

495
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,453
Moving forward into digital space.

496
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:25,448
Maybe, still.

497
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:30,490
But, I also had you.

498
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,396
I had income, I couldn't be
there all of the time.

499
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:36,822
I needed partners.

500
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:38,026
Finding CLU.

501
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:40,482
That's right.

502
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:46,433
Tron was created by Alan for the old system.

503
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:48,862
I brought him here to protect this one.

504
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,056
CLU was my creation.

505
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,961
Program designed to create a perfect world.

506
00:54:56,132 --> 00:54:58,933
We were jammin' man, building utopia.

507
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,604
Hours here were just minutes back home.

508
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,518
Just when I thought it couldn't get more profound.

509
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,641
Something unexpected happened.

510
00:55:07,556 --> 00:55:08,648
The Miracle.

511
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:10,501
The Miracle.

512
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:12,960
You remember.

513
00:55:14,402 --> 00:55:15,924
Iso's

514
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:17,848
Isomorphic Algrarithm's.

515
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:20,499
A whole new life form.

516
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:22,224
And you created them?

517
00:55:26,877 --> 00:55:28,204
No, no.

518
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:29,905
They manifested.

519
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,714
Like a flame.

520
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:34,970
They weren't really from anywhere.

521
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:37,411
The conditions were right, and
they came into being.

522
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,763
For centuries we dreamed of gods, spirits, aliens.

523
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:45,195
Intelligence beyond our own.

524
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:46,384
You seeing this?

525
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,418
I found them, in here.

526
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:51,012
Like flowers in the waste land.

527
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:55,977
Profoundly naive.

528
00:55:57,748 --> 00:55:59,769
Unimaginably wild.

529
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:04,302
They were spectacular.

530
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:07,942
Everything I'd hope to find in the system.

531
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:11,362
Control, order, perfection. None of it
meant a thing.

532
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,715
But living in a hall of mirrors.

533
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:15,482
The Iso's.

534
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:17,000
Shattered.

535
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:20,470
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

536
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:21,939
Disease?

537
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,245
History!

538
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:26,681
Science, philosophy, every idea,

539
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:29,475
man has ever had about the universe
up for grabs.

540
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:32,350
Bio digital jazz, man.

541
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:36,527
The Iso's, they were going to
be my gift to the world.

542
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,212
So, what happened?

543
00:56:39,503 --> 00:56:40,845
CLU.

544
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,207
CLU happened.

545
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:57,637
Flynn!

546
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:04,705
Am I still to create perfect system?

547
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,540
Yeah.

548
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,710
It was a coup.

549
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:16,402
Go!

550
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:31,770
You've been corrupted.

551
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:49,216
Flynn, go!

552
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:54,829
Yahhh!

553
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:59,018
Tron, he fought for me.

554
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:02,051
I never saw him again.

555
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:05,205
So why don't you fight?

556
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:07,502
He did.

557
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,679
It fed from my resistance.

558
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,295
The more I fought, the more powerful
it became.

559
00:58:12,825 --> 00:58:14,751
It was impressive run.

560
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:20,422
Then my miracle. CLU saw the
ISO's as an imperfection.

561
00:58:21,189 --> 00:58:22,844
So he destroyed them.

562
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,680
The purge.

563
00:58:28,626 --> 00:58:29,958
He killed them all?

564
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:32,114
It was genocide.

565
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:36,899
I tried to get back. But I couldn't
get to the portal.

566
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:40,614
It uses massive power. And it can't
stay open forever.

567
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:47,257
And like a safe. It can only be opened
from the outside.

568
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:51,819
It closed on me, Sam.

569
00:58:53,244 --> 00:58:55,009
That's why I never came home.

570
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:06,075
So the portal. It activated when I came in.

571
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:07,980
So it's open, now.

572
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:09,029
Not for long.

573
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,662
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

574
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:12,934
So, we go now.

575
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:15,254
Go home. Make a run for it.

576
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:16,884
Get you out of here. Don't rush.

577
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:19,784
What do you mean, don't rush. The
portal's going to close.

578
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,372
What? What is it?

579
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:27,643
The moment Flynn is on the grid,
CLU will stop at nothing to obtain his disc.

580
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:31,067
My disc is everything, Sam.
It's the master key.

581
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,077
The golden ticket for the way out.

582
00:59:34,096 --> 00:59:35,670
Not just for me.

583
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:40,059
You mean all the other... will  make
a landing on those.

584
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,342
CLU figures if I can be in.

585
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:43,729
Yeah.

586
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,661
With my disc, it's possible.

587
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:48,024
Then what?

588
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:50,107
Game over.

589
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:53,441
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

590
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:57,555
What more important is
our world.

591
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:01,420
I can't let that happen.

592
01:00:01,687 --> 01:00:03,375
I won't.

593
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:04,631
So what will we do?

594
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:06,761
Nothing?

595
01:00:06,762 --> 01:00:09,380
It's amazing how productive doing
nothing can be.

596
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,318
CLU's planning something.

597
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,142
We've known that for a while.

598
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:16,627
Programs have been disappearing,
there's unrest out there.

599
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:21,700
Even revolution. We sit tight, we might
be brought down from the inside.

600
01:00:22,097 --> 01:00:25,429
The portal's closing. We can't just sit
around. We have to move now.

601
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,465
Tell me.

602
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:28,527
What brought you here?

603
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:30,015
Through the grid.

604
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:32,809
Alan got your page.

605
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,933
I didn't send any page.

606
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:38,585
It was CLU. CLU sent that page.

607
01:00:38,586 --> 01:00:39,886
That's why you're here.

608
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,485
This is all his design.

609
01:00:42,486 --> 01:00:45,488
He wanted a new piece on the board
to change the game.

610
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,172
With you he got more than he ever dreamed.

611
01:00:48,173 --> 01:00:50,476
This is precisely what he wants.

612
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:52,695
Us together, heading for the portal.

613
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,018
It's his game now.

614
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:57,529
The only way to win is not to play.

615
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:01,670
Now that's a help, great way.

616
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:03,025
But it is a way.

617
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,507
We need you home.

618
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,105
Don't you want that?

619
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:17,701
Sometimes life has a way of moving
you past things like wants and hope.

620
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,868
That's right, Dad.

621
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:24,960
Keep telling yourself that.

622
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:32,257
Goodnight, Sam.

623
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:57,855
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

624
01:01:57,856 --> 01:02:00,357
I mean, he built CLU.
Why doesn't he just end him.

625
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,355
He could but it would require reintegration.

626
01:02:04,356 --> 01:02:05,384
Yeah, all right.

627
01:02:05,711 --> 01:02:07,889
He would never survive the effect.

628
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,573
It would mean the end of them both.

629
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,163
If he refuses to save himself, then I will.

630
01:02:17,453 --> 01:02:18,453
How?

631
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:20,949
I'm going to the portal.

632
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:23,716
CLU wants Dad's death, not mine.

633
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:27,009
I'm going to fly out I'm going to figure
this thing out from the other side.

634
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:31,878
If CLU finds a way to my world it will be
gone with one keystroke.

635
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,579
I can't do anything unless I
get to the portal.

636
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:40,575
He might get stuck, and you don't want to be
stuck in this place for very long.

637
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:46,615
I really think you should consider
your father's wisdom.

638
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:49,676
I have.

639
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,391
(Knock on door)

640
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,570
There's someone I once knew.

641
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:57,140
A program named Zuse, who
fought along side the ISO's.

642
01:03:57,115 --> 01:04:01,115
They say he can get anyone anywhere..

643
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,525
How do I find him?

644
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,357
This is his sector.

645
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:13,722
Make it there alive.

646
01:04:13,723 --> 01:04:14,988
And he'll find you.

647
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:56,906
Sam.

648
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,036
Sam?

649
01:05:44,022 --> 01:05:46,166
Hey man, it's your lucky day.

650
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:55,875
Stop it.

651
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,775
Sam Flynn.

652
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,043
-You remember me.
-Yeah.

653
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:13,169
You gave me some advice.

654
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,473
And you followed it.

655
01:06:15,362 --> 01:06:17,559
Its unfortunate we met the way we did.

656
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:20,817
You have a good night.

657
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:22,449
You're looking for someone.

658
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:27,547
What makes you say that.

659
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,189
Intuition.

660
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:35,250
Sir, sentries down town,

661
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:37,003
recovered Flynn's light cycle.

662
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:40,743
They've traced it to it's component of origin.

663
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:08,523
Prepare the light-runner Quorra.

664
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:11,701
We're going downtown.

665
01:07:34,728 --> 01:07:36,761
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

666
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:41,124
Flynn, you don't need to go. I sent
him to someone we can trust.

667
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:43,240
Quorra, there is no choice.

668
01:07:44,088 --> 01:07:45,978
I won't lose him again.

669
01:07:48,304 --> 01:07:51,992
Chaos, good news.

670
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:35,316
Relax, they're off the grid.

671
01:08:42,281 --> 01:08:43,812
His name is Castor.

672
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:46,403
You want to speak to Zuse you're
going to have to go to him.

673
01:08:46,404 --> 01:08:48,502
Where is your sense of humor, my friend?

674
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:51,893
Programs are disappearing, Castor. Soon
none of us will be left.

675
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,020
Zuse can make the factions, ferment the revolution.

676
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:57,050
Well of course Zuse can do these things.

677
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:58,713
Grant me an audience.

678
01:08:58,714 --> 01:09:01,649
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating
my dear bot,

679
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,479
But Zuse's time is precious.

680
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,743
We shall see.

681
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,497
If you'll excuse me a moment, I have to, uh...

682
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:16,780
Attend to something, but have a drink.

683
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,557
Courtesy of the "End of line" club.

684
01:09:20,062 --> 01:09:21,162
It is happening.

685
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:24,260
Come, away from these primitive functions.

686
01:09:25,355 --> 01:09:27,775
The son of Flynn.

687
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:30,465
Of all the innumerable possibilities.

688
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,990
He has to walk into mine.

689
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:38,767
Libations, for everybody!

690
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,458
I'm Castor.

691
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:44,278
Your host.

692
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:49,604
Provider of any and all entertainment
and diversions.

693
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,945
At your service.

694
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:55,081
I'm looking for Zuse.

695
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:56,981
Indeed.

696
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:58,587
Many are.

697
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:00,516
Where can I find him?

698
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,192
This pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

699
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:08,276
Perhaps we should retire to
my private lounge.

700
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:13,233
Uh, designed it myself, you know.

701
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:14,649
It's true.

702
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:17,211
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.

703
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,426
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

704
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:23,886
Electrify the boys and girls,
if you'd be so kind.

705
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:27,949
Thank you.

706
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,159
Gem.

707
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,711
My name is, Gem.

708
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,067
Ah, perfect.

709
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:37,116
-You are CLU.
-I am CLU.

710
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:39,875
You will create the perfect system.

711
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:41,943
I will create the perfect system.

712
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,451
Together we're going to change the world, man.

713
01:12:56,197 --> 01:12:57,880
(Angrily screams)

714
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:17,456
Let's move.

715
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:23,155
Zuse has been around since the earliest
days of the gaming grid.

716
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:27,443
By necessity.
Castor mined all the percentages.

717
01:13:27,823 --> 01:13:29,280
All the angles.

718
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:30,988
So when do I meet him?

719
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:36,960
You...just...did.

720
01:13:40,472 --> 01:13:44,282
After the purge, I needed
to reinvent myself.

721
01:13:44,513 --> 01:13:46,541
Self preservation, you understand.

722
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,143
Now.

723
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:56,993
What can I do, for you?

724
01:13:59,276 --> 01:14:01,176
I need to get to the portal.

725
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,686
Well, it's closing quickly.

726
01:14:03,687 --> 01:14:05,233
As I'm sure, you're aware.

727
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:07,238
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

728
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:09,438
And it's quite a journey.

729
01:14:09,969 --> 01:14:12,701
Beyond the far reaches of the outland.

730
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:18,507
Your father didn't want any programs,
slipping out accidentally, did he.

731
01:14:18,673 --> 01:14:19,881
Can you help me?

732
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:22,179
Of course.

733
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:27,074
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed.

734
01:14:27,075 --> 01:14:29,052
I must ask, who sent you my way?

735
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,802
Her name's, Quorra.

736
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:36,720
Said she met you a long time ago.

737
01:14:37,379 --> 01:14:38,922
I believe she did.

738
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:41,790
Many cycles ago.

739
01:14:42,964 --> 01:14:44,838
Was a different time.

740
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:48,065
But we're not here to relive the past.

741
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,765
Let's see about your future, shall we?

742
01:14:49,766 --> 01:14:51,014
Now, well have to, uh...

743
01:14:51,015 --> 01:14:53,832
change your attire, and you'll need
a forged disc.

744
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,995
Not easy these days.

745
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:57,937
But my. And of  course you'll need transport.

746
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,111
To cross the sea of simulation.

747
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:15,083
This is going to be quite a ride.

748
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:30,113
I believed in users once before.

749
01:15:31,179 --> 01:15:32,932
Playing all the angles.

750
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:39,290
Revenge!

751
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:49,666
The game has changed.

752
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:51,280
Son of Flynn!

753
01:16:01,274 --> 01:16:03,288
Ha, ha, haaa.

754
01:16:08,124 --> 01:16:09,193
Met your friend.

755
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:10,477
He's fantastic.

756
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:14,528
Behold, the son of our maker.

757
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

758
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:25,558
Goes through ....

759
01:17:46,882 --> 01:17:48,007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

760
01:18:06,156 --> 01:18:07,737
A little help here, maybe.

761
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:28,695
You did it.

762
01:18:29,678 --> 01:18:31,228
Dad, it's gone.

763
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:33,180
It is.

764
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:37,933
I'm sorry, I know I messed up.

765
01:18:39,813 --> 01:18:41,503
We can go back, I can go back.

766
01:18:41,504 --> 01:18:43,122
No, we stay together.

767
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,847
Dad, I can do this.

768
01:18:44,848 --> 01:18:46,563
You've done enough all ready.

769
01:18:52,182 --> 01:18:54,431
Sam, you really.

770
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:59,056
You're messin' with my Zen thing, man.

771
01:19:01,087 --> 01:19:02,384
She's stable.

772
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:04,756
So what do we do now?

773
01:19:04,757 --> 01:19:06,751
I don't know.
Nothing.

774
01:19:07,806 --> 01:19:08,974
We do nothing.

775
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:11,750
We still,

776
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:15,723
Wait.

777
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:25,581
Ever jump a freight train?

778
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:28,342
Huh?

779
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:29,728
We do it your way.

780
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:31,526
It's a long sprint to the portal.

781
01:19:32,054 --> 01:19:34,198
If we beat CLU there we have a chance.

782
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:35,422
Let's get her out of here.

783
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,996
This will take us there.

784
01:20:22,953 --> 01:20:24,310
Is she going to make it?

785
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:27,250
I don't know, I gotta identify
the damaged code.

786
01:20:28,288 --> 01:20:31,125
The sequence on it is just
enormously complex.

787
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,209
But didn't you write it?

788
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:38,358
Some I wrote, the rest of it is just,

789
01:20:40,341 --> 01:20:41,713
beyond me.

790
01:20:44,271 --> 01:20:45,913
She's an Iso.

791
01:20:46,631 --> 01:20:49,240
Yeah, the last Iso.

792
01:20:51,049 --> 01:20:55,286
All this time you were just, protecting her.

793
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:57,094
She's the miracle, man.

794
01:20:57,409 --> 01:20:59,405
Everything I ever worked for.

795
01:21:00,608 --> 01:21:03,865
A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition.

796
01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:07,751
I always thought that was just a plot line.

797
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:11,693
In our world, she could change everything.

798
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:20,821
Check that out.

799
01:21:28,498 --> 01:21:30,759
She risked herself for me.

800
01:21:32,385 --> 01:21:34,383
Some things are worth the risk.

801
01:21:48,148 --> 01:21:49,811
Look at this.

802
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:57,295
Now that is impressive, if I do say
so myself, huh?

803
01:21:58,151 --> 01:22:01,572
Come on, it's going to take a while for
her system to reboot.

804
01:22:01,705 --> 01:22:03,739
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

805
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:25,139
The boy and Flynn are gone.

806
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,949
I presume your Excellency, they
perished in the elevator.

807
01:22:32,535 --> 01:22:33,818
You presume.

808
01:22:36,104 --> 01:22:37,133
Find them.

809
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:44,355
Ice caps were melting,

810
01:22:44,356 --> 01:22:45,892
farmed in the middle east.

811
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:47,970
Lakers, Celtics, Batman.

812
01:22:49,624 --> 01:22:52,353
Now the rich are getting richer.
The poor are getting poorer.

813
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:55,516
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

814
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:56,826
What's Wi-Fi?

815
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,995
-Wireless sim-linking
-A Digital devices.

816
01:22:59,996 --> 01:23:02,562
-Yeah.
-Oh.

817
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:04,418
I thought of that when you were five.

818
01:23:09,702 --> 01:23:11,124
Mom and Dad,

819
01:23:13,419 --> 01:23:15,479
-I assume let go
-Yeah.

820
01:23:17,009 --> 01:23:18,009
Oh.

821
01:23:18,554 --> 01:23:20,651
Back when I was twelve.

822
01:23:21,453 --> 01:23:23,358
Gram five years later.

823
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,666
You remember that night.

824
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:30,560
You didn't come home.

825
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,780
Wow, I said I'd show you the grid.

826
01:23:36,108 --> 01:23:38,171
You should have seen this place
back then.

827
01:23:39,843 --> 01:23:41,411
Couldn't wait to show it to you.

828
01:23:43,645 --> 01:23:45,013
But not way.

829
01:23:45,015 --> 01:23:47,203
Must been something before CLU screwed it up.

830
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,354
No, no, he,

831
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,245
he's me.

832
01:23:52,246 --> 01:23:53,724
I screwed it up.

833
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:57,081
Crazy after perfection.

834
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,625
Using after what was right in front of me.

835
01:24:03,899 --> 01:24:05,132
Right in front of me.

836
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:09,456
Look what you've accomplished.

837
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:11,937
It's incredible.

838
01:24:12,244 --> 01:24:13,244
Sam.

839
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:17,502
I'd give it all up for one
more day with you.

840
01:24:31,324 --> 01:24:32,324
Hey.

841
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:34,224
Remember your old Ducati?

842
01:24:34,225 --> 01:24:38,387
You kidding me. There's not a day goes
by I don't think about that bike.

843
01:24:38,388 --> 01:24:40,059
Yeah, well. Fixing her up.

844
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,439
What are you busting my bike?

845
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,188
Well twenty years in the shed, no
tork, I mean.

846
01:24:46,036 --> 01:24:47,894
She knew you were her love.

847
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:50,992
How's she running?

848
01:24:51,409 --> 01:24:53,463
Well, when I'm done.

849
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:55,473
Better than ever.

850
01:24:55,475 --> 01:24:58,899
Aw man, I'd like to see that.

851
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:01,667
You will.

852
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:09,024
Yeah, if your brooding, give her this.

853
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,781
Your old man is going to knock down the sky.

854
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:44,560
When Flynn entered the space,
ahh, everything changed.

855
01:25:44,992 --> 01:25:47,911
I've never seen anything quite like it.

856
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:52,770
Aura was palpable.

857
01:25:54,394 --> 01:25:55,766
Was it.

858
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:59,239
I presume our understanding,

859
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,032
is still valid.

860
01:26:02,295 --> 01:26:03,942
Control of the city.

861
01:26:04,888 --> 01:26:06,656
A sizable request.

862
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:08,763
-I know.
-But, uh...

863
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,841
Seemingly fitting compensation.

864
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:12,842
You think?

865
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:17,126
How long have you been searching for this?

866
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:18,387
Hmm?

867
01:26:18,388 --> 01:26:21,821
A thousand cycles...huh?

868
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,714
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

869
01:26:28,672 --> 01:26:30,174
The master key to any and all,

870
01:26:30,175 --> 01:26:33,873
riddles of the grid.

871
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:38,979
There's something else, too.

872
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,630
Isn't there?

873
01:26:40,631 --> 01:26:42,647
I heard the chatter.

874
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:46,486
About this private initiative.

875
01:26:55,990 --> 01:27:00,180
I realize that uh, alliance is at times,

876
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,539
uneasy.

877
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,898
But always necessary.

878
01:27:05,755 --> 01:27:07,252
You know you need me.

879
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,953
Right where I am.

880
01:27:08,954 --> 01:27:10,813
True.

881
01:27:11,731 --> 01:27:13,477
Of course, you're right.

882
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,270
You have a drink.

883
01:27:24,393 --> 01:27:26,053
End of line, man.

884
01:27:35,957 --> 01:27:36,961
- (Gasps for breath)
-Hey, hey.

885
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:38,723
It's okay, we're safe for now.

886
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,744
We're heading east, towards the portal.

887
01:27:43,838 --> 01:27:45,839
CLU has the disc.

888
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:49,625
Once I get out, I can shut him down.

889
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:53,828
I should never have sent you to Zuse.

890
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:55,010
It was a mistake.

891
01:27:55,577 --> 01:27:58,231
It's okay, I made a few myself.

892
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:04,865
Where is he?

893
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:08,329
I think he's knocking on the sky.

894
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:11,187
And listening to the sound.

895
01:28:12,307 --> 01:28:13,585
Yeah.

896
01:28:15,033 --> 01:28:16,559
How did you find him?

897
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:27,594
It's okay.

898
01:28:30,495 --> 01:28:31,535
I know.

899
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:38,739
It was during the purge.

900
01:28:40,497 --> 01:28:42,016
CLU was relentless.

901
01:28:43,072 --> 01:28:45,560
The Black guard were executing
Iso's in the streets.

902
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:48,771
Everyone I knew,

903
01:28:48,978 --> 01:28:49,978
disappeared.

904
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,161
Then they came for me.

905
01:28:57,618 --> 01:28:58,751
So I ran.

906
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:03,417
As sympathetic programs smuggled me
out of the city.

907
01:29:03,977 --> 01:29:05,676
but soon they had me surrounded.

908
01:29:06,581 --> 01:29:08,023
I prepared for the end.

909
01:29:09,192 --> 01:29:11,080
And just as everything was going dark.

910
01:29:11,354 --> 01:29:12,886
I felt a hand.

911
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:14,624
On my shoulder.

912
01:29:17,299 --> 01:29:18,929
And when I opened my eyes.

913
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:22,826
Standing above me,

914
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,894
was the creator.

915
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:29,071
Your father.

916
01:29:30,843 --> 01:29:32,489
He saved me.

917
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,657
I guess you could say I'm,
a rescue.

918
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,091
Hell of a view.

919
01:30:01,092 --> 01:30:03,997
It used to let us know that Flynn was here.

920
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,767
It became a symbol of something bigger.

921
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,927
Something better.

922
01:30:08,928 --> 01:30:10,144
In this world.

923
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:12,835
I've never been this close before.

924
01:30:14,562 --> 01:30:16,904
It's how I imagined the sunrise to be.

925
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,386
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.

926
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:24,331
What's it like?

927
01:30:26,915 --> 01:30:29,365
-The sun?
-Yeah.

928
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:31,923
Oh yeah.

929
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:36,153
I never had to describe it before.

930
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,706
Warm.

931
01:30:42,045 --> 01:30:43,174
Brave

932
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:47,411
Beautiful.

933
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:15,115
Get below.

934
01:31:15,831 --> 01:31:16,831
MOVE!

935
01:31:18,484 --> 01:31:19,854
This isn't suppose to be here.

936
01:31:24,971 --> 01:31:26,184
What happened?

937
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:51,463
He's building an army.

938
01:31:52,018 --> 01:31:53,362
Let's go.

939
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:25,708
-Goodbye.
-Quorra!

940
01:32:25,709 --> 01:32:26,666
-Quorra.
-Wait.

941
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:27,924
What's she doing?

942
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:29,709
Removing herself from the equation.

943
01:32:47,533 --> 01:32:48,533
Tron.

944
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,870
He's alive.

945
01:32:58,064 --> 01:32:59,955
We can't just let her go.

946
01:32:59,956 --> 01:33:01,020
Sam!

947
01:33:01,021 --> 01:33:02,359
There's another way.

948
01:33:16,498 --> 01:33:17,700
Well done sir.

949
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:34,389
Have you ever seen anything like it?

950
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:36,813
Humbly, sir.

951
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:41,564
I know you have greater designs,
then any of us understand.

952
01:33:43,187 --> 01:33:44,228
What does it do?

953
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:11,999
She's going to wind up like one of them.

954
01:34:12,895 --> 01:34:14,445
Keep moving, Sam.

955
01:34:24,635 --> 01:34:28,242
You are a very rare bird, aren't you.

956
01:34:36,893 --> 01:34:42,492
Where's your disc?
Where is he?

957
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:47,127
Must have been so lonely out there.

958
01:34:48,655 --> 01:34:51,389
Tragic to be the only one.

959
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:56,249
I've seen what users are
capable of, CLU.

960
01:34:56,865 --> 01:34:58,721
You don't belong with them.

961
01:35:04,038 --> 01:35:07,102
I have something very special
in mind for you.

962
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,199
Take her upstairs.

963
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:13,953
And find them.

964
01:35:15,265 --> 01:35:18,862
You'll have to excuse me. You know I
was just unprepared to ....

965
01:35:35,112 --> 01:35:37,018
Greetings programs.

966
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:44,707
Together we have achieved a
great many things.

967
01:35:44,743 --> 01:35:47,840
We have created a vast complex system.

968
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:49,853
We've maintained it,

969
01:35:50,738 --> 01:35:51,852
we've improved it.

970
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:56,518
We have rid it of its imperfections.

971
01:35:58,449 --> 01:36:03,250
Not to mention, ridding of the false deity
that sought to enslave us.

972
01:36:05,554 --> 01:36:07,616
Kevin Flynn!

973
01:36:08,857 --> 01:36:10,457
Where are you now?

974
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:16,795
My fellow programs, let there
be no doubt.

975
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:20,230
That our world is a cage no more.

976
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,117
For at this moment.

977
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:27,061
The key to the next frontier is finally
in our possession.

978
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:33,914
The disc.

979
01:36:34,028 --> 01:36:40,326
And unlike our selfish creator who preserves
the privilege of our world only to himself.

980
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:43,911
I will make their world open,

981
01:36:43,912 --> 01:36:46,810
and available to all of us.

982
01:36:49,648 --> 01:36:51,248
YES!

983
01:36:51,249 --> 01:36:53,078
To all of us.

984
01:37:03,337 --> 01:37:05,498
He's taking all of us with him.

985
01:37:05,732 --> 01:37:07,423
He's figured out how to do it.

986
01:37:07,481 --> 01:37:09,762
And whatever we find there.

987
01:37:09,765 --> 01:37:15,036
There our system will grow,
there our system will blossom.

988
01:37:17,058 --> 01:37:21,277
You have proved yourselves,
proved yourself to me.

989
01:37:21,278 --> 01:37:22,951
Been loyal to me.

990
01:37:22,952 --> 01:37:26,040
And I will never betray you.

991
01:37:38,891 --> 01:37:40,319
Dad, we have to get your disc.

992
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:41,631
No we gotta get to the portal.

993
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,222
You shut them down from the outside.

994
01:37:43,223 --> 01:37:45,371
Even if I make it out you won't last
in here.

995
01:37:45,372 --> 01:37:47,400
-Quorra won't last..
-I said it will be all right, come on.

996
01:37:47,401 --> 01:37:49,301
Will you let it go, I'm not
going home without you.

997
01:37:50,372 --> 01:37:51,502
Sam.

998
01:37:52,262 --> 01:37:53,592
Same team.

999
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:55,973
Remember?

1000
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:00,235
I was afraid you were going to say that.

1001
01:38:01,185 --> 01:38:03,577
Meet me on the flight deck in five.
And get me some wheels.

1002
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:05,432
Wheels? What's your plan?

1003
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:07,941
I'm a user.

1004
01:38:08,089 --> 01:38:09,409
I'll improvise.

1005
01:38:13,912 --> 01:38:16,735
Rid the new system of its imperfections.

1006
01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:21,069
My vision is clear.

1007
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:27,812
Out there, is a new world!

1008
01:38:28,605 --> 01:38:31,692
Out there is our victory.

1009
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:34,401
Out there,

1010
01:38:36,378 --> 01:38:38,252
is our destiny.

1011
01:39:23,114 --> 01:39:25,425
Identify yourself program.

1012
01:39:28,692 --> 01:39:29,972
I'm not a program.

1013
01:39:30,168 --> 01:39:31,844
My name is Sam Flynn.

1014
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:56,616
Identify yourself.

1015
01:39:56,617 --> 01:39:58,094
I'm taking this vehicle.

1016
01:39:58,095 --> 01:39:59,890
You are not authorized.

1017
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:03,994
Right away, sir.

1018
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,137
Watch your step please,
as you board the aircraft.

1019
01:40:20,421 --> 01:40:21,684
One of the users.

1020
01:40:29,162 --> 01:40:31,719
<i>Master key, disengaged.</i>

1021
01:40:32,627 --> 01:40:35,112
<i>Master key, disengaged.</i>

1022
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:36,474
I came with a girl.

1023
01:40:36,987 --> 01:40:39,027
A program, where is she?

1024
01:40:42,047 --> 01:40:43,588
Sam. GO!

1025
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,092
What are you doing here?

1026
01:41:11,093 --> 01:41:12,094
We gotta get to the flight deck.

1027
01:41:12,095 --> 01:41:14,213
But CLU will be here any minute.
We'll never make it.

1028
01:41:14,755 --> 01:41:15,755
Come on.

1029
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,182
Come on, kiddo.

1030
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:28,923
Radical, man.

1031
01:41:36,923 --> 01:41:37,923
Hurry!

1032
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,270
Made it.

1033
01:41:58,538 --> 01:42:01,581
Try to hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

1034
01:42:06,828 --> 01:42:08,446
You got this, Quorra.

1035
01:42:08,924 --> 01:42:10,666
It's all in the wrist.

1036
01:42:50,433 --> 01:42:51,992
Death to the user.

1037
01:43:16,582 --> 01:43:18,331
Head towards the light, Quorra.

1038
01:43:20,556 --> 01:43:22,575
Where'd you learn that move back there?

1039
01:43:22,672 --> 01:43:24,184
ENCOM tower.

1040
01:43:24,185 --> 01:43:25,421
Couple nights ago.

1041
01:43:27,914 --> 01:43:29,299
ENCOM tower.

1042
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:33,474
Light jets.

1043
01:43:33,844 --> 01:43:35,316
Here they come.

1044
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:38,410
Sam, take the turret.

1045
01:43:46,881 --> 01:43:49,020
Oh man, I'm all over this.

1046
01:43:52,552 --> 01:43:54,835
Yeaah!

1047
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:05,172
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

1048
01:44:05,173 --> 01:44:06,856
One down, five to go.

1049
01:44:12,508 --> 01:44:14,325
Nice.

1050
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:24,425
We gotta split them up.

1051
01:44:44,694 --> 01:44:45,694
Come on.

1052
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:51,470
Have a nice swim.

1053
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:59,330
You gotta get behind them.

1054
01:45:07,997 --> 01:45:10,083
I don't think this is a good idea.

1055
01:45:10,084 --> 01:45:11,317
You're probably right.

1056
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:18,738
He's gaining on us.

1057
01:45:38,942 --> 01:45:39,942
(Laughs)

1058
01:45:49,197 --> 01:45:50,380
YES!

1059
01:46:02,232 --> 01:46:03,569
It's jammed.

1060
01:46:08,957 --> 01:46:10,265
Tron.

1061
01:46:10,566 --> 01:46:12,510
What have you become?

1062
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:18,390
Aw, come on.

1063
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:23,550
Flynn, go home.

1064
01:46:28,109 --> 01:46:29,583
My word, take a shot.

1065
01:46:33,327 --> 01:46:34,538
Finish today.

1066
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,193
Noooooooo!

1067
01:46:57,023 --> 01:46:59,369
I, fight for the users!

1068
01:47:00,226 --> 01:47:01,617
Ahhhhhh!

1069
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:10,511
That was him.

1070
01:47:10,512 --> 01:47:11,881
It's over.

1071
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:14,124
It's over!

1072
01:47:16,322 --> 01:47:17,322
Waoooo!

1073
01:47:25,646 --> 01:47:28,505
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

1074
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,451
Let's get you home, Dad.

1075
01:48:19,715 --> 01:48:21,099
There it is.

1076
01:48:21,556 --> 01:48:22,699
Take her down.

1077
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:24,316
Hang on.

1078
01:48:24,317 --> 01:48:25,781
This could be rough.

1079
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:19,358
This is mine.

1080
01:49:25,629 --> 01:49:27,386
Had a feeling you'd be here.

1081
01:49:28,897 --> 01:49:31,292
The cycle's haven't been kind, have they.

1082
01:49:31,709 --> 01:49:34,301
Well, you don't look so bad.

1083
01:49:36,062 --> 01:49:37,594
I did everything.

1084
01:49:38,025 --> 01:49:39,797
Everything you ever asked.

1085
01:49:40,231 --> 01:49:41,445
I know you did.

1086
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:43,691
I executed the plan.

1087
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:45,509
As you saw it.

1088
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:50,787
You, you promised that we would
change the world, together.

1089
01:49:51,574 --> 01:49:52,711
You broke your promise.

1090
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:55,100
I know, I understand that now.

1091
01:49:55,101 --> 01:49:58,325
I took this system to its maximum potential.

1092
01:49:58,326 --> 01:50:00,625
I created the perfect system.

1093
01:50:00,926 --> 01:50:04,658
The thing about perfection, is
that it's unknowable.

1094
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:09,179
It's impossible, but it's also right
in front of us all the time.

1095
01:50:10,466 --> 01:50:13,304
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

1096
01:50:15,727 --> 01:50:17,460
I'm sorry for.

1097
01:50:19,646 --> 01:50:21,299
I'm sorry.

1098
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:45,350
Go.

1099
01:50:58,517 --> 01:50:59,535
CLU!

1100
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:02,263
Remember what you came for

1101
01:51:16,525 --> 01:51:17,525
DAD!

1102
01:51:17,635 --> 01:51:19,101
You knew I'd beat you.

1103
01:51:19,556 --> 01:51:21,282
And still you did all this.

1104
01:51:21,283 --> 01:51:22,283
For him.

1105
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:29,765
No.

1106
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,350
Why?

1107
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,133
He's my son.

1108
01:51:47,692 --> 01:51:48,971
Gooooo!

1109
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:55,516
Dad!

1110
01:52:01,665 --> 01:52:04,337
Sam, it's time.

1111
01:52:04,338 --> 01:52:05,337
No!

1112
01:52:05,811 --> 01:52:06,811
Sam.

1113
01:52:07,144 --> 01:52:08,605
It's what he wants.

1114
01:52:10,643 --> 01:52:12,504
I'm not leaving you.

1115
01:52:12,902 --> 01:52:14,311
You take her.

1116
01:52:26,086 --> 01:52:27,551
Yes.

1117
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:56,414
Goodbye, kiddo.

1118
01:54:40,944 --> 01:54:41,967
Alan.

1119
01:54:46,776 --> 01:54:48,229
You paged me?

1120
01:54:49,393 --> 01:54:50,393
Yeah.

1121
01:54:51,304 --> 01:54:53,375
You jet ENCOM at 8AM.

1122
01:54:55,903 --> 01:54:57,182
What about the board?

1123
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,594
you are chairman now.

1124
01:55:03,346 --> 01:55:05,205
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1125
01:55:10,059 --> 01:55:13,619
Oh, and you were right.

1126
01:55:15,973 --> 01:55:17,065
About what?

1127
01:55:18,596 --> 01:55:20,389
About everything.

1128
01:55:45,003 --> 01:55:46,482
What's next, Sam?

1129
01:55:51,784 --> 01:55:54,421
Guess we're suppose to change the world.

1130
01:55:59,302 --> 01:56:02,365
Come on, I'll wanna show you something.

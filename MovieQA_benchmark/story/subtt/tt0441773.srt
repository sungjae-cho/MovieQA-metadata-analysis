1
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:39,258
Legend tells of a
legendary warrior...

2
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:43,546
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:48,208
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,360
I see you like to chew.

5
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,746
Maybe you should
chew on my fist.

6
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:07,348
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

7
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,586
Then he swallowed.
And then he spoke.

8
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:12,957
Enough talk. Let's fight.

9
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,057
Shashabooey.

10
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,263
He was so deadly in fact,

11
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,300
that his enemies
would go blind from...

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,032
overexposure to
pure awesomeness.

13
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,300
- My eyes.
- He's too awesome.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,890
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

15
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,375
There is no charge
for awesomeness.

16
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,075
Or attractiveness.

17
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,410
Kablooey.

18
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,213
It mattered not how
many foes he faced.

19
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,913
They were no match
for his bodacity.

20
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:58,981
Never before had a panda
been so feared. And so loved.

21
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,903
Even the most heroic
heroes in all of China,

22
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,206
the Furious Five,

23
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,211
bowed in respect
to this great master.

24
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,112
We should hang out.

25
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,212
Agreed.

26
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,316
But hanging out
would have to wait.

27
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,333
Because when you're facing...

28
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,824
the 10,000 demons
of Demon Mountain,

29
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:22,844
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

30
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,524
Po. Get up.

31
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,361
You'll be later for work.

32
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,461
What?

33
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:36,486
Po. Get up.

34
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,287
Po. What are you
doing up there?

35
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,387
Nothing.

36
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,981
Monkey. Mantis. Crane.
Viper. Tigress.

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,641
Po. Let's go. You're
late for work.

38
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,741
Coming.

39
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,619
Sorry, Dad.

40
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,525
Sorry doesn't
make the noodles.

41
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,960
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,525
Nothing. I just
had a crazy dream.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,829
About what?

44
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,496
What were you dreaming about?

45
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,596
What was I?

46
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,253
I was dreaming about...

47
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,359
...noodles.

48
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,109
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

49
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,744
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

50
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:54,284
Careful. That soup is sharp.

51
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,819
Oh, happy day.

52
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,919
My son, finally having
the noodle dream.

53
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,547
You don't know how
long I've been...

54
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,190
waiting for this moment.

55
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,129
This is a sign, Po.

56
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,997
A sign of what?

57
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:11,687
You are almost ready
to be entrusted...

58
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,700
with the secret ingredient...

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,037
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

60
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,948
And then you will fulfill
your destiny...

61
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,241
and take over the restaurant.

62
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,974
As I took it over
from my father,

63
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,809
who took it over
from his father...

64
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:27,547
...who won it from a friend
in a game of mahjong.

65
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,317
Dad, Dad, Dad, it
was just a dream.

66
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,688
No, it was the dream.

67
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:36,322
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

68
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:40,296
But, Dad, didn't you.. you know...
ever want to do something else?

69
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,229
Something besides noodles?

70
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,233
Actually, when I
was young and crazy.

71
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:49,367
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

72
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,569
So why didn't you?

73
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,092
Because it was a stupid dream.

74
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,628
Can you imagine
me making tofu?

75
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,112
Tofu.

76
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:02,584
No. We all have our
place in this world.

77
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:05,216
Mine is here, and yours is...

78
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,519
I know, is here.

79
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,721
No, it's at tables
2, 5, 7, and 12

80
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,921
Service with a smile.

81
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,749
Well done, students...

82
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,459
if you were trying
to disappoint me.

83
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,367
Tigress, you need
more ferocity.

84
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,694
Monkey, greater speed.

85
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,566
Crane, height.
Viper, subtlety.

86
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,666
Mantis...

87
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,567
- Master Shifu.
- What?.

88
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,667
It's Master Oogway.
He wants to see you.

89
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,049
Master Oogway,
you summoned me?

90
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,149
Is something wrong?

91
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,734
Why must something be wrong...

92
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,195
for me to want to
see my old friend?

93
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,394
So, nothing's wrong?

94
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:26,109
Well, I didn't say that.

95
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,837
You were saying?

96
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,985
I have had a vision.

97
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:51,803
Tai Lung will return.

98
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,296
That is impossible.
He is in prison.

99
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:02,148
Nothing is impossible.

100
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,999
Zeng.

101
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,406
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison
and tell them...

102
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,056
to double the
guards, double...

103
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,809
their weapons,
double everything.

104
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,779
Tai Lung does not
leave that prison.

105
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,879
Yes, Master Shifu.

106
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,569
One often meets his destiny...

107
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,318
on the road he
takes to avoid it.

108
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,428
We have to do something.
We can't let him...

109
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,387
march on the valley,
and take his revenge.

110
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,454
He'll...

111
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,827
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

112
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:32,150
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

113
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,819
But if you allow
it to settle...

114
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,719
...the answer becomes clear.

115
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,925
The Dragon Scroll.

116
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,108
It is time.

117
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,639
But who? Who is worthy
to be trusted...

118
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,915
with the secret to
limitless power?

119
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,720
To become the Dragon Warrior?

120
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
I don't know.

121
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,741
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

122
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:01,957
Watch it, Po.

123
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,057
Sorry. Suck it up.

124
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:07,698
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

125
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,798
What's...?

126
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:14,138
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior. Today.

127
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:16,556
Everyone. Go. Get to the
Jade Palace. One of...

128
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,808
the Five is going get
the Dragon Scroll.

129
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,844
We have waited for
1,000 years for this.

130
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:21,944
Take the bowl.

131
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:26,149
This is the greatest day in kung fu history.
Don't worry about it, just go.

132
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,649
Po. Where are you going?

133
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,456
To the Jade Palace...

134
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,825
But you're forgetting
your noodle cart.

135
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:35,883
The whole valley
will be there,

136
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,460
and you'll sell
noodles to all of them.

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Selling noodles?

138
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:45,038
But, Dad, you know I was
kind of thinking, maybe I...

139
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,538
- Yeah?
- I was kind of thinking maybe I...

140
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,678
...could also sell
the bean buns.

141
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,644
Well... they're about to go bad.

142
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,434
That's my boy.

143
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,734
I told you that
dream was a sign.

144
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,772
Yeah. Glad I had it.

145
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:09,362
- I'm a kung fu warrior.
- Me, too.

146
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:13,262
- There's spots at the top.
- Hurry, let's go!

147
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,232
Come on. Come on.

148
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,168
Almost there.

149
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:52,401
What?

150
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,150
No. Oh, no.

151
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,698
- Sorry, Po.

152
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,093
We'll bring you
back a souvenir.

153
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,993
No. I'll bring me back
a souvenir.

154
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,594
It is an historic day.

155
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:17,427
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

156
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:22,367
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

157
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,431
Are your students ready?

158
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,531
Yes, Master Oogway.

159
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,172
And know this, old friend.

160
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:31,999
Whomever I choose will
not only bring...

161
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,577
peace to the valley...

162
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,290
...but also to you.

163
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:40,052
Let the tournament begin.

164
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:43,765
Let the tournament begin.

165
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,217
Yeah.

166
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,303
No, no, wait.

167
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,707
I'm coming. Wait, wait.

168
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,807
Yes.

169
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,395
Hey. Open the door.

170
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,381
Let me in.

171
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:17,017
Citizens of the
Valley of Peace,

172
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:20,789
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress.

173
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,026
Viper. Crane. Monkey. Mantis.

174
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:27,126
The Furious Five.

175
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,527
Yeah, the Furious Five.

176
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,314
Warriors, prepare.

177
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,947
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

178
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:49,647
- Ready for battle.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:53,338
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

180
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:55,856
Wow, look at that!

181
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,356
Hey. Get out of the way.

182
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,480
And finally Master Tigress.

183
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,825
And believe me, citizens,

184
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,304
you have not seen
anything yet.

185
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:41,637
I know.

186
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:46,937
Master Tigress. Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

187
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:03,676
I sense the Dragon
Warrior is among us.

188
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:11,915
Citizens of the
Valley of Peace.

189
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:16,773
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior.

190
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,585
Oh, no. No, no, wait.

191
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,861
Yeah.

192
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,892
Po.

193
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:41,992
What are you doing?.

194
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:44,530
What does it look like
I'm doing?. Stop.

195
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,230
I'm going to see
the Dragon Warrior.

196
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,821
But I don't understand.

197
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,761
You finally had
the noodle dream.

198
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:58,861
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

199
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:04,228
I love kung fu.

200
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:21,252
Oh come on, son. Let's
get back to work.

201
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:25,857
OK.

202
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,330
Come back.

203
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,323
What's going on?

204
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,892
Where?

205
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,263
What are you pointing?

206
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,367
OK. Sorry.

207
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,888
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

208
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:14,988
How interesting.

209
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,259
Master, are you
pointing at me?

210
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,369
- Him.
- Who?

211
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:24,563
- You.
- Me?

212
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:30,145
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior.

213
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,807
- What?
- What?.

214
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,907
- What?.
- What?.

215
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:46,269
Stop, wait. Who told you to?

216
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:57,077
Master Oogway, wait.

217
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,628
That flabby panda
can't possibly be...

218
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:01,385
the answer to our problem.

219
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:03,303
You were about to
point at Tigress...

220
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,171
and that thing fell
in front of her.

221
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,675
That was just an accident.

222
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,522
There are no accidents.

223
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:27,393
Forgive us, Master.
We have failed you.

224
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:30,797
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning...

225
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,697
then I will have failed you.

226
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:54,219
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I bring a message...

227
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,569
...from Master Shifu.

228
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,392
What?.

229
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:03,797
'Double the guard?.'

230
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,665
'Extra precautions?.'

231
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:09,265
'Your prison may
not be adequate?.'

232
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,637
You doubt my prison security?.

233
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,576
Absolutely not.

234
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:19,777
Shifu does. I'm
just the messenger.

235
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:24,035
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

236
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,335
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible.

237
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,610
Impressive, isn't it?

238
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,196
It's very impressive.

239
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,761
It's very impressive.

240
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:41,499
One way in, one way out.

241
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,670
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.

242
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,270
Yes, except that prisoner...

243
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,370
...is Tai Lung.

244
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:56,131
Take us down.

245
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,371
What are you doing?

246
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,084
Oh, my.

247
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:22,883
Behold Tai Lung.

248
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,636
I'm eh... just gonna
wait right here.

249
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:31,984
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

250
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:34,319
Crossbows. At the ready.

251
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,187
Crossbows?

252
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,821
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

253
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,107
Oogway's finally going to
give someone the Dragon

254
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,392
Scroll, and it's
not gonna be you.

255
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:45,128
What are you doing?
To get him mad?

256
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:48,028
What's he gonna do about it?

257
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:51,678
I've got him completely
immobilized.

258
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,217
Did I step on the
wittle kitty's tail?

259
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:00,094
I'm good. I've seen enough.

260
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,582
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

261
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:03,881
No, he doesn't.

262
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,184
I'll tell him that.

263
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:08,384
Can we please go now?

264
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,572
Dragon Warrior.
Dragon Warrior.

265
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:29,772
Dragon Warrior.
Dragon Warrior.

266
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,862
Wait a second.

267
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:43,052
I think there's been
a slight mistake.

268
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:46,652
Everyone seems to
think that I'm a...

269
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,509
The Sacred Hall of
Warriors. No way.

270
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,213
Look at this place.

271
00:19:54,817 --> 00:20:00,517
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage.

272
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,172
The Sword of Heroes.

273
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:07,006
Said to be so sharp
you can cut yourself...

274
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,464
just by looking.

275
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:11,864
The Invisible
Trident of Destiny.

276
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:17,002
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

277
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,378
No.

278
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:28,031
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

279
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:33,231
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

280
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,771
Hello.

281
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:38,175
Have you finished
sight-seeing?

282
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,341
Sorry, I should have
come to see you first.

283
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,381
My patience is wearing thin.

284
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:44,195
Well, I mean, it's
not like you...

285
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,283
were going anywhere.

286
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:47,719
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

287
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,816
How's it going?

288
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,516
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu.

289
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,692
Someone... broke that.

290
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:59,015
But I'm gonna fix it.
Do you have some...

291
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:01,115
...glue?

292
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,297
A splinter.

293
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,367
So you're the legendary
Dragon Warrior, hm?

294
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,571
- I guess so.
- Wrong.

295
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,638
You are not the Dragon
Warrior. You will...

296
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,376
never be the Dragon
Warrior until...

297
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:19,576
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

298
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,019
So, how does this work?

299
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,219
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

300
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:27,910
You think it's that easy?

301
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,357
That I'll just hand
you the secret...

302
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,330
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

303
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,429
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

304
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,250
And that is clearly impossible...

305
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,566
if that one is
someone like you.

306
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,667
Someone like me?

307
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:45,406
Yes, look at you.
This fat butt. Flabby arms.

308
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,945
Those are sensitive
in the flabby parts.

309
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,847
And this ridiculous belly.

310
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:54,183
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

311
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:56,417
Now, wait a minute.
That's a little uncalled for.

312
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:59,040
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

313
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,974
Listen, Oogway said I was...

314
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,725
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold.

315
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,528
Oh, you know this hold?

316
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:09,263
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

317
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:12,887
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

318
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:13,987
- No, no.

319
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,636
You know the hardest
part of this?

320
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,476
The hardest part
is cleaning up...

321
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:19,576
afterwards.

322
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:21,776
OK, OK, take it easy.

323
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:24,281
Now listen closely, panda.

324
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:27,481
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you.

325
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,570
I promise you, you're
going to wish...

326
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,540
he hadn't. Are we clear?

327
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,756
Yeah, we're clear.
We're so clear.

328
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,559
Good.

329
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,459
I can't wait to get started.

330
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:21,655
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:23,755
What?

332
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,077
- Now?
- Yes, now.

333
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:29,292
Unless you think
the great Oogway was wrong...

334
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:31,446
and you are not
the Dragon Warrior.

335
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,078
Oh, OK, well...

336
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,423
I don't know...

337
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:37,148
if I can do all
of those moves.

338
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:39,987
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

339
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,020
Yeah, it's just,
maybe we can find...

340
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,892
something more
suited to my level.

341
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:45,024
And what level is that?

342
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,560
Well, I'm not a master, but...

343
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,399
...let's just start
at zero. Level zero.

344
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,569
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

345
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,425
- Hey, maybe I can start with that.
- That?

346
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:01,090
We use that for training
children and...

347
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,559
for propping the door
open when it's hot.

348
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:04,980
But if you insist...

349
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,815
The Furious Five.

350
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:11,715
You're so much bigger than
your action figures.

351
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:15,396
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

352
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:19,459
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

353
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,850
Are they gonna watch,
or should I wait...

354
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,231
till they get back to work
or something?

355
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,317
Hit it.

356
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:29,034
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

357
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,873
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

358
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,827
Just hit it.

359
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,927
All right.

360
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:40,415
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

361
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:43,514
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel the thunder.

362
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,785
I'm coming at you
with crazy feet.

363
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,852
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

364
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:50,724
You've only seen
praying mantis.

365
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,824
Or monkey style.

366
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:55,730
Or I could come at
you snickety-snake.

367
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,181
Would you hit it.

368
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,411
All right. All right.

369
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:10,125
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

370
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:12,963
How's that?

371
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,009
That hurts.

372
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,666
This will be easier
than I thought.

373
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,766
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

374
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,089
Those are hard.

375
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,762
My tenders.

376
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,972
How did I do?

377
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,844
There is now a level zero.

378
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:17,979
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

379
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,313
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

380
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,716
I don't understand What
Master Oogway was thinking...

381
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,085
The poor guy's just gonna
get himself killed.

382
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,650
He is so mighty.

383
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,042
The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky...

384
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:32,559
on a ball of fire.

385
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,420
When he walks, the
very ground shakes.

386
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,757
One would think that
Master Oogway would...

387
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:40,733
choose someone who
actually knew kung fu.

388
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,833
Yeah, or could at
least touch his toes.

389
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,321
Or even see his toes.

390
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:11,681
OK.

391
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:21,657
Great.

392
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,720
Hi. You're up.

393
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,276
I am now.

394
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:40,760
I was just...

395
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,729
Some day, huh?

396
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,239
That kung fu stuff
is hard work, right?

397
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,152
Are your biceps sore?

398
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,900
I've had a long...

399
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,500
and rather
disappointing day, so...

400
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,127
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

401
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:59,629
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

402
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:02,548
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan.

403
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:03,762
You guys were totally amazing...

404
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:05,316
at the Battle of
Weeping River.

405
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,416
Outnumbered a thousand to one,

406
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:11,631
but you didn't
stop. You just...

407
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,992
Sorry about that.

408
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,892
Look, you don't belong here.

409
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,182
I know. I know. You're right.

410
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:23,775
I don't have... I just...

411
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,334
My whole life I dreamed of...

412
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:28,278
No, I meant you
don't belong here.

413
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:31,562
I mean, in this room.
This is my room.

414
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,709
Property of Crane.

415
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,647
OK. Right, right.

416
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,246
So, you want to get to sleep.

417
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,118
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

418
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,319
We got big things tomorrow.

419
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,019
All right. You're awesome.

420
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:48,469
Last thing I'm
gonna say. OK. Bye-bye.

421
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:51,595
What was that?

422
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:53,099
I didn't say anything.

423
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,332
OK. All right. Good night.

424
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,432
Sleep well.

425
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:02,323
That seemed a little awkward.

426
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,740
Master Tigress.
I didn't mean to wake you.

427
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,512
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

428
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:09,882
This is your room.

429
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,251
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

430
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,687
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have...

431
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,642
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

432
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:22,542
you will be gone by morning.

433
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,350
Big fan.

434
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:39,442
I see you have
found the Sacred

435
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,542
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

436
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:45,117
Is that what this is?
I'm so sorry. I thought...

437
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,250
it was just a
regular peach tree.

438
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,257
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

439
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,457
Upset? I'm not upset.

440
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:57,571
What makes you
think I'm upset.

441
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,071
So why are you so upset?

442
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:06,684
I probably sucked
more today...

443
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:08,670
than anyone in the
history of kung fu.

444
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,374
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking.

445
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:13,541
Probably.

446
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:15,509
And the Five. Man,
you should've...

447
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:17,313
seen them. They
totally hate me.

448
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:18,378
Totally.

449
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:21,946
How is Shifu ever
going to turn me...

450
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:24,446
into the Dragon Warrior?

451
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:26,558
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

452
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,191
I've got no claws,
no wings, no venom.

453
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,691
Even Mantis has
those... thingies.

454
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:40,217
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

455
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,539
Quit, don't quit.

456
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:47,642
Noodles, don't noodles.

457
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:49,716
You are too concerned...

458
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,380
with what was
and what will be.

459
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,317
There's a saying:

460
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,836
Yesterday is history,

461
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,340
tomorrow is a mystery,

462
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,523
but today is a gift.

463
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:06,323
That is why it is
called the present.

464
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,761
- Oh, no.
- What's happening?.

465
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:41,461
To your battle
stations. Go. Go. Go.

466
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,705
Fire crossbows.

467
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,805
Fire.

468
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:56,763
Fire.

469
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:06,121
Tai Lung is free.
I must warn Shifu.

470
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,925
You're not going anywhere.
Neither is he.

471
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,025
Let go of me.

472
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,125
Bring it up.

473
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,981
Wait. Bring it back.

474
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:38,367
- He's coming this way.
- He won't get far. Archers.

475
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:48,236
We're dead. So
very, very dead.

476
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,242
Not yet we're not. Now.

477
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:41,387
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

478
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,648
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

479
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,736
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

480
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,835
Fly back there
and tell them...

481
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:15,035
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

482
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,739
Good morning, Master.

483
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,257
Panda.

484
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:32,612
Panda.

485
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,712
Wake up.

486
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,450
He's quit.

487
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,450
What do we do now,
with the panda gone?

488
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,736
Who will be the
Dragon Warrior?

489
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:47,717
All we can do is
resume our training...

490
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:48,906
and trust that in time,

491
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:53,006
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

492
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,500
What are you doing here?.

493
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,602
Hi. Good morning, Master.

494
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:00,802
I thought I'd
warm up a little.

495
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:02,685
You're stuck.

496
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,185
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

497
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,928
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

498
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,228
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

499
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,783
Maybe on three. One, two...

500
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
...three.

501
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,238
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

502
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:23,244
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

503
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:25,640
You actually thought
you could learn...

504
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,614
to do a full split
in one night?

505
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:31,051
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility.

506
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:35,051
And years longer to
apply it in combat.

507
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:45,829
Put that down.

508
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,356
The only souvenirs we
collect here are...

509
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,400
bloody knuckles
and broken bones.

510
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,423
Yeah. Excellent.

511
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,225
Let's get started.

512
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,129
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

513
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:02,585
I'm sorry, brother.

514
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,547
I thought you said
you were ready.

515
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:07,947
That was awesome.
Let's go again.

516
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,117
I've been taking it
easy on you, panda.

517
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:37,217
But no more.

518
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:39,618
Your next opponent will be me.

519
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,318
All right. Yeah, let's go.

520
00:37:43,974 --> 00:37:46,022
Step forth.

521
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:48,080
The true path to
victory is to find...

522
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,557
your opponent's weakness...

523
00:37:49,657 --> 00:37:51,497
...and make him suffer for it.

524
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:52,898
Oh, yeah.

525
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:56,335
To take his strength
and use it against him...

526
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:58,922
...until he finally falls...

527
00:37:59,022 --> 00:37:59,984
...or quits.

528
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,037
But a real warrior never quits.

529
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:06,037
Don't worry, Master.
I will never quit.

530
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:16,706
If he's smart,

531
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,890
he won't come back
up those steps.

532
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,292
But he will.

533
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,661
He's not going to quit, is he?

534
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,911
He's going to
quit bouncing.

535
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:28,011
I'll tell you that.

536
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:40,443
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

537
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:41,544
Trust me, it will.

538
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:43,631
It's just not easy
finding the right...

539
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,248
nerve points under all this...

540
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:47,984
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

541
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,050
Sure you were.

542
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,278
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? I mean, look at me.

543
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:56,378
I'm over here.

544
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,916
Maybe you should
take a look at this again.

545
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:01,415
Oh, OK.

546
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
Stop it. Stop.

547
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,560
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

548
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,710
...but if I didn't
know any better.

549
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,710
I'd say he was trying
to get rid of me.

550
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:22,205
I know he can seem
kind of heartless...

551
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,257
...but you know he wasn't
always like that.

552
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:25,656
According to legend,

553
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:27,594
there was once a time when

554
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:30,258
Master Shifu actually
used to smile.

555
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:32,358
- No.
- Yes.

556
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,597
But that was before.

557
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:35,697
Before what?

558
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,086
Before Tai Lung.

559
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:39,734
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

560
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,825
Well, if he's
going to stay here,

561
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:42,803
he should know.

562
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,810
Guys, guys, I know
about Tai Lung.

563
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,542
He was a student.
The first ever to...

564
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:50,344
master the thousand
scrolls of kung fu.

565
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:54,584
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

566
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,184
He wasn't just a student.

567
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:03,976
Shifu found him as a cub...

568
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:08,815
...and he raised
him as his son.

569
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,991
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

570
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,341
...Shifu trained him.

571
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,432
He believed in him.
He told him...

572
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:23,166
he was destined for greatness.

573
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:26,566
It was never enough
for Tai Lung.

574
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:29,317
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

575
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:33,943
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

576
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:38,343
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

577
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,229
He tried to take
the scroll by force.

578
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:46,913
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

579
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,890
But how could he?

580
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:06,743
Shifu loved Tai Lung...

581
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:10,643
like he had never
loved anyone before.

582
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,018
Or since.

583
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:29,613
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

584
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,914
To train the true
Dragon Warrior.

585
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:35,015
And he's stuck with you.

586
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:39,215
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

587
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:40,853
That is it.

588
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,403
Wait. My fault.

589
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:46,469
I accidentally tweaked
his facial nerve.

590
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:50,169
And may have also
stopped his heart.

591
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,654
Inner peace.

592
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,490
Inner peace.

593
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:02,462
Inner...

594
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:05,765
Inner peace.

595
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:11,053
Would whoever is making...

596
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,353
that flapping
sound quiet down?.

597
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,411
Inner...

598
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:24,330
Oh, Zeng.

599
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,998
Excellent.

600
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:29,798
I could use some
good news right now.

601
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,796
Master. Master.

602
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:42,083
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

603
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,520
Shifu.

604
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,991
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

605
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:51,725
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

606
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:55,011
Tai Lung has broken
out of prison.

607
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,584
He's on his way.

608
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:59,400
That is bad news...

609
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,267
...if you do not believe...

610
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:03,806
that the Dragon
Warrior can stop him.

611
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:05,243
The panda? Master,

612
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,143
that panda is not
the Dragon Warrior.

613
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:11,513
He wasn't even meant to be here.
It was an accident.

614
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:13,913
There are no accidents.

615
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:18,251
Yes, I know. You've
said that already.

616
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:19,351
- Twice.

617
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:22,523
Well, that was no
accident, either.

618
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:23,689
Thrice.

619
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:25,392
My old friend,

620
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:30,063
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

621
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:33,699
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

622
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,137
Illusion?

623
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,237
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

624
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,307
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

625
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:44,646
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

626
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:48,246
But there are things
we can control.

627
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:52,235
I can control when
the fruit will fall.

628
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,506
And I can control...

629
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:57,677
...where to plant the seed.

630
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:00,577
That is no illusion, Master.

631
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,514
Yes.

632
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:05,968
But no matter what you do...

633
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:08,971
that seed will grow
to be a peach tree.

634
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:11,969
You may wish for an
apple or an orange,

635
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,909
but you will get a peach.

636
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:17,610
But a peach cannot
defeat Tai Lung.

637
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,346
Maybe it can.

638
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:23,217
If you are willing
to guide it.

639
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:25,153
To nurture it.

640
00:44:25,253 --> 00:44:26,622
To believe in it.

641
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:29,158
But how? How?

642
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:31,194
I need your help, Master.

643
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,974
No, you just need to believe.

644
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:37,979
Promise me, Shifu.

645
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:41,267
Promise me you will believe.

646
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:44,915
I will try.

647
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:47,758
Good.

648
00:44:49,428 --> 00:44:51,487
My time has come.

649
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:58,068
You must continue
your journey without me.

650
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:00,171
What are you? Wait.

651
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:03,974
Master.

652
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,110
You can't leave me.

653
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:12,076
You must believe.

654
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,019
Master.

655
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,699
Yeah, so I'm like,
'Fine, you may be a wolf,

656
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:50,956
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

657
00:45:51,056 --> 00:45:52,873
...but you're a lousy tipper.'

658
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:56,661
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

659
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:59,297
I mean, I didn't
actually say that...

660
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:00,848
...but I thought it...

661
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:02,681
...in my mind.

662
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:06,304
If he could read my mind,
it'd have been, like, 'What?'

663
00:46:06,404 --> 00:46:09,104
Order up. Hope you like it.

664
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:13,692
- This is really good.
- Now, come on.

665
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,766
You should try my dad's Secret
Ingredient Soup.

666
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,064
He actually knows the
secret ingredient.

667
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:20,534
What're you talking about?
This is amazing.

668
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:23,538
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

669
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:25,506
Tigress, you've
got to try this.

670
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:27,705
It is said that the
Dragon Warrior...

671
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,207
can survive for months
at a time...

672
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:32,671
on nothing but the
dew of a single ginkgo leaf...

673
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:35,367
and the energy
of the universe.

674
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:39,353
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

675
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:44,753
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

676
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:52,147
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

677
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,388
You'll never be the Dragon
Warrior unless you...

678
00:46:57,488 --> 00:46:59,891
lose 500 pounds and
brush your teeth.

679
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,732
What is that noise
you're making?

680
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:03,411
Laughter? I never heard of it.

681
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:06,313
Work hard, panda,
and maybe someday...

682
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:09,613
...you will have
ears like mine.

683
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,901
That's good.

684
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:13,642
Ears. It's not
working for you?

685
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:15,539
I thought they
were pretty good.

686
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,753
It's Shifu.

687
00:47:16,853 --> 00:47:21,378
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

688
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,478
Master Shifu.

689
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:27,798
You think this is funny?

690
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,077
Tai Lung has escaped
from prison...

691
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:30,838
and you're acting
like children.

692
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:31,266
- What?

693
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,205
He is coming for
the Dragon Scroll,

694
00:47:33,305 --> 00:47:37,405
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

695
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,945
And here I am saying
you got no sense of humor.

696
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:44,316
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

697
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:48,016
What? You're serious?
And I have to?

698
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:52,059
Master Oogway will stop him,
he did it before, he'll do it again.

699
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:54,159
Oogway cannot.

700
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,219
Not anymore.

701
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,764
Our only hope is
the Dragon Warrior.

702
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:01,465
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda.

703
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:03,133
Master, please...
let us stop Tai Lung.

704
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:05,135
This is what you've
trained us for.

705
00:48:05,235 --> 00:48:08,771
No. It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

706
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:10,439
It is his.

707
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,539
Where'd he go?

708
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:22,288
You cannot leave.
A real warrior never quits.

709
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,388
Watch me.

710
00:48:26,543 --> 00:48:27,623
Come on.

711
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,550
How am I supposed
to beat Tai Lung?

712
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,530
I can't even beat
you to the stairs.

713
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,921
You will beat him...

714
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:35,319
because you are
the Dragon Warrior.

715
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:38,670
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

716
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,737
From the first moment I've got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.

717
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:44,143
Yes. I was.

718
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:47,158
But now I ask you
to trust in your...

719
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,333
master as I have come
to trust in mine.

720
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:51,885
You're not my master.

721
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:54,151
And I'm not the
Dragon Warrior.

722
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:56,394
Then why didn't
you quit?. You knew

723
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:58,574
I was trying to get rid of you,
yet you stayed.

724
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,674
Yeah, I stayed.

725
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:02,552
I stayed because every time...

726
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,495
you threw a brick
at my head...

727
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:06,581
or said I smelled, it hurt,

728
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:08,968
but it could
never hurt more...

729
00:49:09,068 --> 00:49:13,156
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

730
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:17,827
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

731
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:20,976
...could make me... not me...

732
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:22,565
...it was you.

733
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:25,618
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China.

734
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:27,282
But I can change you.

735
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,785
I can turn you into
the Dragon Warrior.

736
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:30,885
And I will.

737
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:34,955
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

738
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,999
Even if it takes him
a hundred years...

739
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,430
to get here, how are you...

740
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,930
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

741
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:47,088
How?

742
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:49,723
How?

743
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:53,961
- How?.
- I don't know.

744
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:04,004
I don't know.

745
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:12,376
That's what I thought.

746
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:54,219
This is what you
trained me for.

747
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:02,328
Tigress.

748
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,767
Don't try and stop me.

749
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:11,618
We're not trying to stop you.

750
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:12,685
What?

751
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:14,985
We're coming with you.

752
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:31,342
What? I eat when
I'm upset, OK?

753
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:33,936
No need to explain.

754
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:38,024
I just thought you might be
Monkey. He hides...

755
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:41,724
his almond cookies
on the top shelf.

756
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:00,795
Don't tell Monkey.

757
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:04,031
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

758
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:07,099
No, I mean, how did
you get up there?

759
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,099
I don't know. I guess that...

760
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,575
I don't know. I was
getting a cookie.

761
00:53:12,675 --> 00:53:15,496
And yet you are ten feet
off the ground.

762
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,913
And have done
a perfect split.

763
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:20,967
No, this? This is just...

764
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,702
...an accident.

765
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:30,323
There are no accidents.

766
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:32,423
Come with me.

767
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:42,905
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

768
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:48,105
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

769
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:58,103
You dragged me...

770
00:53:58,204 --> 00:53:59,869
...all the way out here...

771
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,969
...for a bath?

772
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:06,227
Panda...

773
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:11,084
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

774
00:54:11,184 --> 00:54:12,197
The Pool of...

775
00:54:12,297 --> 00:54:14,867
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

776
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:17,136
...of harmony and focus.

777
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:19,737
This is the birthplace...

778
00:54:19,837 --> 00:54:21,837
...of kung fu.

779
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:37,324
Do you want to learn kung fu?

780
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:38,389
Yeah.

781
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:41,729
Then I am your master.

782
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:43,829
OK.

783
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:45,997
Don't cry.

784
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:48,097
OK.

785
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,139
When you focus on kung fu,

786
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:57,363
when you concentrate...

787
00:54:57,463 --> 00:54:58,898
...you stink.

788
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:00,849
But perhaps that is my fault.

789
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:04,381
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

790
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,552
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

791
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:08,923
...is with this.

792
00:55:09,023 --> 00:55:12,023
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

793
00:55:12,678 --> 00:55:13,725
Good.

794
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:17,825
When you have been
trained, you may eat.

795
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,950
Let's begin.

796
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:30,901
After you, panda.

797
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:33,001
Just like that?

798
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,674
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

799
00:56:36,774 --> 00:56:39,874
I vowed to train
you, and you...

800
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:43,789
have been trained.
You are free to eat.

801
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:48,671
Enjoy.

802
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,259
Hey.

803
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,659
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

804
00:56:55,814 --> 00:56:57,814
Hey.

805
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,554
You are free to eat.

806
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,630
- Am I?.
- Are you?.

807
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,877
I'm not hungry.

808
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,015
Master.

809
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,346
Cut it.

810
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,648
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

811
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:33,714
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

812
00:59:33,814 --> 00:59:35,985
You think I'm a fool?

813
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:38,589
I know you're not
the Dragon Warrior.

814
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:39,689
None of you.

815
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,027
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

816
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:45,138
That he's a warrior unlike...

817
00:59:45,238 --> 00:59:47,533
anything the world
has ever seen.

818
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:53,202
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

819
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:56,371
Finally, a worthy opponent.

820
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:59,371
The battle will be legendary.

821
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:21,447
We've got this. Help her.

822
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:46,252
Monkey.

823
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:48,158
Go.

824
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:50,358
What was I thinking?.

825
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,855
Mantis.

826
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,128
Now.

827
01:01:53,474 --> 01:01:55,772
Shifu taught you well.

828
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:02,246
But he didn't teach
you everything.

829
01:02:04,785 --> 01:02:06,264
You have done well, panda.

830
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:10,037
Done well? Done well?

831
01:02:10,137 --> 01:02:12,137
I've done awesome.

832
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:16,311
The mark of a true
hero is humility.

833
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:19,093
But, yes, you have done...

834
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,700
...awesome.

835
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:31,594
Guys? Guys?. They're dead.

836
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:33,731
No, they're breathing.
They're asleep?

837
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:35,099
But their eyes are open.

838
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:37,162
We were no match for
his nerve attack.

839
01:02:37,262 --> 01:02:39,467
He has gotten stronger.

840
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,967
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

841
01:02:43,057 --> 01:02:44,035
He's too fast.

842
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,135
Sorry, Po.

843
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,308
I thought we could stop him.

844
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:51,213
He could have killed you.

845
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,345
Why didn't he?

846
01:02:52,445 --> 01:02:54,764
So you could come back
and strike fear...

847
01:02:54,864 --> 01:02:56,837
into our hearts.
But it won't work.

848
01:02:56,937 --> 01:03:01,206
It might. I mean, a little.

849
01:03:01,306 --> 01:03:02,490
I'm pretty scared.

850
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:04,055
You can defeat him, panda.

851
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,063
Are you kidding?
If they can't?.

852
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:10,128
They're five masters.
I'm just one me.

853
01:03:10,228 --> 01:03:12,071
But you will have...

854
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:15,771
the one thing that
no one else does.

855
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:21,406
You really believe I'm ready?

856
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,143
You are...

857
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:25,243
...Po.

858
01:04:13,479 --> 01:04:17,028
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

859
01:04:17,128 --> 01:04:19,128
It is yours.

860
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:22,037
Wait. What happens
when I read it?

861
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:24,055
No one knows but legend says
you will be able...

862
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:26,137
to hear a butterfly's
wing beat.

863
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,442
Really? That's cool.

864
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:31,346
Yes. And see light
in the deepest cave.

865
01:04:31,446 --> 01:04:34,901
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

866
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:36,418
Can I punch through walls?

867
01:04:36,518 --> 01:04:38,853
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

868
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:40,440
- Will I?
- Focus.

869
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,924
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

870
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:44,894
Read it, Po, and
fulfill your destiny.

871
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:47,160
Read it and become...

872
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,460
...the Dragon Warrior.

873
01:04:55,888 --> 01:04:58,288
It's impossible to open.

874
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,522
OK. Come on,
baby. Come on now.

875
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:05,378
Thank you.

876
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:09,067
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

877
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:11,167
OK, here goes.

878
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,362
- It's blank.
- What?.

879
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,767
- Here, look.

880
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:29,362
No, I am forbidden
to look upon...

881
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:36,626
Blank. I don't...

882
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,889
I don't understand.

883
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:42,881
OK. So, like...

884
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:43,981
...Oogway was...

885
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,185
just a crazy old
turtle after all.

886
01:05:46,285 --> 01:05:48,853
No. Oogway was
wiser than us all.

887
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:52,990
Oh, come on. Face it,
he picked me by accident.

888
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,507
Of course I'm not
the Dragon Warrior.

889
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:58,150
Who am I kidding?

890
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,932
But who will stop Tai Lung?

891
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:02,498
He'll destroy everything
and everyone.

892
01:06:02,598 --> 01:06:04,456
No.

893
01:06:04,556 --> 01:06:07,449
Evacuate the valley.
You must protect...

894
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:10,074
the villagers from
Tai Lung's rage.

895
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,547
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

896
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:13,647
- What?

897
01:06:13,747 --> 01:06:15,314
I can hold him
off long enough...

898
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:16,851
for everyone to escape.

899
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:19,354
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

900
01:06:19,454 --> 01:06:23,141
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

901
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:25,322
Listen to me, all of you.

902
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:28,926
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

903
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:33,026
I am very proud
to have been your master.

904
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:55,154
We've got to get
them out safely.

905
01:06:55,254 --> 01:06:57,575
Come, little one.
Let's find your mama.

906
01:06:57,675 --> 01:06:59,913
Viper, gather the
southern farmers.

907
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:01,140
Mantis, the north.

908
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,340
Crane, light the way.

909
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:25,058
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

910
01:07:33,777 --> 01:07:35,777
Hey, Dad.

911
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:37,828
Po.

912
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:45,687
Good to have you back, son.

913
01:07:47,558 --> 01:07:49,037
Good to be back.

914
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:51,137
Let's go, Po.

915
01:07:53,264 --> 01:07:56,267
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

916
01:07:56,367 --> 01:08:00,104
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

917
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:02,285
...no longer slices.

918
01:08:02,385 --> 01:08:05,793
Also, I was thinking,
maybe this time...

919
01:08:05,893 --> 01:08:10,247
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

920
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:12,347
You like that?

921
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:22,272
Po, I'm sorry if things
didn't work out.

922
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:25,384
It just wasn't meant to be.

923
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:31,345
Po, forget everything else.

924
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,616
Your destiny still awaits.

925
01:08:33,716 --> 01:08:35,372
We are noodle folk.

926
01:08:35,472 --> 01:08:38,475
Broth runs deep
through our veins.

927
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:40,825
I don't know, Dad.

928
01:08:40,925 --> 01:08:42,775
Honestly, sometimes

929
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:46,675
I can't believe I'm
actually your son.

930
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:49,364
Po...

931
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:51,587
...I think it's
time I told you...

932
01:08:51,687 --> 01:08:53,873
something I should
have told you...

933
01:08:53,973 --> 01:08:56,004
...a long time ago.

934
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:58,104
OK.

935
01:08:59,195 --> 01:09:04,195
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup...

936
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:10,686
Come hear me. The secret
ingredient is...

937
01:09:10,786 --> 01:09:12,786
...nothing.

938
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:15,661
You heard me. Nothing.

939
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:18,197
There is no secret ingredient.

940
01:09:18,297 --> 01:09:19,297
Wait, wait.

941
01:09:19,397 --> 01:09:21,329
It's just plain
old noodle soup?

942
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,255
You don't add some
kind of special...

943
01:09:23,355 --> 01:09:24,269
sauce or something?

944
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,769
I don't have to. To
make something special...

945
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:31,677
you just have to
believe it's special.

946
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:42,435
There is no secret ingredient.

947
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:07,310
I have come home, Master.

948
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,896
This is no longer your home.

949
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,647
And I am no longer
your master.

950
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:14,652
Oh, yes. You have
a new favorite.

951
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,830
So where is this Po?

952
01:10:19,274 --> 01:10:20,489
Did I scare him off?

953
01:10:20,589 --> 01:10:23,989
This battle is
between you and me.

954
01:10:24,313 --> 01:10:27,733
So, that is how
it's going to be.

955
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,133
That is how it must be.

956
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:48,549
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness.

957
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:50,988
Obeying your master
is not weakness.

958
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:53,857
You knew I was the
Dragon Warrior.

959
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:56,091
You always knew.

960
01:10:56,191 --> 01:10:59,389
But when Oogway
said otherwise,

961
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:01,489
what did you do?

962
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,775
What did you do?.

963
01:11:07,322 --> 01:11:08,436
Nothing.

964
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:09,974
You were not meant
to be the Dragon

965
01:11:10,074 --> 01:11:11,341
Warrior. That
was not my fault.

966
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:13,441
Not your fault?.

967
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,509
Who filled my head
with dreams?.

968
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:17,813
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?.

969
01:11:17,913 --> 01:11:20,629
Who denied me my destiny?.

970
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:33,178
It was never my
decision to make.

971
01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:39,953
It is now.

972
01:11:44,325 --> 01:11:48,077
Give me the scroll.

973
01:11:48,177 --> 01:11:50,177
I would rather die.

974
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:42,717
All I ever did, I did
to make you proud.

975
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:46,117
Tell me how proud
you are, Shifu.

976
01:12:46,287 --> 01:12:48,287
Tell me.

977
01:12:48,355 --> 01:12:50,355
Tell me.

978
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:01,367
I have...

979
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:04,667
I have always been
proud of you.

980
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:08,272
From the first
moment, I've been...

981
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:10,559
...proud of you.

982
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:12,995
And it was my pride...

983
01:13:13,095 --> 01:13:15,095
...that blinded me.

984
01:13:15,195 --> 01:13:17,008
I loved you too much...

985
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:19,652
to see what you
were becoming...

986
01:13:19,752 --> 01:13:22,002
...what I...

987
01:13:22,102 --> 01:13:24,502
...was turning you into.

988
01:13:24,891 --> 01:13:26,891
I'm...

989
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:28,967
I'm sorry.

990
01:13:36,436 --> 01:13:39,153
I don't want your apology.

991
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:41,253
I want my scroll.

992
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,193
What?.

993
01:13:45,293 --> 01:13:47,293
Where is it?.

994
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:50,711
The Dragon Warrior has
taken the scroll...

995
01:13:50,811 --> 01:13:53,153
halfway across China by now.

996
01:13:53,253 --> 01:13:56,369
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

997
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:58,469
Never.

998
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,725
Never.

999
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,666
Stairs.

1000
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:12,186
Who are you?

1001
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:17,300
Buddy, I am the
Dragon Warrior.

1002
01:14:20,313 --> 01:14:22,313
You?

1003
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:24,615
Him? He's a panda.

1004
01:14:24,691 --> 01:14:26,344
You're a panda. What are...

1005
01:14:26,444 --> 01:14:28,504
you gonna do, big
guy? Sit on me?

1006
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:30,604
Don't tempt me.

1007
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:34,606
No. I'm gonna use this.

1008
01:14:34,706 --> 01:14:37,606
You want it? Come and get it.

1009
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:40,064
Finally.

1010
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:07,324
That scroll is mine.

1011
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:02,545
Lightning.

1012
01:16:36,781 --> 01:16:39,317
The scroll has
given him power.

1013
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:41,417
No.

1014
01:17:17,455 --> 01:17:21,375
Finally. Oh, yes.

1015
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:26,328
The power of the
Dragon Scroll is mine.

1016
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:32,659
It's nothing.

1017
01:17:34,638 --> 01:17:37,908
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

1018
01:17:38,008 --> 01:17:40,008
What?

1019
01:17:40,277 --> 01:17:43,277
There is no secret ingredient.

1020
01:17:45,616 --> 01:17:47,616
It's just you.

1021
01:17:56,627 --> 01:17:57,674
Stop it.

1022
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:59,774
I'm gonna pee.

1023
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:02,713
Don't.

1024
01:18:02,813 --> 01:18:04,813
Don't. Don't.

1025
01:19:11,734 --> 01:19:13,517
You...

1026
01:19:13,617 --> 01:19:15,833
...can't defeat me.

1027
01:19:20,276 --> 01:19:22,276
You...

1028
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,629
...you're just a big...

1029
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,294
...fat...

1030
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,251
...panda.

1031
01:19:28,351 --> 01:19:31,467
I'm not a big fat panda.

1032
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:33,852
I'm the big fat panda.

1033
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,543
The Wuxi Finger Hold.

1034
01:19:37,643 --> 01:19:39,044
Oh, you know this hold?

1035
01:19:39,144 --> 01:19:41,222
You're bluffing.
You're bluffing.

1036
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:43,077
Shifu didn't teach you that.

1037
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:44,848
Nope.

1038
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,648
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

1039
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:09,656
Look.

1040
01:20:09,925 --> 01:20:12,018
The Dragon Warrior.

1041
01:20:39,488 --> 01:20:45,088
That's my boy. That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son.

1042
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:48,428
Yes.

1043
01:20:48,797 --> 01:20:50,797
Thanks, Dad.

1044
01:20:59,641 --> 01:21:01,641
Hey, guys.

1045
01:21:05,781 --> 01:21:07,097
Master.

1046
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:09,197
Master.

1047
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,269
Master?

1048
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,369
Master Shifu.

1049
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:29,218
Master.

1050
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,396
Shifu, are you OK?.

1051
01:21:33,774 --> 01:21:35,158
Po.

1052
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:37,258
You're alive.

1053
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,459
Or we're both dead.

1054
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:42,466
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

1055
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,566
You did?

1056
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:53,675
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

1057
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:57,253
You are the Dragon Warrior.

1058
01:21:57,999 --> 01:22:00,499
You have brought peace...

1059
01:22:00,575 --> 01:22:03,285
...to this valley...

1060
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,553
...and...

1061
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,254
...and to me.

1062
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:09,354
Thank you.

1063
01:22:10,444 --> 01:22:13,662
Thank you, Po.

1064
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,342
Thank you. Thank you.

1065
01:22:21,856 --> 01:22:26,839
No. Master. No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please.

1066
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:29,644
I'm not dying, you idiot.

1067
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,744
Dragon Warrior...

1068
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:37,802
...I am simply at
peace. Finally.

1069
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:43,476
So, I should stop talking?

1070
01:22:44,178 --> 01:22:46,178
If you can.

1071
01:23:03,898 --> 01:23:06,798
Do you want to get
something to eat?

1072
01:23:08,168 --> 01:23:10,168
Yeah.

1073
01:23:11,169 --> 01:23:14,169


1074
01:23:15,275 --> 01:23:18,676
<i>Everybody is kung fu fighting</i>

1075
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:23,012
<i>Your mind becomes
fast as lightning</i>

1076
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:28,254
<i>Although the future
is a little bit frightening</i>

1077
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:32,854
<i>It's the book of your life
that you're writing</i>

1078
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:38,021
<i>Everybody is kung fu fighting</i>

1079
01:23:39,299 --> 01:23:42,799
<i>Your mind becomes
fast as lightning</i>

1080
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:48,136
<i>Although the future
is a little bit frightening</i>

1081

<i>It's the book of your life
that you're writing</i>

1082
01:23:53,046 --> 01:23:55,228
<i>You are a natural</i>

1083
01:23:55,328 --> 01:23:57,550
<i>Why is that so hard to see?</i>

1084
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:01,751
<i>Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me</i>

1085
01:24:01,851 --> 01:24:05,905
<i>The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know</i>

1086
01:24:06,005 --> 01:24:09,879
<i>But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero</i>

1087

that you're writing</i>

1091
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:32,200
<i>You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay</i>

1092
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:36,369
<i>You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way</i>

1093
01:24:36,469 --> 01:24:38,465
<i>Now what would it
take to break?</i>

1094
01:24:38,565 --> 01:24:40,241
<i>I believe that you can bend</i>

1095
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:44,680
<i>Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win...</i>

1096
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,380
<i>'Cause everybody is
kung fu fighting</i>

1097

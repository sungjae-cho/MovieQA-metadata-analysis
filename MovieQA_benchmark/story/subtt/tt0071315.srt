1
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,619
<i>All right, Curly, enough's enough.</i>

2
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,177
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

3
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,294
Down the hatch.

4
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,811
<i>- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.</i>

5
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,490
<i>When you're right, you're right.</i>

6
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,209
And you're right.

7
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,168
I'll pay you the rest next week.

8
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:15,008
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

9
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,167
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

10
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,446
<i>Forget it, will you, Curly?</i>

11
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,726
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

12
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:24,966
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

13
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:27,365
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.</i>

14
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,804
<i>Careful driving home, Curl, huh?</i>

15
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:34,364
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

16
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:38,002
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?</i>

17
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:41,801
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.</i>

18
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>Now, what seems to be the problem?</i>

19
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,400
<i>My husband,</i>

20
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,039
<i>I believe, is seeing another woman.</i>

21
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,798
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

22
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:56,478
I am sorry.

23
00:03:56,597 --> 00:04:00,398
<i>Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?</i>

24
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,396
<i>I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,</i>

25
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,636
<i>and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.</i>

26
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:11,035
I can't do everything myself.

27
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,434
Of course not.

28
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:13,794
<i>Now,</i>

29
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:20,353
what makes you certain
that your husband is

30
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:22,951
involved with someone?

31
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,672
A wife can tell.

32
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,151
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?</i>

33
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,390
<i>Yes, of course!</i>

34
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,789
<i>- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, I...</i>

35
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,948
<i>I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

36
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,787
<i>Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?</i>

37
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,227
You're better off not knowing.

38
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:44,866
I have to know.

39
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,905
Very well.

40
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,585
What is your husband's first name?

41
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:55,784
Hollis.

42
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,423
Hollis Mulwray.

43
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,423
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

44
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,542
Chief Engineer?

45
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,380
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, this...</i>

46
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,739
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

47
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:19,898
It takes time...

48
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,698
<i>Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.</i>

49
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,856
<i>Okay, we'II...</i>

50
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,776
We'll see what we can do.

51
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,335
<i>Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,</i>

52
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,374
<i>turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,</i>

53
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,893
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

54
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:42,573
<i>Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,</i>

55
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:45,772
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

56
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,332
<i>Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,</i>

57
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:51,410
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

58
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,050
Los Angeles is a desert community.

59
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,569
<i>Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.</i>

60
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:00,528
<i>And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us</i>

61
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:01,968
as though we never existed.

62
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,127
<i>Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,</i>

63
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:08,966
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

64
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,846
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

65
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:13,925
and not on top of them.

66
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,165
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

67
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:23,363
<i>Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.</i>

68
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:26,563
<i>I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.</i>

69
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:27,841
<i>Mr. Mulwray?</i>

70
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,799
<i>In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,</i>

71
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:44,358
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

72
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,277
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

73
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:53,756
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

74
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,755
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

75
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,315
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

76
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,473
<i>with slopes of 2.5:1 , 112 feet high,</i>

77
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:05,953
<i>and a 12,000-acre water surface.</i>

78
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,312
<i>Well, it won't hold.</i>

79
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,392
I won't build it. It's that simple.

80
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:14,190
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

81
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,030
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

82
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,868
Quiet! Quiet!

83
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:30,028
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

84
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:32,346
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

85
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,865
<i>You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?</i>

86
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:39,464
<i>You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,</i>

87
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,224
starve the livestock!

88
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,584
<i>Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?</i>

89
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,264
That's what I want to know!

90
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,077
<i>- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.</i>

91
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:28,355
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

92
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,755
<i>Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,</i>

93
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,273
<i>a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

94
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,832
The guy's got water on the brain.

95
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,228
So what do you got?

96
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:17,464
This?

97
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:21,583
<i>Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

98
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:24,542
What about?

99
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,982
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

100
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:28,861
<i>I heard only one thing, though.</i>

101
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,182
"Apple core."

102
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,140
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

103
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,100
<i>My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?</i>

104
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,498
<i>Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.</i>

105
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:45,098
<i>Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.</i>

106
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:46,537
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

107
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,896
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

108
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:53,975
<i>What is it, Sophie?</i>

109
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,895
<i>Duffy's on the phone.</i>

110
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,013
<i>- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!</i>

111
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,693
<i>He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...</i>

112
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,253
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

113
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:07,972
<i>I'm at Glendale and Douglas.</i>

114
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:10,811
<i>They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!</i>

115
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,171
Okay.

116
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,329
Echo Park.

117
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,490
Water again.

118
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,407
<i>Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.</i>

119
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,204
You'll love it.

120
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,391
Here. Let me...

121
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,228
<i>When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blasé about it.</i>

122
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:50,708
<i>Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.</i>

123
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,305
<i>- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.</i>

124
00:15:58,426 --> 00:15:59,705
Sure is.

125
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,065
Fools' names and fools' faces.

126
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:07,943
<i>- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.</i>

127
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,543
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

128
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:13,782
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

129
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:16,661
<i>Mortgage department,
First National Bank.</i>

130
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:20,741
<i>Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?</i>

131
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,179
<i>We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.</i>

132
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:24,659
Neither do I.

133
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,179
<i>No, you have your press agent do it.</i>

134
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:30,379
<i>Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?</i>

135
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,137
<i>Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.</i>

136
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,096
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

137
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,336
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

138
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:39,256
<i>- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...</i>

139
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:41,095
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

140
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,614
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

141
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,694
<i>- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.</i>

142
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,094
<i>Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...</i>

143
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,134
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

144
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:49,294
<i>It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.</i>

145
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,412
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

146
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:52,932
Of course you do.

147
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,212
<i>Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife</i>

148
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,612
<i>- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?</i>

149
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,531
<i>So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"</i>

150
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,170
<i>He says, "What do the Chinese do?"</i>

151
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,330
<i>He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."</i>

152
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,690
<i>Duffy. Hey, Walsh!</i>

153
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:10,248
<i>Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?</i>

154
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,968
<i>- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...</i>

155
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,527
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

156
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:16,607
<i>- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.</i>

157
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:17,926
I want to tell you a story.

158
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,046
<i>So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?</i>

159
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,886
He's tired of screwing his wife.

160
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,485
<i>- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.</i>

161
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,086
You're always in such a hurry.

162
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,724
<i>So his friend says to him,</i>

163
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,924
<i>"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"</i>

164
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,883
<i>So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"</i>

165
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,483
<i>The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,</i>

166
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:36,122
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

167
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:39,001
<i>"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,</i>

168
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,842
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

169
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,200
<i>Walsh, just listen to me for a second.</i>

170
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,640
<i>I mean, you'll love this.</i>

171
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,799
<i>Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,</i>

172
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,759
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

173
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,639
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

174
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,478
<i>So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.</i>

175
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,757
<i>So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.</i>

176
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,476
<i>He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.</i>

177
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,555
<i>Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,</i>

178
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,115
<i>and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"</i>

179
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:06,835
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

180
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:09,154
<i>Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.</i>

181
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,154
<i>He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,</i>

182
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,113
<i>he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,</i>

183
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:14,993
<i>she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?</i>

184
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,753
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

185
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,591
Jesus!

186
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:22,351
That Barney!

187
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,790
Mr. Gittes?

188
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,669
Yes.

189
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:33,909
Do you know me?

190
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,109
<i>Well,</i>

191
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:39,827
I think I would have remembered.

192
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,786
Have we ever met?

193
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,546
<i>Well, no.</i>

194
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,865
Never?

195
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,145
Never.

196
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,904
That's what I thought.

197
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,984
<i>You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.</i>

198
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,344
<i>You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?</i>

199
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,863
Not that Mulwray?

200
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,422
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.</i>

201
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,620
<i>And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,</i>

202
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,900
<i>you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,</i>

203
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,340
certainly not spy on my husband.

204
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,058
<i>I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.</i>

205
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,378
<i>Well, you're going to get it.</i>

206
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,497
<i>Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

207
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,577
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

208
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,176
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

209
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,216
<i>I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.</i>

210
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,855
My lawyer does.

211
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,974
<i>Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.</i>

212
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:38,213
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

213
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:55,289
<i>- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...</i>

214
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:57,929
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

215
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,288
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

216
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,767
Since lunch.

217
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:05,286
<i>- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?</i>

218
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,765
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

219
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:11,165
Sir?

220
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,684
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

221
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,683
Is he still in the building?

222
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,203
Very well. Thank you.

223
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:44,423
<i>Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

224
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:45,943
J.J. Gittes.

225
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,582
<i>It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.</i>

226
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,822
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

227
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:51,981
Certainly.

228
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,021
We're a bit nervous around here

229
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:57,899
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

230
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,620
Right this way.

231
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:09,457
<i>You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,</i>

232
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:12,016
<i>you come to know his habits, his values.</i>

233
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:13,136
You come to know him.

234
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:16,295
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

235
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,695
And Mulwray isn't?

236
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,974
He never even kids about it.

237
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:23,014
<i>Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.</i>

238
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,932
<i>- Sit down.
- No, thank you.</i>

239
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,092
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

240
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:32,172
<i>No, I'm sorry, I don't.</i>

241
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,011
<i>Well, tell him I'll be back.</i>

242
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:37,250
I will.

243
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,490
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

244
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,370
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

245
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,729
<i>- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.</i>

246
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:50,288
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

247
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:52,606
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

248
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,846
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

249
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,365
You don't take a bath in it.

250
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:00,085
They wrote you a letter!

251
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:03,004
But then you'd have to be able to read.

252
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:08,203
<i>Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?</i>

253
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,803
<i>Well, I hope so. He's working for us.</i>

254
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,962
Doing what?

255
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,482
<i>Well, frankly, there have been
some threats</i>

256
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,282
to blow up the city reservoirs.

257
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,840
<i>- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.</i>

258
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,480
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

259
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,960
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

260
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,600
<i>- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?</i>

261
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,158
<i>When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,</i>

262
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:31,478
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tonnes of booze on the beach

263
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:33,957
and never lost a drop.

264
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:37,236
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

265
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:37,262
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

266
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,416
Please.

267
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:17,931
You wait.

268
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,997
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

269
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:23,157
Bad for the glass.

270
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,308
Mr. Gittes.

271
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:02,788
<i>Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

272
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:06,986
Would you like something to drink?

273
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:08,226
What are you having?

274
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:10,985
<i>- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.</i>

275
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:14,144
<i>- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

276
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:17,344
My husband's at the office.

277
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,063
<i>Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

278
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,582
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

279
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,382
That's not his apartment.

280
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,181
<i>Anyway, I...</i>

281
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,739
<i>The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,</i>

282
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,139
<i>and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,</i>

283
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,339
set me up.

284
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,577
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

285
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,977
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

286
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,456
<i>Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

287
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,576
<i>- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

288
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,695
So let's just drop the whole thing.

289
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:52,455
<i>- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.</i>

290
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,335
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?</i>

291
00:27:54,414 --> 00:27:56,454
...I don't want to drop it.

292
00:27:57,853 --> 00:28:00,613
I better talk to your husband about this.

293
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:03,133
Why? What on Earth for?

294
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:05,213
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

295
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,891
<i>Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

296
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,050
but never that.

297
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:12,051
<i>Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,</i>

298
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,330
<i>and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.</i>

299
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,568
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

300
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,048
<i>So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.</i>

301
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,008
Why should it be a problem?

302
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:26,167
<i>- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.</i>

303
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:29,366
<i>Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,</i>

304
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,646
<i>in a cheap sort of a way, of course.</i>

305
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:34,965
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

306
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,884
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

307
00:28:38,364 --> 00:28:40,964
<i>- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!</i>

308
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,283
It couldn't be more personal.

309
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:46,842
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

310
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:48,802
Let's look at it this way.

311
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:52,400
<i>Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,</i>

312
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,840
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

313
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,040
<i>Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.</i>

314
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,240
They're out to get your husband.

315
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,758
<i>If I can see him, I can help him.</i>

316
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:06,157
Did you talk to him this morning?

317
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:07,837
No.

318
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,196
I went riding rather early.

319
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:12,756
Looks like you went quite a distance.

320
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,675
I was riding bareback.

321
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:17,355
You...

322
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,594
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

323
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:22,473
<i>Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.</i>

324
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,993
<i>Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.</i>

325
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:25,713
I'll stop by.

326
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,511
Please call first.

327
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,388
<i>Sorry, closed to public, sir.</i>

328
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,267
<i>Oh, that's all right, Officer.</i>

329
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:52,587
<i>Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

330
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:56,105
<i>- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.</i>

331
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,979
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

332
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,219
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:27,498
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

334
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:30,498
<i>Hello, Jake.</i>

335
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:33,056
Lou. How are you?

336
00:30:34,216 --> 00:30:38,656
<i>Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.</i>

337
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:42,775
<i>- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.</i>

338
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:44,254
<i>There's no smoking here, sir...</i>

339
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,094
<i>That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.</i>

340
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:50,332
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

341
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:51,972
<i>Thanks, Lou.</i>

342
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:54,331
How'd you get past the guard?

343
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:57,730
<i>Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.</i>

344
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,690
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

345
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,770
I get by.

346
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:06,129
<i>Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.</i>

347
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:07,329
Maybe you have.

348
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:10,367
<i>Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.</i>

349
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:14,207
<i>Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail</i>

350
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:16,446
for spitting in the laundry?

351
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,325
<i>You're a little behind the times, Jake.</i>

352
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,405
They use steam irons now.

353
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:23,605
And I'm out of Chinatown.

354
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:25,644
Since when?

355
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,083
Since I made lieutenant.

356
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:30,323
Congratulations.

357
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:35,081
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

358
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,281
Who?

359
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:39,001
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

360
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:40,721
Yeah.

361
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:43,240
I'd like to talk to him.

362
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,000
<i>So you'd like to talk to him, huh?</i>

363
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,318
You're welcome to try.

364
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,037
There he is.

365
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:12,873
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

366
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:16,112
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

367
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:20,751
<i>Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.</i>

368
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,950
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

369
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,108
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

370
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:31,468
The publicity didn't make him

371
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:34,308
<i>morose, or unhappy?</i>

372
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,667
It didn't make him happy.

373
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:40,466
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

374
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:41,666
No.

375
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,186
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

376
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:49,144
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

377
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:51,464
No.

378
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:53,823
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

379
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:56,662
You and your husband
never discussed her?

380
00:32:58,342 --> 00:32:59,462
He...

381
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:01,581
We did.

382
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,380
He wouldn't tell me her name.

383
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,940
<i>We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.</i>

384
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,939
A complete surprise?

385
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,458
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

386
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:16,578
A private investigator?

387
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,857
Mr. Gittes.

388
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:27,775
<i>Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end</i>

389
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:30,575
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

390
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:35,093
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

391
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,652
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

392
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:40,811
<i>Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.</i>

393
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:44,131
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

394
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,291
No.

395
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,970
- Or her name?
- No.

396
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:49,969
Of course not.

397
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,169
<i>Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?</i>

398
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,368
<i>Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.</i>

399
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:57,769
<i>If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.</i>

400
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:01,047
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

401
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:05,086
<i>I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.</i>

402
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,925
<i>- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.</i>

403
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,324
We better do this in a hurry.

404
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:15,604
<i>Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!</i>

405
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,322
<i>You want a picture, guys? Here it is!</i>

406
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:21,322
<i>"Gittes", two T's and an E.</i>

407
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,721
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

408
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,880
I just didn't want to explain anything.

409
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
I'll send you a check.

410
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
A check?

411
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,118
To make it official that I've hired you.

412
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,074
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

413
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,393
<i>Jake, what are you doing here?</i>

414
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:56,954
<i>Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.</i>

415
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:59,673
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

416
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,512
Yeah? Isn't this something?

417
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:04,552
<i>Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.</i>

418
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:07,071
- Only in L.A.
- Yeah.

419
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:10,469
<i>- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.</i>

420
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,709
<i>So how are you doing, Morty?</i>

421
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,428
<i>Never better, except for this darn cough.</i>

422
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:23,667
<i>- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.</i>

423
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:33,065
Who you got there?

424
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:36,025
<i>Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.</i>

425
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:39,303
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

426
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,463
Quite a character.

427
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:46,342
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

428
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:50,821
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

429
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:52,900
<i>All right, there.</i>

430
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,138
<i>Yeah. He drowned, too.</i>

431
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:03,458
Come again?

432
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,017
<i>Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.</i>

433
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:08,577
The L.A. River?

434
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:12,176
<i>Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?</i>

435
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,415
<i>Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.</i>

436
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:16,734
It's not completely dry.

437
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:19,534
<i>Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,</i>

438
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:21,574
no matter how soused he is.

439
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:24,213
We got water out of him. He drowned!

440
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,159
Hello.

441
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:29,517
Howdy.

442
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,157
<i>You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?</i>

443
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,356
Do you speak English?

444
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:44,633
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

445
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,073
Yes.

446
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,633
<i>What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?</i>

447
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:52,312
- The water.
- What about the water?

448
00:37:52,392 --> 00:37:54,631
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

449
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,151
What did you tell him?

450
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,710
It comes in different parts of the river.

451
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,989
Every night a different part.

452
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:21,236
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

453
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:32,033
<i>Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!</i>

454
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:40,752
<i>Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?</i>

455
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,310
<i>You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?</i>

456
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,110
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

457
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,948
No? Want to guess? No?

458
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,148
Okay. They lose their noses.

459
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:03,346
Next time you lose the whole thing.

460
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,105
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

461
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,506
Understand?

462
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,864
<i>- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?</i>

463
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:12,584
I understand.

464
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,023
All right.

465
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,581
<i>So some contractor
wants to build a dam,</i>

466
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,061
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

467
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:32,539
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

468
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,178
Don't want Mulvihill.

469
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:37,019
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

470
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,417
Then what do you do?

471
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,097
Sue the shit out of them.

472
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:41,617
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,976
<i>- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.</i>

474
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,535
<i>- Who?
- Ida Sessions.</i>

475
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,455
Don't know her. Take a number.

476
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:55,174
<i>Sue people like that,</i>

477
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:59,412
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

478
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,812
<i>I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.</i>

479
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:04,772
<i>She says you know her.</i>

480
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:06,571
Okay.

481
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,929
<i>Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.</i>

482
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,848
<i>Oh, yes, we have.</i>

483
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,208
<i>- Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?</i>

484
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:21,008
What can I do for you?

485
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,406
<i>Well, I'm a working girl.</i>

486
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:26,726
<i>I didn't come in to see you on my own.</i>

487
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,526
When did you come in?

488
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,045
<i>I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?</i>

489
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:34,644
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?</i>

490
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:38,083
<i>- Yes, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?</i>

491
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:42,202
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

492
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:43,362
Go on.

493
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:46,802
<i>I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.</i>

494
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:49,321
<i>The point is, if it ever comes out,</i>

495
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,280
<i>I want somebody to know
that I didn't know what would happen.</i>

496
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,800
I understand.

497
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:57,359
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

498
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:58,919
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no.</i>

499
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:00,557
<i>No.</i>

500
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,197
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

501
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:05,317
<i>No, Mr. Gittes.</i>

502
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:08,357
<i>Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.</i>

503
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:09,956
The obituary column?

504
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:13,675
<i>- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...</i>

505
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:16,715
Sure.

506
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:19,393
How do you like them apples?

507
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:51,026
Ma'am.

508
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:57,064
Thank you for coming.

509
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:06,182
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Drink?</i>

510
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,262
<i>Tom Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.</i>

511
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,262
Tom Collins with lime.

512
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,820
I got your check in the mail.

513
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,020
<i>Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.</i>

514
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,178
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.</i>

515
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:29,497
How much would you like?

516
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:32,536
<i>Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.</i>

517
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:37,415
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

518
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:40,373
- I have?
- I think so.

519
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:43,533
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

520
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:45,933
<i>You were upset, but not that upset.</i>

521
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:48,932
<i>Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.</i>

522
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:53,611
Sorry.

523
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:59,410
<i>Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,</i>

524
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,729
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

525
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:04,449
Excuse me.

526
00:45:05,648 --> 00:45:09,687
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- It wasn't much of a lie.

527
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,167
<i>If your husband was killed, it was.</i>

528
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:15,685
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

529
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:17,605
But he wasn't killed.

530
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,924
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.</i>

531
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:29,082
<i>Well,</i>

532
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,323
I suppose I am.

533
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:36,001
<i>Actually, I knew about the affair.</i>

534
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,800
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

535
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:41,280
He told you?

536
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:44,319
And you weren't the least bit upset?

537
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,159
I was grateful.

538
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:50,198
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.</i>

539
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:51,357
Why?

540
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,356
<i>Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my métier.</i>

541
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:57,276
<i>When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,</i>

542
00:45:57,356 --> 00:45:59,795
it runs contrary to my experience.

543
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:01,795
Unless what?

544
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,314
She was cheating on him.

545
00:46:08,873 --> 00:46:10,192
Were you?

546
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,231
I dislike the word "cheat".

547
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:19,830
Did you have affairs?

548
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,510
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

549
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,669
<i>Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,</i>

550
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,748
if that's what you mean.

551
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:31,347
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

552
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,347
Where were you
when your husband died?

553
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:36,306
I can't tell you.

554
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:37,905
You mean you don't know
where you were?

555
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:41,225
<i>- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.</i>

556
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:44,585
For very long?

557
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:47,624
<i>I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.</i>

558
00:46:48,144 --> 00:46:50,023
It's difficult for me.

559
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:56,622
<i>Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.</i>

560
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:59,142
I didn't want publicity.

561
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:02,421
<i>I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.</i>

562
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,419
Is that all?

563
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,859
<i>By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?</i>

564
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:15,137
"Cross."

565
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,817
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

566
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,375
Why?

567
00:47:22,095 --> 00:47:23,455
No reason.

568
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:25,735
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

569
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:27,655
No. I'm just a snoop.

570
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,492
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

571
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:38,412
<i>Wait a minute, sonny.</i>

572
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:40,611
I think you better come with me.

573
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,851
But why? There's nothing more to say.

574
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,090
<i>Will you get my car, please?</i>

575
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,969
<i>Okay, go home.</i>

576
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:52,729
<i>But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.</i>

577
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:55,008
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tonnes of water

578
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:56,168
<i>from the city's reservoirs,</i>

579
00:47:56,328 --> 00:47:58,526
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

580
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,247
<i>He found out about it, and he was killed.</i>

581
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,126
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

582
00:48:03,206 --> 00:48:05,606
<i>Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,</i>

583
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:06,685
which they don't.

584
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,925
<i>It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,</i>

585
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:10,844
which is fine by me.

586
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,564
<i>But, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

587
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,842
<i>I goddamn near lost my nose,</i>

588
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:17,202
and I like it.

589
00:48:17,282 --> 00:48:19,122
I like breathing through it.

590
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:22,242
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

591
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,319
Mr. Gittes...

592
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:44,396
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

593
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:16,148
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

594
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:19,787
<i>Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.</i>

595
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:22,866
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

596
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:25,506
I take a long lunch hour.

597
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:29,385
<i>All day, sometimes.</i>

598
00:50:26,852 --> 00:50:29,251
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

599
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:30,610
Yes.

600
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,890
<i>- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?</i>

601
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,889
He owned it.

602
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:38,489
He owned the Water Department?

603
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:39,688
Yes.

604
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:44,807
<i>You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?</i>

605
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:46,007
Yes.

606
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:53,485
How did they get it away from him?

607
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:56,885
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

608
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,684
Mr. Mulwray?

609
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:01,283
I thought you said Cross owned it.

610
00:51:01,403 --> 00:51:03,242
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

611
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:08,081
<i>- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.</i>

612
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,833
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

613
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,310
<i>Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

614
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:57,470
<i>These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.</i>

615
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,629
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

616
00:52:01,749 --> 00:52:05,588
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

617
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:08,508
<i>My goodness,
what happened to your nose?</i>

618
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:10,346
Cut myself shaving.

619
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:14,346
<i>Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.</i>

620
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,225
Only when I breathe.

621
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,144
Only when you breathe.

622
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:25,663
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

623
00:52:25,784 --> 00:52:28,022
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

624
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,862
<i>Neither do I, actually.</i>

625
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,421
You hired me.

626
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:35,661
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

627
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:39,220
<i>Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.</i>

628
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,380
<i>Well, let's look at it this way.</i>

629
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,578
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

630
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,817
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

631
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:48,658
You decided to ruin it.

632
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:51,977
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

633
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:54,137
Then he was...

634
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:55,735
Drowned.

635
00:52:56,616 --> 00:52:59,335
<i>Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.</i>

636
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:01,655
I don't know what you're talking about.

637
00:53:01,775 --> 00:53:05,414
<i>Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.</i>

638
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:07,973
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

639
00:53:08,093 --> 00:53:10,812
<i>in the middle of a drought, that's news.</i>

640
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:14,131
<i>Mr. Gittes,</i>

641
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,371
we're...

642
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,771
<i>We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water</i>

643
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:23,729
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

644
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,408
<i>As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,</i>

645
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:28,048
<i>but we've been trying to help
some of them out,</i>

646
00:53:28,169 --> 00:53:30,008
keep them from going under.

647
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:33,686
<i>Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.</i>

648
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:35,806
Yeah. A little run-off.

649
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:40,124
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

650
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:42,924
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

651
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:47,604
<i>Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.</i>

652
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,643
<i>- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

653
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:53,642
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

654
00:53:54,402 --> 00:53:55,562
Yes.

655
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:57,681
I don't want to nail you.

656
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,040
I want to find out who put you up to it.

657
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,318
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

658
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:09,198
Call me. I can help.

659
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:10,918
Who knows?

660
00:54:11,038 --> 00:54:14,437
<i>Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,</i>

661
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:16,077
and you can stay
the head of the department

662
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:17,996
for the next 20 years.

663
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:00,267
<i>- Drink?
- No, thank you.</i>

664
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,425
What is your usual salary?

665
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:12,103
<i>$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,</i>

666
00:55:12,783 --> 00:55:14,263
<i>plus expenses,</i>

667
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:17,502
plus a bonus if I show results.

668
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:24,260
<i>Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?</i>

669
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,541
Money.

670
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:28,819
<i>How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,</i>

671
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:30,619
that I don't know.

672
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:32,698
<i>I'll pay your salary,</i>

673
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:34,339
<i>plus $5,000</i>

674
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:38,616
<i>if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.</i>

675
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:46,775
<i>Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

676
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:48,534
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

677
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:54,133
Tell me something.

678
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:57,132
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

679
00:55:57,213 --> 00:55:59,252
sold the Water Department?

680
00:55:59,652 --> 00:56:02,172
<i>Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?</i>

681
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,291
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

682
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,730
It was sometime after.

683
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,850
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

684
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:17,608
Then you married
your father's business partner.

685
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:23,126
<i>You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

686
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:28,565
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

687
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:29,925
<i>Why, no.</i>

688
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:32,643
Yes. A little.

689
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:34,764
<i>You see, Hollis and my...</i>

690
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:37,284
My father

691
00:56:37,883 --> 00:56:39,883
had a falling-out finally.

692
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:44,081
Over you
or over the Water Department?

693
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,281
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

694
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,921
Then it was over
the Water Department.

695
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:49,001
Yes.

696
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,559
<i>Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,</i>

697
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:56,238
and I don't think my father felt that way.

698
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:59,397
<i>Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.</i>

699
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:00,797
<i>You know, the dam that broke?</i>

700
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:04,077
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.</i>

701
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:08,235
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

702
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:10,875
They never spoke from that time on.

703
00:57:14,754 --> 00:57:16,514
You sure about that?

704
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,112
Of course I'm sure.

705
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:25,032
Sign here.

706
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:28,190
The copy's for you.

707
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,056
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

708
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:32,535
How do you do?

709
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:36,695
<i>You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.</i>

710
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:38,574
Thanks.

711
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:40,493
<i>If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,</i>

712
00:58:40,573 --> 00:58:42,613
<i>but in your business, it's admirable.</i>

713
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:44,573
And it's good advertising.

714
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:45,652
It doesn't hurt.

715
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:48,971
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

716
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:50,771
Probably.

717
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:52,691
<i>But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,</i>

718
00:58:52,811 --> 00:58:55,170
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

719
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:59,169
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

720
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:03,049
How'd she get that idea?

721
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:05,607
I think I gave it to her.

722
00:59:06,727 --> 00:59:10,447
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

723
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:13,686
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

724
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:18,764
<i>Tell me, what do the police say?</i>

725
00:59:18,884 --> 00:59:21,124
They're calling it an accident.

726
00:59:22,204 --> 00:59:26,043
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

727
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,602
<i>- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

728
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:30,481
Where from?

729
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:33,881
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

730
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:38,120
Would you call him a capable man?

731
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,040
Very.

732
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:41,719
Honest?

733
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,438
As far as it goes.

734
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:47,237
<i>Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.</i>

735
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:50,796
<i>Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?</i>

736
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:53,116
- None.
- That's too bad.

737
00:59:54,036 --> 00:59:55,315
Too bad?

738
00:59:56,076 --> 00:59:59,514
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

739
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:01,954
<i>Financially speaking, of course.</i>

740
01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:04,874
What are you charging her?

741
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:10,432
<i>My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.</i>

742
01:00:10,552 --> 01:00:12,552
Are you sleeping with her?

743
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:15,991
<i>Come, come, Mr. Gitts.</i>

744
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:19,630
<i>You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?</i>

745
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,349
<i>If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,</i>

746
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:25,949
I'll put one of my men on the job.

747
01:00:27,468 --> 01:00:29,187
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

748
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:30,907
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

749
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,747
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

750
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:37,185
I don't want her taken advantage of.

751
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:39,065
- Sit down.
- What for?

752
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:44,904
<i>You may think you know
what you're dealing with,</i>

753
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:47,063
<i>but believe me, you don't.</i>

754
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:49,663
Why is that funny?

755
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:52,782
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

756
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:54,621
Yeah? Was he right?

757
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,781
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

758
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:05,938
<i>Mainly that you're rich,</i>

759
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:09,498
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

760
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:12,137
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

761
01:01:13,776 --> 01:01:15,457
<i>Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores</i>

762
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:18,537
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

763
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:22,215
<i>I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000</i>

764
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:24,614
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

765
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:27,733
<i>- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?</i>

766
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:28,973
Yeah.

767
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:32,093
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

768
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:33,412
Maybe.

769
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,052
<i>If Mulwray was murdered,</i>

770
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:39,250
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

771
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,130
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

772
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,729
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

773
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,608
<i>who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.</i>

774
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:52,488
I let them practice up out here.

775
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:54,728
Yeah.

776
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:59,166
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

777
01:01:59,286 --> 01:02:01,686
<i>At my age, you tend to forget.</i>

778
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,644
<i>It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,</i>

779
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:08,364
and you had one hell of an argument.

780
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:12,284
<i>I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.</i>

781
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:18,121
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

782
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:21,441
What about her?

783
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:25,639
<i>Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.</i>

784
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:32,438
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

785
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:35,318
I'd like to help her if I can.

786
01:02:35,438 --> 01:02:39,157
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

787
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:42,235
<i>Hollis Mulwray made this city,</i>

788
01:02:42,915 --> 01:02:44,915
and he made me a fortune.

789
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:49,594
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

790
01:02:52,313 --> 01:02:56,752
<i>If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.</i>

791
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:00,111
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

792
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:03,151
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

793
01:03:03,391 --> 01:03:05,110
How did you find out?

794
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:09,309
<i>I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.</i>

795
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:13,228
Okay.

796
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:16,148
I'II...

797
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:20,307
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

798
01:03:20,987 --> 01:03:22,227
<i>Tell me,</i>

799
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:27,184
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

800
01:03:27,344 --> 01:03:29,065
Just find the girl.

801
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:32,144
<i>I'll look into it,</i>

802
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:35,303
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

803
01:03:36,222 --> 01:03:37,703
Orange groves?

804
01:03:38,702 --> 01:03:40,902
<i>We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.</i>

805
01:03:45,941 --> 01:03:47,820
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me

806
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,540
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

807
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,419
Part of it's in Ventura County.

808
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,818
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

809
01:03:56,298 --> 01:03:59,338
<i>Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.</i>

810
01:04:00,178 --> 01:04:01,777
<i>Row 23, section C.</i>

811
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,296
Weasel.

812
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:01,842
<i>Say, sonny,</i>

813
01:05:04,002 --> 01:05:07,481
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

814
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,880
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

815
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,040
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

816
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,518
<i>Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.</i>

817
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:20,518
If that's what it says.

818
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,637
Can I check one of these volumes out?

819
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:29,396
<i>Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.</i>

820
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:32,356
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

821
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:36,434
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

822
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:39,034
I'd like to be able to read across.

823
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:51,990
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

824
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:58,094
Hold it right there!

825
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,039
<i>All right, quit it. Quit, now!</i>

826
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:08,558
Search the man. See if he's armed.

827
01:08:21,115 --> 01:08:24,155
<i>I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!</i>

828
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:26,433
Search him. Search him!

829
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:29,273
He ain't armed.

830
01:08:29,393 --> 01:08:30,792
<i>All right, mister, who you with,</i>

831
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:33,912
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

832
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:36,151
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

833
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:37,591
<i>You come near me
with that thing again,</i>

834
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:38,711
you're gonna need a pair of them!

835
01:08:38,831 --> 01:08:40,550
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

836
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:44,389
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

837
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:51,468
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

838
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:53,187
I'm not with either one of them.

839
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,626
<i>Then what you doing out here, mister?</i>

840
01:08:56,947 --> 01:08:58,866
A client hired me to see...

841
01:08:59,906 --> 01:09:02,545
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

842
01:09:02,665 --> 01:09:04,264
Irrigating my land?

843
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:05,904
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

844
01:09:06,024 --> 01:09:08,623
<i>to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.</i>

845
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,743
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

846
01:09:10,862 --> 01:09:13,462
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

847
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:19,740
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

848
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:22,660
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

849
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:27,139
<i>Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.</i>

850
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,618
<i>Well, that's that.</i>

851
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:03,810
What's going on?

852
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,809
<i>You didn't look too good,</i>

853
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,769
so we thought we better call
your employer.

854
01:10:13,128 --> 01:10:14,808
Thanks for coming.

855
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:21,765
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

856
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:25,445
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

857
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:28,164
<i>But the water's not gonna go to L. A.,
it's coming right here.</i>

858
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:29,404
To the Valley?

859
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,883
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

860
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:34,363
I was at the Hall of Records today.

861
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:43,921
<i>In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,</i>

862
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,560
<i>Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,</i>

863
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,719
<i>and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.</i>

864
01:10:50,839 --> 01:10:52,718
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

865
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:56,399
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

866
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,277
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

867
01:10:58,357 --> 01:10:59,716
and then picking it up for peanuts.

868
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:04,196
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

869
01:11:04,316 --> 01:11:07,155
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

870
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,114
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

871
01:11:14,034 --> 01:11:15,752
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

872
01:11:16,553 --> 01:11:18,432
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

873
01:11:20,872 --> 01:11:22,512
- We got it!
- What?

874
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:24,111
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

875
01:11:24,232 --> 01:11:27,111
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

876
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,270
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

877
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,670
He passed away two weeks ago.

878
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,229
Why is that unusual?

879
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:37,228
<i>He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.</i>

880
01:11:37,348 --> 01:11:38,908
That's unusual.

881
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:24,097
<i>Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?</i>

882
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:26,297
<i>Yes, I hope so.</i>

883
01:12:27,616 --> 01:12:28,855
It's Dad.

884
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:30,895
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

885
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:33,215
<i>- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.</i>

886
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:35,734
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

887
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:38,293
<i>Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.</i>

888
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:41,332
<i>- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.</i>

889
01:12:41,492 --> 01:12:44,212
<i>Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,</i>

890
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,972
and money is no object.

891
01:12:46,131 --> 01:12:48,691
Perhaps if we met with your father.

892
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,890
- There is one question.
- Of course.

893
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:55,049
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

894
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:57,528
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't.</i>

895
01:12:57,648 --> 01:12:59,249
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

896
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:02,128
<i>We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?</i>

897
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:06,406
<i>Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?</i>

898
01:13:06,487 --> 01:13:10,446
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

899
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:12,526
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

900
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:15,725
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

901
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:16,884
Good.

902
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:19,244
<i>I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?</i>

903
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:20,563
No. Allow me to show you.

904
01:13:20,724 --> 01:13:23,202
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

905
01:13:23,282 --> 01:13:25,602
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

906
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:27,362
It's almost bedtime.

907
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:30,561
<i>We understand. Come, my sweet.</i>

908
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,957
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

909
01:13:45,038 --> 01:13:46,917
Sit down. Have a chair.

910
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:08,831
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

911
01:14:14,671 --> 01:14:18,069
<i>You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.</i>

912
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:19,589
They can't be.

913
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:26,427
<i>They may not know it, but they are.</i>

914
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:29,666
<i>- Hello, girls.
- Hello.</i>

915
01:14:29,827 --> 01:14:32,187
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

916
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:36,345
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

917
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:38,905
<i>Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.</i>

918
01:14:38,984 --> 01:14:39,984
Why?

919
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:42,144
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

920
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,023
<i>Oh, I'm not.</i>

921
01:14:44,103 --> 01:14:48,022
<i>- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.</i>

922
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:49,982
<i>Some time ago,</i>

923
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:53,940
<i>my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,</i>

924
01:14:54,021 --> 01:14:55,541
but we lost it.

925
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,420
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

926
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,020
Where did you get
this piece of material?

927
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,939
At the Abbacore Club.

928
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:06,698
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

929
01:15:06,818 --> 01:15:08,658
It's a fish.

930
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:13,256
<i>My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.</i>

931
01:15:13,377 --> 01:15:15,176
How do they do that?

932
01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:19,215
<i>Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...</i>

933
01:15:19,774 --> 01:15:20,694
But what?

934
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:24,014
<i>We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.</i>

935
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:29,013
<i>Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.</i>

936
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:32,652
<i>Goodbye, ladies.</i>

937
01:15:32,731 --> 01:15:33,731
- Bye!
- Bye!

938
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:44,529
<i>Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.</i>

939
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,728
Can we leave the lady out of this?

940
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:49,887
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

941
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:52,607
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

942
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:54,847
Get in the car.

943
01:17:12,188 --> 01:17:13,828
Maid's night off?

944
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,587
<i>- Why?
- What do you mean, why?</i>

945
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:21,465
<i>- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.</i>

946
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,385
Easy. It's an innocent question.

947
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,424
<i>No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.</i>

948
01:17:27,544 --> 01:17:29,344
I guess you're right.

949
01:17:32,303 --> 01:17:34,103
<i>To you, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

950
01:17:35,422 --> 01:17:37,782
<i>Frankly, tonight, you saved my...</i>

951
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:39,782
You saved my neck.

952
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:44,540
<i>Tell me, Mr. Gittes,</i>

953
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,099
does this often happen to you?

954
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:51,059
What's that?

955
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:54,578
<i>Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,</i>

956
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:56,777
<i>but if this is how you go
about your work,</i>

957
01:17:56,897 --> 01:18:00,497
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

958
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,776
<i>Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.</i>

959
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:06,775
When was the last time?

960
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,415
Why?

961
01:18:09,175 --> 01:18:11,173
It's an innocent question.

962
01:18:15,693 --> 01:18:18,852
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

963
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:24,451
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

964
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,210
As little as possible.

965
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,649
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

966
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:32,289
They do in Chinatown.

967
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,888
Why did you leave the police force?

968
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:44,606
<i>Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?</i>

969
01:18:44,726 --> 01:18:47,165
Surely. Will you come this way?

970
01:19:03,842 --> 01:19:05,481
My God!

971
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,440
It's a nasty cut.

972
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,958
I had no idea...

973
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:19,957
Sorry!

974
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:22,357
There.

975
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:24,836
Is it painful?

976
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:29,875
It must be painful.

977
01:19:31,835 --> 01:19:33,274
What's wrong?

978
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:35,313
Your eye.

979
01:19:38,553 --> 01:19:40,193
What about it? What?

980
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:44,192
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

981
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:46,031
<i>Oh, that.</i>

982
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:50,669
It's a flaw in the iris.

983
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:53,950
- A flaw?
- Yes.

984
01:19:55,269 --> 01:19:57,229
A sort of birthmark.

985
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,460
Did you wear a uniform?

986
01:20:35,099 --> 01:20:36,459
Sometimes.

987
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:40,618
Must have looked cute in blue.

988
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,497
<i>Give me a break, will you?</i>

989
01:20:45,017 --> 01:20:46,656
I don't know you.

990
01:20:47,896 --> 01:20:50,177
I want to know more about you.

991
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:51,975
Not now.

992
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:57,454
<i>You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?</i>

993
01:20:59,894 --> 01:21:01,214
I'm tired.

994
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:04,892
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

995
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:08,571
- It bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

996
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:11,330
Chinatown. Everybody.

997
01:21:12,651 --> 01:21:14,850
<i>To me, it was just bad luck.</i>

998
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:16,249
Why?

999
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:21,608
You can't always tell what's going on.

1000
01:21:23,688 --> 01:21:25,128
Like with you.

1001
01:21:34,286 --> 01:21:35,645
Why was...

1002
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,644
Why was it bad luck?

1003
01:21:44,283 --> 01:21:47,203
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

1004
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:50,642
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1005
01:21:58,559 --> 01:22:01,039
Was there a woman involved?

1006
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,079
Of course.

1007
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:06,717
Dead?

1008
01:22:19,555 --> 01:22:20,874
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

1009
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:27,312
<i>Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.</i>

1010
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:29,872
Don't do anything until I get there.

1011
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:36,470
I have to go.

1012
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:40,630
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

1013
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:44,949
<i>- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.</i>

1014
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:47,828
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

1015
01:22:47,948 --> 01:22:50,228
- Where are you going?
- Please...

1016
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:54,706
Trust me this much.

1017
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,383
I'll be back.

1018
01:23:11,662 --> 01:23:13,102
And there is...

1019
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:17,341
There is something
that I should tell you about.

1020
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:21,500
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1021
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:25,899
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

1022
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:28,577
- It has to do with my father.
- I know.

1023
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:31,097
He owns it... You know?

1024
01:23:32,017 --> 01:23:33,337
I saw him.

1025
01:23:36,815 --> 01:23:38,175
You saw

1026
01:23:39,135 --> 01:23:40,375
my father?

1027
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:46,453
- What... When?
- This morning.

1028
01:23:49,453 --> 01:23:51,093
You didn't tell me.

1029
01:23:51,453 --> 01:23:53,851
<i>Well, there hasn't been much time.</i>

1030
01:23:54,371 --> 01:23:55,491
What...

1031
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,731
What did he say?

1032
01:24:03,049 --> 01:24:04,569
What did he say?

1033
01:24:05,089 --> 01:24:06,929
That you were jealous.

1034
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:10,369
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

1035
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,607
Do? To whom?

1036
01:24:13,767 --> 01:24:16,007
<i>Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.</i>

1037
01:24:18,327 --> 01:24:20,566
He wanted to know where she was.

1038
01:24:23,645 --> 01:24:25,565
I want you to listen to me.

1039
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:30,043
<i>Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.</i>

1040
01:24:30,163 --> 01:24:33,643
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1041
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:38,042
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

1042
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:39,600
It's possible.

1043
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,319
Even the death of your husband?

1044
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:49,879
It's possible.

1045
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:52,238
<i>Now, please,
don't ask me any more questions now,</i>

1046
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:54,398
just wait. Wait for me here.

1047
01:24:55,478 --> 01:24:57,076
I need you here.

1048
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,793
<i>No, no. Here.</i>

1049
01:28:28,066 --> 01:28:29,626
Give me the keys.

1050
01:28:31,826 --> 01:28:32,826
You...

1051
01:28:32,946 --> 01:28:36,224
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

1052
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:37,664
The police?

1053
01:28:38,384 --> 01:28:39,584
<i>Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1054
01:28:39,744 --> 01:28:43,142
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1055
01:28:43,263 --> 01:28:45,502
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

1056
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,702
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

1057
01:28:49,702 --> 01:28:52,340
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

1058
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,220
She's...

1059
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,019
She's too upset.

1060
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:00,099
What about?

1061
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:02,178
Hollis's death.

1062
01:29:03,258 --> 01:29:04,378
I tried to keep it from her.

1063
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:08,817
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

1064
01:29:08,937 --> 01:29:11,535
You mean she just found out about it?

1065
01:29:13,576 --> 01:29:16,375
<i>That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1066
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:18,654
What does it look like?

1067
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,853
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1068
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:24,853
You're insane.

1069
01:29:25,013 --> 01:29:27,373
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

1070
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:30,972
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1071
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:37,169
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

1072
01:29:37,329 --> 01:29:39,050
I will if you don't.

1073
01:29:52,607 --> 01:29:53,806
She...

1074
01:29:53,887 --> 01:29:55,085
She...

1075
01:29:55,925 --> 01:29:57,005
She...

1076
01:29:58,285 --> 01:29:59,845
She's my sister.

1077
01:30:06,003 --> 01:30:07,403
Take it easy.

1078
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,883
<i>If she's your sister, she's your sister.</i>

1079
01:30:11,482 --> 01:30:13,201
Why all the secrecy?

1080
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,521
I can't.

1081
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:21,000
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

1082
01:30:24,918 --> 01:30:27,278
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1083
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,877
<i>He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.</i>

1084
01:30:34,037 --> 01:30:37,795
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1085
01:30:40,075 --> 01:30:43,594
I wanted him to be happy.

1086
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,789
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1087
01:31:06,349 --> 01:31:08,548
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1088
01:31:08,668 --> 01:31:11,468
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.

1089
01:31:13,387 --> 01:31:15,267
That's not what I meant.

1090
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:19,586
Yeah.

1091
01:31:20,426 --> 01:31:23,985
<i>Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1092
01:31:25,144 --> 01:31:26,503
Good night.

1093
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:30,368
<i>Gittes?</i>

1094
01:32:31,688 --> 01:32:33,128
<i>- Gittes?
- Yeah?</i>

1095
01:32:33,688 --> 01:32:35,928
<i>Ida Sessions wants to see you.</i>

1096
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:39,566
<i>- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.</i>

1097
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:43,166
<i>- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.</i>

1098
01:32:46,564 --> 01:32:48,364
<i>I tell you what, pal.</i>

1099
01:32:49,444 --> 01:32:53,603
<i>If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.</i>

1100
01:33:19,437 --> 01:33:23,796
<i>848-1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.</i>

1101
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:26,835
<i>She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.</i>

1102
01:36:26,592 --> 01:36:29,072
<i>Find anything interesting, Gittes?</i>

1103
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:35,150
What are you doing around here?

1104
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:36,950
Didn't you call me?

1105
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:40,948
How come you happen to know her?

1106
01:36:41,348 --> 01:36:42,588
I don't.

1107
01:36:45,348 --> 01:36:47,947
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1108
01:36:56,865 --> 01:36:59,664
- Isn't that your phone number?
- Is it?

1109
01:36:59,823 --> 01:37:01,903
I forget. I don't call myself that often.

1110
01:37:02,063 --> 01:37:04,903
<i>Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.</i>

1111
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,583
<i>What happened to your nose, Gittes?</i>

1112
01:37:06,703 --> 01:37:08,741
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

1113
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:14,861
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1114
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:16,740
<i>You understand what I mean, pal?</i>

1115
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:18,700
Loach.

1116
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:39,975
They look familiar?

1117
01:37:41,134 --> 01:37:44,293
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

1118
01:37:44,453 --> 01:37:47,853
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

1119
01:37:48,213 --> 01:37:50,373
<i>You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?</i>

1120
01:37:50,533 --> 01:37:51,852
<i>I don't think about it that much,</i>

1121
01:37:52,012 --> 01:37:54,851
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1122
01:37:55,011 --> 01:37:58,371
<i>- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.</i>

1123
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:59,930
What pictures?

1124
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:03,969
<i>This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.</i>

1125
01:38:04,049 --> 01:38:05,449
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1126
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:08,128
<i>Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,</i>

1127
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,728
she hired you.

1128
01:38:09,808 --> 01:38:12,167
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1129
01:38:12,327 --> 01:38:15,166
<i>- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.</i>

1130
01:38:15,326 --> 01:38:18,526
<i>Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?</i>

1131
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:20,805
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1132
01:38:22,844 --> 01:38:25,604
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1133
01:38:25,764 --> 01:38:27,644
You even took pictures of it.

1134
01:38:27,804 --> 01:38:28,882
<i>It was Evelyn Mulwray,</i>

1135
01:38:28,962 --> 01:38:32,082
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1136
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,842
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1137
01:38:34,922 --> 01:38:36,561
I don't think I need a day or two.

1138
01:38:36,641 --> 01:38:38,681
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1139
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,719
<i>Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.</i>

1140
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,320
That's where I draw the line.

1141
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,520
<i>I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.</i>

1142
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:47,278
<i>We're talking about accessory
after the fact,</i>

1143
01:38:47,358 --> 01:38:48,958
<i>conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.</i>

1144
01:38:49,117 --> 01:38:51,438
<i>What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,</i>

1145
01:38:51,518 --> 01:38:52,798
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1146
01:38:52,918 --> 01:38:55,597
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1147
01:38:56,996 --> 01:38:58,236
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1148
01:38:58,356 --> 01:39:01,915
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1149
01:39:02,035 --> 01:39:02,995
Why is that?

1150
01:39:03,075 --> 01:39:04,954
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1151
01:39:05,074 --> 01:39:07,834
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1152
01:39:08,793 --> 01:39:12,553
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1153
01:39:13,753 --> 01:39:16,792
<i>Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.</i>

1154
01:39:34,228 --> 01:39:35,827
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1155
01:39:35,987 --> 01:39:38,386
They only dump the water at night.

1156
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:42,945
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1157
01:39:43,065 --> 01:39:45,665
<i>- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...</i>

1158
01:39:45,784 --> 01:39:48,024
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1159
01:39:49,464 --> 01:39:50,503
Go on!

1160
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,383
<i>Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,</i>

1161
01:39:52,503 --> 01:39:54,542
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1162
01:39:54,702 --> 01:39:56,143
<i>And he says Gittes knows this,</i>

1163
01:39:56,262 --> 01:40:00,541
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1164
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,220
<i>Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.</i>

1165
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:04,101
What the hell are we waiting for?

1166
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:08,619
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1167
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,618
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1168
01:40:14,738 --> 01:40:17,097
<i>And remember,
I don't have to let you go.</i>

1169
01:40:17,257 --> 01:40:20,137
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1170
01:40:21,296 --> 01:40:22,496
Loach?

1171
01:41:06,285 --> 01:41:08,045
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1172
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:11,244
These her bags?

1173
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:15,683
Is she going on a trip?

1174
01:41:16,443 --> 01:41:19,203
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1175
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:22,562
- Is she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1176
01:41:22,962 --> 01:41:26,840
<i>"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?</i>

1177
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:35,559
<i>Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.</i>

1178
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,878
<i>Oh, yes. Bad for glass.</i>

1179
01:41:38,397 --> 01:41:40,597
Salt water very bad for glass.

1180
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:57,033
Salt water?

1181
01:41:57,713 --> 01:42:00,352
<i>Very, very bad. See?</i>

1182
01:42:08,911 --> 01:42:10,271
What's that?

1183
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:13,350
Right there.

1184
01:42:17,068 --> 01:42:18,188
There.

1185
01:43:13,615 --> 01:43:15,415
- You wait.
- You wait.

1186
01:43:20,773 --> 01:43:22,933
How are you? I've been calling you.

1187
01:43:23,013 --> 01:43:24,372
<i>- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.</i>

1188
01:43:24,492 --> 01:43:26,531
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1189
01:43:27,651 --> 01:43:29,891
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1190
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:33,051
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1191
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:34,810
I want to see her.

1192
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:38,969
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1193
01:43:39,089 --> 01:43:40,649
Going someplace?

1194
01:43:41,609 --> 01:43:44,209
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1195
01:43:47,926 --> 01:43:49,046
Jake?

1196
01:43:58,244 --> 01:44:00,684
J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1197
01:44:01,084 --> 01:44:03,722
<i>But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?</i>

1198
01:44:03,803 --> 01:44:07,722
<i>- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.</i>

1199
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,362
<i>Lieutenant Escobar.</i>

1200
01:44:09,522 --> 01:44:10,522
<i>- Lou?
- Yeah.</i>

1201
01:44:10,642 --> 01:44:13,241
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1202
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,880
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1203
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,560
Why did you do that?

1204
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,758
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1205
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:27,238
<i>Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.</i>

1206
01:44:27,758 --> 01:44:30,596
<i>They're expensive, but you can afford it.</i>

1207
01:44:31,356 --> 01:44:34,435
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1208
01:44:45,914 --> 01:44:48,752
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1209
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:52,431
<i>They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?</i>

1210
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,991
Didn't they?

1211
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:57,990
<i>- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.</i>

1212
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:00,030
It's where he was drowned.

1213
01:45:00,269 --> 01:45:01,229
What?

1214
01:45:01,349 --> 01:45:03,869
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1215
01:45:03,949 --> 01:45:05,349
The coroner's report proves

1216
01:45:05,509 --> 01:45:07,747
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1217
01:45:07,828 --> 01:45:09,147
<i>Just take my word for it, all right?</i>

1218
01:45:09,228 --> 01:45:11,227
<i>Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,</i>

1219
01:45:11,307 --> 01:45:13,226
<i>and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,</i>

1220
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:15,226
because I don't want to lose my license.

1221
01:45:15,305 --> 01:45:19,225
<i>I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...</i>

1222
01:45:19,305 --> 01:45:20,705
Stop it!

1223
01:45:20,865 --> 01:45:22,464
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1224
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,183
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1225
01:45:25,343 --> 01:45:26,303
It was an accident!

1226
01:45:26,463 --> 01:45:28,983
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1227
01:45:29,063 --> 01:45:30,142
<i>You don't have the guts to harm her,</i>

1228
01:45:30,303 --> 01:45:32,062
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1229
01:45:32,142 --> 01:45:33,661
- Yes or no?
- No!

1230
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:37,181
<i>Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,</i>

1231
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:39,261
because you don't have a sister.

1232
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:40,980
I'll tell you...

1233
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:43,299
I'll tell you the truth.

1234
01:45:45,178 --> 01:45:46,939
Good. What's her name?

1235
01:45:48,738 --> 01:45:51,377
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1236
01:45:53,737 --> 01:45:55,417
She's my daughter.

1237
01:45:56,576 --> 01:45:58,496
I said I want the truth!

1238
01:45:59,016 --> 01:46:00,655
She's my sister.

1239
01:46:02,015 --> 01:46:03,614
She's my daughter.

1240
01:46:04,614 --> 01:46:06,494
<i>My sister, my daughter!</i>

1241
01:46:07,334 --> 01:46:09,013
I said I want the truth!

1242
01:46:09,172 --> 01:46:10,452
All of it!

1243
01:46:12,612 --> 01:46:15,252
She's my sister and my daughter!

1244
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:20,890
<i>Kahn, please, go back.</i>

1245
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:23,690
<i>For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!</i>

1246
01:46:31,008 --> 01:46:32,688
My father and I...

1247
01:46:37,086 --> 01:46:38,406
Understand?

1248
01:46:39,286 --> 01:46:41,325
Or is it too tough for you?

1249
01:46:50,123 --> 01:46:51,524
He raped you?

1250
01:47:07,479 --> 01:47:09,119
Then what happened?

1251
01:47:09,399 --> 01:47:10,758
I ran away.

1252
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,437
To Mexico.

1253
01:47:18,716 --> 01:47:21,915
Hollis came and took care of me.

1254
01:47:24,915 --> 01:47:26,635
I couldn't see her.

1255
01:47:27,794 --> 01:47:29,114
I was 15.

1256
01:47:32,673 --> 01:47:34,513
<i>I wanted to, but I...</i>

1257
01:47:35,793 --> 01:47:37,072
I couldn't.

1258
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:40,711
Then...

1259
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:45,390
Now I want to be with her.

1260
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:48,229
I want to take care of her.

1261
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:50,629
Where are you going to take her now?

1262
01:47:50,788 --> 01:47:52,269
Back to Mexico.

1263
01:47:53,548 --> 01:47:58,107
<i>Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.</i>

1264
01:48:00,426 --> 01:48:05,106
<i>Well, how about a plane?</i>

1265
01:48:05,226 --> 01:48:06,304
<i>No, that's worse.</i>

1266
01:48:06,464 --> 01:48:09,664
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1267
01:48:09,784 --> 01:48:13,464
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1268
01:48:14,304 --> 01:48:15,583
All right.

1269
01:48:19,102 --> 01:48:22,302
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1270
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:24,300
How do you know?

1271
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,580
He didn't wear bifocals.

1272
01:48:56,813 --> 01:49:00,412
<i>Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.</i>

1273
01:49:00,652 --> 01:49:01,811
Hello.

1274
01:49:02,732 --> 01:49:03,811
Hello.

1275
01:49:08,651 --> 01:49:12,009
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1276
01:49:14,969 --> 01:49:16,049
Sure.

1277
01:49:36,244 --> 01:49:37,963
<i>J.J. Gittes and Associates.</i>

1278
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:40,762
<i>- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

1279
01:49:41,843 --> 01:49:43,322
<i>- Jake?
- Yeah.</i>

1280
01:49:43,442 --> 01:49:46,881
<i>Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.</i>

1281
01:49:47,001 --> 01:49:48,440
<i>What? What the hell's the matter?
What...</i>

1282
01:49:48,561 --> 01:49:50,440
Relax and I'll tell you.

1283
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,600
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

1284
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:57,039
<i>If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.</i>

1285
01:49:57,879 --> 01:50:00,638
<i>Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?</i>

1286
01:50:00,758 --> 01:50:02,597
I know where it is. Just do it.

1287
01:50:02,717 --> 01:50:04,676
<i>1712 Alameda...</i>

1288
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:33,870
<i>Come on in, Lou.</i>

1289
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:38,789
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1290
01:50:43,907 --> 01:50:47,067
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1291
01:50:47,187 --> 01:50:49,826
<i>- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?</i>

1292
01:50:49,946 --> 01:50:52,665
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1293
01:50:52,785 --> 01:50:54,825
What's the maid's address?

1294
01:50:55,305 --> 01:50:57,105
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1295
01:50:57,225 --> 01:51:00,063
<i>No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.</i>

1296
01:51:00,824 --> 01:51:02,063
What for?

1297
01:51:02,863 --> 01:51:04,863
<i>Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,</i>

1298
01:51:04,982 --> 01:51:08,021
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1299
01:51:08,661 --> 01:51:11,141
<i>Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.</i>

1300
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,260
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1301
01:51:27,977 --> 01:51:31,537
<i>- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?</i>

1302
01:51:32,056 --> 01:51:34,695
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1303
01:51:34,775 --> 01:51:38,174
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1304
01:51:38,255 --> 01:51:42,014
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1305
01:51:42,094 --> 01:51:43,372
And to me.

1306
01:51:47,853 --> 01:51:50,132
<i>You never learn, do you, Jake?</i>

1307
01:51:51,771 --> 01:51:53,171
I guess not.

1308
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:57,490
Okay. But...

1309
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:01,328
I'll give you three minutes.

1310
01:52:01,449 --> 01:52:02,848
Just three minutes.

1311
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:04,608
<i>Gee, thanks, Lou.</i>

1312
01:52:20,084 --> 01:52:21,204
Yes?

1313
01:52:22,364 --> 01:52:23,444
Hello.

1314
01:52:24,403 --> 01:52:27,683
<i>Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.</i>

1315
01:52:27,803 --> 01:52:29,562
<i>Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?</i>

1316
01:52:29,682 --> 01:52:31,562
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1317
01:52:31,682 --> 01:52:32,802
<i>No, thanks.</i>

1318
01:52:32,921 --> 01:52:34,601
How about a glass of wine?

1319
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:37,240
<i>- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.</i>

1320
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,520
<i>No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.</i>

1321
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,479
<i>Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?</i>

1322
01:52:42,599 --> 01:52:43,879
Sure thing.

1323
01:52:47,798 --> 01:52:49,597
<i>- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage.</i>

1324
01:52:49,718 --> 01:52:51,797
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1325
01:52:51,917 --> 01:52:54,396
<i>- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.</i>

1326
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:56,795
<i>Right now, Curly. It can't wait.</i>

1327
01:52:57,195 --> 01:52:59,995
<i>- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl, huh?</i>

1328
01:53:30,748 --> 01:53:33,587
<i>Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?</i>

1329
01:53:33,746 --> 01:53:37,906
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1330
01:53:39,225 --> 01:53:40,865
How much do you owe me?

1331
01:53:40,985 --> 01:53:43,824
<i>Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.</i>

1332
01:53:43,944 --> 01:53:47,504
<i>I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.</i>

1333
01:53:47,624 --> 01:53:49,382
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1334
01:53:49,463 --> 01:53:52,462
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1335
01:53:52,622 --> 01:53:55,942
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1336
01:53:56,022 --> 01:54:00,140
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1337
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,460
Maybe even 100.

1338
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,699
<i>- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.</i>

1339
01:54:07,859 --> 01:54:11,258
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1340
01:54:11,378 --> 01:54:14,217
<i>If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.</i>

1341
01:54:26,774 --> 01:54:28,613
You sure this is okay?

1342
01:54:29,414 --> 01:54:32,693
<i>Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?</i>

1343
01:54:58,926 --> 01:55:02,885
<i>Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.</i>

1344
01:55:03,925 --> 01:55:06,044
<i>You've got her? Where?</i>

1345
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:08,124
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1346
01:55:08,244 --> 01:55:10,283
<i>Of course I do. Where are you?</i>

1347
01:55:10,443 --> 01:55:13,603
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1348
01:55:13,763 --> 01:55:14,923
<i>An hour.</i>

1349
01:55:37,877 --> 01:55:39,676
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>

1350
01:55:39,796 --> 01:55:43,996
<i>Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.</i>

1351
01:55:44,796 --> 01:55:46,715
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1352
01:55:46,835 --> 01:55:48,954
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

1353
01:55:49,635 --> 01:55:51,314
<i>Well, where is she?</i>

1354
01:55:51,874 --> 01:55:53,474
With her mother.

1355
01:55:55,194 --> 01:55:58,192
<i>I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.</i>

1356
01:55:58,312 --> 01:55:59,392
What is it?

1357
01:55:59,512 --> 01:56:02,991
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1358
01:56:03,312 --> 01:56:04,750
I guess I can manage.

1359
01:56:14,148 --> 01:56:15,668
What does it mean?

1360
01:56:15,788 --> 01:56:18,027
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1361
01:56:18,987 --> 01:56:20,348
<i>Right here,</i>

1362
01:56:20,627 --> 01:56:22,067
in that pond.

1363
01:56:22,746 --> 01:56:24,306
You drowned him.

1364
01:56:25,546 --> 01:56:27,225
And you left these.

1365
01:56:29,385 --> 01:56:33,304
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1366
01:56:36,743 --> 01:56:40,742
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1367
01:56:41,742 --> 01:56:43,662
You know what he used to say?

1368
01:56:43,782 --> 01:56:45,261
I haven't the faintest idea.

1369
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:47,341
"That's where life begins."

1370
01:56:47,461 --> 01:56:49,261
<i>Sloughs, tide pools.</i>

1371
01:56:50,819 --> 01:56:51,819
<i>When we first come out here,</i>

1372
01:56:51,939 --> 01:56:54,579
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1373
01:56:54,699 --> 01:56:58,459
<i>and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there</i>

1374
01:56:58,617 --> 01:57:01,497
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1375
01:57:01,657 --> 01:57:05,137
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1376
01:57:05,216 --> 01:57:06,937
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1377
01:57:07,097 --> 01:57:08,336
It's what I am doing.

1378
01:57:08,695 --> 01:57:10,255
<i>When the bond issue passes Tuesday,</i>

1379
01:57:10,414 --> 01:57:12,535
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1380
01:57:12,695 --> 01:57:14,055
I'm doing it.

1381
01:57:14,134 --> 01:57:15,654
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1382
01:57:15,735 --> 01:57:18,893
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1383
01:57:18,973 --> 01:57:20,852
<i>Oh, that's all taken care of.</i>

1384
01:57:21,012 --> 01:57:24,852
<i>See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L. A.,</i>

1385
01:57:25,012 --> 01:57:27,211
or you bring L.A. to the water.

1386
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:28,851
How are you gonna do that?

1387
01:57:29,011 --> 01:57:32,650
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1388
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:36,368
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1389
01:57:36,529 --> 01:57:37,568
How much do you want?

1390
01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:40,048
<i>No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?</i>

1391
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:43,047
<i>- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?</i>

1392
01:57:43,128 --> 01:57:44,166
How much better can you eat?

1393
01:57:44,326 --> 01:57:46,406
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1394
01:57:46,566 --> 01:57:48,326
<i>The future, Mr. Gitts!</i>

1395
01:57:48,806 --> 01:57:50,126
The future!

1396
01:57:50,926 --> 01:57:52,684
<i>Now, where's the girl?</i>

1397
01:57:52,804 --> 01:57:55,004
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1398
01:57:55,084 --> 01:57:58,124
<i>As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.</i>

1399
01:57:58,283 --> 01:58:00,523
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1400
01:58:01,043 --> 01:58:02,763
I don't blame myself.

1401
01:58:04,042 --> 01:58:07,201
<i>See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact</i>

1402
01:58:07,282 --> 01:58:09,762
<i>that at the right time and the right place,</i>

1403
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:11,960
they're capable of anything.

1404
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:17,160
<i>Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?</i>

1405
01:58:24,077 --> 01:58:26,277
<i>It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.</i>

1406
01:58:28,197 --> 01:58:30,115
It's really not worth it.

1407
01:58:36,515 --> 01:58:37,435
Where's the girl?

1408
01:59:30,342 --> 01:59:33,300
<i>You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?</i>

1409
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:36,820
<i>Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...</i>

1410
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:40,060
<i>You're under arrest, Jake.</i>

1411
01:59:42,138 --> 01:59:43,178
Good news.

1412
01:59:43,258 --> 01:59:46,778
<i>Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.</i>

1413
01:59:46,898 --> 01:59:49,097
<i>I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.</i>

1414
01:59:49,178 --> 01:59:52,376
<i>This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.</i>

1415
01:59:52,496 --> 01:59:54,576
<i>He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.</i>

1416
01:59:54,656 --> 01:59:55,696
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1417
01:59:55,776 --> 01:59:56,816
That's all I need.

1418
01:59:56,895 --> 01:59:58,936
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1419
01:59:59,094 --> 02:00:01,134
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1420
02:00:01,214 --> 02:00:03,374
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1421
02:00:03,454 --> 02:00:07,053
<i>Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.</i>

1422
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:10,051
<i>- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!</i>

1423
02:00:10,172 --> 02:00:11,731
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1424
02:00:11,892 --> 02:00:12,811
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1425
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:13,972
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1426
02:00:14,132 --> 02:00:16,771
<i>Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.</i>

1427
02:00:17,690 --> 02:00:20,450
<i>Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.</i>

1428
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:21,889
Katherine!

1429
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,210
Katherine.

1430
02:00:23,289 --> 02:00:27,968
<i>- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.</i>

1431
02:00:28,088 --> 02:00:29,648
<i>- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.</i>

1432
02:00:29,768 --> 02:00:31,367
<i>Katherine, get in the car.</i>

1433
02:00:31,447 --> 02:00:32,767
<i>- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...</i>

1434
02:00:32,887 --> 02:00:35,886
<i>No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.</i>

1435
02:00:36,726 --> 02:00:38,605
Get away from her. Get away!

1436
02:00:38,765 --> 02:00:43,365
<i>Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.</i>

1437
02:00:43,445 --> 02:00:45,763
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1438
02:00:45,843 --> 02:00:47,083
Evelyn!

1439
02:00:48,243 --> 02:00:51,003
How many years have I got?

1440
02:00:51,602 --> 02:00:53,083
<i>She's mine, too.</i>

1441
02:00:53,202 --> 02:00:55,481
She's never going to know that!

1442
02:00:57,601 --> 02:01:01,640
<i>Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.</i>

1443
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,359
<i>Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!</i>

1444
02:01:04,519 --> 02:01:06,239
He owns the police!

1445
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:08,518
Get away from her.

1446
02:01:08,638 --> 02:01:11,677
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

1447
02:01:12,837 --> 02:01:14,837
<i>Katherine, close the door.</i>

1448
02:01:15,677 --> 02:01:16,756
Halt!

1449
02:01:55,628 --> 02:01:56,987
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1450
02:01:57,066 --> 02:01:59,666
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1451
02:01:59,786 --> 02:02:01,666
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

1452
02:02:01,786 --> 02:02:03,266
- Lord.
- No!

1453
02:02:06,743 --> 02:02:07,904
Lord.

1454
02:02:08,384 --> 02:02:09,663
Lord.

1455
02:02:11,224 --> 02:02:12,624
No! No!

1456
02:02:14,342 --> 02:02:17,942
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1457
02:02:30,019 --> 02:02:32,537
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

1458
02:02:35,737 --> 02:02:37,137
What's that?

1459
02:02:41,495 --> 02:02:44,255
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1460
02:02:45,855 --> 02:02:47,255
Take him home.

1461
02:02:50,773 --> 02:02:52,213
Take him home!

1462
02:02:52,534 --> 02:02:54,933
Just get him the hell out of here!

1463
02:02:55,053 --> 02:02:56,493
<i>Come on, Jake.</i>

1464
02:02:57,532 --> 02:02:58,932
<i>Go home, Jake.</i>

1465
02:02:59,932 --> 02:03:01,891
I'm doing you a favor.

1466
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:04,851
<i>Come on, Jake.</i>

1467
02:03:07,890 --> 02:03:10,169
<i>Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.</i>

1468
02:03:24,446 --> 02:03:28,084
<i>All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!</i>

1469
02:03:30,044 --> 02:03:31,684
On the sidewalk!

1470
02:03:33,724 --> 02:03:35,404
Get off the street!

1471
02:03:37,682 --> 02:03:39,362
Get off the street!

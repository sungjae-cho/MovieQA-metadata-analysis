1
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,702
He's clean.

2
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:48,829
So...

3
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:51,544
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,926
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,530
4:35.

6
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,744
You misunderstood.

7
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:07,830
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,833
There was a time?

9
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,550
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,008
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,256
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,228
She's 70.

13
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,352
If she's a day.

14
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,982
But there was a time.

15
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,610
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,737
- Listen, Mr Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,328
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,329
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,038
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:49,752
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,884
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:54,131
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:57,011
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,140
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,727
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,858
No small matter.

27
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,781
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,993
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,827
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,959
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,879
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,724
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,152
<i>It's what they called back then</i>
<i>a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,369
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing,</i>
<i>so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:52,490
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobbler from Antwerp</i>
<i>known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,164
WOMA N: O<i>h, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:57,257 --> 00:07:00,461
<i>The same could be said</i>
<i>for Doc'sjelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,127
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,679
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:19,157
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria</i>
<i>was too muchjelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,283
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,613
- <i>What do you want?</i>
WOMA N: <i>Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,414
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:31,749
GLORIA: <i>Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,</i>
<i>mayb e then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,880
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,541
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,221
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,969
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,679
SMITH: <i>Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,</i>
<i>but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,814
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,937
ABE: <i>Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,907
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:59,035
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:01,448
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,329
SMITH:
<i>And then there was thisjoker who had ears...</i>

56
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,796
ABE: <i>Let's get back.</i>

57
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,207
SMITH: <i>... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,341
Max, who's your favourite uncle?

59
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,671
OK, who's your second favourite uncle?

60
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,592
Just pay attention.

61
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,511
I got something here.

62
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:21,387
SMITH: <i>And before you know it,</i>
<i>folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

63
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:24,020
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,856
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in</i>
<i>your ear and tells you you got a sure thing,</i>

65
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,487
<i>and what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,487
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

67
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,740
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,666
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,170
<i>Tired of waking up and finding</i>
<i>that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,538
We're leaving.

71
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:48,300
<i>But mostly,</i>
<i>Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,346
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,924
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,392
- (Giggles)
- You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,189
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,516
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,855
Love you.

78
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,484
TANNOY: <i>They're off.</i>

79
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,751
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,246
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:18,339
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,176
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,591
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,055
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:31,430
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,814
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,100
Mm -hm.

88
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:37,855
You're good.

89
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,857
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,322
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,036
Why?

92
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:47,123
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,915
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,329
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:55,839
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,967
It's economically viable.

97
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,380
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,723
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,766
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,604
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,524
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,944
But until then...

103
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,027
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:22,496
Hey.

105
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,538
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,456
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,339
I love you, kid.

108
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,085
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,842
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,970
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:38,097
Start counting.

112
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,477
TANNOY:
<i>The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:57,699
- Come on, come on.
TANNOY: <i>The field is making towards</i>

114
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,371
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved</i>
<i>into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,920
<i>- Number Two has the lead...</i>
- (Cheering)

116
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,633
Come on.

117
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,635
<i>Number</i> O<i>ne is against the rail.</i>

118
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:13,637
<i>And Number Seven is beginning</i>
<i>to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:14,842
Yes!

120
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:16,811
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

121
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,015
- Let's go!
- (Cheering intensifies)

122
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:25,857
<i>... to challenge, goes clear</i>
<i>and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,943
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,242
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,279
Yes!

126
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:34,540
Oh!

127
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,044
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:44,085
<i>Number</i> O<i>ne comes home</i>
<i>and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,596
SMITH: <i>Max woke up to find his dreams</i>
<i>hadjust been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,724
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,092
20 large.

132
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,604
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,271
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,189
And lay it off.

135
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,989
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,903
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:06,664
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,787
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,796
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:17,714
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,045
The juice is ten.

142
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,552
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,684
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:31,473
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,195
Yeah.

146
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,576
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

147
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:43,289
<i>if you lose...</i>

148
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:47,330
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:52,547
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,734
Henry!

151
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,019
Henry!

152
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,488
Henry!

153
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,624
Henry!

154
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:23,376
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,503
No. Henry!

156
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,961
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,304
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,387
Urgh!

159
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,979
Where am I?

160
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:53,571
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,335
He already has.

162
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,757
Please.

163
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,931
I have a family.

164
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,972
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,773
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,602
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,316
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,531
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,833
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,496
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,475
Fuck.

172
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,981
Shit.

173
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,566
Jesus.

174
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,650
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,818
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,740
New outfit in town.

177
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,118
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,629
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,341
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:19,973
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,099
and came in third.

182
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,227
Now that's a story.

183
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,482
This...

184
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,609
This is something else.

185
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,737
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:34,200
No.

187
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,324
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,453
The catalyst.

189
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,828
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:47,296
<i>They lookright...</i>

191
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,542
And you...

192
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:51,676
go left.

193
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,895
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:04,772
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,363
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:10,436
<i>- He's down!</i>
<i>- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,350
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:09,297
I'm coming!

199
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,137
Coming.

200
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,100
It took you long enough.

201
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,725
You're not Nick.

202
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:24,224
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,359
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:31,864
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:35,120
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,576
So it's a good thing?

207
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,872
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:45,381
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,212
Who are you?

210
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:48,799
I'm Slevin.

211
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,966
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:54,093
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,227
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,474
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,228
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,776
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,486
<i>First... I lost myjob.</i>

218
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,912
<i>Then I came home to find</i>
<i>my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,665
<i>due to a hyb rid breed</i>
<i>of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,793
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,005
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,770
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,606
Slevin.

224
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,606
It was an accident.

225
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,235
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,080
MA N: <i>Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:51,122
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,583
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York</i>
<i>and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:58,460
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first handjob</i>
<i>on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,426
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:05,218
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,</i>
<i>that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,983
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?</i>
- Yeah.

233
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,530
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:22,663
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,036
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,169
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:30,831
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:35,388
<i>Why don't youjust go ahead and give me</i>
<i>your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,016
Am I being mugged?

240
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,015
Man!

241
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:42,061
And so here I am.

242
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,481
You said three.

243
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,894
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:51,856
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,778
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,828
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,741
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,669
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:04,087
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,297
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:09,505
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,507
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,435
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,560
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,272
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,185
Where's Nick?

257
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,480
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,529
- How did you get in?
<i>- Door was open.</i>

259
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,775
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,111
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,290
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,415
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,828
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,330
- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a <i>cup</i> of sugar.

265
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,584
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,386
- Touché.
- (Phone rings)

267
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:47,010
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:48,847
Hello?

269
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:51,765
Hello?

270
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,898
They hung up.

271
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:59,355
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,488
No, except for that.

273
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,993
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:05,870
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:07,829
What are you doing?

276
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,826
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:12,244
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:15,624
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:18,043
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,129
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:23,674
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:26,094
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:28,145
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:29,643
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,773
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:35,729
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,235
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:40,694
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:44,122
- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything <i>didn't.</i>

290
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:47,709
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:49,789
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:53,750
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:57,296
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:58,221
OK.

295
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:03,477
I totally forgot...

296
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:07,149
Yeah.

297
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,025
Sorry.

298
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:11,605
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,529
<i>I never gave it much thought</i>
<i>until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,457
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,079
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:23,328
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:27,420
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,799
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,086
What, my penis?

306
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,719
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,431
<i>Neighbours borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,478
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:40,353
Yeah.

310
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:43,360
<i>That's</i> Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.

311
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,070
No.

312
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,196
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:58,999
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,667
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,595
Whew!

316
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:17,857
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:22,022
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who...?

318
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:24,026
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:26,325
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:29,448
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:31,539
Go.

322
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:35,630
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,755
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,299
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:42,345
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:44,639
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:46,766
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,427
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,893
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,442
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:57,570
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,826
Who are you?

333
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:02,287
I'm Slevin.

334
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:05,784
You got some ID?

335
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:11,716
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,378
Look, look.

337
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,296
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:17,427
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,564
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,146
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,483
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,534
Motherfucker!

343
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:39,575
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,706
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:43,418
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:46,126
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:47,793
Now he told me that today.

348
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:50,340
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,715
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,555
Today.

351
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:57,268
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:59,097
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:02,440
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,356
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,737
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:11,317
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:14,366
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:16,201
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:21,086
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:22,205
No.

361
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,340
Orders.

362
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:26,753
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,136
Orders is <i>orders.</i>

364
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:34,930
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:43,736
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,574
My nose is already broken.

367
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,418
- Can I just say one more thing?
- <i>What?</i>

368
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:58,079
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:00,797
Uh... yeah.

370
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:05,016
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:37,508
SLEVIN: Ah, Jeez. (Sighs)

372
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:52,481
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,378
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,385
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,159
Well, listen.

376
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,037
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,294
- I'm not Nick Fisher.
<i>- Mr Fisher?</i>

378
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:46,548
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr Fisher?

379
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,678
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,889
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,805
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:57,646
gave milk...

383
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,938
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:06,030
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,360
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,997
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,583
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers</i>
<i>made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:22,383
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:28,558
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:30,020
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:31,647
I'm The Boss.

392
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,523
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,356
Why?

394
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:37,731
Do we look alike?

395
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:43,077
So, Mr Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:45,202
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,665
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:48,789
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:52,000
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:55,174
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,751
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,922
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,055
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:05,429
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:07,598
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:11,024
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,196
No, do you want to give <i>me</i> $96,000?

408
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:15,693
No, should I?

409
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,777
I don't know, should you?

410
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,162
I don't know, should I?

411
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:29,208
Long story short.

412
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:34,263
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:42,352
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,896
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,985
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:51,241
You owe me.

417
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,789
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

418
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:06,842
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:10,051
Slim?

420
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,469
No use.

421
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,890
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:21,023
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:22,391
Why?

424
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:28,867
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,364
Oh, OK.

426
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,955
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:38,287
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,213
Hm.

429
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:45,929
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favour?

430
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:51,434
Well, that depends on the favour.

431
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,603
THE BOSS: <i>That was my son.</i>

432
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,736
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,657
Yeah.

434
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:04,783
That's because he's dead.

435
00:32:05,872 --> 00:32:07,865
Murdered.

436
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,750
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:17,750
Sent from an <i>is</i> to a <i>was</i>
before he'd had his breakfast.

438
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,673
Bummer.

439
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,312
Lex Talionis.

440
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,772
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,503
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:53,423
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:55,971
Whose son?

444
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:57,764
The Rabbi's.

445
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,890
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,353
Because...

447
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,852
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,983
Who's his son?

449
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,740
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,900
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,368
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,790
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:25,295
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,422
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,550
Come on.

456
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:35,513
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,845
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:39,766
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,649
So where do I fit in?

460
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,397
You?

461
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,905
You're the trigger man.

462
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:50,870
Me?

463
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,781
You.

464
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:03,885
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,672
Of course there are.

466
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:07,761
Yes.

467
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,890
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:15,107
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:21,397
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,033
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,870
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:28,528
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:32,666
Slim could use the company.

474
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:34,628
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,873
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,550
Is there anything else?

477
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:45,013
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichéd as,

478
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:47,308
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:49,722
I think you just did.

480
00:34:49,815 --> 00:34:51,358
I guess I did.

481
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,110
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:05,746
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:08,837
Don't worry.

484
00:35:09,923 --> 00:35:11,962
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,176
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,893
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,731
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:03,727
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,444
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,774
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,197
Where are we going?

492
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:14,241
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:16,372
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,499
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:23,048
<i>She can access the computer and we can</i>
<i>find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:24,842
What is it?

497
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:26,968
- I know this guy.
<i>- Who?</i>

498
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,514
This guy.

499
00:36:29,975 --> 00:36:32,015
You know that guy?

500
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,096
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:35,600
He was dead.

502
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,192
You met a dead guy?

503
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:42,319
Yeah.

504
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,447
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,326
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,042
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:57,173
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:02,086
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:09,555
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:12,103
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (Phone rings)

511
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:14,944
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,199
Hm.

513
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:34,666
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:38,968
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:44,726
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:49,434
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:50,939
Let's go.

518
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:52,857
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,782
Aaahh... better...

520
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,499
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:02,077
You think?

522
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:10,838
What is it?

523
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,383
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,514
- Do you always speak for him?
- <i>Yes.</i>

525
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:20,431
Hm.

526
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:22,563
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,646
Not quite.

528
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,775
Well, what, then?

529
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:28,436
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,572
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,575
- Hey, are we going to the...?
- No.

532
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:40,076
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,547
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:47,963
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:53,725
<i>And now neither man leaves</i>
<i>his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:56,268
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:07,574
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:12,496
Penthouse.

539
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:22,008
Gentle piano music

540
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,443
You must be Mr Fisher.

541
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,077
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

542
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:51,921
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

543
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,630
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

544
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:01,133
For starters, I'm unlucky.

545
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:05,223
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr Fisher.

546
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:08,184
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

547
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,858
Unfortunately, the lucky never realise
they are lucky until it's too late.

548
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:15,565
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

549
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:21,034
but it took today for you to realise it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

550
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,535
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

551
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,122
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

552
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,624
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

553
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,712
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

554
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:34,884
I mean, what is that?

555
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:38,177
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

556
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,555
<i>I mean, how do youjustify being a rabbi</i>

557
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,806
and a gangster?

558
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,524
I don't.

559
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

560
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,862
when I am what could've been or not have been.

561
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:58,740
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

562
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,458
Consider, Mr Fisher...

563
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,081
...there are two men sitting here before you,

564
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:07,176
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

565
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:11,348
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

566
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:14,138
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

567
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:16,980
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

568
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:21,359
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

569
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,872
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

570
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,377
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

571
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,383
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

572
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,876
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

573
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:47,257
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

574
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:52,686
You have 48 hours to get my money.

575
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:56,143
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

576
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,821
Wait, I just have one question.

577
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:07,495
I wasn't frisked.

578
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,134
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

579
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,597
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

580
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:27,686
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

581
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,848
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

582
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:32,983
- Kosher.
- (Exhales)

583
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:37,154
Acceptable.

584
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,555
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

585
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,895
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

586
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,021
Now I can expect that when?

587
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:11,862
- Very soon.
- Good.

588
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,655
So, tell me. The kid...

589
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,536
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

590
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:21,951
The kid and I have unfinished business.

591
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,726
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

592
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,053
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

593
00:43:38,606 --> 00:43:42,225
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

594
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,063
your own, someone else's.

595
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:47,240
That being said, he wasn't lying.

596
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:49,862
That's not Nick Fisher.

597
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:52,117
I know.

598
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:07,424
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

599
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:10,470
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

600
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:14,346
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

601
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,309
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

602
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:20,693
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

603
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,818
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

604
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,825
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr Smith. In the flesh.

605
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:32,827
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

606
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,044
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

607
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,499
<i>But I have no idea who he is</i>
<i>but I thinkyou might,</i>

608
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,928
<i>so I take a picture using my cellphone</i>
<i>which I thought was a total waste</i>

609
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,553
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

610
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:49,804
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

611
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:52,850
This is Smith. Recognise him?

612
00:44:52,944 --> 00:44:53,726
No.

613
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:59,364
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

614
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:03,320
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

615
00:45:03,415 --> 00:45:05,242
So I followed him.

616
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:14,086
<i>He went down</i>
<i>into an apartment building downtown.</i>

617
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,336
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

618
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,807
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

619
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:22,721
- Smith?
- You.

620
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:28,100
Me?

621
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:34,200
<i>You out of the same building</i>
<i>with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

622
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,112
Friends of yours?

623
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:39,623
Not exactly.

624
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,950
I think it's time you told me that story.

625
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,588
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

626
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:51,092
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

627
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,347
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

628
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:05,188
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

629
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,198
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

630
00:46:08,283 --> 00:46:14,120
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

631
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,165
I don't know who Mr Smith is.

632
00:46:18,086 --> 00:46:21,041
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

633
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,623
Ironic.

634
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:25,385
I know, I don't even gamble.

635
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,637
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

636
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:34,479
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

637
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:38,432
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

638
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:42,822
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

639
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,197
I'd say you're fucked.

640
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:47,278
Fucked.

641
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,082
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

642
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,459
I have Ataraxia.

643
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:56,746
Ataraxia?

644
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:03,127
It's a condition characterised by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

645
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,801
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

646
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,935
Oh, what are you gonna say?

647
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:14,021
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

648
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:16,685
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

649
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:20,281
Yes.

650
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:23,284
I knew you had sense.

651
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:27,786
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

652
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:29,704
Sometimes.

653
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,252
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

654
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:37,342
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

655
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:40,713
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

656
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:43,217
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

657
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:47,810
He doesn't see it.

658
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:50,571
Wouldn't matter if he did.

659
00:47:50,654 --> 00:47:52,149
Elvis lets me win.

660
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:55,489
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

661
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:59,240
Wait a minute. You know this game?

662
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:08,375
THE BOSS: You got three days.

663
00:48:10,177 --> 00:48:11,969
I was thinking it would take me a week.

664
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:14,546
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

665
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:18,853
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

666
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,016
You win this game, you got your week.

667
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:28,279
Hm.

668
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,754
THE BOSS: So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

669
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,008
Was gonna play it by ear.

670
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:48,261
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

671
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:51,884
And, by the way, he has shadows.

672
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,558
Shadows?

673
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:03,398
Bodyguards.

674
00:49:04,157 --> 00:49:06,197
With him all the time.

675
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,953
Military.

676
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:17,085
Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

677
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:22,595
THE BOSS: They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

678
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:24,719
Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

679
00:49:27,352 --> 00:49:28,550
That doesn't sound good.

680
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:32,013
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

681
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:35,231
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

682
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,443
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

683
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:41,692
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

684
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:43,196
What's this?

685
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:45,486
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

686
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,329
- Get down!
- (Silenced gunshot)

687
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:54,337
<i>Response time's gonna be</i>
<i>three to five seconds.</i>

688
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,382
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

689
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,510
Where?

690
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:02,434
- Where?
- The apartment.

691
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:07,560
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

692
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:10,689
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

693
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:20,321
Then what?

694
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:22,656
He does the kid, I do him.

695
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:26,158
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

696
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:30,419
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

697
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:35,504
Take the clothes off- make it look like a,

698
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,309
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

699
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:43,475
And that's all there is to it.

700
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,768
Is that all there is to it?

701
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:49,354
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

702
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,240
Peww!

703
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:04,379
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

704
00:51:06,093 --> 00:51:08,335
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

705
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,139
Some have grown pretty dead.

706
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:19,191
You're a conundrum, you.

707
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:26,155
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

708
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:28,863
You can only kill me once.

709
00:51:36,879 --> 00:51:37,662
Checkmate.

710
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,220
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

711
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:51,430
Cat.

712
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,350
Mouse.

713
00:51:56,027 --> 00:51:58,067
You've got three days.

714
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:04,074
Excuse me.

715
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,519
Who the fuck is this guy?

716
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:30,975
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in</i>
<i>very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

717
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:35,945
because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

718
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:40,078
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

719
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:42,239
Yes, boss.

720
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:45,748
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

721
00:52:45,836 --> 00:52:48,837
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

722
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:52,423
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

723
00:53:02,564 --> 00:53:04,058
- What have you got?
- Get this.

724
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:06,641
The Kat's in town.

725
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:07,934
Goodkat?

726
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:10,699
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

727
00:53:10,782 --> 00:53:14,080
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

728
00:53:14,093 --> 00:53:16,418
Um... who's er... who's Goodkat?

729
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:19,050
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

730
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:22,175
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

731
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,805
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

732
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:27,895
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

733
00:53:27,981 --> 00:53:30,020
<i>Just what we need.</i>

734
00:53:30,108 --> 00:53:31,270
All right.

735
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:37,228
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

736
00:53:45,247 --> 00:53:48,331
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

737
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:50,954
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

738
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:52,835
Well, listen.

739
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,829
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

740
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:57,709
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

741
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,041
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

742
00:54:00,135 --> 00:54:01,879
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

743
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:06,971
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

744
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:09,517
My guess was a fastball.

745
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:14,645
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humour.

746
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:16,523
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

747
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:19,859
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

748
00:54:19,945 --> 00:54:22,899
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

749
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,899
Between you and me...

750
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:29,567
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

751
00:54:30,955 --> 00:54:33,624
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

752
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,665
These two were poisoned.

753
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:38,207
Something exotic.

754
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:40,667
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

755
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:42,583
<i>Will do.</i>

756
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,124
Prick.

757
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:50,966
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

758
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:57,643
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

759
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:02,974
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

760
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:04,895
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

761
00:55:04,986 --> 00:55:07,560
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

762
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:11,320
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and licence

763
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,236
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

764
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:15,154
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

765
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:18,828
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

766
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:22,616
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

767
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:25,498
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

768
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:26,964
Hm.

769
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:29,456
- You should run.
- I can't.

770
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:32,338
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

771
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:35,429
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

772
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:37,554
This isn't the first time this has happened.

773
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:41,140
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

774
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:44,928
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

775
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:47,016
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

776
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:51,984
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

777
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:54,360
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

778
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:58,362
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

779
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,696
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:07,498
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

781
00:56:07,586 --> 00:56:11,250
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

782
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:16,712
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

783
00:56:16,802 --> 00:56:18,842
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:20,471
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

785
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:23,592
OK. Um... No. Bye.

786
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:30,849
Hm...

787
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:33,513
Weird.

788
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,202
What?

789
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:49,498
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

790
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:53,662
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

791
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,499
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

792
00:56:58,591 --> 00:57:02,173
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

793
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:05,464
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

794
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:10,894
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

795
00:57:14,439 --> 00:57:15,719
So, come here often?

796
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:21,643
No. But I heard about someone who does.

797
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:25,940
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

798
00:57:26,032 --> 00:57:28,072
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:29,650
Where?

800
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:38,035
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

801
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:41,336
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

802
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,331
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

803
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,123
Talking.

804
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:48,344
You're gonna go over and say, "I'm Slevin,
some bad dudes think I am someone I am not.

805
00:57:48,428 --> 00:57:51,345
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

806
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:53,672
and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

807
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:55,889
- I can't do that.
- You think?

808
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:58,598
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

809
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,522
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

810
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:05,474
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

811
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,145
Beards. Right behind him.

812
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:11,153
<i>See 'em?</i>

813
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,074
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

814
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,953
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

815
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:20,411
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

816
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,331
What do you think?

817
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:26,494
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

818
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,212
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

819
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,338
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

820
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:35,839
<i>Bodyguards nearb y.</i>

821
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,974
O<i>ur boy's not far away</i>
<i>but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

822
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,759
- <i>Did Murph get a beat on him yet?</i>
<i>- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

823
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,519
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even</i>
<i>bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

824
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,687
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

825
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,858
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

826
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:24,963
- Marty, the door's locked.
- <i>Relax.</i>

827
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:27,810
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

828
00:59:31,856 --> 00:59:33,896
I got it next.

829
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:38,936
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

830
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,811
And?

831
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:41,981
I told him I thought we should get together.

832
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:43,485
- You didn't?
- I did.

833
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:45,484
And?

834
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:48,531
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

835
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:52,666
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

836
00:59:53,876 --> 00:59:56,165
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

837
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:58,460
- A what?
- The cops.

838
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:01,833
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

839
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:06,168
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

840
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:17,477
You and me need to talk.

841
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:23,771
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

842
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,487
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

843
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,287
I'm not gay.

844
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:39,536
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

845
01:00:40,544 --> 01:00:42,371
I've been watching you.

846
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:47,255
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

847
01:00:47,342 --> 01:00:50,094
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

848
01:00:50,178 --> 01:00:52,930
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

849
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:55,968
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

850
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:58,098
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

851
01:00:58,185 --> 01:01:00,142
And you... are not him.

852
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:03,645
So... who the fuck are you?

853
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:10,275
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

854
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:13,440
May I leave now?

855
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:15,276
- Come here.
- What?

856
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:20,528
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

857
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:27,457
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

858
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:29,503
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

859
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:30,371
Kananga?

860
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,422
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

861
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,550
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

862
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:41,054
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

863
01:01:41,976 --> 01:01:45,510
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

864
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,228
Who?

865
01:01:47,314 --> 01:01:50,018
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

866
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:53,559
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

867
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:58,030
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

868
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:17,754
So...

869
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:22,550
See you later.

870
01:02:49,413 --> 01:02:52,497
SLEVIN: Ah, that was incredible!
- (Giggles) You...

871
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:58,919
- I just realised something.
- What's that?

872
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:02,124
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realising that now?

873
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:06,759
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

874
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:11,139
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

875
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:15,387
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

876
01:03:15,478 --> 01:03:16,557
I naturally assumed...

877
01:03:16,646 --> 01:03:19,849
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

878
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:30,024
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

879
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:35,074
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

880
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,364
Well, on that we agree.

881
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,038
Same time on three.

882
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:43,835
- One...
- Two...

883
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,748
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

884
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,211
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

885
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,842
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

886
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,966
The only James Bond is...

887
01:03:52,053 --> 01:03:54,176
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

888
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,722
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

889
01:04:32,924 --> 01:04:34,964
Why are you going?

890
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:37,716
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

891
01:04:38,763 --> 01:04:40,590
OK.

892
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:46,057
Hurry back to me.

893
01:04:46,854 --> 01:04:48,264
WENDY RENE: After Laughter

894
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:55,602
When you're in love, you're happy

895
01:04:56,196 --> 01:05:00,442
Oh, and when you're in her arms

896
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:05,775
You gain

897
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:10,202
After...

898
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:12,331
Hey! Police.

899
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:14,458
Aw, come on, man.

900
01:05:14,546 --> 01:05:17,119
I already talked to your buddy.

901
01:05:17,965 --> 01:05:21,915
After...
After your laughter

902
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:28,220
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

903
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:30,550
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

904
01:05:30,644 --> 01:05:33,763
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

905
01:05:33,855 --> 01:05:37,520
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

906
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:39,186
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

907
01:05:39,277 --> 01:05:41,981
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

908
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,482
Oh.

909
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:50,869
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

910
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:53,160
- What about me?
- Who are you?

911
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:54,825
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

912
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:57,489
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

913
01:05:57,585 --> 01:05:59,625
You think I'm tall enough?

914
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:13,803
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

915
01:06:13,892 --> 01:06:16,217
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

916
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:19,146
- Kelevra.
- <i>Look, kid,</i>

917
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:22,350
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

918
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:25,015
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

919
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,019
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

920
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:30,188
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favours.

921
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:33,572
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

922
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,456
Take a walk.

923
01:06:43,669 --> 01:06:46,586
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

924
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:38,341
When you're in love

925
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:42,472
You're happy

926
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:47,178
Oh, and when you're in her arms

927
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:52,263
You gain

928
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:59,561
After
This doesn't matter...

929
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:01,066
I have to go to work.

930
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:04,197
Hey.

931
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:06,866
After
After...

932
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:34,227
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

933
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,685
I've got at least... Jesus.

934
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:41,189
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

935
01:09:59,682 --> 01:10:01,509
You're early.

936
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,517
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

937
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:22,195
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

938
01:10:22,286 --> 01:10:24,113
I wasn't expecting you for...

939
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,993
<i>You look good.</i>

940
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:32,242
<i>- You want some wine?</i>
- No.

941
01:10:32,337 --> 01:10:34,377
Is something the matter?

942
01:10:38,176 --> 01:10:39,800
Somebody's trying to kill you.

943
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,673
Who?

944
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:47,757
Me.

945
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:44,065
- That was close.
- Yeah.

946
01:13:02,809 --> 01:13:03,888
Close.

947
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,509
THE BOSS: <i>I hired you to do ajob.</i>

948
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:33,221
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

949
01:14:35,227 --> 01:14:40,434
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

950
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:45,691
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

951
01:14:45,778 --> 01:14:48,103
beginning to look very much

952
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,236
like a job.

953
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:01,246
All right. Fuck it.

954
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:05,917
If the Rabbi wants a war...

955
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:09,412
...I'll give him a war.

956
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:18,550
Saul.

957
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:23,760
- Saul.

958
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:26,519
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

959
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,647
Oh.

960
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,774
I thought you were Saul.

961
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:35,814
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

962
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,948
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

963
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,493
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

964
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,288
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

965
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,498
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

966
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,045
But names, even made-up ones...

967
01:15:57,594 --> 01:15:59,919
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

968
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:03,390
Now...

969
01:16:03,474 --> 01:16:05,716
the woman in the picture with Grant,

970
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,265
- <i>her name was er...</i>
- Eva Marie Saint.

971
01:16:08,354 --> 01:16:11,224
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

972
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:14,518
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

973
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,563
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

974
01:16:17,654 --> 01:16:20,571
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

975
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:24,191
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

976
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:29,450
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

977
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,745
Is that my money?

978
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:37,248
This is everything I owe you.

979
01:17:11,912 --> 01:17:15,862
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

980
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:17,831
I know.

981
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:19,791
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

982
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:21,076
Saul!

983
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:23,840
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

984
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,132
Saul's dead.

985
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:34,212
<i>They're all dead.</i>

986
01:17:58,705 --> 01:18:00,745
Oh, I've been in this room before.

987
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:05,332
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

988
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:08,668
Somehow...

989
01:18:09,548 --> 01:18:10,959
Somehow it seems different.

990
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,833
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

991
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:19,304
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

992
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,767
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

993
01:18:23,853 --> 01:18:28,645
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

994
01:18:28,733 --> 01:18:30,772
20 years...

995
01:18:32,778 --> 01:18:36,194
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

996
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,571
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

997
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:49,660
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won,</i>
<i>if such a term may be applied.</i>

998
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:54,459
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

999
01:18:58,552 --> 01:19:00,176
Should we get on with it, then?

1000
01:19:06,726 --> 01:19:08,765
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1001
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:17,356
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1002
01:19:19,946 --> 01:19:21,986
Nice speech, though.

1003
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:28,193
I wish I was standing for it.

1004
01:19:39,256 --> 01:19:41,497
You... you brought this upon our heads.

1005
01:19:43,885 --> 01:19:48,013
- Me?
- You... you hired Goodkat to kill my son.

1006
01:19:49,974 --> 01:19:52,013
After you murdered my son?

1007
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:56,681
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1008
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:58,811
Just like in '84?

1009
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:02,940
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1010
01:20:05,697 --> 01:20:07,736
Time's up, Rabbi.

1011
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:12,320
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1012
01:20:16,331 --> 01:20:18,371
You were getting too big.

1013
01:20:20,252 --> 01:20:22,291
See...

1014
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:25,711
...problem when two men are standing in a room

1015
01:20:25,798 --> 01:20:28,716
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1016
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:32,300
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1017
01:20:34,974 --> 01:20:36,384
Then they called you The Boss.

1018
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:41,517
It was clear what had to be done.

1019
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:50,862
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1020
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:57,279
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1021
01:20:58,161 --> 01:21:00,487
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1022
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:06,915
The dead eyes of...

1023
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:13,002
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1024
01:21:16,804 --> 01:21:18,843
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1025
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:22,015
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1026
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:25,474
...looking for your son.

1027
01:21:30,691 --> 01:21:32,731
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1028
01:21:34,445 --> 01:21:36,484
And now...

1029
01:21:37,656 --> 01:21:39,779
...after all these years...

1030
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:43,243
...in spite of our agreement!

1031
01:21:44,537 --> 01:21:46,162
You... you...

1032
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:49,248
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1033
01:21:50,168 --> 01:21:52,326
You managed to take my son away from me.

1034
01:21:53,879 --> 01:21:55,919
Well...

1035
01:21:57,174 --> 01:21:59,297
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1036
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:02,420
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1037
01:22:11,604 --> 01:22:13,513
You haven't heard.

1038
01:22:13,606 --> 01:22:15,645
Will I?

1039
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:19,933
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1040
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:23,571
Your son is dead.

1041
01:22:26,951 --> 01:22:29,109
Your son is dead.

1042
01:22:31,789 --> 01:22:34,410
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1043
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:37,866
SLEVIN: <i>Rabbi.</i>

1044
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:41,247
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1045
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,640
Fisher.

1046
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:59,560
Fisher, listen to me.

1047
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,974
I already told you,

1048
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:07,109
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1049
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:14,491
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1050
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:22,958
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1051
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:26,503
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1052
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:29,341
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1053
01:23:37,307 --> 01:23:39,347
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1054
01:23:47,358 --> 01:23:49,896
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1055
01:23:50,736 --> 01:23:52,895
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1056
01:23:52,989 --> 01:23:55,064
<i>In books.</i>

1057
01:23:59,453 --> 01:24:01,030
<i>And who has books?</i>

1058
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:11,168
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1059
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:14,169
He's clean.

1060
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,297
SLEVIN: <i>Crooked bookies...</i>

1061
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,220
- <i>... who work with big-time crooks.</i>
- So... why are you here?

1062
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:33,643
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1063
01:24:35,277 --> 01:24:37,021
O<i>ne who was in both books...</i>

1064
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,152
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1065
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,403
Got him.

1066
01:24:41,491 --> 01:24:43,531
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1067
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,283
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1068
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:49,373
1729.

1069
01:24:49,457 --> 01:24:51,699
Nick Fisher.

1070
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:53,832
OK.

1071
01:25:05,555 --> 01:25:07,594
GOODKAT: <i>There was a time.</i>

1072
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:26,943
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1073
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:51,259
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger</i>
<i>and wait for you to call the man</i>

1074
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:53,672
<i>who does thejobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1075
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,849
THE BOSS: <i>I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1076
01:25:59,313 --> 01:26:01,519
There's a specialist.

1077
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,809
Calls himself Mr Goodkat.

1078
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:13,905
Fine.

1079
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:17,861
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1080
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,582
Are you ready?

1081
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:26,709
Yeah.

1082
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:31,838
It's just that one last thing.

1083
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:42,220
THE BOSS: <i>Mr Goodkat.</i>

1084
01:26:43,228 --> 01:26:44,936
It's been a long time.

1085
01:26:49,275 --> 01:26:53,937
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr Goodkat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1086
01:26:55,072 --> 01:26:58,939
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1087
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:02,902
And I guess you've already heard about...

1088
01:27:04,414 --> 01:27:07,035
- <i>... my son.</i>
- Yes, I heard.

1089
01:27:08,042 --> 01:27:09,869
I need you to sort it out for me.

1090
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:11,669
Who's the mark?

1091
01:27:11,754 --> 01:27:13,332
Yitzchok.

1092
01:27:16,717 --> 01:27:18,342
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1093
01:27:18,427 --> 01:27:20,633
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1094
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:22,547
I remember The Rabbi well.

1095
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,264
<i>Thing is...</i>

1096
01:27:24,349 --> 01:27:26,887
it can't look like a job.

1097
01:27:27,811 --> 01:27:30,348
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1098
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:37,353
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1099
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:41,110
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1100
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:43,190
Anything can be done.

1101
01:27:45,452 --> 01:27:47,824
Good. How?

1102
01:27:47,912 --> 01:27:50,071
Kansas City Shuffle.

1103
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:53,831
I'm not familiar with the term.

1104
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:58,787
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1105
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:04,467
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1106
01:28:09,224 --> 01:28:11,430
What are you looking for?

1107
01:28:14,896 --> 01:28:17,565
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1108
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:20,355
1729.

1109
01:28:20,442 --> 01:28:21,853
Nick Fisher.

1110
01:28:21,944 --> 01:28:23,058
Why him?

1111
01:28:24,196 --> 01:28:25,856
A loser.

1112
01:28:25,947 --> 01:28:28,236
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1113
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:39,163
GOODKAT: <i>Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1114
01:28:39,251 --> 01:28:41,291
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1115
01:28:41,378 --> 01:28:43,536
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1116
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:46,714
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1117
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,966
Like I said... very big job.

1118
01:28:50,053 --> 01:28:54,264
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1119
01:28:54,348 --> 01:28:57,135
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1120
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,559
No. But something like that.

1121
01:29:05,734 --> 01:29:08,688
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1122
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:10,272
And I hate baseball.

1123
01:29:10,363 --> 01:29:13,648
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1124
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:16,612
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1125
01:29:17,536 --> 01:29:21,285
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1126
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:26,118
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1127
01:29:26,211 --> 01:29:29,461
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1128
01:29:30,256 --> 01:29:33,625
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1129
01:29:33,718 --> 01:29:35,710
than he does to The Boss dead.

1130
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:38,045
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1131
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:42,266
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1132
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:44,679
I'm listening.

1133
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:48,849
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1134
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:52,143
- Ohh.
- And that...

1135
01:29:53,945 --> 01:29:55,984
And that will make us friends.

1136
01:29:56,781 --> 01:29:58,820
Right, Rabbi?

1137
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:01,284
Hm?

1138
01:30:05,414 --> 01:30:10,159
And... since friends do favours for their friends,
you will do a favour for me.

1139
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:13,169
Pray tell? What is this favour?

1140
01:30:13,254 --> 01:30:16,789
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1141
01:30:16,882 --> 01:30:18,045
Whose?

1142
01:30:18,134 --> 01:30:21,253
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1143
01:30:21,345 --> 01:30:23,503
Who is he?

1144
01:30:23,597 --> 01:30:25,636
Just a loser.

1145
01:30:25,724 --> 01:30:27,763
You just made a lot of money.

1146
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:34,432
SLEVIN: <i>And then I was free</i>
<i>to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1147
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:49,200
Hm?

1148
01:30:49,287 --> 01:30:52,371
Whatever they're paying you...

1149
01:30:59,213 --> 01:31:00,624
Oh.

1150
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:02,793
There is nobody.

1151
01:31:05,135 --> 01:31:07,174
I did this to you.

1152
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:11,379
- Me.
- You.

1153
01:31:12,141 --> 01:31:13,933
Me.

1154
01:31:20,065 --> 01:31:22,105
Who are you?

1155
01:31:24,778 --> 01:31:26,771
BRIKOWSKl: <i>Who is he?</i>

1156
01:31:26,863 --> 01:31:31,192
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1157
01:31:31,284 --> 01:31:33,111
What about dental records?

1158
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:38,789
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1159
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:41,664
What a fucking mess.

1160
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:45,417
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1161
01:31:45,505 --> 01:31:49,585
<i>We found two more bodies</i>
<i>to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1162
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:51,715
All right, I'll be right over.

1163
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:56,132
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1164
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:59,592
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1165
01:31:59,685 --> 01:32:01,179
Send somebody over.

1166
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,468
<i>Copy.</i>

1167
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:07,316
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1168
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,274
No, I'm fine.

1169
01:32:09,361 --> 01:32:11,400
All right.

1170
01:32:34,842 --> 01:32:38,045
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1171
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:39,715
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1172
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,925
<i>Harry Kello came by today.</i>
<i>You remember Harry?</i>

1173
01:32:43,017 --> 01:32:46,884
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1174
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:49,018
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1175
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:52,806
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1176
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,474
- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- <i>We're making small talk.</i>

1177
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,188
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1178
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:02,697
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1179
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:06,485
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1180
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:10,411
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1181
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,252
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1182
01:33:13,336 --> 01:33:16,752
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1183
01:33:36,816 --> 01:33:38,855
I have that same phone.

1184
01:33:51,329 --> 01:33:55,706
<i>About an hour later the phone rings, it's Harry,</i>
<i>talking like a goddamned machine gun,</i>

1185
01:33:55,792 --> 01:33:58,282
going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1186
01:34:01,172 --> 01:34:03,211
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1187
01:34:04,258 --> 01:34:06,499
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1188
01:34:07,636 --> 01:34:09,675
<i>(Race start bell)</i>

1189
01:34:14,267 --> 01:34:16,306
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1190
01:34:16,394 --> 01:34:20,438
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,</i>
<i>The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1191
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:23,559
<i>before people started</i>
<i>waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1192
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:28,359
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1193
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:30,238
His name was Max.

1194
01:34:33,118 --> 01:34:36,901
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1195
01:34:36,996 --> 01:34:39,238
Roth laid the bet off.

1196
01:34:39,332 --> 01:34:40,909
On you.

1197
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:52,210
And you.

1198
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,887
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1199
01:35:01,977 --> 01:35:04,017
they are the opposite of happy.

1200
01:35:04,104 --> 01:35:07,140
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1201
01:35:07,232 --> 01:35:08,014
Aargh!

1202
01:35:08,108 --> 01:35:10,433
These guys kill everyone!

1203
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:11,772
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1204
01:35:12,862 --> 01:35:16,148
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1205
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,149
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1206
01:35:18,242 --> 01:35:21,860
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1207
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:27,792
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid</i>
<i>cos nobody would take thejob.</i>

1208
01:35:45,726 --> 01:35:48,014
What have you done with my son?

1209
01:36:04,326 --> 01:36:06,069
You?

1210
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:08,237
No.

1211
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:10,618
You're dead.

1212
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:14,574
You're dead!

1213
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,011
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to</i>
<i>bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1214
01:36:25,095 --> 01:36:29,306
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1215
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:31,430
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1216
01:36:31,518 --> 01:36:33,641
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1217
01:36:33,728 --> 01:36:38,141
<i>He says the horse's name was</i>
<i>Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1218
01:36:38,232 --> 01:36:40,225
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1219
01:36:49,451 --> 01:36:51,490
Do you remember this part?

1220
01:37:02,254 --> 01:37:05,255
Please! I have a family.

1221
01:37:05,341 --> 01:37:07,250
Not any more, you don't.

1222
01:37:07,342 --> 01:37:09,134
Henry! (Sobs)

1223
01:37:11,221 --> 01:37:13,260
You fucking bastards!

1224
01:37:14,974 --> 01:37:17,596
You fucking bastards!

1225
01:37:36,953 --> 01:37:39,526
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1226
01:37:45,794 --> 01:37:47,834
Fuck you both.

1227
01:38:12,277 --> 01:38:17,271
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra,</i>
<i>as far as I can tell.</i>

1228
01:38:17,365 --> 01:38:19,607
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1229
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,737
<i>Which is interesting,</i>
<i>him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1230
01:38:22,828 --> 01:38:25,153
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1231
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:28,497
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1232
01:38:28,584 --> 01:38:31,253
<i>I thought to myself, mayb e it means something.</i>

1233
01:38:31,336 --> 01:38:36,211
<i>Then again, mayb e it'sjust a coincidence,</i>
<i>name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1234
01:38:36,299 --> 01:38:39,999
<i>I guess none of this really matters</i>
<i>now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1235
01:38:45,015 --> 01:38:48,182
<i>Ah, one more thing,</i>
<i>we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1236
01:38:48,936 --> 01:38:51,473
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1237
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:57,939
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,</i>
<i>he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1238
01:38:58,027 --> 01:39:00,233
<i>He says it means...</i>

1239
01:39:00,321 --> 01:39:02,360
Bad dog.

1240
01:39:08,912 --> 01:39:11,581
BRIKOWSKl:
<i>20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1241
01:39:11,665 --> 01:39:13,823
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1242
01:39:30,015 --> 01:39:32,054
Brikowski? You there?

1243
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,371
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1244
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,206
She took my picture.

1245
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,209
She's got to go in the ground.

1246
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:38,544
OK.

1247
01:42:00,111 --> 01:42:02,150
I have something I have to tell you.

1248
01:42:04,824 --> 01:42:06,863
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1249
01:42:12,247 --> 01:42:14,286
You're gonna have to trust me.

1250
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,799
Shit!

1251
01:42:30,722 --> 01:42:32,762
He's going to shoot you here.

1252
01:43:30,277 --> 01:43:32,316
I didn't think you'd understand.

1253
01:43:49,962 --> 01:43:51,586
I understood.

1254
01:43:56,426 --> 01:43:58,465
How did you find out about us?

1255
01:43:58,553 --> 01:44:00,795
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1256
01:44:00,888 --> 01:44:02,928
How do you think I found out?

1257
01:44:06,602 --> 01:44:08,511
I thought you might want this.

1258
01:44:48,349 --> 01:44:50,175
I want to go home.

1259
01:44:50,267 --> 01:44:52,639
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.

1260
01:44:56,481 --> 01:44:58,521
My name is Goodkat.

1261
01:44:59,609 --> 01:45:01,648
You can call me Mr Goodkat.

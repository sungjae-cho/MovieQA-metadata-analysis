1
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,200
Dia.

2
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,674
English boys don't go
to school every day.

3
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,888
BLOOD DIAMOND

4
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:52,417
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

5
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:55,153
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

6
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:57,697
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

7
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,266
...our world will be a paradise.

8
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,802
And all this you learn in one day?

9
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:05,096
And math and science.

10
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:09,339
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

11
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:10,633
No, Papa.

12
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,104
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

13
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,030
- Stay.
- Papa.

14
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,605
- Stay!
- Papa!

15
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,266
Jassie!

16
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,299
Solomon.

17
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:43,987
Come, come, come.

18
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,092
Pick it up. Quick.

19
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,522
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

20
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,600
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

21
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:04,766
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

22
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:07,035
Papa!

23
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:25,257
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

24
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,088
Bring forward the next one.

25
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,197
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

26
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,197
Young man. You must understand.

27
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,033
The government wants you to vote, okay?

28
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,866
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

29
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,271
We now the future.

30
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,037
So we take your hands.

31
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,644
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

32
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,144
Chop him.

33
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,754
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

34
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:05,591
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

35
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,093
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

36
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:15,894
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

37
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:18,804
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

38
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,333
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,168
Not this one. Look at him.

40
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:27,670
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

41
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:29,247
Bring him to the mines.

42
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,576
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

43
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:33,514
Next one, next one, next one.

44
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,684
<i>Throughout the history of Africa...</i>

45
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,389
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

46
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,096
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

47
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:53,968
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

48
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,537
It is now true of diamonds.

49
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:01,168
<i>According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...</i>

50
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:06,180
<i>...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.</i>

51
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,145
We must act to prohibit...

52
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:13,651
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

53
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:21,281
<i>May I remind you...</i>

54
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,396
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

55
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:30,160
<i>...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.</i>

56
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,567
<i>We must remember
that these stones...</i>

57
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:37,696
<i>...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...</i>

58
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,745
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

59
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:46,178
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

60
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,978
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

61
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,245
RUF have freed you.

62
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,754
<i>- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.</i>

63
00:07:54,925 --> 00:08:00,020
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

64
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:02,596
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

65
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:05,824
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

66
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,901
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

67
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,535
RUF is fighting for the people!

68
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,469
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

69
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:18,509
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

70
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:21,839
Stop!

71
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:27,278
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

72
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:31,084
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

73
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,918
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

74
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:38,355
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

75
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,965
Give it to me.

76
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,799
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

77
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:30,340
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

78
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,942
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

79
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:35,774
You be careful, Danny.

80
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:40,474
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

81
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,351
Where is Commander Zero?

82
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,691
I am Captain Rambo.

83
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,099
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

84
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,740
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

85
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,739
He's inside. You talk to me.

86
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,879
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

87
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,607
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

88
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,431
All right.

89
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,830
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

90
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,166
Here, huh?

91
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:00,186
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

92
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,413
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

93
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:05,248
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

94
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:09,053
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

95
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:12,252
Mr. Archer, come here.

96
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:21,030
You get something for me?

97
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:23,797
And yourself get something for me, huh?

98
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:28,271
Are you craze?

00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,217
This no fine, huh?

100
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:49,759
This no fine.

101
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:58,234
...and their new weapons, huh?

102
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,702
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

103
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:02,772
Then you get one more dead body...

104
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,603
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

105
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,773
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

106
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,380
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

107
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,416
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

108
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,751
This is the thing you want? Here.

109
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:23,084
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

110
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:26,751
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

111
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,690
<i>- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.</i>

112
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,331
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:56,777
Hello, hello, hello.

114
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,917
Papers, please.

115
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,314
<i>Danny Archer, National Geographic.</i>

116
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,025
You crossing into Liberia.

117
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:10,825
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

118
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,469
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

119
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:16,969
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

120
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,464
<i>You ever read National Geographic, huh?</i>

121
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:03,173
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

122
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,041
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

123
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,683
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

124
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,152
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

125
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,050
Now, you know who I am, all right?

126
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:18,090
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

127
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,955
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

128
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,757
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

129
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,765
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

130
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,199
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

131
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,364
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

132
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,203
Guys, take him away.

133
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:27,079
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

134
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:29,117
Come on! Fix that shit now!

135
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:32,551
Wasting my time here!

Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

137
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,495
- Can't work. What's going on there?

138
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:41,528
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

139
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:44,997
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

140
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,303
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

141
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:51,565
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

142
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,345
Stop!

143
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:02,349
Spread your fingers.

144
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:04,916
Open.

145
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,097
Make it quick.

146
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:59,693
Give it to me.

147
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:03,995
Give it to me.

148
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,672
The government troops are coming!

149
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,210
Go, go, go--!

150
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,637
No, no, no!

151
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,502
No! I'm not a rebel!

152
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,878
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>

153
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,981

154
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:39,279
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!</i>

00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:43,720

00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,388
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,364
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,841
Hey.

161
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,412
What did you do with it?

162
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,707
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

163
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:17,312
Where the diamond? The pink one.

164
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,250
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

165
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:24,358
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

166
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:29,162
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

167
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,931
My brothers, I go give $1000...

168
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:37,558
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

169
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:41,195
You the craze! You the craze!

170
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:43,001
Where is the diamond?

171
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:46,372
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

172
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:52,316
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

173
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:56,646
Here, look. What is left?

174
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,721
What is left?

175
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,552
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

176
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:03,693
Liar! The man is a liar!

177
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:08,128
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

178
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:12,393
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

179
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,366
And I'll find them!

180
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:34,346
<i>Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.</i>

181
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,952
I just have to tell you, Danny.

182
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:39,147
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

183
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,191
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

184
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,987
He might've found a pink. Big one.

185
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,289
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

186
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,932
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

187
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,934
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

188
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:57,202
What? What?

189
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:00,069
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

190
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,774
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

191
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,575
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

192
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,878
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso--"

193
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,147
Fucking hell.

194
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:16,715
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

195
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:20,554
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

196
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,319
Get him out.

197
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:30,235
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

198
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:34,400
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

199
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,221
Afternoon, darling, huh?

200
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:04,296
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

201
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,924
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

202
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:12,369
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

203
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,439
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

204
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,906
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

205
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,921
Solomon Vandy?

206
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,788
What do you want?

207
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,827
It seems you made a friend in prison.

208
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:44,147
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

209
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:46,116
The body fine, M'Ed.

210
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:53,088
So you want something nice, huh?

211
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:56,457
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

212
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,157
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

213
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:03,167
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

214
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:05,838
- Really?
- Now, come on.

215
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,669
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

216
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:13,278
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

217
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:16,676
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

218
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,407
Yeah.

219
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:29,319
Who's that, huh?

220
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:32,151
All right.

221
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:42,362
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

222
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:44,196
You listening to this?

223
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:46,839
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

224
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:50,567
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

225
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:52,640
<i>I believe he's sorry.</i>

226
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:56,213
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

227
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:02,152
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

228
00:25:04,656 --> 00:25:06,852
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

229
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,823
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

230
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:11,628
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

231
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,061
Well, Americans usually are.

232
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,932
Says the white South African?

233
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,959
I'm from Rhodesia.

234
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,297
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

235
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:27,740
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

236
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:30,071
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

237
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,476
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

238
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:36,113
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

239
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,547
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

240
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:40,618
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

241
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,652
Government only wants
to stay in power...

242
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:45,723
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

243
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:48,518
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

244
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,025
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

245
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,494
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

246
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,894
What's TIA?

247
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:59,435
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

248
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:02,471
- You want another?
- Sure.

249
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,800
So which one are you?

250
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:13,545
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

251
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,651
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

252
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,655
How about soldier of fortune?

253
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:22,682
Or is that too much of a cliché?

254
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:24,189
Diamonds?

255
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:28,488
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

256
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,792
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

257
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,061
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

258
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:39,465
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

259
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:43,005
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

260
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:46,441
...for talking about blood diamonds?

261
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:52,309
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

262
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:57,845
Piss off, huh?

263
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:05,457
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

264
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,290
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

265
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:12,490
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

266
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,657
I'm shocked.

267
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:17,167
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

268
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:21,671
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

269
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:23,538
What do you want from me, huh?

270
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,237
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

271
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:32,942
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

272
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,715
Shit.

273
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:13,544
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

274
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:17,087
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

275
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,088
Tim must be in school, right?

276
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,591
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

277
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:24,354
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

278
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:26,929
<i>Well, you know the bush, right, bru?</i>

279
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,260
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

280
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:33,064
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

281
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,672
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

282
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,275
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

283
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:43,140
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

284
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,442
<i>Smoking will kill you, bru.</i>

285
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:47,945
Only if I live, right?

286
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:55,188
<i>That's for breaking my TV, bru.</i>

287
00:29:00,062 --> 00:29:03,588
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

288
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:11,566
Ten more.

289
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,640
Come. Come.

290
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:22,238
Go on.

291
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:40,362
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

292
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:43,625
Go. Go, Mama.

293
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,733
Stay down.

294
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,511
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy--

295
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:07,779
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

296
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:12,413
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

297
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,581
Then God help you,
because I can't.

298
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,818
- Please, sir--
- Next.

299
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,122
- Sir-- Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

300
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:22,062
Husband here. One year we look.

301
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,733
Hurry, Mom. Go.

302
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,277
Dia! Dia!

303
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:36,436
- Jassie!
- Dia!

304
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,204
- Mama!
- Dia!

305
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,543
Jassie! Mama!

306
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:05,633
He's been waiting.
What took you?

307
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:09,704
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

308
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:12,969
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

309
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,439
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

310
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,405
You look well.

311
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,738
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

312
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,775
Walk with me.

313
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,383
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

314
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:01,884
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

315
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,023
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

316
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,783
So you sell the rebels weapons...

317
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,619
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

318
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,961
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

319
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,256
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

320
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,730
And you get rich, right?

321
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:23,596
How long have I known you, Danny?

322
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,201
I was... I was 19, sir.

323
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:31,971
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

324
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:36,043
Just lucky, I guess.

325
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:42,820
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

326
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:47,627
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

327
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:50,820
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

328
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,189
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

329
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:59,029
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

330
00:33:00,004 --> 00:33:03,667
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

331
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,278
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

332
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:13,212
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

333
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,808
Sir...

334
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,112
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

335
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,017
I'll take a stone as payment.

336
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,058
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

337
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:28,061
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

338
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:34,795
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

339
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,668
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

340
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:40,397
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

341
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:47,003
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

342
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,443
If you say so, sir.

343
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,592
So, what did you do, bury it?

344
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,362
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

345
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,565
<i>- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.</i>

346
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,176
I'm late for work.

347
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:24,868
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

348
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:27,173
<i>You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?</i>

349
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,839
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

350
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:33,248
Go ask him.

351
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:48,795
Thank you.

352
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,238
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

353
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,275
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

354
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:06,675
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

355
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:16,887
Your parents are weak.

356
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:21,894
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

357
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:25,957
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

358
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,793
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

359
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,039
You are not children anymore.

360
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,974
You're men.

361
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:42,340
No one has ever given you respect...

362
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,607
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

363
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:48,274
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

364
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:50,749
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

365
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:54,880
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

366
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:58,118
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

367
00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:01,423
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

368
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:04,157
<i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

369
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,233
<i>- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>

370
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:10,303
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.</i>

371
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,064
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

372
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,830
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

373
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,034
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.</i>

374
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:21,980
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

375
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:00,671
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

376
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,942
Sit up. Come.

377
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,418
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

378
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:11,489
And I am your commander.

379
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,857
Whatever you need...

380
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:17,258
...guns, CDs, food...

381
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:21,093
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

382
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:30,808
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

383
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,402
Dia Vandy...

384
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,846
...boss man.

385
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:00,225
<i>How's it, bru?</i>

386
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:03,930
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

387
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:08,104
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

388
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:10,797
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

389
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:15,640
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

390
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:19,214
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

391
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:23,115
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

392
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,319
This my country, man.

393
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,947
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

394
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:41,131
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

395
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:44,670
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

396
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,276
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

397
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:53,636
Archer.

398
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:58,207
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

399
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:04,581
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

400
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:09,787
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

401
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:12,121
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

402
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,699
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

403
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:20,232
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

404
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:25,497
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

405
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,702
Christ, you never stop, do you?

406
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:32,344
No, I never stop.

407
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:34,639
Do you want me to stop?

408
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,920
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

409
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,181
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

410
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:46,186
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

411
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,259
...because of the deals you do?

412
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,659
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

413
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,764
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

414
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:58,161
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

415
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,670
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

416
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:06,242
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

417
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:11,378
You're a hard case, huh?

418
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:14,539
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

419
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,049
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

420
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:20,446
You come here
with your laptop computer...

421
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:24,558
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

422
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:28,354
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

423
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,123
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

424
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,788
- Really?
- Yeah.

425
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:33,957
Tell me, how is that?

426
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,397
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

427
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:40,197
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

428
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,934
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

429
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,102
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

430
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:52,813
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

431
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:56,214
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

432
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,783
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

433
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,859
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

434
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,427
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

435
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:10,464
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

436
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:15,094
This place is about to explode.

437
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,396
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

438
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:31,506
<i>You are listening to BBC World Service.</i>

439
00:41:31,683 --> 00:41:35,415
<i>In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...</i>

440
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:38,318
<i>...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.</i>

441
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:41,152
<i>The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...</i>

442
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,691
<i>...that the government troops
can repel the attack.</i>

443
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:47,127
<i>All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.</i>

444
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,459
<i>There are also unconfirmed reports...</i>

445
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,694
<i>...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.</i>

446
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:57,805
<i>The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.</i>

447
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:11,784
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

448
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,478
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

449
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,680
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

450
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:19,917
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

451
00:42:20,094 --> 00:42:23,961
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

452
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:26,429
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

453
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,899
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

454
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,504
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

455
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:36,937
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

456
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,238
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

457
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:41,673
Am I right? Am I?

458
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,105
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

459
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:47,342
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

460
00:42:47,518 --> 00:42:50,009
What if I helped you find your family?

461
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:51,710
What do you know of my family?

462
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:54,913
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

463
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:57,685
<i>- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.</i>

464
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,089
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

465
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:04,389
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

466
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:09,496
Oh, shit.

467
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,830
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

468
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,997
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

469
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:18,574
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

470
00:43:18,744 --> 00:43:23,011
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

471
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:25,776
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

472
00:43:57,212 --> 00:43:58,840
Stay low!

473
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:01,943
Get your ass over here!

474
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:14,050
Wait!

475
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:16,154
Now!

476
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:22,857
Come on, come on.

477
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:28,269
Come on!

478
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:46,079
Come on.

479
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:47,448
Fuck!

480
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:58,562
No, this way.

481
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,490
Fire!

482
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,149
Fuck! Go, go, go!

483
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,042
Go!

484
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,856
Shit!

485
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:33,688
No! No!

486
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,898
This way.

487
00:46:03,756 --> 00:46:05,916
This way. Stay low.

488
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:19,097
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

489
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,839
Come on!

490
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:35,740
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

491
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,564
Fire!

492
00:48:45,397 --> 00:48:49,163
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

493
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:51,494
So, what do we do?

494
00:49:02,312 --> 00:49:07,079
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

495
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,309
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

496
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:12,647
Wait, wait. Wait.

497
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:18,352
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

498
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:20,927
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

499
00:49:56,624 --> 00:49:58,558
Where are we going?

500
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,888
Lungi's under government control.

501
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:06,523
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

502
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:09,067
I have agreed to nothing.

503
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:12,428
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

504
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:16,873
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

505
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:33,919
So you're a fisherman, huh?

506
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:37,925
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

507
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:47,734
Come on.

508
00:50:59,947 --> 00:51:01,470
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

509
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,243
<i>Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?</i>

510
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:07,353
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

511
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:10,182
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

512
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:13,382
Back away from the fence.

513
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:19,024
But you are not a journalist.

514
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:20,631
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

515
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,200
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

516
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:25,928
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

517
00:51:26,104 --> 00:51:29,163
<i>How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?</i>

518
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,067
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

519
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:34,268
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

520
00:51:34,445 --> 00:51:37,210
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

521
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:38,370
- Is it?
- Yeah.

522
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:42,143
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

523
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,515
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

524
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:47,917
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

525
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,957
<i>- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.</i>

526
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:55,764
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

527
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:03,931
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

528
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:07,970
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

529
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:12,742
Hi.

530
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:14,673
You got out.

531
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:17,906
Yes. Hello again.

532
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:20,413
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

533
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:22,109
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

534
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:25,853
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

535
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:30,322
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

536
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,053
All right. Here it is.

537
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:36,163
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

538
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:38,630
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

539
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:41,166
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

540
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:44,635
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

541
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:46,934
- ...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

542
00:52:48,342 --> 00:52:51,800
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

543
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:54,505
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

544
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:59,543
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

545
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,916
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

546
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:04,682
He cannot get through the red tape.

547
00:53:04,857 --> 00:53:07,620
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

548
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,818
And how do you know this man?

549
00:53:10,463 --> 00:53:14,297
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

550
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,291
You're using him.

551
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:22,134
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

552
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:25,070
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

553
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,140
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

554
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:30,471
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

555
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,084
I can't believe I just said that.

556
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:43,949
My family's here, in Guinea?

557
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:46,422
Yes, according to the manifest.

558
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,122
I do not know how to thank you.

559
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,814
Thank you. Thank you.

560
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:34,498
This is what a million people looks like.

561
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:41,772
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

562
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:48,041
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

563
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,851
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

564
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:01,390
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

565
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:04,692
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

566
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,055
- Move away.
- What him doing?

567
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:07,594
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

568
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,289
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

569
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:11,725
We are here to help you.

570
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,163
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

571
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:18,102
An entire country made homeless.

572
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,376
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

573
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:28,071
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

574
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:31,478
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

575
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:34,746
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

576
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:13,980
Jassie.

577
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,611
Jassie!

578
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:19,086
Jassie!

579
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:20,420
- Jassie.
- Solo.

580
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:21,822
- Jassie.
- Solo.

581
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:24,359
Jassie. Jassie.

582
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,229
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

583
00:56:37,009 --> 00:56:38,237
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

584
00:56:39,977 --> 00:56:41,774
Dia. Dia.

585
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,009
Where is Dia?

586
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:48,944
Jassie!

587
00:56:59,662 --> 00:57:01,892
They took him.

588
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,293
There are only two children
on the manifest.

589
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:10,995
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

590
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:13,138
Where is my son?

591
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:15,070
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

592
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:16,504
Move away from the fence.

593
00:57:16,677 --> 00:57:19,737
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

594
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:22,343
Let them out!

595
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:26,840
Away from the fence.

596
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:30,616
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

597
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:33,153
No! Solo!

598
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:35,622
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

599
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,126
Solo! Solo!

600
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:53,132
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

601
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:57,406
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

602
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:01,577
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

603
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:04,611
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

604
00:58:04,786 --> 00:58:06,946
...where I buried it.

605
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:35,110
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

606
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,770
Solomon.

607
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,647
I do not need a map.

608
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:45,219
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

609
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:47,150
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

610
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:50,621
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

611
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:57,157
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

612
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,095
You damn well better be able to find it.

613
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:06,267
My son is a very good student.

614
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:10,067
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

615
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:13,609
...every morning to study English.

616
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:18,506
He's going to be a doctor one day.

617
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:46,707
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

618
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:50,538
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

619
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:56,846
- What?
- Nothing.

620
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:00,977
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

621
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:04,717
You're right. It's shit.

622
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,219
It's like one of those infomercials.

623
01:00:08,392 --> 01:00:13,227
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

624
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:17,298
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

625
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:20,062
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

626
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:21,703
...maybe even write a check...

627
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:24,237
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

628
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:29,101
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

629
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:30,801
Because I need facts.

630
01:00:30,979 --> 01:00:35,507
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

631
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:40,075
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

632
01:00:40,253 --> 01:00:42,518
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

633
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:45,318
But I can't write that story...

634
01:00:45,493 --> 01:00:49,018
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

635
01:00:49,194 --> 01:00:54,327
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

636
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:57,025
So if that is not you...

637
01:00:57,203 --> 01:01:01,298
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

638
01:01:01,473 --> 01:01:04,703
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

639
01:01:04,876 --> 01:01:06,777
...and let me do my work?

640
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:18,854
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

641
01:01:21,623 --> 01:01:24,786
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

642
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:27,287
Who knows, maybe both.

643
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,125
Do you realize that
that diamond...

644
01:01:31,297 --> 01:01:34,061
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

645
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:38,466
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

646
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:46,002
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

647
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:48,271
The only way
is with the press convoy.

648
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:50,812
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

649
01:01:50,982 --> 01:01:52,507
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

650
01:01:52,684 --> 01:01:54,311
- Please.
- No!

651
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,997
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

652
01:02:11,168 --> 01:02:13,897
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

653
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,037
Go on.

654
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:25,411
<i>He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.</i>

655
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:27,947
That way, they can be legally exported.

656
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,610
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

657
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:34,277
<i>...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...</i>

658
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:36,046
<i>...no more questions are asked.</i>

659
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,988
By the time they get to India...

660
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,888
<i>...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...</i>

661
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:45,325
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

662
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:47,692
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

663
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,356
Yeah.

664
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,196
<i>When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.</i>

665
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:57,073
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

666
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,708
- Agreed.
- Good.

667
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:01,240
Now, there's an underground vault...

668
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,971
<i>...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...</i>

669
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,979
<i>...so they can keep the price high.</i>

670
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:11,149
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

671
01:03:11,318 --> 01:03:14,379
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

672
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:16,216
...can't afford to let that happen.

673
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,654
<i>Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...</i>

674
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:21,317
<i>...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...</i>

675
01:03:21,495 --> 01:03:22,826
<i>...for an engagement ring.</i>

676
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:25,988
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

677
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,999
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

678
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:32,400
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

679
01:03:38,877 --> 01:03:43,006
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

680
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:48,177
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

681
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:50,378
...and I'm dead, huh?

682
01:03:50,556 --> 01:03:54,924
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

683
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,957
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

684
01:03:59,129 --> 01:04:01,527
Then write whatever you want.

685
01:04:02,363 --> 01:04:04,456
I'm already dead.

686
01:04:11,304 --> 01:04:14,967
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

687
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:17,077
Listen, I cannot do this.

688
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:19,871
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

689
01:04:20,046 --> 01:04:22,538
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

690
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:25,912
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

691
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:28,483
Now get on the bus. Go.

692
01:04:45,168 --> 01:04:48,069
I am the cameraman.

693
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:56,170
You are writing about
what is happening here?

694
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:57,968
Yes.

695
01:04:58,147 --> 01:05:02,344
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

696
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:04,143
Probably not.

697
01:05:05,753 --> 01:05:08,119
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

698
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,748
<i>Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.</i>

699
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:15,622
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

700
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:18,924
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

701
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:21,930
<i>When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.</i>

702
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,399
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

703
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,435
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

704
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:29,332
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

705
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:32,772
- What's that?
- What's going on?

706
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:35,138
Looks like it was an RPG.

707
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,142
Open the door. Let us out.

708
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:39,414
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

709
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:42,851
Go, go! Move, move, move!

710
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:46,552
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

711
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:50,020
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

712
01:05:50,191 --> 01:05:52,820
- ...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

713
01:05:52,994 --> 01:05:54,518
...just a few minutes ago...

714
01:05:54,696 --> 01:05:57,027
- ...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

715
01:05:57,231 --> 01:05:59,256
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

716
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,162
--at this site.
Dozens of--

717
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:04,102
Many are injured.

718
01:06:14,246 --> 01:06:17,409
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

719
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,210
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

720
01:06:19,385 --> 01:06:20,373
Get back on the bus!

721
01:06:20,552 --> 01:06:22,109
Solomon! Solomon!

722
01:06:22,286 --> 01:06:23,777
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

723
01:06:23,957 --> 01:06:25,388
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

724
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:28,253
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

725
01:06:28,594 --> 01:06:30,423
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

726
01:06:30,594 --> 01:06:32,790
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

727
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:35,397
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

728
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:37,829
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

729
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:40,968
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

730
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:44,069
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

731
01:06:44,238 --> 01:06:46,799
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

732
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:02,846
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

733
01:07:03,722 --> 01:07:06,919
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

734
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:10,549
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

735
01:07:11,097 --> 01:07:13,531
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

736
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:51,230
<i>This medicine will make you strong...</i>

737
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:54,165
...make you invisible to your enemies.

738
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:56,565
Bullets will bounce off you.

739
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:11,142
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

740
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:14,250
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

741
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:20,687
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

742
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:24,048
I am Baby Killer.

743
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:31,492
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

744
01:08:34,836 --> 01:08:36,267
I am Born Trouble.

745
01:08:42,675 --> 01:08:44,734
I am See Me No More.

746
01:08:54,286 --> 01:08:57,221
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

747
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:02,787
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

748
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,830
Get down!

749
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:45,173
- Look out!
- Shit!

750
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,248
- You all right?
- Fine.

751
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:06,194
Shit!

752
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:10,631
Hold on!

753
01:10:20,744 --> 01:10:22,144
Hold on!

754
01:10:33,422 --> 01:10:34,650
Come on.

755
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,356
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

756
01:10:44,564 --> 01:10:45,996
Let me see that. You okay?

757
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:47,222
- Yeah.
- All right.

758
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,862
Quietly, now. Quietly.

759
01:11:14,023 --> 01:11:15,456
Come on.

760
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,913
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

761
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:42,951
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

762
01:11:57,433 --> 01:11:58,923
Excuse me. Excuse me?

763
01:11:59,868 --> 01:12:03,235
<i>Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

764
01:12:03,405 --> 01:12:06,463
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

765
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:09,576
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

766
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:12,372
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

767
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:14,477
Everyone could all come in together.

768
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:20,010
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

769
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:24,147
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

770
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:27,780
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

771
01:12:28,059 --> 01:12:29,857
There you go. That's perfect.

772
01:12:31,663 --> 01:12:34,188
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

773
01:12:34,366 --> 01:12:36,334
I'll come in like this, yeah?

774
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:38,124
Cheese.

775
01:12:40,305 --> 01:12:42,636
So do you think
they've read your work?

776
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:44,934
Shut up.

777
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:00,152
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

778
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:05,488
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

779
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:08,355
Where have you come from?

780
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:11,659
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

781
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:15,600
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

782
01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:17,668
I don't have anything for you.

783
01:13:37,988 --> 01:13:39,784
My name is Benjamin Margai.

784
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,548
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

785
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:45,785
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

786
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,904
I'm the cameraman?

787
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:08,447
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

788
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:12,983
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

789
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:15,245
...to keep them in line.

790
01:14:15,888 --> 01:14:18,822
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

791
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,982
We have taken them back.

792
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,254
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

793
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,454
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

794
01:14:27,632 --> 01:14:29,258
Let me show you.

795
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,600
Imagine doing all this, huh?

796
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:36,802
What's your excuse?

797
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:42,942
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

798
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,804
So you're an action junkie, huh?

799
01:14:46,747 --> 01:14:49,045
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

800
01:14:49,216 --> 01:14:53,653
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

801
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:56,451
Maybe I just give a shit.

802
01:15:00,126 --> 01:15:01,115
You were good today.

803
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:04,892
You know that?

804
01:15:06,031 --> 01:15:07,522
You too.

805
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:13,403
"--that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

806
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:16,631
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

807
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:22,234
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

808
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:25,475
Cheers.

809
01:15:28,284 --> 01:15:30,878
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

810
01:15:31,053 --> 01:15:33,955
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

811
01:15:34,123 --> 01:15:38,651
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

812
01:15:40,096 --> 01:15:43,554
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

813
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:46,564
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

814
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:48,930
My experience suggests otherwise.

815
01:15:49,104 --> 01:15:50,900
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

816
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,773
In your long career as a journalist...

817
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:56,772
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

818
01:15:58,844 --> 01:16:00,277
No.

819
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:02,070
I'd say they're just people.

820
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:06,181
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

821
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:09,580
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

822
01:16:09,853 --> 01:16:12,322
...can give meaning to a life.

823
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:16,118
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

824
01:16:18,862 --> 01:16:20,352
Hey!

825
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,204
It's palm wine.

826
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:22,416
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

827
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,072
God.

828
01:17:24,252 --> 01:17:26,982
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

829
01:17:29,155 --> 01:17:30,384
I take notes.

830
01:17:33,093 --> 01:17:34,822
The Shona...

831
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,427
The Shona have a word for me.

832
01:17:40,267 --> 01:17:43,895
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

833
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,232
I didn't leave.

834
01:17:46,405 --> 01:17:50,739
<i>I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.</i>

835
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:52,542
Then you joined the army?

836
01:17:55,413 --> 01:17:57,573
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

837
01:17:57,749 --> 01:18:00,444
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

838
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,084
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

839
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:09,747
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

840
01:18:09,926 --> 01:18:13,658
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

841
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:17,229
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

842
01:18:19,467 --> 01:18:22,868
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

843
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:24,869
No more apartheid.

844
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,406
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

845
01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:30,065
Kumbaya.

846
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:33,606
We fought and died together,
you know?

847
01:18:33,778 --> 01:18:37,045
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

848
01:18:37,215 --> 01:18:39,080
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

849
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:43,117
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

850
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:46,347
Ivory, oil, gold:

851
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,053
Diamonds.

852
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:55,264
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

853
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,456
"I'm gonna get mine."

854
01:18:57,634 --> 01:18:59,225
You gonna steal his diamond?

855
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:10,438
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

856
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,476
That doesn't answer the question.

857
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:27,218
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

858
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:31,360
And it took him...

859
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:34,590
...about 20 years to get right.

860
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:37,766
What?

861
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:44,937
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

862
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:47,374
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

863
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:49,671
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

864
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:53,146
You lost both your parents.

865
01:19:54,049 --> 01:19:56,882
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

866
01:19:59,521 --> 01:20:01,852
Mom was raped and shot...

867
01:20:04,691 --> 01:20:07,785
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

868
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,058
I was 9.

869
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:16,259
Boohoo, right?

870
01:20:20,005 --> 01:20:22,131
Sometimes I wonder...

871
01:20:25,244 --> 01:20:28,304
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

872
01:20:31,949 --> 01:20:34,816
Then I look around and I realize...

873
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,177
...God left this place a long time ago.

874
01:20:45,896 --> 01:20:47,921
It's...

875
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:52,133
What's the point, huh?

876
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:37,597
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

877
01:21:37,774 --> 01:21:39,536
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

878
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,972
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

879
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,443
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

880
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:49,276
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

881
01:21:50,518 --> 01:21:51,576
Hello, little brothers.

882
01:21:51,752 --> 01:21:54,277
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

883
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:57,086
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

884
01:21:57,257 --> 01:21:58,917
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

885
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:01,322
Only RUF on the road.

886
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:03,429
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

887
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:04,960
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is--

888
01:22:07,234 --> 01:22:08,824
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

889
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:14,401
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

890
01:22:14,572 --> 01:22:16,871
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

891
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:18,804
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

892
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,809
Is there any wine left in that jug?

893
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:22,843
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

894
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:27,316
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

895
01:22:27,483 --> 01:22:30,477
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

896
01:22:30,755 --> 01:22:31,945
A comedian, huh?

897
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:48,533
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

898
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:01,945
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

899
01:23:02,113 --> 01:23:03,343
Papers, please.

900
01:23:07,518 --> 01:23:08,746
Excuse me.

901
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,855
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

902
01:23:12,023 --> 01:23:14,548
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

903
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:16,522
Will you?

904
01:23:17,227 --> 01:23:20,220
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

905
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:21,795
Hey.

906
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,322
Look who's alive, eh?

907
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,832
I told the H you'd be back.

908
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:30,738
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

909
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:32,736
Transport touches down at 1600.

910
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,670
She's with me, all right?

911
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:38,539
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

912
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:41,511
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

913
01:23:43,016 --> 01:23:45,041
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

914
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:48,051
Come on. The colonel's this way.

915
01:23:48,222 --> 01:23:50,054
Give me a minute, huh?

916
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:55,749
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

917
01:23:57,395 --> 01:23:59,089
That's correct.

918
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:02,128
You made it out. Well done.

919
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:04,267
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

920
01:24:04,934 --> 01:24:08,598
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

921
01:24:09,772 --> 01:24:10,966
The pink.

922
01:24:11,474 --> 01:24:14,068
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

923
01:24:14,244 --> 01:24:17,734
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

924
01:24:17,913 --> 01:24:19,539
Colonel?

925
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:22,517
Go get kitted. Yes?

926
01:24:28,822 --> 01:24:30,814
Move, move, move!

927
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:34,289
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

928
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:40,994
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

929
01:24:44,104 --> 01:24:45,798
How's Benjamin?

930
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:47,438
They say he'll live.

931
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:50,036
Good. Good.

932
01:24:57,448 --> 01:24:59,246
Listen, Maddy...

933
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:02,414
...I need you to do me one last favor.

934
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:04,819
Yeah?

935
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:08,451
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

936
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:11,285
<i>...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.</i>

937
01:25:17,331 --> 01:25:18,560
You're going in.

938
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:25,233
You and Solomon.

939
01:25:27,408 --> 01:25:28,396
You're going in now.

940
01:25:29,242 --> 01:25:31,437
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

941
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,014
You're an idiot.

942
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,186
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

943
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,346
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

944
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:52,655
It's my story.

945
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:56,230
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

946
01:25:56,399 --> 01:25:59,836
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

947
01:26:01,305 --> 01:26:04,170
Please, just give me two minutes.

948
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:22,320
Yeah.

949
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:35,326
- Hello.
- Hi.

950
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,730
<i>My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

951
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:41,369
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

952
01:26:41,537 --> 01:26:43,062
Well, that depends what they are.

953
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:47,199
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

954
01:26:47,944 --> 01:26:49,844
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

955
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:05,119
And before that you were with
the South African Defense--?

956
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:06,953
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

957
01:27:07,128 --> 01:27:10,565
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

958
01:27:10,732 --> 01:27:12,254
Angola, yeah.

959
01:27:13,867 --> 01:27:16,835
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

960
01:27:17,035 --> 01:27:18,504
- Thank you.
- Okay.

961
01:27:28,514 --> 01:27:29,913
Thank you, huh?

962
01:27:30,082 --> 01:27:32,515
Just keeping my end of the deal.

963
01:27:33,118 --> 01:27:34,415
Good luck to you, Solomon.

964
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,209
Okay.

965
01:27:37,388 --> 01:27:41,221
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

966
01:27:48,665 --> 01:27:51,257
- Listen, I--
- No, you listen.

967
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,769
In another life maybe, all right?

968
01:27:59,206 --> 01:28:01,037
Yeah. Sure.

969
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,573
Yeah.

970
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,040
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

971
01:28:14,987 --> 01:28:18,012
You know, I've got three sisters.

972
01:28:18,189 --> 01:28:20,819
They're all married to good men.

973
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:23,752
I prefer my life.

974
01:28:26,397 --> 01:28:30,857
Here is my office phone...

975
01:28:31,035 --> 01:28:33,400
...home phone, cellphone.

976
01:28:35,505 --> 01:28:38,669
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

977
01:28:49,852 --> 01:28:51,978
You better get on that plane, huh?

978
01:28:53,722 --> 01:28:55,621
You should get on that plane.

979
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,594
So should you.

980
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,195
You gonna call me?

981
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:18,497
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

982
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:21,809
Yeah, right.

983
01:29:43,631 --> 01:29:46,896
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

984
01:29:51,472 --> 01:29:53,063
Oh, shit.

985
01:29:53,339 --> 01:29:56,070
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

986
01:29:56,242 --> 01:29:58,837
You keep me posted. Right.

987
01:29:59,013 --> 01:30:02,811
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

988
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,815
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

989
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:10,544
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

990
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,384
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

991
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,328
Tell me about the stone.

992
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:28,127
Is it clear or is it milky?

993
01:30:28,302 --> 01:30:29,827
Clear.

994
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:32,404
And the color, is it strong?

995
01:30:32,573 --> 01:30:33,801
Does it hold the light?

996
01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:36,034
It is as you say.

997
01:30:36,476 --> 01:30:39,638
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

998
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:43,977
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

999
01:31:25,554 --> 01:31:26,919
Dia!

1000
01:31:28,823 --> 01:31:30,791
Stop the truck!

1001
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,254
I thought it was Dia.

1002
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:28,732
Wake up.

1003
01:32:30,576 --> 01:32:33,670
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1004
01:32:35,014 --> 01:32:38,143
You know, I once had this buddy...

1005
01:32:38,317 --> 01:32:40,182
...named Mabhoko.

1006
01:32:40,952 --> 01:32:44,183
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1007
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,355
Baboons.

1008
01:32:46,525 --> 01:32:49,390
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1009
01:32:50,495 --> 01:32:51,826
They're cunning.

1010
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:54,089
Cunning creatures.

1011
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:56,993
Fast, strong.

1012
01:32:57,168 --> 01:32:59,397
Got good eyesight.

1013
01:32:59,904 --> 01:33:03,930
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1014
01:33:04,107 --> 01:33:09,236
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1015
01:33:13,314 --> 01:33:14,747
By the smell of your shit.

1016
01:33:15,781 --> 01:33:17,248
It's not...

1017
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:20,146
It's not the same as a baboon's.

1018
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:25,949
But, you know, after you skin it...

1019
01:33:27,259 --> 01:33:29,489
...the flesh of a baboon...

1020
01:33:29,762 --> 01:33:32,162
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1021
01:33:35,566 --> 01:33:39,503
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1022
01:33:51,748 --> 01:33:53,908
You risk my life like that again...

1023
01:33:59,287 --> 01:34:01,415
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1024
01:34:03,925 --> 01:34:06,190
Do you understand?

1025
01:34:14,435 --> 01:34:16,494
Make us a fire.

1026
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:28,356
What'd he say?

1027
01:35:28,532 --> 01:35:30,660
We are going the right way.

1028
01:35:37,808 --> 01:35:40,537
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1029
01:35:42,011 --> 01:35:44,207
Where do you think you are going?

1030
01:35:45,879 --> 01:35:47,541
Stop!

1031
01:35:47,815 --> 01:35:49,510
I said, stop!

1032
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:51,508
He is not down there, all right?

1033
01:35:53,554 --> 01:35:57,216
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1034
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:59,653
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1035
01:35:59,825 --> 01:36:01,794
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1036
01:36:01,963 --> 01:36:03,588
You are not the master.

1037
01:36:03,762 --> 01:36:07,391
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1038
01:36:22,546 --> 01:36:23,877
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1039
01:36:24,047 --> 01:36:26,015
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1040
01:36:26,184 --> 01:36:28,515
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1041
01:36:28,684 --> 01:36:30,015
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1042
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:32,747
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1043
01:36:33,957 --> 01:36:37,393
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1044
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:41,761
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1045
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:44,160
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1046
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:49,726
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1047
01:36:57,577 --> 01:36:59,841
We wait until dark, huh?

1048
01:37:29,004 --> 01:37:30,402
Are you satisfied?

1049
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:35,898
All right, come on.

1050
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:42,842
<i>--is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

1051
01:37:43,016 --> 01:37:46,076
<i>RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

1052
01:37:46,253 --> 01:37:49,186
<i>Go tell my parents
They may see me no more</i>

1053
01:37:49,355 --> 01:37:52,415
<i>In the battlefield
We're fighting forever</i>

1054
01:37:52,591 --> 01:37:55,493
<i>Go tell my parents
They may see me no more</i>

1055
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,128
<i>In the battlefield...</i>

1056
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:01,666
You are how old?

1057
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:03,596
Me? I'm 31.

1058
01:38:03,768 --> 01:38:05,928
And you have no wife?

1059
01:38:06,403 --> 01:38:09,271
- No.
- No children?

1060
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:11,739
No.

1061
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:13,537
And no home?

1062
01:38:13,712 --> 01:38:15,371
No.

1063
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:18,480
But you have money, yes?

1064
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:20,912
Yeah, some.

1065
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:23,076
But not enough?

1066
01:38:25,585 --> 01:38:27,144
No.

1067
01:38:27,888 --> 01:38:32,382
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1068
01:38:34,526 --> 01:38:35,550
Yes.

1069
01:38:35,728 --> 01:38:38,526
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1070
01:38:38,696 --> 01:38:40,097
Probably not, no.

1071
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:43,155
What?

1072
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:46,794
What?

1073
01:38:47,206 --> 01:38:49,265
I am confused.

1074
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,808
Yeah?

1075
01:38:51,975 --> 01:38:54,774
<i>That makes two of us, my bru.</i>

1076
01:38:57,281 --> 01:39:00,772
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1077
01:39:01,385 --> 01:39:03,353
Why don't you?

1078
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:06,020
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1079
01:39:06,288 --> 01:39:10,815
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1080
01:39:18,234 --> 01:39:21,225
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1081
01:39:21,403 --> 01:39:24,566
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1082
01:39:24,973 --> 01:39:28,431
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1083
01:39:36,082 --> 01:39:39,779
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1084
01:39:40,019 --> 01:39:42,852
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1085
01:39:43,022 --> 01:39:46,751
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1086
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:00,201
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1087
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:06,968
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1088
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,308
I know good people...

1089
01:40:17,485 --> 01:40:20,351
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1090
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,880
...inside our black skin.

1091
01:40:22,055 --> 01:40:25,388
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1092
01:40:27,293 --> 01:40:30,090
But my son is good.

1093
01:40:31,664 --> 01:40:33,860
And when he grows up...

1094
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:35,261
...and peace comes...

1095
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:41,932
...this place will be a paradise.

1096
01:40:49,814 --> 01:40:52,281
We'll get your son back, huh?

1097
01:41:33,984 --> 01:41:36,317
Where is it exactly?

1098
01:41:37,854 --> 01:41:40,754
Through the camp, by the river.

1099
01:41:45,361 --> 01:41:47,056
Christ.

1100
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:49,157
Okay.

1101
01:41:49,797 --> 01:41:51,663
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1102
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:53,359
He'll send in an air strike.

1103
01:41:53,803 --> 01:41:56,771
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1104
01:41:56,939 --> 01:41:59,462
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1105
01:41:59,641 --> 01:42:00,938
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1106
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:04,703
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1107
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:17,020
Cordell, it's Danny.

1108
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:19,522
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1109
01:42:19,692 --> 01:42:22,556
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1110
01:42:22,725 --> 01:42:25,696
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP'ing its location.

1111
01:42:25,863 --> 01:42:27,454
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1112
01:42:27,631 --> 01:42:29,997
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1113
01:42:30,568 --> 01:42:33,434
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1114
01:42:33,602 --> 01:42:36,162
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1115
01:42:36,605 --> 01:42:39,631
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1116
01:42:39,809 --> 01:42:44,371
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1117
01:42:44,546 --> 01:42:46,809
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1118
01:42:49,584 --> 01:42:52,518
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1119
01:42:52,686 --> 01:42:55,349
I promise you he is not there.

1120
01:43:00,594 --> 01:43:02,789
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1121
01:43:02,963 --> 01:43:05,397
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1122
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:09,768
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1123
01:43:31,923 --> 01:43:34,914
Solomon. Shit.

1124
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:47,098
I can do it.

1125
01:43:47,268 --> 01:43:48,360
- Help me.
- Help him.

1126
01:43:48,534 --> 01:43:50,593
Thank you, Papa.

1127
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:34,770
Hey, you smell.

1128
01:44:35,977 --> 01:44:37,444
That's fine.

1129
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:51,724
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1130
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:53,552
Play, man.

1131
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:58,028
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1132
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:25,946
Dia.

1133
01:45:28,988 --> 01:45:30,684
Leave me alone.

1134
01:45:31,726 --> 01:45:34,957
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1135
01:45:35,129 --> 01:45:36,857
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1136
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,826
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1137
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,690
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1138
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:43,096
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1139
01:45:43,268 --> 01:45:44,566
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1140
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:46,466
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1141
01:45:46,638 --> 01:45:48,161
Get away from me!

1142
01:45:50,643 --> 01:45:52,507
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1143
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:55,241
- Don't shoot! Don't--! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1144
01:45:55,413 --> 01:45:57,313
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1145
01:45:57,481 --> 01:45:59,712
Get away from me!

1146
01:46:06,823 --> 01:46:08,985
I knew you would come back.

1147
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:12,950
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1148
01:46:13,129 --> 01:46:15,030
Nothing.

1149
01:46:15,297 --> 01:46:16,787
Dig, dig, dig!

1150
01:46:16,966 --> 01:46:19,265
You will find it for me.

1151
01:46:20,234 --> 01:46:22,532
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1152
01:46:22,703 --> 01:46:23,727
No.

1153
01:46:23,904 --> 01:46:26,337
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1154
01:46:27,074 --> 01:46:30,338
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1155
01:46:30,809 --> 01:46:33,404
RUF is fighting for the people!

1156
01:46:35,747 --> 01:46:38,841
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1157
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:43,415
Pick it up.

1158
01:46:44,623 --> 01:46:47,591
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1159
01:46:47,758 --> 01:46:50,851
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1160
01:46:53,697 --> 01:46:55,891
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1161
01:46:56,065 --> 01:46:58,294
...I will find the rest of your family.

1162
01:46:58,468 --> 01:47:00,902
Just as I have found your son.

1163
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:05,371
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1164
01:47:06,175 --> 01:47:08,473
...slit her throat...

1165
01:47:09,078 --> 01:47:11,443
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1166
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:19,285
You think I am a devil...

1167
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:21,785
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1168
01:47:23,423 --> 01:47:26,085
I want to get out.

1169
01:47:26,694 --> 01:47:28,787
You will help me.

1170
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:32,928
I don't remember.

1171
01:47:33,099 --> 01:47:36,067
Find it or your family will die!

1172
01:47:37,002 --> 01:47:38,868
Now pick it up!

1173
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,850
- Go!
- Bastards!

1174
01:47:56,018 --> 01:47:57,383
Shoot it!

1175
01:48:02,357 --> 01:48:03,345
Dia!

1176
01:48:15,435 --> 01:48:17,629
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1177
01:48:18,505 --> 01:48:19,733
Dia!

1178
01:48:42,626 --> 01:48:44,219
<i>Colonel, we think Archer's there.</i>

1179
01:48:44,395 --> 01:48:47,227
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1180
01:48:57,573 --> 01:48:58,833
Dia!

1181
01:49:13,585 --> 01:49:14,883
I'm coming!

1182
01:49:18,423 --> 01:49:20,084
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1183
01:49:43,245 --> 01:49:44,610
No!

1184
01:50:04,698 --> 01:50:06,030
Dia!

1185
01:51:12,256 --> 01:51:15,191
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1186
01:51:17,161 --> 01:51:19,355
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1187
01:51:19,529 --> 01:51:22,897
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1188
01:51:23,067 --> 01:51:26,400
So where is it? The stone?

1189
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:28,503
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1190
01:51:28,672 --> 01:51:30,299
Look around you, Danny boy.

1191
01:51:30,472 --> 01:51:33,441
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1192
01:51:33,609 --> 01:51:35,703
Then you will never find it, sir.

1193
01:51:35,879 --> 01:51:37,505
That's correct.

1194
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:41,807
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1195
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:45,680
Introduce me to your digger.

1196
01:51:47,252 --> 01:51:48,914
Solomon Vandy.

1197
01:51:49,088 --> 01:51:51,249
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1198
01:51:51,423 --> 01:51:54,451
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1199
01:51:54,627 --> 01:51:56,617
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1200
01:51:59,297 --> 01:52:00,992
Does he speak English?

1201
01:52:01,166 --> 01:52:04,191
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1202
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:08,094
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1203
01:52:14,844 --> 01:52:17,210
All right, my friend.

1204
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,314
End of the line here, huh?

1205
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:22,746
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1206
01:52:22,918 --> 01:52:26,355
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1207
01:52:28,057 --> 01:52:31,183
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1208
01:52:31,625 --> 01:52:34,388
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1209
01:52:34,562 --> 01:52:37,156
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1210
01:52:38,365 --> 01:52:41,198
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1211
01:52:41,368 --> 01:52:44,359
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1212
01:52:44,537 --> 01:52:46,199
Tell him!

1213
01:52:47,374 --> 01:52:49,169
- No.
- Fucking--

1214
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:52,037
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1215
01:52:52,211 --> 01:52:53,838
Yeah, yeah.

1216
01:53:02,017 --> 01:53:05,010
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1217
01:53:05,187 --> 01:53:07,586
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1218
01:53:07,756 --> 01:53:09,418
Agreed.

1219
01:53:14,596 --> 01:53:16,154
Come here.

1220
01:53:18,733 --> 01:53:22,169
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1221
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:27,103
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1222
01:53:29,877 --> 01:53:32,175
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1223
01:53:32,646 --> 01:53:35,546
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1224
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,412
Come on.

1225
01:53:56,367 --> 01:53:59,459
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1226
01:53:59,669 --> 01:54:02,934
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1227
01:54:03,106 --> 01:54:05,575
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1228
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:09,101
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1229
01:54:10,046 --> 01:54:11,740
I missed you, Danny.

1230
01:54:12,047 --> 01:54:16,211
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1231
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:19,078
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1232
01:54:34,133 --> 01:54:36,396
<i>Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?</i>

1233
01:54:36,868 --> 01:54:38,769
Smoking will kill you.

1234
01:54:39,537 --> 01:54:41,027
Sorry.

1235
01:54:44,107 --> 01:54:46,006
It's all right.

1236
01:54:46,176 --> 01:54:48,304
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1237
01:55:02,824 --> 01:55:04,156
- It's gone.
- What?

1238
01:55:04,326 --> 01:55:06,420
Someone has taken it.

1239
01:55:07,530 --> 01:55:11,294
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1240
01:55:11,766 --> 01:55:15,133
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1241
01:55:19,472 --> 01:55:21,134
Wait, wait, wait.

1242
01:55:21,308 --> 01:55:23,538
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1243
01:55:24,011 --> 01:55:26,002
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1244
01:55:31,183 --> 01:55:32,172
Yes.

1245
01:55:32,351 --> 01:55:35,716
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1246
01:55:35,886 --> 01:55:37,547
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1247
01:55:38,722 --> 01:55:40,121
Fuck!

1248
01:55:58,773 --> 01:56:00,706
TIA, huh, Danny?

1249
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,701
TIA.

1250
01:56:10,617 --> 01:56:14,074
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1251
01:56:16,289 --> 01:56:17,551
Keep digging.

1252
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:33,131
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1253
01:56:36,173 --> 01:56:37,764
Have you got it?

1254
01:56:39,209 --> 01:56:42,473
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1255
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:45,176
Oh, yes.

1256
01:56:47,349 --> 01:56:48,942
Solomon.

1257
01:56:55,754 --> 01:56:58,724
Dia, what are you doing?

1258
01:56:59,225 --> 01:57:00,715
Dia.

1259
01:57:03,063 --> 01:57:04,961
What are you doing?

1260
01:57:09,834 --> 01:57:11,132
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1261
01:57:17,075 --> 01:57:21,943
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1262
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:27,376
Your mother loves you so much.

1263
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:32,617
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1264
01:57:32,788 --> 01:57:35,450
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1265
01:57:37,726 --> 01:57:39,990
...and the new baby.

1266
01:57:48,902 --> 01:57:51,166
The cows wait for you.

1267
01:57:51,338 --> 01:57:57,139
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1268
01:57:59,713 --> 01:58:03,045
I know they made you do bad things...

1269
01:58:03,217 --> 01:58:05,683
...but you are not a bad boy.

1270
01:58:08,888 --> 01:58:11,287
I am your father...

1271
01:58:12,991 --> 01:58:15,286
...who loves you.

1272
01:58:16,559 --> 01:58:20,325
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1273
01:58:45,752 --> 01:58:48,118
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1274
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:49,845
We've got to--

1275
01:58:53,025 --> 01:58:55,722
Go, go! Move!

1276
01:58:58,497 --> 01:59:00,054
Move. Move.

1277
01:59:00,231 --> 01:59:01,527
Move, move, move!

1278
01:59:01,698 --> 01:59:04,725
Move! Move! Move!

1279
01:59:06,337 --> 01:59:07,564
How far?

1280
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:09,798
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1281
01:59:09,974 --> 01:59:12,066
A plane will meet us, huh?

1282
01:59:12,476 --> 01:59:14,842
Hey, stop. Stop.

1283
01:59:17,113 --> 01:59:21,106
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1284
01:59:28,624 --> 01:59:31,683
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1285
01:59:37,997 --> 01:59:40,055
Nabil, where are you?

1286
01:59:41,133 --> 01:59:43,760
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1287
01:59:43,935 --> 01:59:47,394
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1288
01:59:47,572 --> 01:59:49,472
<i>- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.</i>

1289
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,233
<i>Lose them.</i>

1290
02:00:05,387 --> 02:00:07,481
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1291
02:00:07,657 --> 02:00:08,954
You must stop and rest.

1292
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:11,957
What? And give up the damn stone?

1293
02:00:12,128 --> 02:00:14,187
Keep moving. Come on.

1294
02:00:48,827 --> 02:00:51,159
Come. Come, come.

1295
02:01:38,269 --> 02:01:40,566
I can't. Stop.

1296
02:01:40,737 --> 02:01:42,798
- Okay.
- Stop.

1297
02:02:11,266 --> 02:02:12,358
Come on.

1298
02:02:12,966 --> 02:02:15,560
No! God, no. Stop.

1299
02:02:16,669 --> 02:02:20,002
Christ. No more. No more.

1300
02:03:03,945 --> 02:03:05,639
Take it, huh?

1301
02:03:08,049 --> 02:03:11,245
- Mr. Archer--
- Take it, take it.

1302
02:03:18,324 --> 02:03:20,088
I thought you would steal it from me.

1303
02:03:21,928 --> 02:03:25,556
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1304
02:03:36,506 --> 02:03:38,132
Listen...

1305
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:43,508
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1306
02:03:43,678 --> 02:03:45,839
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1307
02:03:50,084 --> 02:03:52,052
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1308
02:03:52,219 --> 02:03:55,279
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1309
02:03:55,456 --> 02:03:56,922
I can carry you.

1310
02:04:09,835 --> 02:04:11,302
You take your boy home, huh?

1311
02:04:16,474 --> 02:04:19,135
You take him home, huh?

1312
02:04:23,681 --> 02:04:25,443
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1313
02:04:26,284 --> 02:04:27,376
Go on!

1314
02:04:33,122 --> 02:04:34,987
Come on. Come on.

1315
02:04:41,798 --> 02:04:44,162
Archer, you're a dead man!

1316
02:04:44,332 --> 02:04:46,164
Yeah, yeah.

1317
02:05:16,861 --> 02:05:18,225
Dia.

1318
02:05:39,447 --> 02:05:40,607
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1319
02:05:40,849 --> 02:05:42,679
Yeah.

1320
02:05:43,017 --> 02:05:44,678
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1321
02:05:45,586 --> 02:05:49,646
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1322
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:52,784
When am I gonna see you?

1323
02:05:53,926 --> 02:05:59,661
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1324
02:06:00,366 --> 02:06:04,893
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1325
02:06:05,104 --> 02:06:07,799
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1326
02:06:10,807 --> 02:06:12,866
We found his son...

1327
02:06:13,843 --> 02:06:17,244
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1328
02:06:18,013 --> 02:06:19,106
<i>Maddy?</i>

1329
02:06:21,917 --> 02:06:23,782
You're hurt.

1330
02:06:24,418 --> 02:06:25,476
Are you hurt?

1331
02:06:25,653 --> 02:06:28,817
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1332
02:06:33,394 --> 02:06:37,091
Okay. You--
You tell me where you are.

1333
02:06:40,365 --> 02:06:41,389
<i>Archer?</i>

1334
02:06:53,544 --> 02:06:58,278
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1335
02:06:59,685 --> 02:07:01,312
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1336
02:07:01,487 --> 02:07:05,149
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1337
02:07:08,358 --> 02:07:09,689
I don't think so.

1338
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:13,191
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1339
02:07:13,362 --> 02:07:17,628
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1340
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,201
<i>And keep him out of sight.</i>

1341
02:07:20,803 --> 02:07:23,533
<i>And get Solomon to London.</i>

1342
02:07:26,674 --> 02:07:29,439
He's bringing something with him.

1343
02:07:30,109 --> 02:07:32,043
But he's gonna need your help.

1344
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:35,109
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1345
02:07:36,616 --> 02:07:41,677
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1346
02:07:42,587 --> 02:07:44,315
And you can write the hell out of it.

1347
02:07:51,529 --> 02:07:54,053
I'm really happy I met you.

1348
02:07:55,633 --> 02:07:56,621
You know that?

1349
02:07:59,969 --> 02:08:02,097
Yeah, I'm...

1350
02:08:03,306 --> 02:08:06,365
I'm really happy I met you too.

1351
02:08:06,975 --> 02:08:10,968
<i>And I wish I could be there with you.</i>

1352
02:08:11,847 --> 02:08:13,814
That's all right.

1353
02:08:16,350 --> 02:08:18,751
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1354
02:09:12,366 --> 02:09:14,698
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1355
02:09:14,868 --> 02:09:16,892
...and I'll wait for you here.

1356
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:18,993
You're not coming.

1357
02:09:19,171 --> 02:09:22,437
I'm not here. Good luck.

1358
02:09:44,094 --> 02:09:46,756
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1359
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:52,994
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1360
02:09:56,307 --> 02:09:59,273
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1361
02:09:59,442 --> 02:10:03,307
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1362
02:10:03,477 --> 02:10:06,176
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1363
02:10:09,648 --> 02:10:12,174
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1364
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,509
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1365
02:10:15,188 --> 02:10:16,814
I will have the money too.

1366
02:10:18,123 --> 02:10:19,647
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1367
02:10:19,822 --> 02:10:22,587
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1368
02:10:23,362 --> 02:10:25,158
How do I even know you've got it?

1369
02:12:33,043 --> 02:12:35,808
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1370
02:12:35,977 --> 02:12:39,881
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1371
02:12:40,047 --> 02:12:42,641
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1372
02:12:42,816 --> 02:12:45,216
- Mr. Van De Kaap--
- That's all I have to say.

1373
02:12:45,386 --> 02:12:46,787
The natural resources
of a country...

1374
02:12:48,789 --> 02:12:51,759
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1375
02:12:53,093 --> 02:12:58,552
<i>...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.</i>

1376
02:13:08,472 --> 02:13:10,532
They're ready for you, sir.

1377
02:13:12,042 --> 02:13:14,441
The Third World is not a world apart.

1378
02:13:14,611 --> 02:13:19,277
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1379
02:13:19,447 --> 02:13:23,316
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1380
02:13:23,485 --> 02:13:27,010
And let us ignore it no more.

1381
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:30,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.

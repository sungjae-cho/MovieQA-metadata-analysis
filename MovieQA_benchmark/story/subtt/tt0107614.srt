1
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:21,288
Salutations, snack.

2
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:24,655
On second thought...

3
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,926
9-1-1!

4
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:32,028
Police! Civic authorities! ASPCA! ASAP!

5
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,733
Murder! Betrayal! Kidnapped!

6
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,502
No, bird-napped!

7
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:40,477
A cup of garlic, a twist of parakeet.

8
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:43,072
Eat your heart out, Julia Child.

9
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:49,646
Excuse me, but isn't it customary
for the jailbird to get one telephone call?

10
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:51,784
In your case, I think not.

11
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,520
Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.

12
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,721
But I'm not wholly without heart.

13
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,530
How about a nice soothing cigarette?

14
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,204
Oh, I will not do this. I cannot!

15
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,738
Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
I don't want to get beak cancer.

16
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,341
No! My lungs are blackened!

17
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:18,145
Here we go again. Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.

18
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,914
- Help me...
- What are you doing? Daniel...

19
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,922
That line is not in the script.
Why did you add it?

20
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:27,482
- I wanted to comment on the situation.
- What situation?

21
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:31,753
Shoving a cigarette into Pudgie's mouth
is morally irresponsible.

22
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:35,700
This is a cartoon,
not a friggin' Oprah Winfrey Special.

23
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,899
Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.
It's like telling them ''Light up.''

24
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:43,704
You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
if his mouth isn't moving.

25
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:47,440
It's voice-over. An interior monologue.
Maybe even the voice of God.

26
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:50,582
Pudgie, don't smoke.

27
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,778
- Actors.
- What? Let's ask the technicians.

28
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:58,052
Do you think it's morally right
to promote smoking to the youth of America?

29
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:05,787
- They're biased. That's a mistrial.
- This session costs the studio thousands.

30
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,596
If you want a paycheque, stick to the script.

31
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:12,729
If you want to play Gandhi,
then do it on somebody else's time.

32
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,612
Then I've got to do what I've got to do.

33
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,616
That's very funny.
Where the hell are you goin'?

34
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:27,346
If you leave, you're not comin' back in.

35
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,389
I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.

36
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:33,551
Well, in the words of Porky Pig:

37
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,189
Piss off, Lou.

38
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,397
- So what about that history test?
- Don't ask.

39
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:18,327
- Did you have fun in school?
- I painted a picture of a rainbow.

40
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:24,209
- Dad?
- Daddy!

41
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:26,670
Daddy!

42
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:34,249
- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
- Well, I got off early.

43
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:38,849
- You mean you got fired?
- No, I quit. For reasons of conscience.

44
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:39,914
Actors.

45
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:46,158
Dude, congratulations
on your 12th birthday. Got a surprise for ya.

46
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,358
- A stripper?
- Ooh, please!

47
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,332
- Two strippers?
- Hoo-hah, boy!

48
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:51,768
- A party?
- Yes!

49
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,930
No. No parties.

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,635
Mom said you couldn't have one
because of your report card.

51
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:02,705
Mom's not gonna be
home for another four hours, is she?

52
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:08,076
Prepare yourself... for the wild kingdom.

53
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:32,872
Coming up toward the very end.
There she goes. And she wins that race.

54
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,005
Come on off now. Here we go.

55
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,942
You want to feed him?

56
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,480
See if this guy will.

57
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,952
Sorry.

58
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,386
Get out!

59
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:19,214
- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.
- Miranda Hillard, please.

60
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:26,422
I know what you're going for with these
murals, but perhaps if they weren't so large.

61
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,229
And let's do steel windows, not wood.

62
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:33,329
Eliminate the Oriental rug.
Let's try an Aubusson carpet.

63
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,931
- More pink than red.
- Good idea.

64
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,068
Union Square Inn. This is better.

65
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:43,411
More Arts and Crafts. A Dirk Van Erp lamp,
a Stickley chair. Don't be seduced by chintz.

66
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,281
Excuse me. Miranda,
can I speak to you for a minute?

67
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,683
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

68
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,847
Just be one minute.

69
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,894
I just got off the phone
with a Stuart Dunmeyer.

70
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:58,589
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- He said you were acquaintances.

71
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,996
Stuart Dunmeyer?

72
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:04,230
He's putting millions into restoring
the old Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.

73
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:09,298
- He wants to make it into a $500-a-night B&B.
- Yes, I read about it.

74
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,502
- He's been doing very well.
- That's him.

75
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:16,070
And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.

76
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,774
He did?

77
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,979
- I told him you'd call first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, I will.

78
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,580
Miss Hillard? The operator
has a Gloria Chaney on hold.

79
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:28,991
- She says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.

80
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,597
Gloria?

81
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,011
- Oh, my God!
- Is this your residence, ma'am?

82
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,139
Yes, I'm sorry to say it is.

83
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:53,413
Are you aware it's illegal to possess
barnyard animals in a residential area?

84
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,456
- What if you're married to one?
- We're also responding to a noise violation.

85
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:01,891
I'm going to respond myself.
I'm awfully sorry about this.

86
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,054
You ate my begonias! God!

87
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,525
Get out of my way!

88
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,519
Miranda! Whassup?

89
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,362
You're home early, girlfriend.

90
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,899
Havin' a birthday in the house.

91
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,568
What the hell is going on around here?

92
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,297
Don't get mad, honey. Listen.

93
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:24,173
You're home a little early. I was gonna
clean it all up before you got home.

94
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,346
Honey... What are you looking for?

95
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:33,915
I'd be careful. That pony had a lot of water.

96
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,926
Party's over.

97
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:52,164
She called you
and you bust the birthday party. Great!

98
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:55,969
Don't you dare
make me out to be the monster here, Daniel!

99
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,738
You have all the fun
and I get whatever's left over.

100
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:03,214
- You chose the career.
- I have no choices here. I have no choices!

101
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:06,775
Even when I try to do something fun,
you do it ten times bigger!

102
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:10,584
I bring home a cake and gifts.
You bring the goddamn San Diego Zoo!

103
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,820
- And I have to clean up!
- It's not toxic waste, just a few party plates!

104
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,886
Why am I the only one
that feels there has to be rules?

105
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:20,363
Why do you always
make me out to be the heavy?

106
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,231
I don't. You do it yourself quite naturally.

107
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:27,171
- You set me up every time to be the bad guy.
- Oh, lighten up, will ya?

108
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,574
You spend too much time with
those corporate clones you used to despise.

109
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,511
I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
It's over!

110
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,673
It's over.

111
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:43,387
Come on, Miranda. We've got problems,
but who doesn't? We could work 'em out.

112
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,387
We've been trying to work them out
for 14 years.

113
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,295
Come on, please. Listen.
Maybe we need some help, OK?

114
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:55,492
Maybe a family therapist
will help us do this together.

115
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,627
It's too late for that.

116
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:02,300
Well, let's take a vacation with the kids,
as a family. Get you away from work.

117
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:05,809
You're a different person.
You really are. You're great.

118
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:09,336
Our problems would be waiting for us
when we got back.

119
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,850
We'll move, and hopefully
our problems won't follow us.

120
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,149
Daniel, please don’t joke.

121
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,424
OK.

122
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:25,086
We've just grown apart. We're different.

123
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:29,294
- We have nothing in common.
- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.

124
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,636
Come on, Miranda. We love each other.

125
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:45,375
Don't we?

126
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,682
I want a divorce.

127
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,151
No.

128
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,732
We can't. We're a family. You know?

129
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,665
I'm so sorry.

130
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,541
Yeah, Ma, he told me all about it.

131
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,010
Yeah, Ma. I heard, I heard.

132
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,747
- Well, yeah, he's here.
- No.

133
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,387
Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.

134
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,954
Yeah, depressed.
I mean, his marriage is ending.

135
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:10,264
My marriage is not ending. It's just on hiatus.

136
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,405
Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.

137
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:19,172
No, we're taking good care of your little boy.
Don't worry, Mom.

138
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,612
- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
- She says you're welcome.

139
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:26,140
That beige concealer.
When are we gettin' more of it?

140
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,881
- Next week.
- You hear that, Ma? Next week.

141
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,784
Wait, hang on.

142
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,621
- Enough already. It's a man.
- How would you know?

143
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,422
Bitch.

144
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,862
No, Ma, not you. I was talkin' about the dog.

145
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:42,596
Ma, listen. We got people
waitin' for us on the set.

146
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:46,468
Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.
Places to go, faces to paint.

147
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,107
Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.

148
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,039
Don't worry, I'll tell him.

149
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah. Hold on, Ma.

150
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,781
She wants to know
if you want to come stay with her.

151
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:59,682
- No way.
- He says he'll think about it, Ma.

152
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,647
I will. All right. I love you, too.

153
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,815
Bye, Ma.

154
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:10,088
Hey, listen, you know you can always
stay with us just as long as you want.

155
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:14,599
Thank you, but I'm OK, really.
I mean, this is just a temporary thing.

156
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,431
I know Miranda. It's gonna blow over.

157
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:27,842
Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
proceedings tend to favour the mother,

158
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:33,250
we also realize, perhaps now more than
ever, that it is not in a child's best interest

159
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,516
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father.

160
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:44,954
However, since at the present time Mr Hillard
has no place to live and no employment,

161
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:49,227
it is the court's ruling
to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.

162
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,566
- Congratulations.
- No.

163
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,232
Mr Hillard will have visitation rights
every Saturday.

164
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,708
- Can't you do something?
- He's made his decision.

165
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:01,144
Isn’t it traditional
to say ''I object'' or something?

166
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:02,976
Your Honour, please.

167
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,547
Every Saturday? That's one day a week.

168
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,984
That's not enough.

169
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:14,287
I have to be with my children. It's not
a question. I have to be with them, sir. Please.

170
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,887
I know it seems like a lot,
but for me it's not enough. Really.

171
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:22,697
I haven't been away from 'em for more than
one day since the day they were born.

172
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:26,670
- Mr Hillard, this ruling is only temporary.
- Oh, good.

173
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,936
I will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case.

174
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,342
There will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days.

175
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,381
- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
- Thank you.

176
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:41,112
Three months in which to get a job,
keep it and create a suitable home.

177
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,814
If this proves to be a possibility for you,

178
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:49,759
I will consider a joint-custody arrangement
when we reconvene. We're adjourned.

179
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,698
Well, it looks like there is
a little light at the end of our tunnel.

180
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:28,731
- That's all my stuff.
- This is all my fault.

181
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,626
God, no. Why would you think that?

182
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:34,262
I should have never had a birthday, Dad.

183
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,274
- This never would have happened.
- Yes, it would.

184
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,641
It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?

185
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,271
You did nothing wrong. You got that?

186
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,543
OK, gimme five.

187
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,218
You're the man of the house now.

188
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,420
Don't be messy.

189
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:01,624
- You can't go now.
- Honey, I have to.

190
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:07,002
We're in the middle of Charlotte`s Web.
Who's gonna finish it?

191
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,165
Well, Grandma will finish it for you.

192
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:17,107
She's not as good. She always skips parts,
and she never does the voices.

193
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:19,309
She smells funny, too.

194
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,578
That's the formaldehyde.
That's why Granny's so well preserved.

195
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,459
Hey, come here.

196
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:33,795
It's the same as always.
We just have a really big backyard, OK?

197
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,858
- I love you.
- I love you.

198
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:44,075
I'll miss you. Saturday comes real quick.

199
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:48,943
- I'll miss you.
- Ditto.

200
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:51,278
Oh, Dad...

201
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,678
- Take care of her.
- OK.

202
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,949
Goodbye.

203
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,656
Thanks for the time, warden.

204
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,065
Bye, Dad.

205
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:38,820
As your court liaison,
I will be looking at two things.

206
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:43,164
- Your living environment...
- It's more like a habitat, really.

207
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:49,908
And I will be coming by on Monday
and Friday evenings to inspect it.

208
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,967
Well, I'll put on a chicken.

209
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:54,838
And there's always the job issue.

210
00:18:54,948 --> 00:19:00,580
This is the nearest employment office. I took
the liberty of making an appointment for you.

211
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,384
- Thank you.
- By the way, do you have any special skills?

212
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,583
Oh, yes. I do.

213
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,718
I do voices.

214
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,425
What do you mean, you do voices?

215
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,632
Well, I do voices.

216
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:15,666
Yes!

217
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:18,635
We're looking for intelligent life.
Oops, mistake!

218
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:22,037
Happy to be in America.
Don't ask for a green card.

219
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,632
I want you in the worst way.

220
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:28,475
This is certainly a rough meeting.
It's not going very well for me.

221
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:32,244
Hey, boss, give her a chance.
She's gonna loosen up any moment.

222
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:36,288
Look at me, Moneypenny.
I want to undo that bow and get to know you.

223
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,857
I'm crazy to make a deal with you!

224
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,825
Nancy and I are still looking for
the other half of my head.

225
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:45,694
They're doin' it! I'm sittin' on a gold mine!

226
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,198
Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.

227
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,198
I do a great impression of a hot dog.

228
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:57,002
Mr Hillard, do you
consider yourself humorous?

229
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:59,169
I used to.

230
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,408
There was a time when I found myself funny.

231
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:05,645
But today you have proven me wrong.
Thank you.

232
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,047
Listen, bottom line...

233
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:14,725
I need to be with my children,
and I'll do anything to do that.

234
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,886
You just tell me what to do.

235
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,480
- Excuse me. You Tony?
- That's me.

236
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,519
Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.

237
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,717
Follow me.

238
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,527
Oh, films! Will I be
introducing these movies on air?

239
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,097
- Not exactly.
- What do I do?

240
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,431
You take all these cans.
You box 'em and you ship 'em.

241
00:20:56,502 --> 00:21:00,131
Then you box those cans over there.
Ship them. Then more will come in.

242
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,134
You box those, you ship those.

243
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,301
Any questions?

244
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,539
After you box 'em...?

245
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:10,878
You ship 'em.

246
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,043
Lots of luck, smartass.

247
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:19,557
I think I made a friend.

248
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:28,900
- Miranda.
- Stu!

249
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,675
Hello, Miranda.

250
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:39,472
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

251
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:46,314
Mr Dunmeyer's come by
to look over your sketches.

252
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,283
Let me show you to the conference room.

253
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:55,221
As you probably know,
the estate was built in 1876.

254
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,822
These sketches are meant to reflect
your desire to have it completely restored.

255
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,923
You look better than ever.

256
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:07,496
The lobby will resemble a music salon with
inspiration from the French Second Empire.

257
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,508
I was thinking a 17th-century grand piano...

258
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:14,171
I've been following your career
these past couple of years.

259
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:19,184
A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
a brass-bound Regency-style table...

260
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:23,018
I'd love to get reacquainted. Catch up.

261
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:26,824
Mantel clocks.

262
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:29,759
Fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.

263
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,456
Can we talk? Over dinner, maybe?

264
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:37,726
Stuart, thank you. I...

265
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm at the beginning of a divorce.

266
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,568
It just didn't work out.

267
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:48,011
- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to say that.

268
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,744
No, really. I mean, I never
held any grudges or anything. I just...

269
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:56,083
Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.

270
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:58,682
Oh, God, that's so nice.

271
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:03,194
I was just worried my coming in here
might scare you off the project.

272
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,355
No, no. Of course not. I...

273
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,663
I'm a professional. I'm...

274
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:14,001
I was flattered that you thought of me
after all these years and everything.

275
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,701
Yeah, everything.

276
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,040
Well... Ancient history.

277
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,409
Yeah.

278
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,118
I'm late. I've got a meeting over at the bank.

279
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,722
Can we talk maybe later in the week?

280
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:39,627
- Sure.
- Good.

281
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,224
It's good to see you again.

282
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,416
Good, huh?

283
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:12,623
I know the place
doesn't look like much now, but...

284
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:15,223
It'll be OK. How do you like it?

285
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,160
- Nice.
- It's OK.

286
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,263
Detestable.

287
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:24,702
Hey, just give me some time.

288
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:28,079
I'm not too comfortable
with this new lifestyle.

289
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:30,081
Neither are we.

290
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,108
I know it's hard, sweetie.

291
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
Can't you just tell Mom you're sorry?

292
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,682
Wish I could.

293
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,127
You know, grown-up problems...

294
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:47,063
They're a little more complicated, Nattie.

295
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,499
How is the old battle-axe?

296
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,505
- Your mom.
- She's fine.

297
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:58,100
Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

298
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:04,080
I'd hate to think that she came down
with amoebic dysentery or piles.

299
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,414
What's amoebic dysentery?

300
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:10,747
It's an infection in your tummy
where you get diarrhoea forever.

301
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:14,759
- Diarrhoea forever?
- And your body dries up and you die.

302
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:18,126
- You die?
- You don't have to be so graphic with her.

303
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:23,692
- I read about it in a science book.
- Why would you want Mommy to die?

304
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,162
Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.

305
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,207
Then why did you say that?

306
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:36,513
Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.

307
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:40,780
We only get to come here once a week.
That's not very much.

308
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:44,619
You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

309
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:49,525
Nattie, I'll think good thoughts, OK?

310
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:54,528
- About Mommy?
- I'll try. I really will.

311
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,536
- And call her a princess.
- Oh, yes.

312
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,334
And right now I feel like a toad.

313
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,809
Daddy's a toad.

314
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,981
- That's Mom.
- Can't be. She's an hour early.

315
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,449
Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.

316
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,386
No, no! Come on, sit down.

317
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,224
Sit down!

318
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,561
You don't have to run off
when she honks the horn.

319
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,363
Come on, you're on my time now.

320
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:33,462
You're my goddamn kids, too!

321
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:41,476
Come on.

322
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,584
Hi.

323
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:54,860
Oh, Daniel... Charming.

324
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,624
Thank you, Miranda.
I was going for a refugee motif.

325
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:01,098
Fleeing-my-homeland kind of thing.

326
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,265
But look at you!

327
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:08,136
This lovely Dances With Wolves motif.
What's your Indian name: Shops With A Fist?

328
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:11,877
- Are my children ready yet?
- No, our children are not ready yet...

329
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:16,108
..because you are an hour early
and you were late dropping them off.

330
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:22,118
Daniel, I don't have time for this. I have to
drop something off at the newspaper office.

331
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:25,485
Newspaper? Are you taking out
one of those personal ads?

332
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,291
''DWF seeks WWM with BMW,
into light B&D''?

333
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,828
I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.

334
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:37,332
Housekeeper?
Why do you need a housekeeper?

335
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:43,102
I need someone to be there when the children
get home from school, to clean, start dinner...

336
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,576
- How much are you gonna pay?
- $300 a week. Is that all right?

337
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,948
May I see the ad?

338
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:56,920
- I have a right as their father. Please?
- All right. Anything else you wanna see?

339
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,685
- Are you offering?
- Not any more.

340
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,317
What's the change?

341
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,385
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.

342
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,558
Miranda, why not let me
take care of the kids?

343
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:13,536
I'll pick 'em up after school, be with them,
then drop them off at your house after work.

344
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,198
- That'd be great!
- Please!

345
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:18,003
- Look. The kids love it.
- Mommy, please!

346
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,704
I'll think about it.

347
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,885
We're his goddamn kids, too.

348
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,491
Kids say the darndest things.

349
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:41,097
Thank you. Any other choice phrases
you'd like to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?

350
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,504
Come on, everybody get their coats.

351
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,938
- Put them on and let's get out of here.
- OK, Mom.

352
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:53,536
I would say go to the bathroom before we go,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

353
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:00,975
Don't forget anything.
I don't wanna come back.

354
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,112
Come on, let's go.

355
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:06,650
- See you Saturday.
- Say goodbye to your father.

356
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,818
Goodbye, Daddy.

357
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,861
- Here's your ad.
- I'll get my purse.

358
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:15,024
Yeah, you'd better.

359
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:32,943
Hello. Are you calling
in response to the ad?

360
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,057
- Who was your previous employer?
- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.

361
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,683
- In a band?
- I just wanna know one thing.

362
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:46,891
Are your kids well-behaved, or do they need,
like, a few light slams every now and then?

363
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:50,665
- I'll have to get back to you.
- Wow!

364
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:58,843
Ja, my name is Ilsa Himmelman. I want
to know how many children do you have?

365
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:02,472
- I have two girls and a boy.
- Oh, a boy!

366
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:06,278
I don't work with the males
’cos I used to be one.

367
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,216
Yikes.

368
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,417
Hello.

369
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:20,794
Leyla, get back in your cell!
Don't make me get the hose!

370
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:21,890
Hello?

371
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,808
I am job.

372
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:34,907
- Do you speak English?
- I am job.

373
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:38,149
I'm sorry. The position has been filled.

374
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,741
Oh, what a nightmare!

375
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:45,284
Let's go in for the kill.

376
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:56,096
Hello?

377
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,296
I'm calling in regards
to the ad I read in the paper.

378
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:05,309
Yes. Well, would you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

379
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:07,670
Oh, certainly, dear.

380
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:12,740
For the past 15 years I've worked for
the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.

381
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,910
That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.

382
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:22,323
And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,
and took care of their four glorious children.

383
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:27,661
I grew quite attached to them after 15
years, but they grew up, as children tend to.

384
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:32,898
Oh, but listen to me. I am going on when you
should be telling me about your little ones.

385
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:36,100
- Well, I have two girls...
- Oh, two precious gems.

386
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,370
No doubt the jewel of your eye.

387
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:42,777
- And one boy.
- Oh, the little prince. How wonderful.

388
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:46,308
I must tell you,
a little light cooking is required.

389
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:49,377
Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
I'd love some heavy cooking.

390
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:53,982
But I do have one rule: they'll only eat
good, nutritious food with me.

391
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:58,325
And if there's any dispute, it's either
good, wholesome food or empty tummies.

392
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:01,332
That's my rule.
I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.

393
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:03,730
No!

394
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:08,102
Would you mind coming on an interview?
Say, Monday night at 7.30?

395
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,006
- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
- Wonderful.

396
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:16,037
I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.

397
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:18,378
Steiner. Oh, how lovely.

398
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:22,546
- Could you tell me your name?
- My name?

399
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:25,783
I thought I gave it to you, dear.

400
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,325
No.

401
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:34,826
- Doubtfire.
- I beg your pardon?

402
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:38,331
Doubtfire, dear. Mrs Doubtfire.

403
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:42,932
- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.

404
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,476
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

405
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:51,207
Showtime.

406
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,189
- Daniel, hi.
- Could you make me a woman?

407
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,552
Honey, I'm so happy!

408
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:06,257
- Oh, come here.
- I knew you'd understand.

409
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,296
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Don't whine. Just relax.

410
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:14,372
- Are you sure?
- Just remember, pain is beauty.

411
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,240
OK, take a deep breath. Instant eye lift.

412
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,039
And the strings are under the wig.

413
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:27,781
- The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
- All right, we'll start with make-up.

414
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:31,414
- I'm not gonna wax.
- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.

415
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,017
- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
- You look like her mother.

416
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,888
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.

417
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:42,198
OK, everyone. Let's pray.

418
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:49,003
I hope you are using Jungle Red.
That is the colour I love.

419
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,133
- Matches your lips.
- God bless you.

420
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:54,610
I'm feeling fabulous
because I met this beautiful Cuban.

421
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,114
Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.

422
00:33:57,216 --> 00:34:00,151
I can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.

423
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:04,951
I don't know. This would scare the children.
Maybe this is too much for them.

424
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,823
I think we have to go to the next level.

425
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,724
Latex.

426
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,324
Oy, it was such a shandeh.

427
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:16,959
I should never buy gribbenes from a mohel.
It's so chewy.

428
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:20,334
- No, I feel like Bubbee. This is not working.
- Don't worry.

429
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:24,933
It's a work in progress and you're my brother.
I will never let you be embarrassed.

430
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,568
- God bless you.
- We'll have to do the entire face.

431
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,170
But look at this nice thing we have here.

432
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:52,694
It's not working. I need to go older.

433
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:56,502
Older? Like Shelley Winters older
or Shirley MacLaine older?

434
00:34:56,575 --> 00:35:00,102
- What's the difference?
- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.

435
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,910
- What about Joan Collins?
- I don't think I have the strength.

436
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,075
But I have some plaster.

437
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:11,373
Are we close?

438
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,817
Any closer and you'd be Mom.

439
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,962
That's disgusting!

440
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:37,767
The most revolting thing I've ever seen.

441
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:39,640
Awesome.

442
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,907
What is this? Turn it off, will you?

443
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:47,382
Come on. I want you
to meet this lady with me.

444
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:51,047
I want you to be polite to her, then...
tell me what you think.

445
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:55,492
Everybody stand over here
and help me decide what to do.

446
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,825
Hello. Mrs Hillard, I presume.

447
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,062
Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.

448
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,469
Euphegenia Doubtfire.

449
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:09,905
Yes. Won't you please come in?

450
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:12,442
Thank you, dear.

451
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,946
- And these must be the cherubs.
- Yes.

452
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:20,109
- This is Natalie.
- Oh, hello, Natalie.

453
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:22,482
- Are you wearing bug spray?
- Nattie!

454
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:27,218
It's quite all right, dear. No offense taken.
I was a little liberal with the atomizer.

455
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:31,558
And at my age, it's like a good Stilton.
Everything has its own aroma.

456
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:36,123
I admire that honesty, Nattie.
That's a noble quality. Never lose that.

457
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,931
It often disappears with age
or entering politics.

458
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:43,769
Look at that face.
You remind me of Stuart Little,

459
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,333
one of the most honourable creatures
in all of literature.

460
00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:51,746
- Do you know that book, Stuart Little?
- Yeah! It's one of my favourites.

461
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,786
Mine, too! Maybe I could read it to you -
if I get the position.

462
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:59,323
- That would be wonderful.
- And who is this strapping young lad?

463
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:01,689
- This is Chris.
- Hello, Christopher.

464
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,591
Hello.

465
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:07,495
Jeez, you're big for a lady.
You could play for the 49ers.

466
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:11,502
Well, I was a fullback.
But that's European football, dear.

467
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,061
- Soccer?
- Yes. You play soccer, too?

468
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:16,402
- Yeah!
- Oh, isn't that amazing?

469
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:21,070
Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
We won three university championships.

470
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,272
Oh, but that was decades ago!

471
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:27,808
But I was more disciplined then. I always
put my studies ahead of my athletics.

472
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:31,616
I'm sure you're the same
and you've done all your homework already.

473
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:35,386
- Well, not exactly.
- Really? Oh. That's a pity.

474
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:40,989
Young men who don't do their studies
often miss out on more amusing activities.

475
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,797
- And who is this young lady?
- This is Lydia.

476
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,831
Hello, Lydia.

477
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,501
This isn't fair, Mom.
Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?

478
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,104
- This is all I need.
- Why can't Dad do it?

479
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:03,015
Dear, I don't think it's appropriate to argue
with your mother in front of a stranger.

480
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:06,557
I just don't see why
we can't spend the extra time with Dad.

481
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:10,823
Maybe she's right, dear. Maybe their father
would be a more appropriate person.

482
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,420
No, I don't think so.

483
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:18,060
It's not my fault, honey. If he would
get a job and a decent apartment...

484
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,469
- You see, he's the kind...
- Excuse me, dear.

485
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:24,736
I'm sure you'd want the children
to step out of the room

486
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,779
before you verbally bash their father. Hm?

487
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:30,576
If I did that, I might never see them again.

488
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:35,651
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- No harm done.

489
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:40,418
- You're absolutely right.
- I'm not a therapist. I just see what I see.

490
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:43,586
Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
I'll be up in a minute.

491
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:46,825
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

492
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:48,991
You too, Lydie.

493
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,234
- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
- Yes.

494
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,708
- Especially Lydie. She's got daggers for you.
- I know.

495
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:04,612
- They're very upset with me right now.
- Probably the divorce.

496
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,776
How did you know?

497
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:10,117
You can sense it, dear -
the way she talks about her father.

498
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:15,854
I don't think he's in the Navy, the way she's
saying she misses him. It's like he's nearby.

499
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,918
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sad.

500
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,793
- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
- I'd love that.

501
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,733
- It's right in here.
- What a lovely home you have.

502
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:26,133
- Did you decorate this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

503
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:30,800
Oh, it reeks of taste! Isn’t this lovely, dear!

504
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:34,004
- Here's my résumé.
- Oh. Thank you.

505
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,480
- Let me start this tea.
- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.

506
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:43,715
You've had a hard day. You just sit yourself
down on that stool and leave the tea to me.

507
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:46,689
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

508
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,851
Oh, not at all, dear.

509
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,828
- Oh. What a wonderful résumé.
- Thank you, dear.

510
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:54,654
''Expert in first aid and CPR.''

511
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,826
And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.

512
00:40:56,902 --> 00:41:00,429
You can never be too prepared
when little ones are around.

513
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:04,305
They'll swallow anything.
You've got to be ready to pop it out.

514
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:07,470
Oh, let's see.

515
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:11,441
What a perfectly appointed little cubby!

516
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:15,680
Look at this. Everything
has its place and name tag.

517
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:18,723
How precise! It's lovely.

518
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,883
My husband never appreciated it.

519
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:23,052
Oh. Poor dolt.

520
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:26,120
That's not the reason
you divorced him, was it?

521
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:28,193
No.

522
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,102
It's so sad, because marriage
can be such a blessing.

523
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,731
So can divorce.

524
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:43,943
Daniel is a very difficult man to live with.
But the children are crazy about him.

525
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,815
You don't have to be a psychic to sense that.

526
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,021
My, you certainly do know your way
around a kitchen!

527
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:58,020
It's just because everything is so accessible.
You designed it.

528
00:41:58,597 --> 00:42:02,693
I'm amazed there isn't a little label there
that says ''spoons''.

529
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,968
You remind me of someone.

530
00:42:08,907 --> 00:42:11,535
Really? Who?

531
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:15,842
I feel like I've known you for years.

532
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:20,251
Maybe we knew each other in another life.

533
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:25,420
I would love for you
to come and work with us.

534
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:28,151
- So would I.
- Great!

535
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,319
It would be an honour.

536
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:33,428
To us.

537
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:37,160
To us. The start of a business relationship.

538
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:09,592
Good evening, dear.

539
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,428
Evening, ma'am.

540
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:21,508
Cold night, isn't it?

541
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,841
Yes, it is.

542
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:28,312
Hope you have somethin' nice and warm
to go home to.

543
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,292
My back.

544
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:49,033
Jesus! If I find the misogynistic bastard
that invented heels, I'll kill him.

545
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:52,001
God...!

546
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:02,281
Excuse me.

547
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:04,344
Mrs Sellner!

548
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,856
Have we met?

549
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:11,123
No. But Danny's told me all about you.

550
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:14,625
I'm his sister.

551
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,697
His... much older sister.

552
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:22,470
- You have his eyes.
- Only if he fills out a donor card.

553
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:29,510
- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.

554
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:32,141
Let me go up and get him
and he'll be right down.

555
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,842
- I'll come with you.
- No.

556
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,283
- Yes.
- Why?

557
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:41,349
Because I have an appointment on Monday
and Friday evenings to check the apartment.

558
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:44,326
I remember him saying something about that.

559
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:47,922
Are you sure, dear?
It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.

560
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,467
- If you can do it, I can.
- I'll bet so!

561
00:44:50,535 --> 00:44:52,594
- Is your ticker all right?
- Top-notch.

562
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:56,333
Oh, good! Cos I don't want to jump-start ya.

563
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,343
Damn door.

564
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:03,471
Come in, please, dear. Sorry about that.

565
00:45:03,548 --> 00:45:05,607
Here we are. Daniel's abode.

566
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,782
Oh, that's mine, dear.
I'm a messy house guest.

567
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,984
Well, just make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

568
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:17,152
He'll be back. I'll go get him.

569
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:20,356
Don't be afraid. I'll be right there. Danny!

570
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:24,197
Danny boy, where are you?
Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.

571
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,964
Danny, there's a Mrs Sellner here to see you!

572
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:29,404
- Oh, is she here?
- Yes, she is.

573
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:32,969
Mrs Sellner, I just got out of the shower!

574
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,535
I think you'll be very pleased with me!

575
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:39,049
I've been through
some really interesting changes!

576
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,711
And I'm becoming a new man
and a model father!

577
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:47,052
He'll be right there. He's just changing, dear.

578
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,620
I want to keep you abreast
of the changes in my career!

579
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:56,325
There have been two big developments!
I'm finally starting to come into my own!

580
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:00,770
Things are really starting to take shape,
and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!

581
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:06,435
Things were hairy for a while,
but I'm in great shape now!

582
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:09,035
I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!

583
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:13,216
A job I could really sink my teeth into!

584
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,445
I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!

585
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:22,592
So nice I don't have to
save face any more, Mrs Sellner!

586
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,197
Mrs Sellner! How are you? Always a joy!

587
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:32,566
If you wanted some cheese,
why didn't you just say so?

588
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:36,431
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I now am holding down two jobs.

589
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:40,466
One for an educational film
and TV company - heavy responsibility.

590
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:44,981
- And the other?
- Cleaning houses. Not mine.

591
00:46:46,618 --> 00:46:48,916
- Big girl!
- Your sister is English?

592
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,181
She's half-English, half-American.

593
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:55,488
Half-sister, really. That makes her
an eighth English? I've never done the math.

594
00:46:55,593 --> 00:47:00,292
Let me see, my father was American.
He flew for the English during the war.

595
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:04,061
He was in London and...
he met this lovely Englishwoman.

596
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:07,798
Well, my sister was the fruit of their passions.

597
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:10,670
Sorry. My sister's, not yours.

598
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:16,237
You see, she's not a very good housekeeper.
But she makes a fabulous cup of English tea.

599
00:47:16,314 --> 00:47:19,943
Really? Well, I would adore
a good cup of English tea.

600
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:23,452
Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

601
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:26,251
Sis! Oh, sis!

602
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:28,417
Sis, are you in here?

603
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:31,223
Tea? Cup of TNT.

604
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,040
Sick. Mom!

605
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,279
My face!

606
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,787
I've gotta go down and get it.

607
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,527
Norman Bates!

608
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,520
Miss Hillard?

609
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:37,720
- Yes, dear?
- I take sugar in my tea.

610
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:39,888
Oh, your tea!

611
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:42,558
I'll be right there with your tea!

612
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:49,532
Coming right up, dear!
Sugar - one lump or two, dear?

613
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,940
- Two, please!
- Tea, sugar, hot water.

614
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:56,503
You got it. Coming right your way, dear!

615
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:58,742
I'll be right there with your tea!

616
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:03,583
No! Stop!

617
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:13,753
Oh, shit!

618
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:24,934
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, dear! I don't need a hand.

619
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:27,637
I need a face.

620
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:32,345
- Are you sure?
- Oh, definitely!

621
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:41,789
I'm not a Muslim. I need a face! Oh, God.

622
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:48,559
Miss Hillard? The water's boiling.

623
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,097
Hello!

624
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:56,699
Oh, I'm sorry to frighten you, dear.
I must look like a yeti in this get-up.

625
00:49:56,808 --> 00:50:00,710
This is my nightly meringue mask.
Part of my beauty regimen.

626
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:05,909
It's basically egg whites, crème fraîche,
powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of alum.

627
00:50:06,017 --> 00:50:11,319
There you go, dear. Oh! You've got your
cream and sugar. It's a little cappu-tea-no.

628
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,649
One drop or two? Would you like another?

629
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,386
Oh! There you go!

630
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:21,023
As you can see, I can't stay with you, dear.
I'm melting like a snow cone in Phoenix.

631
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:26,264
There we go again! I'll go get Danny.
He'll be right with you. Hold on.

632
00:50:26,337 --> 00:50:29,602
- Danny!
- Coming, sis!

633
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:33,269
- It was lovely to have met you!
- Lovely to meet you.

634
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:56,132
- Had a little accident.
- Be careful this time. She's an old woman.

635
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:00,831
Why wasn't I an only child?

636
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,971
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

637
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:52,180
Ready? OK.

638
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,381
Did you have fun?

639
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:57,393
- What did you do?
- I painted a picture of a bunny.

640
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,759
The teacher liked it.

641
00:52:01,232 --> 00:52:05,100
Here it is, Mel. $1,000 worth of hair.
What am I supposed to do with it?

642
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:08,036
- Alan, I was wondering if...
- You want one of them?

643
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:12,136
I`d rather make a coat for my wife.

644
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,805
All right, everyone.
It's time to expand your minds.

645
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:21,215
- It's homework time. OK?
- Yeah, but... after Dick Van Dyke.

646
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:25,315
No. Now.

647
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:26,948
No.

648
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:31,126
We always watch Dick Van Dyke.

649
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,465
Really? Well, not any more.

650
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:41,167
The only thing you'll be watching
is Deep Sea-N-N.

651
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,006
Now,

652
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:47,534
I know you're used to loosey-goosey.

653
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:50,547
But I run a much tighter ship.

654
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:55,285
Between the hours of 3pm and 7pm,
I'm in charge.

655
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,779
And when I'm in charge,
you will follow a schedule.

656
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:02,849
Those who do not follow the schedule
will be punished.

657
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,788
- Punished?
- She's lying.

658
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,957
She'd never punish us.

659
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,958
Don't... fuss with me.

660
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,502
This is exploitation. It's not fair.

661
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:49,801
- Shut up, Lydie.
- Yeah. You got us into this.

662
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:52,308
Ooh, my little ankle-biters.

663
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,004
Do I sense dissension in the ranks?

664
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,810
Are we ready for homework,
or shall we continue manual labour?

665
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:03,752
- No. Anything but this.
- Then upstairs, my little nose-miners.

666
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:06,948
Go. Flee before me!

667
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:09,356
Onward and upward!

668
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,690
Go pump some neurons.

669
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:13,855
Expand your craniums.

670
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:16,024
- I miss Dad.
- Me, too.

671
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,660
Me most.

672
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,464
I'm here, guys.

673
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:25,700
In some form.

674
00:54:28,512 --> 00:54:30,639
Let's see.

675
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:36,077
OK. Pinch of basil.

676
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,115
Damn!

677
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:50,958
Mayday!

678
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,695
Oh, God! It's gonna blow!

679
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:58,099
Easy.

680
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:00,268
Damn. Calm down.

681
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:03,505
Come on.

682
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:07,480
How is it? Oh, my God. It's clotted. Oh, God.

683
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,788
This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber.

684
00:55:12,623 --> 00:55:14,784
God, it's hot in here.

685
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:38,244
Look at this! My first day as a woman
and I'm getting hot flashes.

686
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:57,599
- Hey, here's your food.
- How much is it?

687
00:55:57,735 --> 00:56:00,966
- 135.27.
- 135 dollars?! That's certainly...

688
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:03,131
And 27 cents.

689
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:06,074
Four dinners. 20 bucks extra for rushing us.

690
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:10,136
Rushing? Well, you could have been
a little bit faster, dear.

691
00:56:10,214 --> 00:56:13,650
- There's 140. Do you have change?
- No.

692
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,878
I thought you wouldn't.
Thank you very much.

693
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:49,310
Hello!

694
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,880
Hello! Anybody home?

695
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:58,418
- Where were you guys?
- Upstairs, doing our homework.

696
00:56:58,496 --> 00:57:00,726
Mrs Doubtfire said we had to.

697
00:57:00,865 --> 00:57:03,459
Oh, she did, huh?

698
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:06,526
Doing your homework. How great!

699
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:08,434
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

700
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:12,465
Look at this place! It looks wonderful!
All spick-and-span.

701
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:28,624
Dinner is served, madam.

702
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:31,290
How lovely!

703
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:55,518
Mrs Doubtfire?

704
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:59,352
Lydia, dear. Get back inside
right now before you freeze.

705
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:03,916
Look... I just want to apologize
for being such a pain today.

706
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:07,725
- Oh, dear, it's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

707
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:13,299
It's just... I'm still kind of messed-up.
About everything.

708
00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:17,699
We all are, sweetie.

709
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,272
What?

710
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:25,147
I just mean I understand
the pain you're all going through.

711
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:29,210
Yeah.

712
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:32,282
Well, I also wanted to thank you.

713
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:35,986
- For what?
- For making my mom so happy.

714
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:43,522
She hasn't been in this good a mood since...
I can't even remember.

715
00:58:45,803 --> 00:58:47,896
It's been a long time.

716
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:50,439
- It has?
- Yeah.

717
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:53,768
Well, I gotta go back in, but...

718
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:57,403
- Go.
- OK. Thank you.

719
00:58:58,015 --> 00:59:00,506
You're welcome.

720
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,579
Bye.

721
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,521
Thank you.

722
00:59:26,477 --> 00:59:28,468
Oh, no.

723
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:33,642
Well, milady! It's a pleasure to see you again!

724
00:59:33,751 --> 00:59:35,810
A joy, as always.

725
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:56,772
I like that Mediterranean look in women.

726
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,434
Natural. Healthy.

727
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:04,105
Just the way God made ya.

728
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:09,811
He broke the mould when he made me, dear.
He made me very special.

729
01:00:10,254 --> 01:00:12,722
He sure did.

730
01:00:13,924 --> 01:00:16,449
Bless you.

731
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:37,262
I am not a crook.

732
01:01:37,341 --> 01:01:39,741
''She kissed Stuart and thanked him.''

733
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:42,944
'''How was it down there?' asked Mr Little,

734
01:01:43,013 --> 01:01:46,574
who was always curious to know
about places he'd never been to.''

735
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,583
'''It was all right,' said Stuart.''

736
01:02:38,202 --> 01:02:39,999
Back off, asshole!

737
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,799
Beat it!

738
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:47,343
Broke my bag, the bastard.

739
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,480
Lover boy's here.

740
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:00,785
What a beautiful little car for Don Juan.

741
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:07,555
So sad when that happens!

742
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:12,495
It was our junior year in college, and your
mother got asked to design this big float.

743
01:03:15,172 --> 01:03:18,471
- I wasn't that young.
- I went to kiss her...

744
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:22,375
Elastic bands were flying out everywhere.
Hit you in the face.

745
01:03:22,446 --> 01:03:25,847
- That's not true!
- It was like Jaws.

746
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:29,875
- Isn’t that the pretty picture!
- Oh. Mrs Doubtfire.

747
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,684
Miranda. What a pleasant surprise
to see you home so early, dear.

748
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,624
- And who is your gentleman caller?
- This is Stu.

749
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:41,130
- He just wanted to come and meet the kids.
- Oh, did he?

750
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:44,667
Ah, this must be the famous Mrs Doubtfire.

751
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:47,028
It's a pleasure to meet you.

752
01:03:48,038 --> 01:03:50,905
Yes, well... Miranda's been raving about you.

753
01:03:51,008 --> 01:03:53,909
- Odd. She's never mentioned you.
- No?

754
01:03:54,011 --> 01:03:57,139
- No.
- Well... It's good to meet you.

755
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,306
- You, too.
- Yes.

756
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:04,511
I have a home in London. I was born there.
What part of England are you from?

757
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:09,149
- Here and there, dear. All over, really.
- Yes?

758
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:13,252
- Accent's a little kind of... muddled.
- Really? So is your tan.

759
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:19,529
Dear, can you help me with something?
I found this outside.

760
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,628
Yes. This is off my Mercedes.

761
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:27,268
Off your Mercedes, dear?
You own that big, expensive car out there?

762
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:30,711
Oh, dear. They say a man
who has to buy a big car like that

763
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:33,147
is compensating for smaller genitals.

764
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,687
But not in your case, cos I see
that you're a strapping lad, aren't ya?

765
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:40,484
- It was lovely to meet you.
- You too, dear.

766
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:45,117
- Mrs Doubtfire, may I speak with you?
- Ooh, certainly, dear.

767
01:04:45,729 --> 01:04:48,664
Could you stay
a few extra hours this evening?

768
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:52,930
Stu. That's more of a thick soup
than a name, really.

769
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:55,096
It's a name. It's short for Stuart.

770
01:04:55,172 --> 01:04:58,300
- Is it?
- Yes. He's a client. And a friend.

771
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:01,003
- He was a friend. He is a friend.
- What is he?

772
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,875
- I don't know what's happening.
- What is it, dear?

773
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:06,609
- Isn’t he fabulous?
- Kind of, dear.

774
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:09,379
If you like that handsome, rugged type.

775
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,977
But personally I prefer short, furry and funny.

776
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,581
He just wants to go out and have a drink.

777
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:19,594
- I think that's pretty harmless. Don't you?
- Absolutely not, dear.

778
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:23,291
- They always have other intentions.
- This is business, mostly.

779
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,700
I'll just sip club soda
and we'll go over wallpaper samples.

780
01:05:27,004 --> 01:05:30,303
Dear Miranda. Wake up
and smell the coffee, dear.

781
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:33,002
Can't you see the lust in that man's eyes?

782
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:36,011
It's too soon, dear. Really.

783
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:38,377
You've got to give your divorce time.

784
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:43,442
Let your sheets cool down before you bring
someone else into the bed. All right?

785
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:46,112
Mrs Doubtfire, may I ask you a question?

786
01:05:46,189 --> 01:05:48,248
Certainly, dear.

787
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:50,952
How long after Mr Doubtfire passed away...

788
01:05:51,028 --> 01:05:52,825
Winston.

789
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:55,420
..did you feel any desire...

790
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,799
Never.

791
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:02,805
Never again.

792
01:06:02,873 --> 01:06:06,775
Once the father of your children
is out of the picture,

793
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:10,438
the only solution is
total and lifelong celibacy.

794
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:12,439
- Celibacy?
- Yes.

795
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:15,614
And if you violate that, heaven forgive ya.

796
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:18,818
Good luck.

797
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,983
Thank you.

798
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:29,863
''Preponderance.''

799
01:06:38,508 --> 01:06:41,636
Bravo. ''Discriminate.''

800
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:53,450
Oh, that's very good.
Will you excuse me, dear? Call of nature.

801
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,259
Check those. I'll be right back.

802
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:21,846
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God!

803
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:25,044
- Oh, my God!
- Chris! Wait!

804
01:07:25,856 --> 01:07:27,915
Lydia! We gotta call the cops!

805
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:30,549
- We gotta dial 911 now!
- Why?

806
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,221
Mrs Doubtfire. He's a she!

807
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:36,265
What?!

808
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:38,961
- He's half man, half woman!
- What?!

809
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:43,529
- All right, everyone. Calm down.
- Freeze! Or you're gonna get it!

810
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,107
- In the balls!
- Yeah!

811
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:48,467
- She's got 'em?
- She's got everything.

812
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:50,638
All right. Listen to me.

813
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:53,238
I'm not... who you think I am.

814
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:56,513
- No shit!
- Watch your mouth, young man!

815
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,349
Oh, my God.

816
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:08,462
- Dad?
- Yeah.

817
01:08:09,366 --> 01:08:11,994
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey.

818
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,334
You don't really like
wearin' that stuff, do you?

819
01:08:16,873 --> 01:08:19,569
Well, some of it's comfortable... No!

820
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:24,106
It's a pain in the padded ass.
This is not a way of life. It's just a job.

821
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:28,377
I don't go to old-lady bars or
anything like that after work.

822
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:31,215
It's the only way
I could see you guys every day.

823
01:08:31,321 --> 01:08:35,155
- Who did this?
- Uncle Frank and Aunt Jack.

824
01:08:41,498 --> 01:08:43,557
It's really you in there.

825
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,726
Yeah.

826
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:53,438
It's just a mask. And this is a body suit.
I didn't have any operations or anything.

827
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:55,636
- It's good.
- Yeah.

828
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,212
Hi.

829
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:03,151
- Sorry I scared you. Come here, Chris.
- No. No, it's OK.

830
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:06,917
I get it. I just...
don't wanna hug you or anything.

831
01:09:07,357 --> 01:09:10,793
- Not just yet.
- That's cool. It's a guy thing.

832
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:13,222
Yeah.

833
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,527
Well, now that you know,
you can't tell Mom, OK?

834
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:23,068
Cos if she finds out, I'll only be able
to see you through plate glass. OK?

835
01:09:23,173 --> 01:09:26,267
And we can't tell Nattie,
cos she'll blow my cover.

836
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,573
So you have to promise me,
it's just us. All right?

837
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:32,046
- You promise?
- Yeah.

838
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,577
It's OK.

839
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:41,185
All right? It's our little secret.

840
01:09:44,694 --> 01:09:49,256
Most of the dinosaurs were herbivorous.

841
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:51,994
But this Tyrannosaurus-rex

842
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:55,035
is a carnivore.

843
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:05,074
The reptile-like Saurischia

844
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:11,118
and the bird-like

845
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:13,086
Ornithischia.

846
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:22,527
Now, we`re going to go

847
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:25,123
where no human being has ever been.

848
01:10:25,235 --> 01:10:27,294
Oh, no.

849
01:10:28,872 --> 01:10:30,999
Which one's the dinosaur?

850
01:10:31,074 --> 01:10:35,807
- The one in the middle, I think.
- Nah, you're wrong. They're all extinct.

851
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:42,050
I can't believe they're still
subjecting kids to this. This is insane.

852
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:47,249
There should be a disclaimer: Do not operate
heavy machinery while watching this show.

853
01:10:47,324 --> 01:10:49,417
It's incredible.

854
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:53,519
This guy used to put me to sleep
when I was a kid. It's amazing.

855
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:58,761
He has the warmth of a snow pea. Makes
Mr Rogers look like Mick Jagger. It's insane.

856
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:03,029
What kind of idiot
kept this guy on the air for 25 years?

857
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,107
Me.

858
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:10,109
You?

859
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,080
Jonathan Lundy.

860
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:16,246
Jonathan Lundy, General Manager, owner?

861
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,312
Daniel Hillard, former employee.

862
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:22,716
Maybe.

863
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:25,318
That's funny.

864
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:27,590
I don't mean to criticize. I just...

865
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:31,565
- Sometimes I have...
- Criticize all you want. Show's terrible.

866
01:11:31,668 --> 01:11:36,071
I'm gonna cancel it. It's pullin' down
the whole afternoon schedule. It's gone.

867
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:38,198
You know what you gotta do?

868
01:11:38,308 --> 01:11:41,368
Start from scratch.
Give it... maybe a musical number.

869
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:46,472
- A little Tyrannosaurus rex comes out...
- Hillard, get your ass to the truck.

870
01:11:46,549 --> 01:11:49,950
That shipment's gotta make
a six o'clock flight to LA.

871
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,579
Tone, this is Mr Lundy.

872
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:55,582
- He knows who I am.
- Yeah.

873
01:11:55,692 --> 01:12:00,026
Did you ever wish that you could
freeze-frame a single moment in your day,

874
01:12:00,163 --> 01:12:02,757
look at it and say ''This is not my life''?

875
01:12:30,026 --> 01:12:32,824
Miranda. What are you home early for, dear?

876
01:12:32,929 --> 01:12:35,261
I had an appointment. Oh, thank you!

877
01:12:35,365 --> 01:12:38,630
With the court liaison. Mrs Sellner.

878
01:12:38,735 --> 01:12:41,226
- I can't believe it.
- What, dear?

879
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:46,071
She says Daniel has some woman
living with him pretending to be his sister!

880
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:53,248
- I told her he doesn't even have a sister.
- Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.

881
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:56,841
She's a social worker, dear. Really!

882
01:12:56,953 --> 01:13:00,582
And besides, how could he replace you?

883
01:13:00,657 --> 01:13:03,217
And so quickly. Really!

884
01:13:03,293 --> 01:13:06,751
She's supposed to be older
and very unattractive.

885
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:10,490
Really?

886
01:13:11,301 --> 01:13:13,394
Mrs Doubtfire.

887
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:18,098
- Yes?
- Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever...

888
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:24,912
- You must have had your share of problems.
- Oh, of course, dear. What marriage doesn't?

889
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:28,711
But I always say: the bad times fade away,

890
01:13:28,818 --> 01:13:31,878
and the good ones
adhere themselves to your memory.

891
01:13:31,988 --> 01:13:34,684
- Yes. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

892
01:13:37,794 --> 01:13:42,390
As I hold this cold meat,
I'm reminded of Winston. God rest his soul.

893
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:45,067
When did he... pass on?

894
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,934
Eight years ago, dear. This November.

895
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:52,299
What happened?

896
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:55,138
- He was quite fond of the drink.
- Ah.

897
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:58,606
- It was the drink that killed him.
- How awful.

898
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:02,879
- He was an alcoholic?
- No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.

899
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:05,944
So it was quite literally
the drink that killed him.

900
01:14:06,089 --> 01:14:08,614
- How tragic!
- Yes.

901
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:16,064
Oh, but he was a good man, though, really.

902
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:20,035
A sainted man.

903
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:22,833
And despite his mountains of faults, dear,

904
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:26,307
I always say: a flawed husband
is better than none at all.

905
01:14:27,477 --> 01:14:31,914
- Who needs a husband when I've got you?
- Surely you don't mean that, dear?

906
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:34,449
- Well...
- Oh, that's so sweet!

907
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:38,317
You can't imagine what it was like
being married to Daniel.

908
01:14:38,388 --> 01:14:43,189
Tell me, dear. What was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years?

909
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:45,386
Well, at first, nothing.

910
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:48,589
He was so... romantic.

911
01:14:48,698 --> 01:14:50,757
- So passionate.
- Really?

912
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,768
He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.

913
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,738
I hope you don't mind me
being a tad rude, but...

914
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:01,800
How was he... you know...
on a scale of 1 to 10?

915
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:05,278
Oh, well. That part was always...

916
01:15:05,982 --> 01:15:07,677
OK.

917
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,014
Just OK?

918
01:15:10,587 --> 01:15:14,546
He was probably a Casanova
compared to poor old Winston.

919
01:15:14,624 --> 01:15:17,149
- What was the matter with Winston?
- Oh, dear.

920
01:15:17,226 --> 01:15:21,595
Winston's idea of foreplay was
''Effie, brace yourself.''

921
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:27,932
It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy
I fell in love with.

922
01:15:28,004 --> 01:15:29,904
Really?

923
01:15:29,973 --> 01:15:34,569
Everyone else I knew
was so organized, so scheduled.

924
01:15:34,644 --> 01:15:36,737
Like me, I guess.

925
01:15:36,813 --> 01:15:41,807
But Daniel was so wonderfully different.
And funny. He could always make me laugh.

926
01:15:41,918 --> 01:15:45,149
I always say:
the key to a solid marriage is laughter.

927
01:15:46,456 --> 01:15:50,187
But after a few years,
everything just stopped being funny.

928
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:53,990
- Why?
- I was working all the time.

929
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:58,261
And he was always between jobs.
I hardly ever got to see the kids.

930
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:02,270
If I got home early to be with them,
something would go wrong.

931
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:05,808
The house would be wrecked
and I'd have to clean it up.

932
01:16:07,143 --> 01:16:11,842
He never knew, but so many nights I just...
cried myself to sleep.

933
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,550
Really?

934
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:21,184
The truth is, I didn't like who I was
when I was with him.

935
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,222
I would turn into this horrible person.

936
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:29,061
I didn't want my kids growing up
with a mother like that.

937
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,891
When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.

938
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:38,633
And... I'm sure he's better
when he's not with me.

939
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:42,367
Well, you never...

940
01:16:42,445 --> 01:16:46,814
I mean... Did you ever
say anything to him, dear?

941
01:16:49,018 --> 01:16:52,112
Daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious.

942
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:02,291
I used to think Daniel could do anything.
Except be serious.

943
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:08,667
But then, I was serious enough
for everybody.

944
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,420
- This is great!
- Isn’t this posh!

945
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:41,061
I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably need
a credit reference just to get in the pool.

946
01:17:41,137 --> 01:17:43,833
- Amazing!
- Oh, Nattie.

947
01:17:43,906 --> 01:17:47,899
Not a single body
that exists in nature. Look at that.

948
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:50,138
- Lydie...
- There's Stu!

949
01:17:50,246 --> 01:17:52,441
Where? Oh. On the board.

950
01:17:53,182 --> 01:17:55,742
Oh, isn't he a stunning piece of work?

951
01:17:55,852 --> 01:17:58,980
Look, Nattie. That's called liposuction.

952
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:13,899
I hope he had protection,
hitting the water at that speed.

953
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,871
- Let's go say hi.
- Let's do, please.

954
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:19,567
- That's amazing.
- Stunning.

955
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:29,940
- Hello! You look lovely!
- Hi.

956
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,487
Oh, guys, I'm so glad you could make it.

957
01:18:32,555 --> 01:18:36,548
- By the looks of you, that water's so cold!
- Yes, well...

958
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:39,593
Your tummy looks different from my daddy's.

959
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:45,025
Oh, Nattie! Not everyone has
their own personal trainer.

960
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:49,129
- Got your swimsuits? Wanna go for a dip?
- That'd be great!

961
01:18:49,372 --> 01:18:53,308
- Good! How about you, Mrs Doubtfire?
- Oh, you wicked, wicked man!

962
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:56,743
Isn’t there enough flesh here
for you to feast your eyes on?

963
01:18:56,813 --> 01:19:01,307
- Come, Mrs Doubtfire. Don't be bashful.
- No, dear. They've outlawed whaling.

964
01:19:01,384 --> 01:19:04,785
- We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.
- Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.

965
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:08,722
Oh, no. Just go. Leave me here.
I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.

966
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:11,555
You can't get heatstroke
twice in the same year.

967
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:14,460
OK. Well, let's go, kids. Swim time.

968
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:17,994
- Go, dear. I'll be fine.
- Your day's on me, Mrs Doubtfire.

969
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:21,036
- Anything you need, put it on my tab.
- Thank you, dear.

970
01:19:21,137 --> 01:19:24,470
Touch me again and
I'll drown you, you bastard.

971
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:28,271
I'll just sit here and watch you
move in on my family.

972
01:19:33,049 --> 01:19:37,486
Oh, God. What am I doing here?
This is beyond obsession.

973
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:09,407
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Fan-bloody-tastic.

974
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:11,077
- Can I have another?
- Sure.

975
01:20:11,187 --> 01:20:12,211
Great.

976
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:25,265
Soda with a lime, please.

977
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:37,345
- It's on me.
- No, thanks.

978
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:48,615
Four iced teas, Todd.

979
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,684
So, whose rugrats?

980
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:56,292
Miranda Hillard's.

981
01:20:56,365 --> 01:20:59,528
- Miranda Hillard?
- The woman I'm seeing.

982
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:03,371
No kidding? You?
The guy who's never having kids?

983
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:07,841
Won't have anything to do with kids?
You won't even date a woman with kids.

984
01:21:07,944 --> 01:21:10,037
People change, Ron.

985
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:13,946
I'm pushing 40. I don't want to
spend the rest of my life by myself.

986
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:16,450
She's got an awful lot of baggage. Three kids.

987
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:21,456
Three terrific kids, and I'm crazy about them.
Especially little Natalie. Look at her.

988
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:23,719
She's a sweetie pie.

989
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:29,089
God knows they need a stable father figure
in their life right now.

990
01:21:29,165 --> 01:21:34,501
- What about their real father?
- What can I say? The guy's a loser. I'll see ya.

991
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:38,132
Loser? Oh, yeah?

992
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:45,272
Oh, sir!

993
01:21:45,348 --> 01:21:49,682
I saw it! Some angry member
of the kitchen staff. Did you not tip them?

994
01:21:49,752 --> 01:21:53,620
Oh, the terrorists! They ran that way.
It was a run-by fruiting.

995
01:21:53,723 --> 01:21:56,214
I'll get them, sir. Don't worry.

996
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:05,792
Good waste of juice.

997
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,630
Loser.

998
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,171
What are you lookin' at?

999
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:45,832
Hi, boys and girls.

1000
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:49,240
Today we'll be talking about dinosaurs.

1001
01:22:49,345 --> 01:22:52,576
It's A Dinosaurus Line!

1002
01:22:56,218 --> 01:22:58,686
And please welcome... the king!

1003
01:23:02,892 --> 01:23:06,623
It's a dinner show. Hi! Where you from?
I'm gonna make you lunch.

1004
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:09,095
Thank you very much. Thank you! All right!

1005
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:12,292
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your claws together!

1006
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:16,701
Please welcome... James Browntosaurus!

1007
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,698
I eat wood

1008
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,478
It tastes good

1009
01:23:24,013 --> 01:23:26,277
No meat, big feet

1010
01:23:26,382 --> 01:23:29,180
I eat wood

1011
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:33,119
Oh, I got to help myself!
Can't go on! I'm goin' extinct!

1012
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:38,785
Oh, thank you, James. But right now...
it's time for the Raptor Rap!

1013
01:23:38,861 --> 01:23:41,728
I'm a raptor, doin' what I can

1014
01:23:41,831 --> 01:23:44,994
Gonna eat everything
till the appearance of man

1015
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:48,498
Yo, yo, see me, I'm livin' below the soil

1016
01:23:48,604 --> 01:23:51,630
I'll be back but I'm comin' as oil

1017
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:57,607
Very impressive, Mr Hillard!

1018
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:02,413
- I didn't know anybody was watching.
- I was watching. That's funny stuff.

1019
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:05,545
- Well, thanks.
- I think kids'd like it.

1020
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:09,920
- They'd be entertained and get information.
- That's kinda my theory.

1021
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:12,926
You don't have to play down to 'em,
just play to 'em.

1022
01:24:13,028 --> 01:24:16,691
- Listen, I'd like to hear more of your ideas.
- My ideas?

1023
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:20,360
- How about a dinner meeting?
- Wow. OK.

1024
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:23,632
Next Friday. Bridges Restaurant.
Seven o'clock sharp.

1025
01:24:25,074 --> 01:24:27,167
I'll be there.

1026
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:34,108
Take five.

1027
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,276
Take five million. You're dead.

1028
01:24:40,723 --> 01:24:45,660
We've just had our first
home-cooked meal. I'm domestic now, huh?

1029
01:24:45,728 --> 01:24:49,528
- This is terrific, Dad.
- You want more spaghetti?

1030
01:24:49,598 --> 01:24:52,396
- No, I'm stuffed.
- Garlic bread? I made it myself.

1031
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:55,766
Well, I didn't make it myself.
I cooked it. I sliced it.

1032
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:58,396
It's OK, Dad. Thanks.

1033
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:01,340
The place looks great. The food's terrific.

1034
01:25:02,211 --> 01:25:04,941
I'm really proud of you.

1035
01:25:05,014 --> 01:25:06,538
Yeah. Me, too.

1036
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:09,140
Me, too.

1037
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:14,317
I'll be right back.

1038
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:22,420
- Thank you for knocking.
- Yeah.

1039
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:26,965
Look at this!

1040
01:25:27,036 --> 01:25:29,504
I see you got someone to clean for you.

1041
01:25:29,572 --> 01:25:31,631
No.

1042
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:35,933
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

1043
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:39,145
- Are they ready?
- No. They haven't had dessert yet.

1044
01:25:39,215 --> 01:25:42,412
- You cooked?
- Yes. I cook, I bake, I sew.

1045
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:45,913
Thanks to this Amish
home study course I'm doing.

1046
01:25:46,322 --> 01:25:48,790
- I'm very impressed.
- Really?

1047
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:52,725
Give me a second chance. OK?
Let me take the kids after school.

1048
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:57,195
- I can't get rid of Mrs Doubtfire. She's terrific.
- Why not?

1049
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,858
She's the best thing that ever happened to us.

1050
01:25:59,969 --> 01:26:04,872
The kids are all doing better in school.
Chris is passing every single subject.

1051
01:26:04,974 --> 01:26:09,741
I find myself getting home early
just to be with them. We're all doing so great.

1052
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,675
Sounds like an amazing woman.
Too good to be true.

1053
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:16,944
She is.

1054
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,253
- I kinda like the black one.
- Me, too.

1055
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:30,230
I don't know. Actually... Mrs Doubtfire!

1056
01:26:30,366 --> 01:26:32,596
- Yes?
- We need another woman's opinion.

1057
01:26:32,668 --> 01:26:34,761
Oh! Then I'm your woman.

1058
01:26:34,837 --> 01:26:37,567
- Which one?
- What's the occasion?

1059
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,302
It's my birthday.

1060
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:43,104
Stu's taking me out to dinner.

1061
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:46,981
Neither.

1062
01:26:47,049 --> 01:26:50,041
They're both too brazen, dear.
They cry ''harlot''.

1063
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:52,883
Red is the traditional colour for streetwalkers.

1064
01:26:52,988 --> 01:26:57,015
And the black one is far too short.
I hope you waxed.

1065
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:58,889
They both say to me ''I'm easy.''

1066
01:26:58,994 --> 01:27:03,226
You want to be Kilimanjaro
on your first date - inaccessible.

1067
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:06,200
Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

1068
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:09,726
No, let's find something more your own age.

1069
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:11,897
Something a little less tawdry.

1070
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:14,801
Let's see.

1071
01:27:14,877 --> 01:27:18,472
How about this lovely frock?
Tasteful, elegant...

1072
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:20,538
Don't you think?

1073
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:24,210
And old. I wore that
to my aunt's funeral in 1976.

1074
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:27,687
A classic never dies, dear.
I think it's time to revive it.

1075
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:30,725
I think we should ask the kids.
What do you think?

1076
01:27:30,826 --> 01:27:35,456
- I'd go with the short, black one.
- Yeah. It's the most fun.

1077
01:27:36,265 --> 01:27:38,324
There. You see? I agree.

1078
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:41,903
Fine. You ask my opinion, then don't take it.

1079
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:46,669
- I will not be held responsible for your virtue.
- You'll be there to protect me.

1080
01:27:46,742 --> 01:27:52,078
- Stu has invited you and the kids to join us.
- Oh, how lovely! One big, happy family.

1081
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:55,913
I wouldn't miss that for the world!
Should be smashing good fun!

1082
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:59,579
- I'm so glad.
- When is this enchanted evening?

1083
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:02,521
Friday night, seven o'clock.

1084
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:06,493
- This Friday at seven?
- Yes. At my favourite restaurant. Bridges.

1085
01:28:07,596 --> 01:28:09,689
- Bridges?
- Yes.

1086
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:11,892
- Friday at seven.
- Bridges.

1087
01:28:11,967 --> 01:28:14,060
Sorry.

1088
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,163
- Bridges?
- Yes! Bridges.

1089
01:28:17,272 --> 01:28:20,537
- The restaurant Bridges?
- Friday at seven.

1090
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:25,603
- I can't. Please, don't. It's bingo night, dear.
- Cancel it.

1091
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:29,172
I can't, dear. It's my turn
to pull the balls at the rectory.

1092
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:31,752
- Please join us.
- Don't ask me that, dear.

1093
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,913
I can't have my birthday without you.

1094
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:38,119
It's so important to us that you be there.
You're part of the family now.

1095
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:43,130
I can't have a birthday without you. It would
mean so much to me and the children.

1096
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:47,635
Please promise you'll come with us,
Mrs Doubtfire. You just have to.

1097
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,896
Who could resist that little face?

1098
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,900
- I promise.
- Thank you!

1099
01:28:57,179 --> 01:28:59,113
Thank you, dear.

1100
01:28:59,982 --> 01:29:01,847
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

1101
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,009
Let's see... Nothing.

1102
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:06,314
- Anything in May?
- Not a thing.

1103
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,447
It doesn't look good.

1104
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:12,785
I'm sorry. Mr Lundy is completely booked
for the next two months.

1105
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:17,062
- I'll meet him anytime, anywhere.
- Sorry. There's nothing I can do.

1106
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:20,067
Please. I can't cancel.
It's a huge opportunity.

1107
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:23,332
Take my advice: don't cancel.

1108
01:29:26,608 --> 01:29:28,872
Thank you.

1109
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:46,418
- Come along, Nattie.
- Hello, darling!

1110
01:29:46,862 --> 01:29:49,854
- Shouldn't you cover your shoulders?
- No! I'm fine.

1111
01:29:50,032 --> 01:29:52,432
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- Good evening.

1112
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:56,369
Oh, God. Here we go.

1113
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:59,168
- Mrs Doubtfire, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1114
01:29:59,241 --> 01:30:01,300
Come on. I hope you're all hungry.

1115
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:09,444
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- I'm meeting someone. Is he here?

1116
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:12,412
No, I'm sorry. He hasn't arrived yet.

1117
01:30:12,488 --> 01:30:15,286
But we can seat you.
Smoking or non-smoking?

1118
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,881
Non-smoking, please.

1119
01:30:17,993 --> 01:30:21,986
- Tanya will seat you. Table 15.
- This way, please.

1120
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:26,192
- Reservation. Dunmeyer.
- Yes, sir.

1121
01:30:26,869 --> 01:30:29,030
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Non-smoking.

1122
01:30:29,104 --> 01:30:32,005
- Smoking!
- Mrs Doubtfire, you don't smoke.

1123
01:30:32,074 --> 01:30:34,508
No, I don't. But I did.

1124
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:39,638
I found the best way to keep from smoking
again is to be around those who do smoke.

1125
01:30:39,748 --> 01:30:44,447
I have to randomly ingest just a little bit
of nicotine and it steels my wool.

1126
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:48,547
And I know you're Mr Health. Bless you
for putting yourself in harm's way.

1127
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:52,354
- Smoking.
- All right. Table 39.

1128
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:55,624
- Follow me, please.
- 39! My age! You're a saint.

1129
01:30:56,365 --> 01:30:59,300
Thank you very much
for humouring an old lady.

1130
01:31:09,378 --> 01:31:12,108
- He's pissed already.
- Mrs Doubtfire?

1131
01:31:13,248 --> 01:31:17,582
- Would you like to join us?
- Oh. I thought I saw Clint Eastwood.

1132
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:21,349
That would make my day!
He is such a stud-muffin.

1133
01:31:21,456 --> 01:31:24,516
Will you excuse me, dear?
I have to check my wrap.

1134
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:28,290
- I can do it for you.
- Oh, no, please. I'm quite capable of...

1135
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,662
All right, dear. There you go.

1136
01:31:31,733 --> 01:31:34,531
- Oh, and your bag too, ma'am.
- Drop it!

1137
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:37,595
Oh, I'm very sorry, dear. It's my medicine.

1138
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:41,142
- I have to go take my medicine now.
- We have water at the table.

1139
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:44,975
I can't take it orally, dear. I'll be right back.

1140
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,483
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, yes. A good stiff Chardonnay.

1141
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:51,712
I like 'em light and woody.

1142
01:32:01,496 --> 01:32:05,489
- Hello. Bridges Restaurant. May I help you?
- Yes. My name is Daniel Hillard.

1143
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:11,301
Mr Lundy is expecting me for dinner. Will you
tell him I'm running late, but I'm on my way?

1144
01:32:11,373 --> 01:32:15,036
- I'll deliver the message personally, sir.
- Thank you.

1145
01:32:23,452 --> 01:32:25,647
Oh, Stu!

1146
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:27,619
I hope you like it.

1147
01:32:27,723 --> 01:32:30,453
It's gorgeous! Thank you!

1148
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,360
Did I miss anything?

1149
01:32:34,363 --> 01:32:38,322
Well, yes. Look. This is the gift
that Stu gave me for my birthday.

1150
01:32:40,202 --> 01:32:42,261
- Isn’t it gorgeous!
- Is it real?

1151
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:44,430
It is very real, Mrs Doubtfire.

1152
01:32:44,539 --> 01:32:49,670
You can either wear that or feed a small
country. That's so nice. So decadent.

1153
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:51,837
Mommy, I need to go.

1154
01:32:53,482 --> 01:32:56,417
- Mrs Doubtfire, would you take her?
- No. You.

1155
01:32:56,852 --> 01:33:00,253
- She wants you, dear.
- Well, I'll be right back.

1156
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:01,481
OK.

1157
01:33:06,395 --> 01:33:08,454
Yes, well...

1158
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:12,158
Children, look at that lovely
dessert tray over there.

1159
01:33:12,234 --> 01:33:16,694
Why don't you go over and pick
what you'd like now so they could reserve it?

1160
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:18,864
- We'll be back.
- All right.

1161
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:24,002
That's a pretty impressive bauble you got her.

1162
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:26,172
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1163
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:30,878
A fella gives a gift like that,
he wants more than a piece of her heart, eh?

1164
01:33:31,019 --> 01:33:33,487
Bit of a going-down payment, huh?

1165
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:37,251
- Excuse me?
- You know, dear. Sink the sub.

1166
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:39,657
Hide the weasel? Park the porpoise?

1167
01:33:39,728 --> 01:33:41,821
Bit of the old humpty dumpty?

1168
01:33:41,897 --> 01:33:46,800
- Little Jack Horny? The horizontal mambo?
- Mrs Doubtfire...

1169
01:33:46,868 --> 01:33:50,201
The bone dance, eh?
Rumpleforeskin? Baloney bop?

1170
01:33:50,272 --> 01:33:52,797
Bit of the old cunning linguistics? Hm?

1171
01:33:52,874 --> 01:33:56,742
- Mrs Doubtfire, please.
- Am I being a little graphic? Sorry.

1172
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:01,312
- I hope you're up for a little competition.
- I beg your pardon?

1173
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:07,116
She's got a power tool in the bedroom, dear.
It's her personal jackhammer.

1174
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:10,658
She uses it and the lights dim.
It's like a prison movie.

1175
01:34:10,726 --> 01:34:13,854
Amazed she hasn't chipped her teeth.

1176
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,623
I hope you bring cocktail sauce.

1177
01:34:18,633 --> 01:34:21,466
She's got crabs.
And I don't mean Dungeness.

1178
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:24,932
I'm being blunt as a spoon, aren't I?

1179
01:34:25,507 --> 01:34:27,566
Forgive me.

1180
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:35,848
It's the wine. Oh, gosh!

1181
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:39,444
Be back in a flash. All right? My tiny bladder.

1182
01:34:43,291 --> 01:34:45,350
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- What?!

1183
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:49,528
- You're going into the men's room.
- No! Oh, so it is!

1184
01:34:49,598 --> 01:34:53,398
I do need new glasses, dear. Sorry!

1185
01:34:56,304 --> 01:34:58,363
Hello!

1186
01:35:27,836 --> 01:35:29,736
Jesus! God!

1187
01:35:41,983 --> 01:35:45,009
- Excuse me. May I have a menu?
- Of course.

1188
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:50,591
- What's France like?
- Very beautiful.

1189
01:35:53,662 --> 01:35:55,755
Thank you very much.

1190
01:35:57,132 --> 01:35:58,861
- Mr Lundy.
- Oh, hi.

1191
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:02,562
- Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message?
- Yes. Sit down.

1192
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:05,800
- How about a drink?
- Sure. I'll have what he's having.

1193
01:36:05,874 --> 01:36:07,865
Double Chivas on the rocks.

1194
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:11,412
Bring him two doubles so he can catch up.

1195
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:16,678
- A Scotch drinker, huh? That's my kinda guy!
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

1196
01:36:21,423 --> 01:36:26,451
- OK, everybody. Are we ready to order?
- Yes, I believe we are. Children, fire away.

1197
01:36:26,561 --> 01:36:28,961
Shouldn't we wait for Mrs Doubtfire?

1198
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:32,057
Yes.

1199
01:36:43,111 --> 01:36:45,477
- How are we doin' over here?
- No, no.

1200
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,639
Oh, yes.

1201
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:54,380
Now...

1202
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:58,256
What can you do
to help the ratings on the kid show?

1203
01:36:58,326 --> 01:37:01,921
Bottom line: don't patronize kids.
They're little people.

1204
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:07,195
You gotta personalize it. Make it fun.
If it's something you'd enjoy, they'd enjoy it.

1205
01:37:07,302 --> 01:37:09,862
- That's what I'm interested in.
- Bingo!

1206
01:37:09,938 --> 01:37:12,930
Well, I wonder what's happened
to Mrs Doubtfire.

1207
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:16,909
- We could cross over to the news.
- Would you excuse me for a moment?

1208
01:37:17,012 --> 01:37:18,673
But...

1209
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:52,674
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Yes, dear. Thank you very much.

1210
01:37:55,116 --> 01:37:59,382
- Oh, my goodness!
- I'm so sorry! It's my fault.

1211
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:04,784
- Forgive me. Excuse me.
- I'm all right. There we go.

1212
01:38:04,893 --> 01:38:07,191
Thank you. Oh, let's see here!

1213
01:38:07,295 --> 01:38:09,388
- May I take your order, ma'am?
- Oh, yes.

1214
01:38:12,133 --> 01:38:16,695
Let's see. I'll have the poached salmon.

1215
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:19,399
- And you, sir?
- I'll have the jambalaya.

1216
01:38:19,507 --> 01:38:23,671
- Make mine not spicy. I'm allergic to pepper.
- Certainly, sir.

1217
01:38:23,745 --> 01:38:25,804
Thank you. Cheers. Your health.

1218
01:38:36,825 --> 01:38:38,759
Oh, my God.

1219
01:38:38,827 --> 01:38:42,991
So sorry about that. Just one moment.

1220
01:38:43,098 --> 01:38:45,157
Carpe dentum - seize the teeth.

1221
01:38:45,233 --> 01:38:47,167
Let me assist you.

1222
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:51,035
A spoon. Oh, how clever. Wait. I've got it.

1223
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:53,369
Wait. There. Make a pincer.

1224
01:38:53,508 --> 01:38:56,534
Come at it from both sides. Together - up.

1225
01:38:58,113 --> 01:39:00,172
Thank you. There it is.

1226
01:39:01,449 --> 01:39:03,747
Just shake them off, like a dog.

1227
01:39:03,818 --> 01:39:05,911
Sorry. Oh, forgive me.

1228
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:08,854
- That's all right.
- Sorry about my spray.

1229
01:39:10,058 --> 01:39:14,256
I'll be right back. I just have to
re-attach them with a little adhesive.

1230
01:39:14,362 --> 01:39:17,820
- Tell him to purée the salmon, if you will.
- Purée the salmon.

1231
01:39:17,932 --> 01:39:20,400
Thank you. Sorry about that.

1232
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:29,073
Oh, that one.

1233
01:39:33,948 --> 01:39:37,884
Oh. I didn't know there was
someone else in here. Sorry.

1234
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:47,022
Damn it! Oh, there it is.

1235
01:39:49,631 --> 01:39:51,690
Excuse me.

1236
01:40:13,088 --> 01:40:17,252
Where the hell have you been?
I ordered you another Scotch.

1237
01:40:17,325 --> 01:40:19,259
Bully!

1238
01:40:24,499 --> 01:40:26,592
Daniel?

1239
01:40:27,235 --> 01:40:29,294
Are you wearing ladies' perfume?

1240
01:40:32,006 --> 01:40:34,065
Yes, I am.

1241
01:40:36,678 --> 01:40:39,203
Are you wearing lipstick?

1242
01:40:41,082 --> 01:40:42,447
Yeah.

1243
01:40:43,618 --> 01:40:45,677
Why?

1244
01:40:46,054 --> 01:40:49,217
- It rubbed off.
- From whom?

1245
01:40:51,226 --> 01:40:53,660
A girl I used to date. She's a waitress.

1246
01:40:53,962 --> 01:40:56,055
- A waitress? Here?
- Oh, yeah.

1247
01:40:56,865 --> 01:41:01,165
On the way to the bathroom...
Couldn't keep her hands off me.

1248
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:06,771
- You dog!
- You scallywag!

1249
01:41:10,912 --> 01:41:14,678
I got the stretch outside.
Does your girlfriend have a girlfriend?

1250
01:41:14,749 --> 01:41:17,445
- Hey, it's the '90s.
- No, no! I mean...

1251
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:21,250
Does she have a lady friend for me?

1252
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:23,548
- Go ahead. Ask her.
- I'll go ask her.

1253
01:41:23,691 --> 01:41:26,990
Go on. Come on, go get 'em!

1254
01:41:34,102 --> 01:41:35,967
Hey, Dan!

1255
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:38,129
I need my order for table 39!

1256
01:41:38,206 --> 01:41:41,505
- Relax. I'll be out in a minute.
- Thank you! Great.

1257
01:41:47,549 --> 01:41:49,983
39.

1258
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:03,522
Table 39!

1259
01:42:19,914 --> 01:42:21,575
Hot jambalaya!

1260
01:42:33,595 --> 01:42:36,029
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Sorry I'm late.

1261
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,260
But after all those Scotches
I had to piss like a racehorse.

1262
01:42:42,337 --> 01:42:44,396
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

1263
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,441
Why in God's name
are you dressed like a woman?!

1264
01:42:54,449 --> 01:42:56,542
Oh, damn.

1265
01:43:02,991 --> 01:43:05,050
Well...

1266
01:43:07,595 --> 01:43:10,655
I'd like you to meet
the host of your new show.

1267
01:43:10,999 --> 01:43:13,024
Host?

1268
01:43:13,101 --> 01:43:19,631
Euphegenia Doubtfire, dear. I specialize in
the education and entertainment of children.

1269
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:24,203
Surprise!

1270
01:43:27,248 --> 01:43:29,182
Oh, thank you very much.

1271
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:32,219
- This looks terrific.
- Where's Mrs Doubtfire?

1272
01:43:32,287 --> 01:43:34,517
Well, I hope the dear lady's all right.

1273
01:43:34,622 --> 01:43:38,490
- Shall we start?
- Yes. Let's start. I don't want it to get cold.

1274
01:43:40,895 --> 01:43:44,092
Tell me. Why would Mrs Doubtfire
be a good host?

1275
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:49,226
I'm a hip old granny who could
hip-hop, bebop, dance till ya drop,

1276
01:43:49,304 --> 01:43:52,432
and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.

1277
01:44:06,754 --> 01:44:08,881
Stu?

1278
01:44:10,658 --> 01:44:13,684
Oh, he's choking. He's choking!

1279
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:17,128
Help us! Somebody help!
He's choking! Help us!

1280
01:44:17,231 --> 01:44:19,426
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1281
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,266
- He's choking here! Call 911!
- Oh, no. I killed the bastard.

1282
01:44:23,338 --> 01:44:27,365
- Mrs Doubtfire! Help us! He's choking!
- Help is on the way, dear!

1283
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:30,501
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- Help is on the way!

1284
01:44:30,578 --> 01:44:33,638
- Mrs Doubtfire, he's choking!
- Hold on, dear.

1285
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:40,554
One more time, dear. Work with me!

1286
01:44:40,655 --> 01:44:42,987
Come on!

1287
01:45:01,275 --> 01:45:03,505
I'm all right.

1288
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:05,603
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1289
01:45:05,713 --> 01:45:08,204
Almost lost ya.

1290
01:45:13,354 --> 01:45:16,187
- Dad.
- Oh, my...

1291
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:20,623
Daddy?

1292
01:45:25,366 --> 01:45:27,493
Yeah, honey. It's me.

1293
01:45:29,804 --> 01:45:32,398
Happy birthday.

1294
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,607
Daniel...

1295
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:37,837
Daniel! Oh, my God!

1296
01:45:38,212 --> 01:45:40,942
Oh, my God!

1297
01:45:41,048 --> 01:45:43,141
The whole time...

1298
01:45:43,217 --> 01:45:45,777
- The whole time?!
- I'm sorry, Miranda. Please?

1299
01:45:45,853 --> 01:45:49,619
Don't talk to me! Don't touch me!

1300
01:45:49,724 --> 01:45:52,852
I have to go. We have to leave now.
I have to leave!

1301
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,793
We have to leave now!
I have to go! We're going.

1302
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,064
- You guys go.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

1303
01:46:02,403 --> 01:46:04,462
Bye.

1304
01:46:05,473 --> 01:46:07,566
Sorry about the pepper. I was...

1305
01:46:19,153 --> 01:46:21,553
What are you lookin' at? Show's over.

1306
01:46:27,462 --> 01:46:31,398
Miss Robeson,
do you have any closing remarks?

1307
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:33,559
Nothing further, Your Honour.

1308
01:46:34,402 --> 01:46:38,805
Mr Hillard, since you've determined
to act as your own attorney,

1309
01:46:38,873 --> 01:46:42,673
you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time.

1310
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:57,681
Your Honour, in the past two months,
I've secured a residence, refurbished it

1311
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:01,728
and made it ''an environment
fit for children''. Those are your words.

1312
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:07,632
I'm also holding down a job as a shipping
clerk. So I believe I met your requirements.

1313
01:47:07,702 --> 01:47:09,795
Ahead of schedule.

1314
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:13,339
In regards to my behaviour,

1315
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:15,500
I can only plead insanity.

1316
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:18,238
Because, ever since my children were born,

1317
01:47:18,312 --> 01:47:21,611
the moment I looked at them,
I was crazy about them.

1318
01:47:21,682 --> 01:47:24,207
Once I held them, I was hooked.

1319
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,679
I'm addicted to my children, sir.

1320
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:30,649
I love them with all my heart.

1321
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:35,856
And the idea of someone telling me I can't
be with them, I can't see them every day...

1322
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,660
It's like someone saying I can't have air.

1323
01:47:38,733 --> 01:47:42,294
I can't live without air,
and I can't live without them.

1324
01:47:42,737 --> 01:47:48,437
Listen, I would do anything. I just want
to be with them. I know I need that, sir.

1325
01:47:48,776 --> 01:47:51,301
We have a history.

1326
01:47:52,246 --> 01:47:57,479
And I just... They mean everything to me.
And they need me as much as I need them.

1327
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,312
So, please.

1328
01:48:01,389 --> 01:48:03,687
Don't take my kids away from me.

1329
01:48:09,463 --> 01:48:11,522
Thank you.

1330
01:48:20,942 --> 01:48:23,001
Mr Hillard...

1331
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:28,377
You've been able to fool a lot of people into
believing that you're a 60-year-old woman.

1332
01:48:29,116 --> 01:48:31,175
No easy task.

1333
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:37,519
And your little speech seemed to be
very heartfelt and genuine.

1334
01:48:40,027 --> 01:48:46,489
But I believe it to be a terrific performance
by a very gifted actor. Nothing more.

1335
01:48:46,567 --> 01:48:50,025
- No. It's not that.
- The reality, Mr Hillard,

1336
01:48:50,638 --> 01:48:55,575
is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox.

1337
01:48:56,043 --> 01:48:59,706
And I refuse to further subject
three innocent children

1338
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:04,046
to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behaviour.

1339
01:49:04,151 --> 01:49:07,848
It is this court's decision
to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.

1340
01:49:07,955 --> 01:49:09,252
Oh, God, no.

1341
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:12,917
You will have supervised
visitation rights every Saturday.

1342
01:49:12,994 --> 01:49:14,552
Supervised, sir?

1343
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:18,827
A court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children.

1344
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:24,394
I am suggesting a period of psychological
testing and perhaps treatment for you.

1345
01:49:25,573 --> 01:49:29,202
We will re-examine this case
one year from now.

1346
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:32,439
Thank you. Court is adjourned.

1347
01:49:45,993 --> 01:49:49,224
I don't do laundry.
I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.

1348
01:49:49,296 --> 01:49:53,255
I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.
And I don't do diapers.

1349
01:49:53,401 --> 01:49:56,302
My children have been potty-trained
for some time.

1350
01:49:56,437 --> 01:49:59,099
Well, I don't do washing.
I don't do basements.

1351
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:02,505
I don't do dinners. I don't do reading.

1352
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:09,907
Yes. Well, we have your number.
Thank you so much for coming.

1353
01:50:10,017 --> 01:50:12,611
- We'll be getting back to you.
- Thank you.

1354
01:50:12,687 --> 01:50:14,780
I'll show you to the door.

1355
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:20,458
Yes, here we are. Please...

1356
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,299
Laura, that shipment
has been delayed three times.

1357
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:31,234
Yes, but...

1358
01:50:31,305 --> 01:50:34,672
Laura, I'm not gonna wait
another six months for it.

1359
01:50:34,742 --> 01:50:36,835
You do that. Call me back.

1360
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:42,208
Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.

1361
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:44,677
Everything's gonna be all right.

1362
01:50:44,752 --> 01:50:47,812
- I miss her spaghetti.
- I miss her jokes.

1363
01:50:48,322 --> 01:50:50,222
I miss her stories.

1364
01:50:50,858 --> 01:50:55,022
Don't worry. We will find someone.
There are plenty of people out there.

1365
01:50:55,096 --> 01:50:57,064
Nobody like her.

1366
01:50:58,866 --> 01:51:03,633
All right. I admit things were a lot nicer
when she was around.

1367
01:51:03,704 --> 01:51:08,903
The house was so warm and cosy, the beds
were always made, and the dinner was...

1368
01:51:08,976 --> 01:51:13,845
She isn't real! We have to stop referring to her
as if she were a real person.

1369
01:51:13,914 --> 01:51:16,849
Hello, my dears!

1370
01:51:17,952 --> 01:51:20,648
We have a wonderful show today.

1371
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:23,781
We have Mr Van Zandt from the Sierra Club,

1372
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:28,191
and he`s going to bring some animals
that are endangered species.

1373
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:31,958
- Do you know what that means, poppets?
- Did you say ``puppet``?

1374
01:51:32,066 --> 01:51:35,797
Oh, no, dear! It`s Kovacs! Welcome, Kovacs!

1375
01:51:35,903 --> 01:51:39,202
Hi, guys. Did you say ``extinction``?
Does something stink?

1376
01:51:39,306 --> 01:51:45,108
It`s not something smelling bad. Extinction
means there`s no more of a particular animal.

1377
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:47,909
- Oh, my God.
- Doesn`t that make you a little mad?

1378
01:51:47,982 --> 01:51:50,007
- Very mad!
- Tell people about it.

1379
01:51:50,117 --> 01:51:55,077
I`m mad! You know why? Because next,
it`s the chimps! There are fewer chimps...

1380
01:51:55,156 --> 01:51:58,751
Doesn`t it make you mad that
humans play your parts in movies?

1381
01:51:58,826 --> 01:52:04,890
Ooh! ``Planet of the Apes``: who gets the role?
Roddy McDowall! I`d be better than that!

1382
01:52:04,965 --> 01:52:09,163
- I`d be better than Charlton Heston!
- And your rug is better, too.

1383
01:52:09,236 --> 01:52:12,228
You could fly to Persia on that rug.

1384
01:52:25,452 --> 01:52:29,218
- Shall we tell them where we'll be tomorrow?
- Yeah. They wanna know.

1385
01:52:29,323 --> 01:52:32,349
Tomorrow, poppets,
we're taking a wonderful trip.

1386
01:52:32,426 --> 01:52:35,987
But you don't have to pack
because we're going in our mind.

1387
01:52:36,063 --> 01:52:41,194
We're going across the Atlantic Ocean
to England, where I came from.

1388
01:52:41,268 --> 01:52:44,135
- You came from England?
- It's a wonderful country.

1389
01:52:44,205 --> 01:52:46,730
- Do you know about England?
- It's an island.

1390
01:52:46,807 --> 01:52:49,207
It's an island, dear. A glorious one.

1391
01:52:49,276 --> 01:52:53,838
- They have a queen and a royal family.
- Oh! Just like a poker game!

1392
01:52:53,948 --> 01:52:57,076
- It's a full house.
- Some cards don't live at home any more.

1393
01:52:57,184 --> 01:52:59,277
Thanks to mobile phones.

1394
01:53:00,154 --> 01:53:02,748
Do you know what language
they speak in England?

1395
01:53:02,823 --> 01:53:06,782
- Pakistani?
- That's right. In many stores they do.

1396
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:09,694
But we'll get into that tomorrow,
boys and girls.

1397
01:53:09,797 --> 01:53:12,664
- You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.
- I'm gonna give you two.

1398
01:53:12,766 --> 01:53:15,234
- All right, dear.
- Here's one on the cheek.

1399
01:53:15,302 --> 01:53:20,171
- And here's a monkey bite!
- Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!

1400
01:53:20,808 --> 01:53:24,437
Well, that's all for today. Bye-bye.

1401
01:53:24,511 --> 01:53:26,411
Cut!

1402
01:53:27,448 --> 01:53:30,178
That's a wrap, folks! Thank you very much.

1403
01:53:34,521 --> 01:53:38,651
We're a smash! Number one in our time slot!

1404
01:53:38,792 --> 01:53:42,489
Yes! Calls from Detroit, Cleveland,
Chicago, Los Angeles...

1405
01:53:42,596 --> 01:53:45,656
- All with offers to syndicate.
- Hollywood!

1406
01:53:45,799 --> 01:53:47,926
Daniel?

1407
01:53:48,035 --> 01:53:49,434
Yes?

1408
01:53:49,503 --> 01:53:53,872
- Miranda.
- Could I talk to you?

1409
01:53:55,643 --> 01:53:57,235
Yeah.

1410
01:53:57,311 --> 01:53:59,905
I'll be right out. Just wait here.

1411
01:54:22,102 --> 01:54:24,570
Welcome to Euphegenia's house.

1412
01:54:24,672 --> 01:54:28,073
A little draughty but... you know. It's nice.

1413
01:54:30,878 --> 01:54:32,937
What can I do for you?

1414
01:54:34,648 --> 01:54:37,310
First of all, congratulations on the show.

1415
01:54:37,384 --> 01:54:40,376
Thanks. You got to see the dress rehearsal.

1416
01:54:41,722 --> 01:54:44,247
We've... The kids...

1417
01:54:45,192 --> 01:54:47,854
We've been watching every day.

1418
01:54:48,996 --> 01:54:52,295
It's nice to know they can see me every day.

1419
01:54:54,902 --> 01:54:59,601
Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take
a long time to get over all the fights and

1420
01:54:59,707 --> 01:55:03,336
all the horrible things we said to each other.

1421
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:05,878
It's... It's so hard.

1422
01:55:07,548 --> 01:55:11,985
But I know somehow you and I will be
all right and we'll get through this.

1423
01:55:14,555 --> 01:55:16,989
But the kids...

1424
01:55:19,593 --> 01:55:21,686
I don't wanna hurt our children.

1425
01:55:24,398 --> 01:55:26,491
So what do you want me to do?

1426
01:55:26,567 --> 01:55:31,334
You want me to pretend everything's
all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?

1427
01:55:32,573 --> 01:55:35,736
Jesus, Miranda.
You took my children away from me.

1428
01:55:35,809 --> 01:55:38,209
I can only see them now with supervision.

1429
01:55:38,312 --> 01:55:42,214
Some woman watches me with the kids
like I'm some sort of deviant.

1430
01:55:42,316 --> 01:55:46,013
If I try to hug 'em, she wonders why.
You know what that's like?

1431
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:51,414
You just sat there in that courtroom and
let that judge pass that despicable sentence.

1432
01:55:51,525 --> 01:55:53,925
- I was angry.
- Oh, God.

1433
01:55:53,994 --> 01:55:56,588
- You hurt me, too!
- You ripped my heart out!

1434
01:55:56,663 --> 01:56:00,258
You lied... You know what?
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1435
01:56:00,367 --> 01:56:03,393
I don't wanna do any more
''who did what to whom''.

1436
01:56:06,607 --> 01:56:10,236
Ever since this happened,
I've been trying to make sense out of it.

1437
01:56:10,344 --> 01:56:14,337
And the only thing I know in my heart
is that the children were happier

1438
01:56:14,415 --> 01:56:17,213
when Mrs Doubtfire was a part of their lives.

1439
01:56:17,284 --> 01:56:18,808
Yeah?

1440
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:23,483
She... brought out the best in them.

1441
01:56:24,425 --> 01:56:28,225
- She brought out the best in you.
- And you.

1442
01:56:33,434 --> 01:56:35,868
They miss her terribly.

1443
01:56:38,038 --> 01:56:41,906
- What are you saying?
- Daniel, the kids need you.

1444
01:56:50,584 --> 01:56:52,643
I need them.

1445
01:56:59,393 --> 01:57:02,794
Well, tomorrow we`ll have Frank,
who is a make-up artist.

1446
01:57:04,298 --> 01:57:06,289
A big knock at the door.

1447
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,631
Who could that be?
And do we have enough time?

1448
01:57:10,504 --> 01:57:13,029
Mr Sprinkles, boys and girls!

1449
01:57:13,107 --> 01:57:15,507
Hello! What do you have for me today?

1450
01:57:15,609 --> 01:57:18,908
Mrs Doubtflier, I`ve got a letter from Katie...

1451
01:57:21,248 --> 01:57:23,307
It's the new baby-sitter.

1452
01:57:24,318 --> 01:57:26,616
Come on, guys! Get up! Let's go!

1453
01:57:28,922 --> 01:57:31,049
Come on.

1454
01:57:31,859 --> 01:57:34,157
It's gonna be all right.

1455
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:36,923
Chris, wait right over there. Everybody.

1456
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:50,468
Daddy!

1457
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:54,242
Hi.

1458
01:57:55,149 --> 01:57:58,949
- What's goin' on?
- I'm here to pick you up.

1459
01:57:59,319 --> 01:58:03,187
Your dad's gonna take you
for a few hours every day after school.

1460
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:05,883
Really?

1461
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:08,851
What about the courts? That legal stuff.

1462
01:58:09,396 --> 01:58:12,160
- Ask your mom.
- I took care of it.

1463
01:58:12,799 --> 01:58:16,667
No more supervised visits.
No more court liaison.

1464
01:58:16,737 --> 01:58:19,729
- Just us?
- Just us.

1465
01:58:31,185 --> 01:58:33,278
Go get Mr Bear.

1466
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:36,612
- Go get your stuff. Hurry up.
- All right.

1467
01:58:41,161 --> 01:58:44,597
- Would you like to come in?
- I'll wait outside.

1468
01:58:44,698 --> 01:58:46,165
OK.

1469
01:58:49,403 --> 01:58:51,496
Thank you.

1470
01:58:56,577 --> 01:58:58,010
See ya.

1471
01:59:02,783 --> 01:59:08,187
``Dear Mrs Doubtfire - Two months ago
my mom and dad decided to separate.``

1472
01:59:08,255 --> 01:59:10,416
``Now they live in different houses.``

1473
01:59:10,824 --> 01:59:16,126
``My brother Andrew says that we aren`t
a real family any more. Is this true?``

1474
01:59:16,230 --> 01:59:18,323
``Did I lose my family?``

1475
01:59:18,398 --> 01:59:22,664
``Is there anything I could do
to get my parents back together?``

1476
01:59:22,769 --> 01:59:24,828
``Sincerely, Katie McCormick.``

1477
01:59:27,774 --> 01:59:29,833
Oh, my dear Katie.

1478
01:59:31,378 --> 01:59:36,782
You know, some parents get along
much better when they don`t live together.

1479
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:40,650
They don`t fight all the time
and they can become better people.

1480
01:59:40,754 --> 01:59:43,780
Much better mommies and daddies for you.

1481
01:59:43,857 --> 01:59:46,985
And sometimes they get back together.

1482
01:59:47,995 --> 01:59:50,054
And sometimes they don`t, dear.

1483
01:59:50,797 --> 01:59:52,856
And if they don`t,

1484
01:59:52,966 --> 01:59:55,560
don`t blame yourself.

1485
01:59:55,636 --> 02:00:00,505
Just because they don`t love each other
doesn`t mean that they don`t love you.

1486
02:00:01,908 --> 02:00:05,435
There are all sorts of different families, Katie.

1487
02:00:05,512 --> 02:00:09,676
Some families have one mommy,
some families have one daddy,

1488
02:00:09,783 --> 02:00:11,842
or two families.

1489
02:00:11,918 --> 02:00:14,614
Some children live with their uncle or aunt.

1490
02:00:14,688 --> 02:00:19,716
Some live with their grandparents,
and some children live with foster parents.

1491
02:00:19,826 --> 02:00:22,852
Some live in separate homes
and neighbourhoods

1492
02:00:22,929 --> 02:00:25,022
in different areas of the country.

1493
02:00:25,098 --> 02:00:31,037
They may not see each other for days,
weeks, months or even years at a time.

1494
02:00:32,539 --> 02:00:34,632
But if there`s love, dear,

1495
02:00:36,043 --> 02:00:38,534
those are the ties that bind.

1496
02:00:39,346 --> 02:00:42,838
And you`ll have a family in your heart for ever.

1497
02:00:45,052 --> 02:00:47,486
All my love to you, poppet.

1498
02:00:47,554 --> 02:00:49,647
You`re going to be all right.

1499
02:00:51,958 --> 02:00:54,051
Bye-bye.

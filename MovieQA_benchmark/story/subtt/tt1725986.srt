1
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,436
It's important you understand.

2
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,564
It's not you, it's me.

3
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,902
What we have is so special.

4
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,740
I love you more than I can say,

5
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:20,060
but I'm sorry, truly,

6
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,913
because... I fucked up.

7
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,608
Look...

8
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:30,045
I owe you an explanation, but honestly,
I don't know where to begin.

9
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,176
Well...

10
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,430
maybe there, at the beginning.

11
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:43,726
<i>You see, I grew up above a great party.</i>

12
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,353
- Gordon!
- Mommy?

13
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:05,147
- She's in the kitchen.
- What are you doing?

14
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,459
I'm waiting for your mother to bring out
the hors d'oeuvres. Now bugger off.

15
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:14,173
<i>After school, I used to love
to listen to my father lecture.</i>

16
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:18,135
Now the faculty would have me
teach you it was Wordsworth,

17
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,828
Keats, and Coleridge,

18
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:24,850
who in writing about love,
defined the Romantic age.

19
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:29,438
And they've told me to ignore Byron.

20
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:33,484
Mad, bad, and dangerous to know was
how one of his many lovers described him.

21
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,236
He was controversial.

22
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:40,140
Now did you know,
this esteemed establishment told Byron

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,851
that he wasn't allowed to bring
his beloved dogs to college?

24
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:46,663
So he said screw the rules. He went out
and he bought himself a bear.

25
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,211
Brought it to class on a chained leash.
He tied up to that very pipe just there.

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,866
So you see, it was Byron who defined
the Romantic age, which wasn't about love.

27
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:01,161
It was about going your own way,

28
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,705
defying authority
and following your heart,

29
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,308
sticking it to the man,
and as many women as possible.

30
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,520
Now that... that is Romantic.

31
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,147
And if the faculty
don't like me saying so,

32
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:15,050
well, they can take this job
and they can shove it.

33
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,321
Because like Mr. Bob Dylan, I ain't gonna
work on Maggie's farm no more.

34
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,893
<i>Dad hated authority,
and everyone loved him for it.</i>

35
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:29,498
<i>All I wanted was to be just like him.</i>

36
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,921
Forget the critics.

37
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,407
Let them have their opinions.

38
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:42,552
Let them publish their books and brag
about them at tedious faculty parties,

39
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:47,599
and let university librarians
file those books away.

40
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,769
The faculty has called this class

41
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:55,440
"The Romantics and Literary Theory."

42
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,262
I want you all to forget
the second half of this sentence.

43
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:04,283
There's nothing theoretical
about the romantics.

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,730
"Where true love burns,

45
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,668
"desire is love's pure passion.

46
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,296
"It is the reflex

47
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,049
"of our earthly frame...

48
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:24,886
"that takes its meaning
from the nobler part

49
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,681
and but translates...

50
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,892
the language of the heart."

51
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,815
Wakey, wakey, Professor Haig.

52
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,720
Oh, shit. It's Saturday, isn't it?

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,640
No, don't look like that.
Are you sure about this?

54
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,767
I mean, I make a terrible
first impression.

55
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,646
Will you relax, Richard?
My dad is gonna love you.

56
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:53,607
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll have lots to talk about.

57
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:57,878
Yeah? Corporate hard-nosed raider
meets libidinous lit professor.

58
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:00,238
- It's a match made in heaven.
- I just want my dad

59
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,367
to meet the wonderful man
I've been dating for the last six months.

60
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,886
- Six months?
- Broke your record, didn't I?

61
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,498
- Crazy.
- "Love is begun by time,

62
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:14,019
and time qualifies the spark
and fire of it all."

63
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:17,939
Relax, you're still very sparky, darling.
Really sparky, I mean...

64
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:22,319
Well, my liege, I must hie me
to Heathrow, thou to London,

65
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,806
- chimes of 6:00 sharp.
- Sure, of course.

66
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,825
- Sharp.
- Sharp. 6:00. Chimes.

67
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,103
Sal.

68
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,398
Sal, I've got to go. Why?

69
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:05,070
Because we've been talking for so long
I've lost track of time, space, and myself.

70
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:09,783
<i>Hello? Hello? Olivia?</i>

71
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:12,352
- Not to worry, madame.
- I'll call maintenance.

72
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:15,038
- We'll fish it out later.
- <i>Are you there? Can you hear me?</i>

73
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:17,874
- Please don't.
- <i>Hello?</i>

74
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,293
<i>Olivia?</i>

75
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,298
<i>Aúpa!</i>

76
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:45,318
There you go. They fishing
your phone out of the drain?

77
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:49,264
No.

78
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:54,202
I told them not to.
I am cutting myself off from the world.

79
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:57,330
Footloose, fancy-free.

80
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:03,111
Won't that be lonely?
An island unto yourself?

81
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,238
- No.
- Madame?

82
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:08,033
- Can I have a glass of red wine, please?
- Yes, madame.

83
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:13,847
No. I would populate the island
with all new people.

84
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,334
People that I actually like.

85
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,477
Yes, but then things change.

86
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,671
The people you thought you'd like...

87
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,274
turn out to be as bad
as the people you left behind.

88
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:28,486
Soon you're moving to another island,
and so it goes on, ad infinitum.

89
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:33,116
You know my solution?
Get along with everyone.

90
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,660
Really?

91
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:40,832
Then why are you here alone
in a hotel bar on a Saturday night?

92
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,877
Well, I certainly
wouldn't keep you waiting.

93
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,157
Exactly. Because you never know
what kind of...

94
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:52,635
handsome stranger
I might start talking to.

95
00:07:56,973 --> 00:08:00,627
"I do desire we become
better strangers."

96
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,213
Pulling out the Shakespeare.

97
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:05,382
Is that line successful
for you normally?

98
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:08,259
I had my moments with it, you know?

99
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,944
<i>Comme ci, comme ca.</i>

100
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,906
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

101
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:19,287
Thank you. You're so kind.

102
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:22,123
There you go. Back on the grid.

103
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,901
Why is that the most helpful people

104
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,904
are always around
when you do not want any help?

105
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:31,508
Give him a minute.
He'll be back with a shoemaker.

106
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:37,680
On the other hand, it's nice to be
looked after every now and then.

107
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,917
The other day I found myself
opening a door for a man.

108
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,228
What happened to chivalry?

109
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:47,257
- You know why guys open doors for women?
- No.

110
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,592
So we can check out your asses
as you walk by.

111
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,804
Well, you're just full of all these
amazing insights, aren't you?

112
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:56,991
I can tell within one minute
of meeting someone...

113
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:00,286
if I want to be with them.

114
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,414
How about me?

115
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,250
Do you want to be with me?

116
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,545
Yes.

117
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:11,965
For one more minute.

118
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,218
Okay.

119
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,347
You've got a minute.

120
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:22,600
What are you going to do with it?

121
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:30,049
Olivia? Oh, my God! Hi!

122
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,402
What are you doing here?

123
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:37,474
I was in Dublin in the book festival,

124
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,809
and Dad called me and told me
that you were coming,

125
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,746
that he was meeting you here, and that
I should come and surprise you. Surprise!

126
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,608
- He flaked on us, didn't he?
- Yes.

127
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,210
So how did you two make
the connection? Hi!

128
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,214
You're the famous Olivia?

129
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:59,721
My beautiful sister Olivia.
Olivia, my gorgeous Englishman...

130
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:03,182
- ...Richard Haig. Thank you.
- You look great.

131
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,963
So me, my dad, and my mom are staying
at this hotel that we always stay at,

132
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:13,676
and my dad keeps running off saying he has
meetings, or appointments, or whatever.

133
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:17,447
And finally my mom gets fed up,
and she decides to tail him one day

134
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,033
to one of his "meetings".

135
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,994
Ends up following him
to the other end of the beach

136
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,873
where Livvy is staying with her mom.

137
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:30,276
And all hell breaks loose.

138
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,737
Our dad is leading a double life,

139
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:37,008
- like raising two families at the same time.
- What a naughty boy.

140
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,802
Right? Crazy.

141
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,682
Anyway...

142
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:49,879
I take Kate to the beach, I'm sitting there
and I'm trying to process everything.

143
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,633
What my father did, my poor mom,

144
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,302
and the fact that I have
this little lovely sister.

145
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:59,055
For me, I mean, I was stoked.
I always wanted a big sister.

146
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:04,911
And I decide the only way we can protect
each other from this craziness

147
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:09,732
is if Kate and I make
a pact, no secrets.

148
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,985
Absolute honesty.

149
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,863
From this day forward,
we would tell each other everything.

150
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:18,324
No matter what, always.

151
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:22,303
And we have.
And we're, like, best friends.

152
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,180
So, Livvy...

153
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:26,849
how is your Alan?

154
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,770
What?

155
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,147
Please. Tell us about Alan.

156
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,110
He's great.

157
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:41,889
Livvy's Alan is the Alan Sloan.
You know, the romance writer?

158
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,517
And Livvy edits his books,
and they're totally in love.

159
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:47,603
Madly and totally in love
with a romance writer.

160
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,414
- That sounds fascinating.
- Well,

161
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,027
no more than the Romantics professor's
passion for his students, surely.

162
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,296
- Livvy, be nice.
- Yes, Kate.

163
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,449
Would either of you like
a little taste of my steak?

164
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:02,218
- No thanks.
- It's very tender.

165
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:08,975
- You're unbelievable, aren't you?
- I'm sorry?

166
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,378
Of course. On the verge
of graduating, going home.

167
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,255
She's the perfect catch
for you, isn't she?

168
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,632
- Hey.
- I get it. I get it.

169
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:20,303
He's hot, and funny, and smart,

170
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:23,072
and he's got the suave accent.

171
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:27,685
But all I see is a lothario
with an eternally wandering eye

172
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,354
who simply charmed
the pants off you, literally.

173
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:35,568
- Livvy, what are you doing?
- Kate, I know this feels like love,

174
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:39,489
but no, no, no, no.
This is not love. This is a fling.

175
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,949
How do you know?
What are you even saying?

176
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:46,454
Obviously, you're looking
for a father figure, but in our case

177
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:52,310
it means a self-centered, cheating
womanizer who's not to be trusted.

178
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,837
And you're just so young,
you can't see it.

179
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,964
How young were you
when you ran off with Anwar.

180
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,567
- We thought I was pregnant!
- Well, I am.

181
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,470
- What?
- What?

182
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,741
- I wanted to tell you earlier, but...
- Pregnant? With a baby?

183
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,452
Yeah.

184
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:13,064
I wanted to tell you another way,
but this is like so weird, I just...

185
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:16,792
No, this is the perfect way.
This is really the perfect way, I think.

186
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:21,739
You know what? This is great.
Really great.

187
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,177
- Well, that was so heartfelt.
- Livvy. Livvy.

188
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,512
Thank you so much for supper.

189
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:31,415
Remind me never to do this again.

190
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,934
I'm just going to go outside
and get some fresh air.

191
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,503
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me. Air.

192
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,396
- Yeah, run.
- What?

193
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:39,465
- Richard?
- Yeah?

194
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,233
- Richard? Look.
- Yeah, I'm here.

195
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:45,930
I know I just dropped a bomb on you
back there, so right here, right now,

196
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,616
- I'm giving you the out.
- I just want some air, that's all.

197
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:53,162
You just need some time to think.
It's fine. I get it.

198
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,109
So I'm moving to LA.

199
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,961
I got a really cool job
at a venture capital firm.

200
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,031
- You're full of surprises today.
- You'll love LA.

201
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:07,702
It'll be like Cambridge-ish,
but with a lot of palm trees,

202
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:11,347
and, like, chicks with tans and stuff.

203
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,977
- Oh, honey, you're all clammy.
- I just need some air. That's all, really.

204
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,671
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

205
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,690
I'll be back in there. Go ahead. You go.

206
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,110
- Richard.
- Yeah?

207
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:29,156
- You're going to be a great father.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,668
Did you have a good dinner then, sir?

209
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,647
All right, where the buggering hell
have you been? I said 6:00.

210
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:06,652
Sorry about that, Dad. Didn't realize
your grumbling ran on such a tight schedule.

211
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:10,447
Bloody miserable out there, as usual.

212
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:17,146
Don't touch that.

213
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:19,540
Good God, Dad. I'm not five years old.

214
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,626
- Hi, Richard, dear.
- Hello, Joan.

215
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:27,548
- How is everything?
- Oh, just terrific. Thanks for asking.

216
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:30,968
You still boffing
that Yank totty, are you?

217
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,929
Yes, she's a great girl.

218
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,124
Bright, beautiful, ambitious.

219
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:41,604
You mean a horrible little upstart
determined to go places.

220
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:45,508
So, tell me, when are you going
to start going places?

221
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,318
- Good God. Please.
- Oh, come on. Jesus.

222
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:49,303
Come on, when I was your age,

223
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:52,389
I mean, I'd been the head
of the department for seven years.

224
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:55,643
Yeah, and it made you
so happy, didn't it, Dad?

225
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,703
All right, what's the grievance today?

226
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:01,707
Split infinitives, too many used?
Too many women with jobs?

227
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:05,711
It's his waterworks. He's got
to go back into hospital next week.

228
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:08,797
Stop talking about my cock, woman.

229
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,680
Tell me something, Dad.

230
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,836
Why did you and Mom get married?

231
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:26,465
What kind of an inane question is that
for a Thursday evening?

232
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,151
For a man who revels
in reckless promiscuity,

233
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:31,945
your four marriages
do beg some questions.

234
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:36,934
Your mother fed me regularly.

235
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:40,396
She pleasured me
half decently now and then.

236
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:44,875
- What more could a man want?
- Oh, I don't know, friendship?

237
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,921
Someone to see the world with,
have a laugh with?

238
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:51,507
Maybe even start a family with.

239
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:55,411
Good God, man.

240
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,972
You've fallen for that little slice
of American pie.

241
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,791
- Dad...
- Now you listen to me.

242
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:05,562
This might be the most important
bit of advice that I ever give you.

243
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,510
American women may be fun and Victoria's
Secret when you first bed them,

244
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,264
but as soon as they get their claws
into you, they stop fucking

245
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:20,602
and start eating, and the only ass
you're going to get is a fat one.

246
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:21,854
Why did open my mouth?

247
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:27,668
American women invariably become
spouters of self-help platitudes,

248
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:32,673
they're addicted to designer labels,
dieting, and frozen yogurt.

249
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,244
Overall, thoroughly nasty,
selfish, vain creatures

250
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:40,722
that don't fuck!

251
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:45,060
Thank you for your fatherly advice.

252
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,396
Good night, Joan.

253
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:53,318
Bugger off then! See if I care.

254
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,870
Kate! Kate!

255
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,998
Screw Cambridge. I'm in.

256
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,691
- Really?
- Really.

257
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,335
- Really?
- Yes, come on!

258
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,383
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

259
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:20,429
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

260
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:25,042
<i>Up in the clouds over the town</i>

261
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:27,853
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

262
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:33,133
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

263
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:37,029
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

264
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:41,283
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

265
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,620
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

266
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:49,416
<i>So from the moonlight</i>

267
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,754
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

268
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:57,591
<i>This will be our time</i>

269
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:01,970
<i>Free-falling nosedive</i>

270
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,313
Look into the world, Jakey.

271
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:14,650
It's a beautiful world.

272
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:19,196
Do you need the booby now?
Do you want the booby?

273
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:23,200
Yes. There's a boy after my own heart.

274
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:30,274
<i>The whole world in our sights</i>

275
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:34,461
<i>Like a miniature paradise...</i>

276
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:43,537
Okay, family, here we go.

277
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:48,000
Here you are, Jakey. Welcome home.
A modest little house...

278
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,477
which your granddad bought
your mom out of guilt.

279
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:52,754
- Don't fall in the pool.
- I won't.

280
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:55,023
You probably will never meet anyway.

281
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,234
He has a very bad habit
of never showing up.

282
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,568
Hey.

283
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,863
All right.

284
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:09,730
Oh, I'm going to call Livvy.
Can you take the baby?

285
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,790
- Sure.
- Okay.

286
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay.

287
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,785
I know it's easier to read the critics
and the CliffNotes,

288
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,913
but forget about them.

289
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,084
Read the poems. Put the time in.

290
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:02,132
After all, "Nothing will come
of nothing."

291
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,594
What was that from?

292
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,725
Anyone?

293
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,545
- Hey. There you go.
- I'm having trouble getting on the Wi-Fi.

294
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,938
What's the password again?

295
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:20,984
I think they're all on Prozac.

296
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,653
Did you hear from the university yet?

297
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:28,450
- No. They went with the other guy.
- I told you to kiss ass more.

298
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:31,995
- Angela, please.
- I'm sure something will open up soon at ULA.

299
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,356
Yeah, well, one can
only hope, can't one?

300
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,692
In the meantime, I'm glad that
you're still slumming it here with us.

301
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,320
You city college lot
don't pull any punches do you?

302
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,089
- We will go 16 rounds with anyone.
- Bring it on.

303
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,856
Asshole.

304
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:02,233
Asshole.

305
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,320
Never let me hear you
say that word, Jake.

306
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,766
The word is "ahh's-hole" not "aah's-hole."
Can you say "ahh's-hole?"

307
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:13,244
- Asshole.
- Yes, elongate the A.

308
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:15,330
There we go.

309
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:18,166
I'll get them. I'll get them.

310
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:23,672
- Mama!
- No, mama is at work.

311
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,926
- She'll be back later.
- Mama.

312
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:36,017
No, that's Hummer. Hummer.

313
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:38,186
Well done. Hummer.

314
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,629
- Pull over.
- What?

315
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:42,983
- Pull over! Listen to this voicemail.
- I can't pull over.

316
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,928
<i>I thought he was saying "mama,"</i>

317
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:50,990
<i>and then I realized he was pointing
at one of those absurdly oversized tanks</i>

318
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:55,245
<i>driven no doubt by some idiot
with an absurdly undersized penis.</i>

319
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,622
- This is not an oversized car.
- <i>All right.</i>

320
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,666
He knows.

321
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:10,243
- Hey there, sexy. Where are you?
- I'm in New York.

322
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,245
Honey, do I look chunky?

323
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:14,472
Didn't mean to call you sexy.
Wrong person.

324
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,435
No, I look good.

325
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:20,562
<i>Very funny. Is Kate there?</i>

326
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,715
She's not back yet, still banking.
Busy counting things.

327
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:26,443
Well, tell her to call me
right, right away,

328
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,862
because I have something
really big to tell her.

329
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:32,223
No secrets in the family. Pray tell.

330
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,351
<i>I can't believe
that I'm about to tell you...</i>

331
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:38,647
Richard, I don't know
why this is so hard for me.

332
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:41,733
I've been trying
to tell you now for weeks.

333
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,587
- Alan's asked me to marry him.
- I'm in love with somebody else.

334
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:48,281
You're what?

335
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:52,035
We're getting married! Don't act
so surprised that somebody asked me.

336
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,220
- Are you on the phone?
- Who is it?

337
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,973
- Who are you talking to?
- Answer the question. Who is it?

338
00:23:57,098 --> 00:24:00,226
- I just did!
- Who's on the phone?

339
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:02,587
- Hello?
- Kate! Kate!

340
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:06,316
- I have to call you back.
- What? Hello?

341
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:11,971
I was just, I mean... I was
really young, okay? Really young.

342
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:15,767
Not that you're not, of course.
But I really thought that I loved you,

343
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:18,311
but clearly I was working
through daddy issues.

344
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:23,900
And then I got pregnant, and you
were just trying to do the right thing.

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,780
And you've been a really good father, but
let's face it, you never really loved me.

346
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,408
- But Brian does.
- Brian? Brian?

347
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:34,494
That little idiot from the office?

348
00:24:34,594 --> 00:24:39,207
He likes to talk to me about start-ups
and acquisitions and exit strategies.

349
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,876
I mean, all the stuff that you think
is so boring about me.

350
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,837
It is boring. God.

351
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:48,149
Why do you have to be so
goddamn English? Talk to me!

352
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:53,221
You can leave me,
but I am not leaving that boy.

353
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:55,031
Brian.

354
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,450
Richard,

355
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:59,953
why can't you just talk to me?

356
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:13,783
Now, I know two years in the pool house

357
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:16,744
makes me look a little a nut,
but I'll say two things.

358
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:19,914
First, your mom and Brian
hated me being there,

359
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,475
which was the most wonderful
incentive to stay.

360
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,227
And secondly...

361
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:28,314
I wanted to be close to you.

362
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:31,109
Good morning.

363
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:35,405
I think you're going
to want to see this.

364
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:39,200
- Oh, let me see it.
- Is the big bad professor awake yet?

365
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:43,354
<i>Jake to Dad. Breaker, breaker.
You got your ears on?</i>

366
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,998
- Okay.
- <i>Are you awake?</i>

367
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:49,627
- It's Jakey. Just a second.
- <i>Get up! Are you having a sleepover?</i>

368
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:53,448
Hi, Jakey! Good morning.

369
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:56,075
- Where are you?
- <i>Can I come and play?</i>

370
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,844
Just a second, Jakey.

371
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:00,246
- Hey.
- Hi!

372
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:03,558
Would you mind just skedaddling for now?
It's my son.

373
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:06,894
Your son? I love kids! I babysit!

374
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,339
- Sorry about this. The perils of parenthood.
- It's okay.

375
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,149
- Come and see me during the week.
- When?

376
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:14,068
- Make it a surprise.
- Oh, I love surprises! Okay, I will.

377
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,429
Okay, good-bye.

378
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:18,973
- Who was that?
- Oh, just a friend of mine.

379
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:22,076
Very busy lady. She had to leave.
There you go.

380
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:24,954
Aren't these uncomfortable?

381
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,416
That's why girls love it when you
take them off. Let's get some pancakes.

382
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,168
Dad, get on with it.

383
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,463
So there we were.

384
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:36,466
And then...

385
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,409
last week...

386
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,953
everything went pear-shaped.

387
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:43,431
I have the papers you asked for.

388
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,978
- Will that be all, professor?
- For now, yes, thanks.

389
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,608
Great.

390
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,110
Excuse me.

391
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,347
Newest member of the TA
of the month club?

392
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,641
How dare you insinuate such a thing?

393
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,244
- You have a visitor. Be nice.
- Send them in.

394
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:07,622
Thank you.

395
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:14,821
- Professor Pickard, what a delight!
- How's your father these days?

396
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:18,424
- Loving life. He is happy as a clam.
- That's good to hear.

397
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,844
Well, I received your application
for the position at the University.

398
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:25,765
I was in the area, so I thought I would
just pop by and invite you to a soirée

399
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,708
- I'm giving tomorrow.
- Splendid.

400
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:29,685
The faculty will be there, of course.

401
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,397
I thought it might be a good idea if you do
come by and just sort of butter them up.

402
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:36,692
Not me, by the way.
I consider myself lavishly buttered.

403
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,428
Oh, well, that's good to know.

404
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:41,405
- So we'll see you there.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

405
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:45,226
"Dustin Kalarney"
just sold its 5 millionth copy.

406
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:47,662
- You're unbelievable.
- What?

407
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:52,525
Here I am, splayed out like an open-faced
sandwich so we can have a baby,

408
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,544
- and all you care about...
- Mr. Sloan.

409
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,364
Would you mind signing a copy
of your book for me?

410
00:27:58,464 --> 00:28:02,451
- Of course. Did you like it?
- Are you kidding? It was great.

411
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:05,763
Really? Is that Desiree two Es or one E?

412
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,308
What the hell was that for?

413
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:12,520
Oops, it slipped.
Can I have my phone back, please?

414
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,465
There you go, you can do it.
Just concentrate.

415
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:20,611
- Nice big swing. That's it.
- Dad, I suck.

416
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:23,723
No, you don't, you don't.
You look great, just eye on the ball.

417
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:27,560
Who's here! Jakey, what up, dawg?
Yo, give me some love.

418
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,228
Blow it up. Blow it up.

419
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,439
- Jellyfish sting!
- Jellyfish sting!

420
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,958
Lots of love. We were just
playing a little ball here.

421
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,377
- Right. Sorry, sorry.
- That's all right. Okay.

422
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:40,031
What are you doing? You're a righty.
You got to switch your hands around.

423
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:43,759
- Come around there. Bat up!
- Eye on the ball. Hit it to Dad!

424
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,705
Sorry, Dad! Are you okay? Are you okay?

425
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:51,642
I'm okay, son. I'm all right.
Just... occupational hazard.

426
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:55,271
- That looks pretty bad.
- No, this. It's okay.

427
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:57,231
Jakey!

428
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,774
- Hey.
- Hey.

429
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,553
- Did you remember Atlanta?
- Yeah. No? Atlanta?

430
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:05,322
- Brian and I, four days, conference.
- Got it.

431
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:08,325
- We leave the day after tomorrow.
- Good. Sounds good. I'll be there.

432
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:10,036
- No, you'll be here.
- I'll be here.

433
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:12,063
- Yeah. Here's Jakey's schedule.
- Great.

434
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:14,482
I left a copy in your room
and another one on the fridge.

435
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:17,026
- All right. That's good.
- So, yeah.

436
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,086
I'm on it. Jawohl!

437
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:22,048
Okay.

438
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:25,326
No, I understand,

439
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:29,889
but I strongly believe that three slaves
is enough. It's enough. Come on.

440
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,066
You!

441
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,823
Dr. Collins!

442
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,245
Son of a bitch!

443
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,835
Yeah!

444
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:02,546
Jesus.

445
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,841
Come in.

446
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:09,053
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- Yeah, covering the Asian markets.

447
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:12,456
Oh, hey, by the way, I can get you
in on a pretty sweet no-load.

448
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:15,835
These guys are killing it right now. I can
get you 15%, 18%. Just say the word.

449
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:18,187
The word is no.
What is it you want? I'm busy.

450
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:20,815
This letter came for you. It's about
your green card. I'm sorry.

451
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,467
- I opened it before I saw who...
- Just read it, Brian, thank you.

452
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,554
- I mean, you've opened it. Just read it.
- All right. "This is your final warning.

453
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:29,306
If you and your spouse fail to attend
your interview next week,

454
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:32,368
deportation proceedings
will be initiated."

455
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:39,041
Blimey, mate. Looks like you could be
in a spot of bother with the Bobbies.

456
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:43,737
Keep working on the accent, Brian.
Close the door on the way out.

457
00:30:43,837 --> 00:30:46,173
- Cheerio.
- Shut up.

458
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:49,885
I love the dentist.
I'm not drooling, am I?

459
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,763
Hello, Mr. Haig.

460
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:55,516
You can't drink alcohol
when taking this medication.

461
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:56,642
- Really?
- Yes.

462
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:57,710
- No?
- No.

463
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,212
Absolutely not. Wouldn't dream of it.
Thank you so much.

464
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:01,714
- No alcohol.
- Good.

465
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:03,632
- We'll see you soon.
- Can't wait.

466
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,901
Look forward to it. Thank you so much.

467
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:07,636
- No alcohol.
- No alcohol.

468
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,655
- I mean it.
- I mean it, too.

469
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,315
Okay, let's go this way.
Any time you feel like it,

470
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:22,918
- jump in and lavish me with praise.
- Copy that.

471
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,921
- So glad you could make it!
- Oh, thank you!

472
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,506
- Here you are.
- Thanks. Wonderful.

473
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,369
Please, help yourself to refreshments.
My wife made her famous cheese balls.

474
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:35,247
Please be sure to try one
and compliment her accordingly.

475
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:37,224
Will do.

476
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:42,855
There are some very, very important
people here. I'd like you to meet them.

477
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,050
And they are your kind
of people, Richard.

478
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,152
Come this way.

479
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,642
My dear colleagues,
this is Richard Haig.

480
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:57,186
This is Professor Vale, Bates, Berg,

481
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:58,996
- Ang and Professor Jones.
- Hello.

482
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,461
Can we do that again?
I forgot your names already.

483
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:10,240
It is a damn shame we didn't hire you,
what was it, three years ago?

484
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,178
Three years, two months, 17 days.
But who's counting?

485
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,538
- You know, I met your father once.
- Oh, yeah?

486
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:20,334
He delivered a fascinating lecture,
a retort to Terry Hearst,

487
00:32:20,434 --> 00:32:23,729
a hermeneutical reading
of Milton's "Paradise Lost."

488
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:26,565
- Wish I'd been there for that one.
- Where are you from in England?

489
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,568
- And are you a Rich or a Dick?
- I'm a Richard.

490
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,654
- Your father took a structural stance...
- You know, the missus and I,

491
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,032
we love it over there,
we go every summer.

492
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:38,327
- You do? Great.
- Cheers again, matey.

493
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:41,563
Richard, I want to let you know
that these fervent minds here

494
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:44,583
have taken great care looking over
your application material.

495
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:47,586
Never trust an Englishman
who doesn't drink, Richie boy.

496
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:49,989
- Syllabus...
- ...epistemological level.

497
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:51,256
Academics. Yup, yup, yup.

498
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:55,244
- I do have one small question for you.
- This one's the biggest yapper of them all.

499
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:59,181
How are the Romantics relevant
to today's students?

500
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,962
You want me to answer this question now?

501
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:09,258
I'm sure we'd all enjoy hearing
just a taste of one of your lectures.

502
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:11,777
- A taste.
- A mere amuse-bouche is all.

503
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:15,614
Why not the whole meal? Why don't you
come down and see me in action?

504
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:18,267
- I happen to be free on Thursday.
- Christ, what about that?

505
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,869
I see you've already met my wife.

506
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:28,527
I'm just going to go outside for a moment
here, and just jump in front of a bus.

507
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,779
Where are you going?
You didn't even say goodbye!

508
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,798
That's true.

509
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:35,551
Bye!

510
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:38,053
I wonder if he was flirting with me.

511
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,597
Oh, my God.

512
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,937
Oh, shit.

513
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:51,567
Oh, bollocks.

514
00:34:12,296 --> 00:34:13,405
Shit.

515
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:17,050
Good evening, Officer. Oh, boy.
Have I been drinking?

516
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:21,013
I drink every night. How about you?

517
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:24,308
Can't we all just get along?

518
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:38,405
Thanks.

519
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,144
Thanks again for bailing me out.

520
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:47,539
- And for the silent treatment.
- Don't talk to me.

521
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,548
I still can't believe it.

522
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:59,259
- Can't believe what?
- I wasn't talking to you.

523
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:03,830
And I wasn't talking to you,
my darling little fornicating ex-wife.

524
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,999
- Shut up, Richard.
- Alan dumped me.

525
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:10,020
What a small world.
My wife did exactly the same thing.

526
00:35:10,145 --> 00:35:12,314
She used to adore me.

527
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:15,150
Where, oh, where did the love go?

528
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:17,444
She turned 30 and wised up.

529
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:21,056
So, what's going on?
Why are you here, Olivia?

530
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,684
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- It's the least I can do.

531
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:26,186
- Helping out? Helping out with what?
- I needed to know

532
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:30,023
that Jake was going to be looked after,
fed, and driven by a responsible person

533
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:32,876
- with a valid driver's license.
- Fine. Why her?

534
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:36,171
Livvy offered to come
at a very difficult time for her

535
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:39,324
to bail us out of the mess
that you put us in.

536
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:41,009
You know what?

537
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:45,706
- I've had enough of this.
- You know, you say "I" a lot.

538
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:50,627
Really? Well, I know that Jake
loves having you around.

539
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,880
But I'm getting phone calls
from your immigration attorney

540
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,466
because you don't ever bother
to call him back.

541
00:35:56,566 --> 00:36:00,762
I can't be in your life anymore.
I'm enabling your degenerate behavior.

542
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:03,907
And what is the point
of all this right now?

543
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:07,619
Richard, if you want me to pretend
like we're happily married

544
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:11,706
so you can stay in this country,
you better get it together.

545
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,706
- Yeah?
- <i>Gotcha.</i>

546
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,625
- <i>I woke you up, didn't I?</i>
- Dad, is that you?

547
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:34,880
You know, there are no time zones
in China. Did you know that?

548
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,774
<i>The whole bloody country
is on Peking time,</i>

549
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:40,569
<i>and that's the way it should be.</i>

550
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:44,306
- We should all be on Peking time.
- <i>Don't be a dumb prat.</i>

551
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:47,726
The whole world
should be on London time.

552
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:50,370
Okay. What do you want, Dad?

553
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:55,400
- How's the little turd?
- Don't call him that.

554
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,070
Come on,
you're far too bloody sensitive.

555
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,115
<i>All right, great to hear from you, Dad.</i>

556
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:05,302
Why don't you go badger Joan? Okay?

557
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:06,995
<i>She's not here.</i>

558
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:11,141
Shit. Okay. I've got to go. Goodbye.

559
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,285
Richard Haig?

560
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,412
Thank you.

561
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:43,131
So, your interview is Monday.

562
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:46,301
This is the fourth quarter now, two minute
warning, you got no timeouts left.

563
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:47,869
What the hell are you talking about?

564
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:52,932
If your ex-wife won't show up to your
interview, it's going to be Hail Mary time.

565
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:54,726
Okay?

566
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,397
- So, did you get a full-time job?
- Doing my best.

567
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,967
Have you recently joined
any terrorist organizations?

568
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:05,487
Applied all over. Fingers crossed.

569
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:10,617
Have you ever been arrested?

570
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,289
- DUI.
- When? How many years ago?

571
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:19,859
Friday? I mean, they can't kick me
out of the country for that, can they?

572
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,921
- Jakey's a US citizen.
- You see the people in my waiting room?

573
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:25,824
The kid born here, the parents, illegal.

574
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:28,551
They're deporting the parents!

575
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:31,930
Oh, yeah, it's game seven,
win or go home time.

576
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:36,226
All right, well, if you join
a recovery program now...

577
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,877
What, recovery?

578
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:41,256
You do the 10 mandated sessions
the court's going to give you for the DUI.

579
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:44,092
- 10? That's going to take me weeks!
- Hell week, baby. Two-a-days.

580
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:46,678
You get your ex-wife to your interview
and you get a great job.

581
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:49,989
You do all that, and you get
the ring, baby, okay?

582
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:52,951
Yes, of course.

583
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,973
<i>Hijos de puta.</i>

584
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:41,916
Everything all right?

585
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,963
Yeah. Why?

586
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,282
Want to borrow my car?

587
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:52,135
Okay, if you're not using it.

588
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:09,068
That's good, that's good,
that's good. It's okay!

589
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:18,561
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

590
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:21,164
Did Kate tell you about
the one-way system at pick up?

591
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,585
No, I didn't think so. It's okay.

592
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:30,214
- All right, toots. Step on it.
- Oh, boy.

593
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:35,912
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
Car, car! Jesus.

594
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:38,581
Where the hell did you learn
how to drive?

595
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,391
Mexico.

596
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:44,479
Oh, can you please get that?
Where is my phone? Where's my phone?

597
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:47,815
- I'm waiting for a very important call.
- Here you go. Sorry, it's down here.

598
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:50,652
Hello?

599
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:54,097
<i>Olivia? I have Tim Prince
from Creative Management Lit for you.</i>

600
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:56,824
- Okay.
- Can't he dial the phone by himself?

601
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:58,810
- <i>Hey, babes!</i>
- Hi!

602
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,665
- <i>Listen, so sorry about Alan. Awful!</i>
- Thanks, Tim. Thank you.

603
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,568
<i>I caught my ex-wife in downward dog
with my tantra teacher</i>

604
00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:09,337
<i>coming out of her central eye.
You feel so...</i>

605
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:11,864
- Angry.
- Who the hell is this guy?

606
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:13,366
<i>Okay, listen, babes,</i>

607
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:16,803
<i>if anyone can go from editor to author,
it's you, and I mean that.</i>

608
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,831
<i>And I got your sample chapter.
Give me a day or two to look it over.</i>

609
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,166
- Of course.
- <i>I'll be gentle. I promise.</i>

610
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:25,478
- Who says I like it gentle?
- <i>That's my girl. Okay, got to jump.</i>

611
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:28,106
- <i>Bye, babes.</i>
- Bye!

612
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:33,486
- Fascinating exchange.
- How can men move on so quickly?

613
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:36,014
- What?
- It's like a switch for you, isn't it?

614
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:38,099
You flip it off,
then you turn to the next one.

615
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,394
You flip that one on, and when you
get tired of that, you just flip another.

616
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:45,331
Like a pilot on a cockpit.
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

617
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:47,817
What the hell are you talking about?

618
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:50,361
Wishful thinking, Richard.
I wish I was like...

619
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:53,781
Eyes on the road, eyes on the road!
Do not enter! Wrong way! Wrong way!

620
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:56,843
- Oh, relax. Relax.
- I am, I am very relaxed.

621
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:59,303
You're like an old lady!

622
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:04,042
You men, you'd rather just go out there

623
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:07,837
and have sex than work things out.

624
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:09,647
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

625
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:14,694
But your horniness is nothing
but a big mask for you to hide behind.

626
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:18,156
- Now, what's wrong with a big mask?
- Let me ask you something.

627
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:22,518
How can you teach the Romantics
when you can't even have a real feeling?

628
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:24,395
Is irritation a real feeling?

629
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:28,316
I mean, listening to you flirt on the phone
with some guy who's calling you babes,

630
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:31,002
- oohing and ahhing. No...
- Please. I wasn't oohing and ahhing.

631
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:35,590
I like it gentle. Good Lord, anyone
would think you were having an orgasm.

632
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:38,076
I do not sound like that when I...

633
00:42:38,176 --> 00:42:43,097
Anyway, you should hear some of the stupid
noises you guys make when you're...

634
00:42:43,598 --> 00:42:47,643
You can't even say the word, can you?
Come on. What do we sound like?

635
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:50,563
For example, you have the bear.

636
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,054
I can see your tonsils.

637
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:00,306
- Then you have the sports commentators.
- Oh, yeah?

638
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:05,494
<i>Baja la pelota, recibe con el pecho,
mete mano en el área chica. Gol!</i>

639
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,750
- What kind of men have you been with?
- And then there's the quiet ones.

640
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:16,464
- Are you finished?
- No.

641
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:19,951
- Of course not.
- And the worst one is the Tourette's one.

642
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,595
- What?
- You know, "Shit, fuck.

643
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,515
I love you, fuck me, oh,
motherfucker bitch, I love you.

644
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:29,418
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."

645
00:43:29,518 --> 00:43:31,646
Hey, that sounds like you, Dad.

646
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,566
I heard him once on the walkie-talkie.

647
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:38,177
Mr. Haig, do you have a minute?

648
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:42,390
Of course I do.
Come on, toots. This way.

649
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,310
This morning, Jake said
he had a question about the rules.

650
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,481
He asked if he was allowed to use
the special alphabet.

651
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:52,900
- Oh, boy.
- I didn't know what that was.

652
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,338
So he asked if he was allowed
to say the "A" word.

653
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:00,992
Then he asked,
"Can I say bugger, crap, dummy?"

654
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:03,953
And when he got to F, he said,
"Am I allowed to say 'frick,'

655
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:06,430
because I know I'm not allowed
to say 'fuck.'"

656
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:10,434
It was at that point that I sent him
to the principal's office.

657
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:19,151
- And what did you say for G?
- Goddamn.

658
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,736
Mr. Haig,

659
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:26,033
how is Jake adjusting to your new...
living situation?

660
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,355
No, no, this is not what it looks like,
or what it sounds like. No, no, no.

661
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:34,984
- We don't need to have an explanation.
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.

662
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:37,837
- I would never...
- You've said enough.

663
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:46,287
Oh, wonderful.

664
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:49,098
I'll walk to the curb. Mind your hands.

665
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:52,335
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

666
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:55,938
I'm just going to get
some delicious Potatoes Latinos.

667
00:44:57,022 --> 00:45:00,025
Yeah, and maybe a manicure.

668
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:02,345
Or a bikini wax.

669
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:05,156
Bye. I'll see you later. You take care.

670
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:08,075
- Whatever.
- Bye.

671
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:15,775
We have two new members today.
We have Cindy and Richard.

672
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,376
So, Cindy, do you want to...

673
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:22,423
Hi, I'm Cindy.

674
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:25,426
And I'm an alcoholic.

675
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:31,056
Thank you, Cindy. Richard?

676
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:36,562
Hi, I am Richard,
and I'm not an alcoholic.

677
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:41,342
I'm English, a country with...
a few thousand years of history,

678
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:44,386
and part of that history
is the communal practice

679
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:46,555
of having a drink in the pub.

680
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:50,976
Now, I know it's not your fault
a few sad, sorry pilgrims arrived here

681
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:55,898
and infected your country with the message
of puritanical masochism.

682
00:45:55,998 --> 00:46:00,711
But it is your fault you've all taken it
on board quite so earnestly.

683
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:04,798
So... you chaps go ahead.

684
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,118
Knock yourselves out.

685
00:46:07,218 --> 00:46:10,596
But just know this. The first thing
I intend to do when this hour is up:

686
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:13,933
is hit that bar across the street
and have a nice cold one.

687
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:17,645
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you, Chad.

688
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:28,447
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

689
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:32,101
You know, the only reason I'm taking
this class is so I can get my GPA up

690
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:35,788
so I can play baseball
at Arizona State, so...

691
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,275
How about you, Stacy?

692
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,710
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

693
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:43,712
They're not.

694
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:51,303
You have been such a wonderful audience.

695
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,122
I can't wait to see you all next week,

696
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:57,126
when I shall be lecturing naked,
wearing a sombrero.

697
00:46:57,226 --> 00:46:59,603
It'll be so wonderful.

698
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,274
Fuck me.

699
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:08,028
Olivia?

700
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:11,390
- Hey, babes! There you are!
- Oh, Tim! Hi!

701
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,575
How are you, beautiful?

702
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,579
Okay.

703
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:20,416
About this.

704
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:22,584
This rocks.

705
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,045
- Really?
- It is smart, it is funny.

706
00:47:25,254 --> 00:47:27,156
- Oh, I love Jenna.
- Jane.

707
00:47:27,256 --> 00:47:30,868
You might want to change that. Sex sells.
Jane makes me think of nun in a wimple.

708
00:47:30,968 --> 00:47:32,386
God, but you are so talented.

709
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:35,347
You're so beautiful, too.
And trust me, that helps, babe.

710
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:38,334
I'm gonna take you to the stars.
I am gonna take you to the stars.

711
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:41,603
All I ask is that these shoulders
be the ones you stand upon.

712
00:47:41,729 --> 00:47:43,105
Watch the silk, though?

713
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:49,011
Hello?

714
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:51,805
Richard, listen. They've assigned
your case for investigation.

715
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:53,641
Really? What does that mean?

716
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:56,018
You're under surveillance
by an undercover federal agent.

717
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,770
- <i>Jesus! Fuck!</i>
- Yes.

718
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,288
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

719
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:03,859
Shit. He's here tonight.
He just flashed his badge.

720
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:05,486
Don't fumble the ball, now!

721
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:08,756
<i>All that matters is that you exhibit
good moral character, okay?</i>

722
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:11,175
Okay, everybody, grab a seat.

723
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,137
Okay, so, Chad, I believe
you wanted to start us off?

724
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:18,415
I'm Chad, and I am 13 days sober.

725
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:21,894
- Yeah! Way to go, Chad!
- All right, Chad!

726
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:26,882
All right, so why don't you tell us
how that feels?

727
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:29,843
Well, you know,
it started by not going...

728
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:33,780
Wendy? Excuse me, Wendy,
just a moment there, please.

729
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:35,699
Sorry, everyone. Can I say something?

730
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:38,702
Sorry, Chad, I didn't mean to interrupt
your moment of glory there.

731
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,205
My name is Richard,

732
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:46,251
and I'd like to amend my earlier comments
about the drinking habits of the English.

733
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:50,572
I mean, just because the entire country
hits the pub after work doesn't mean

734
00:48:50,672 --> 00:48:53,909
we can't all be alcoholics,
because we are.

735
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:57,763
We are inebriates, national disgrace.

736
00:48:57,888 --> 00:49:01,416
What else? I'm married, very happily so.

737
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,294
Oh, and I have a son.
A beautiful little son called Jakey.

738
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:09,566
Born here, in this country, a country which
I love and has such meaning to my heart.

739
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:11,318
So, Richard...

740
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:14,179
with all of that to lose,

741
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:19,201
why would you get drunk
and then get behind the wheel of a car?

742
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:27,793
Yep. Well, there you have it.
I'm an alcoholic.

743
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:31,004
I'm Richard, alcoholic.

744
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:42,683
Yeah? Jakey? Jake, no, no, no.
No, Jakey, just tell him...

745
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:44,418
Just tell him...

746
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:46,603
Tell him just to calm down.

747
00:49:46,728 --> 00:49:49,189
Okay, no more cellphones.

748
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:53,010
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.

749
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:57,030
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry. Don't worry.

750
00:49:57,155 --> 00:50:02,703
I know. I know. Come on, Jakey, calm down.
Calm down. Just breathe. There you go.

751
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:06,106
Breathe, breathe, relax.

752
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,443
- Use your words.
- I... I had a bad dream.

753
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:11,153
- Okay.
- Then I woke up...

754
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:14,923
and Mommy wasn't here,
and you were gone and...

755
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:18,093
I'm really sorry. Okay.

756
00:50:18,552 --> 00:50:21,079
Hey, you know what we're gonna do?

757
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:24,683
We're gonna blow
that bad dream away, okay?

758
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:37,237
Here, let me catch it.

759
00:50:43,118 --> 00:50:47,080
Okay. Give us a hug.
All right, where's Teddy?

760
00:50:48,123 --> 00:50:49,916
There he is!

761
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:56,256
All right, let's go to sleep.
Come on, say good night.

762
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,424
Good night.

763
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:13,799
There you go, my little warrior poet.
Go to sleep.

764
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:19,738
Dad, you and Mom are never going
to live together, are you?

765
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:23,784
No, I'm sorry.

766
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:27,062
But if you're ever upset about anything,

767
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:31,775
anything at all, you go talk
to your mum or talk to me.

768
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,211
Or Brian?

769
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:37,589
Only if I'm stuck down a mine
and your mom's in a coma.

770
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:47,916
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

771
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:49,459
I...

772
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,921
- I was completely useless.
- No, It's okay.

773
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:55,757
I can't even take care
of my little sister's child.

774
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:58,818
I mean, how hard can that be, right?

775
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:03,114
Have you ever felt like everybody else
has gotten their shit together but you?

776
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,436
I mean, my little sister has.
Even you have.

777
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:10,455
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

778
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,042
Look, it's just a lot different
when it's your own kid.

779
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:18,296
Well, I wouldn't know about that either.

780
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,840
Listen, I made some soup.

781
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:25,095
- Would you like some? It's horrible.
- Sure. I love horrible soup.

782
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:34,254
It's horrible. I can't even make a soup.

783
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:35,730
Oh, boy.

784
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:42,095
- You know, you're a really good father.
- Yeah. Sure I am.

785
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:45,907
Richard, I'm giving you a compliment.
Just say thank you.

786
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:47,867
Thank you, Olivia.

787
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:52,455
I like it when you say my name.

788
00:52:53,498 --> 00:52:55,500
It's funny.

789
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:59,963
Most women adore me to begin with,
and then end up hating me.

790
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:04,676
You, on the other hand, hated me right off
the bat, but now I think you despise me.

791
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:08,413
No, I despised you at the beginning.

792
00:53:08,513 --> 00:53:13,518
Now, I just loathe you
a little sometimes.

793
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,523
Well.

794
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,800
<i>I've been staying inside</i>

795
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:49,637
<i>Watching from the outside</i>

796
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:53,641
<i>My God, it's been a long time</i>

797
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:56,603
<i>For sure</i>

798
00:53:57,687 --> 00:54:01,149
<i>I've been reaching for my west side</i>

799
00:54:01,524 --> 00:54:05,069
<i>'Cause it used to be my best side</i>

800
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:08,364
<i>Now it's a part of me I can't find</i>

801
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:11,326
<i>Anymore</i>

802
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:15,997
<i>I wanna fly...</i>

803
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:22,462
I packed your toothbrush, your pajamas,

804
00:54:22,587 --> 00:54:24,130
and...

805
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:27,033
Hey, guys, what's happening?

806
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,743
- Where you going?
- My sleepover!

807
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:31,329
Oh, yeah! The sleepover,
of course. All right.

808
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:35,333
Well, give me a kiss and have
a good night. There you go, soldier.

809
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,085
- Cool!
- Have fun, Jakey!

810
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:39,713
- Let's go.
- Good night.

811
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:42,106
Enjoy your night off.

812
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:20,895
Hello?

813
00:55:23,398 --> 00:55:27,235
Oh, there he is! What's up, Rich?

814
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:29,529
Hi, Richard!

815
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:34,033
Yeah, great, well done.

816
00:55:34,242 --> 00:55:37,829
Leaving now. Yeah, good.
Sorry about that.

817
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:41,833
Yeah.

818
00:55:43,418 --> 00:55:45,503
He's a little weird.

819
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:50,158
- Bye!
- Hey, I'll be back for more?

820
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,343
Bye, babes!

821
00:55:53,136 --> 00:55:54,971
Had to leave early, did he?

822
00:55:55,763 --> 00:55:59,209
Well, he did stay
until he got the job done.

823
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:02,770
- That was good of him.
- Yeah, he's gonna come back tomorrow

824
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:05,548
and bring a friend
so we can all do it together.

825
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:08,109
- The more the merrier.
- For Christ's sake.

826
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:11,529
We were working,
and then he went surfing, you idiot.

827
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:15,241
Now where is that bottle of wine?
I could use a drink.

828
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,454
Come on up.

829
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:30,715
There you go.

830
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:35,887
- Apology accepted.
- Oh, good.

831
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:39,390
- To friends.
- To friends.

832
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:47,215
A bit old for homework, aren't you?

833
00:56:47,315 --> 00:56:52,070
Well, it's never too late to perfect
new ways of boring one's students.

834
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:58,434
So... must be very excited
to have Tim all over you.

835
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:01,370
So to speak. About your book.

836
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,582
Well...

837
00:57:05,374 --> 00:57:08,294
tonight he tore me to pieces.

838
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:10,655
It's hard to be judged by others.

839
00:57:10,755 --> 00:57:14,867
It's very difficult...
to stay true to your own voice

840
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:18,513
when everybody else
wants you to do something else.

841
00:57:20,098 --> 00:57:22,016
It made me think of Alan.

842
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:25,712
All the notes that I gave him
through the years.

843
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:28,147
It must have tortured him.

844
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:30,566
So it's not all bad, then.

845
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:35,888
I'll be honest, I always thought
he was an arrogant little shit

846
00:57:35,988 --> 00:57:38,699
whose books were vapid and hackneyed.

847
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:42,954
And all I could ever think about
when I skim-read them...

848
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:47,458
- was you.
- Me?

849
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,377
You.

850
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:51,696
Yes.

851
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:53,130
And what could have been worse?

852
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:58,302
Being married to him
or editing his schmaltzy drivel?

853
00:58:00,388 --> 00:58:03,099
They both sucked.

854
00:58:05,142 --> 00:58:07,603
Do you know who he's screwing?

855
00:58:08,145 --> 00:58:10,882
My gynecologist.

856
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:13,509
My gynecologist!

857
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:15,052
I mean,

858
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:18,764
I actually thought that he was coming
to our appointments because he cared,

859
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,075
but no, he wanted to see the doctor.

860
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,869
Maybe you're better off without him.

861
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:26,038
Think about it.

862
00:58:26,163 --> 00:58:30,543
You're smart, you're funny,
you're beautiful, terrible driver, but...

863
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:34,338
I'm sure you'll find someone
to overlook that.

864
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:36,782
You're just saying that.

865
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:40,595
Well, you are smart, you are funny,

866
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,723
and you are very, very beautiful.

867
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:41,472
- What the hell happened to my car?
- Oh, shit.

868
00:59:41,572 --> 00:59:45,534
Oh, my nuts! They said they
weren't coming back until tonight!

869
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:49,455
- It's a good thing it's a military vehicle.
- Oh, my God!

870
00:59:49,997 --> 00:59:53,918
Okay, okay. To the house. To the house.

871
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,509
- <i>Buenos días, Pedro.</i>
- <i>Buenos días, señora.</i>

872
01:00:05,304 --> 01:00:07,248
Get the keys, sweetie.

873
01:00:07,348 --> 01:00:10,768
Oh, you know what,
I think I left my phone in the car.

874
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:24,306
- Hi!
- You're naked.

875
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:27,868
If you're wondering where Jake is,
he's at a sleepover with Josh.

876
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,288
- Why are you naked?
- Richard's sleeping in his house.

877
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:34,416
- I'm just gonna go and swim.
- Unbelievable.

878
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:39,964
Hey, how's the lecture coming?

879
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:43,217
I've passed kidney stones
with greater ease.

880
01:00:43,968 --> 01:00:48,597
Well, don't overthink it.
Just be honest, pithy, simple.

881
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:53,978
You know something? I think you're the first
woman I've ever really been friends with.

882
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:56,756
Well, that's a little sad, Richard,
but very touching.

883
01:00:56,856 --> 01:01:00,276
What brought about this sudden
onset of sincerity?

884
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:05,765
I slept with someone,

885
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:07,491
and...

886
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:10,411
it actually meant something.

887
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:13,147
Well, that's great. Who?

888
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:14,957
Olivia.

889
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:20,404
Are you kidding? Richard, why don't you go
down to your Green Card appointment,

890
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:23,365
take out your samurai sword,
and disembowel yourself?

891
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:26,660
What is wrong with you?
Are you trying to get deported?

892
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,080
- I mean, Kate is going to kill you!
- Kate's not going to know about it, is she?

893
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,349
I mean, I'm not going to tell her,
and Olivia's not going to tell her.

894
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:37,187
They are sisters, Richard,
close sisters, and close sisters talk.

895
01:01:41,275 --> 01:01:43,319
You better move.

896
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:56,165
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

897
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:04,798
- Kate, hi.
- Hey!

898
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:08,052
- How's everything? Good?
- Olivia told me everything.

899
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:10,287
Oh, she did?

900
01:02:10,387 --> 01:02:13,265
I think it's awesome
that she started writing.

901
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:17,686
And she said you were really nice
to her when I was away.

902
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:20,147
Oh, wonderful.

903
01:02:20,648 --> 01:02:24,343
You know... I know I've been
kind of a bitch to you lately.

904
01:02:24,443 --> 01:02:25,444
Oh, that's okay.

905
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:30,032
Threatening not to come to your green card
meeting was totally out of line. I'm sorry.

906
01:02:30,157 --> 01:02:33,202
Yeah, live and let live,
forgive and forget, all of that.

907
01:02:33,327 --> 01:02:35,729
- We're cool?
- We are so cool.

908
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:38,357
Okay. Do you want
to get me some lemonade?

909
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:39,692
- Good idea.
- Thanks.

910
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:42,461
Okay. Great.

911
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:54,223
You smoke?

912
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:02,815
- I can't stop thinking about last night.
- Nor can I.

913
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:06,635
- We have to tell her.
- No, no, no.

914
01:03:06,735 --> 01:03:08,946
- This is not good timing. Olivia, Olivia.
- Dad?

915
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,265
That's gone to your head. Get back
in the bush. Get behind the bush.

916
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:14,518
There's a funny old man here
that wants to see you.

917
01:03:14,618 --> 01:03:16,286
What?

918
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:19,023
Dad, what are you doing here?

919
01:03:19,123 --> 01:03:23,418
Why in buggering hell
have you been ignoring my calls?

920
01:03:24,044 --> 01:03:27,698
Oh, hello, this must be the Yank totty!

921
01:03:27,798 --> 01:03:30,175
Kate, my father.

922
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:32,953
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Haig!

923
01:03:33,053 --> 01:03:36,165
It's so nice to meet you!

924
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:39,585
- Sorry, I'm soaking wet.
- I need a shower anyway.

925
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:42,880
Oh, and who is this other vision
of loveliness?

926
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,550
I'm Olivia. I'm Kate's sister.

927
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,986
Blimey. Bookends.

928
01:03:49,403 --> 01:03:51,989
Well, come inside,
I'll make you up a room.

929
01:03:52,114 --> 01:03:54,658
No, no, no, it's okay. Dad, come with me.
Come to the guesthouse.

930
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:58,036
- We've got plenty of rooms.
- No, that's okay. Dad, come with me.

931
01:03:58,162 --> 01:04:00,564
- Are you sure?
- You're staying with me. I promise you.

932
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:02,791
- Nice to meet you!
- You too!

933
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:07,713
- Why exactly are you here?
- I'm visiting you and the little turd...

934
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:13,660
- Fella. What's it bloody look like?
- Well, I don't really know. I mean...

935
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,330
Jake, meet your grandfather.

936
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,582
Yeah. I'm your granddad.

937
01:04:18,682 --> 01:04:21,627
I've got something for you
that I brought all the way from England.

938
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:27,466
Would you like to see it?
Now that is a model of "HMS Defiance."

939
01:04:27,566 --> 01:04:29,902
God, Dad. You never let me
used to touch that.

940
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:32,321
- What?
- Okay, I'll be right back.

941
01:04:32,446 --> 01:04:34,848
Hey! Wait a minute, where are you going?

942
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:38,101
You can't bear to be in the same room
with me for two minutes, is that it?

943
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:41,121
- No, that's not it, Dad, not at all!
- Can I keep it?

944
01:04:41,413 --> 01:04:44,458
Of course you can bloody keep it.
It's yours!

945
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:48,587
But don't put it in the bath,
because it'll sink.

946
01:04:51,632 --> 01:04:53,926
- Hey, cool!
- Where should we put it? Here?

947
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:56,595
- On the top!
- Yes, on the top!

948
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:00,582
Hello, my lovelies.

949
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:04,603
All I'm asking is, can you wait
till Monday morning at 11:00?

950
01:05:05,479 --> 01:05:07,189
Why?

951
01:05:07,314 --> 01:05:09,608
My green card interview.

952
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:12,803
After that...

953
01:05:12,903 --> 01:05:14,905
you can...

954
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,824
tell her what you like, okay?

955
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:37,761
Dad...

956
01:05:38,345 --> 01:05:41,348
- I need to go pee.
- Come on, then.

957
01:05:41,723 --> 01:05:44,835
Hey, where the bloody hell
are you two going? Come on, hey!

958
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:49,089
- We're going to go for a pee, Dad.
- Come on, whip it out. Come on!

959
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:52,634
- Dad, you can't pee off the pier.
- Jake, who are you going to listen to?

960
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:57,347
Your dad, who, for some buggering reason
has turned into a boring old fart,

961
01:05:57,447 --> 01:06:00,826
or your grandfather,
who's lived a rich and full life

962
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:03,578
and doesn't take shite from anybody?

963
01:06:05,622 --> 01:06:08,108
You! Sorry, Dad.

964
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:12,362
There you go, come on up here.
There you go. Up you go.

965
01:06:12,462 --> 01:06:16,700
Come on, you too.
If you're still my son, that is.

966
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,263
All right, on three. One, two, three.

967
01:06:21,388 --> 01:06:24,391
Yeah! That's it.

968
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:33,567
Well, somebody had
their vitamins this morning.

969
01:06:35,652 --> 01:06:38,347
You know, there are coconuts over there!

970
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:40,657
Great isn't it? There you go.

971
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:45,645
Beautiful. Oh, dear.
All right, all right, all right.

972
01:06:45,745 --> 01:06:49,708
That's good stuff.
Put on some tunes, guys?

973
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:54,838
Oh, look at this. This is paradise, man.
You've ended up in paradise!

974
01:06:54,963 --> 01:06:58,300
You know, they must be freezing
their bollocks off in England.

975
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:03,638
Why are you really here?

976
01:07:10,562 --> 01:07:14,858
Joan left me. Silly cow.

977
01:07:15,525 --> 01:07:19,613
Well, I'm sorry. Truly.

978
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:25,185
Well, that makes me feel so much better.

979
01:07:25,285 --> 01:07:30,315
I mean, God almighty, thank you
for those profound words of sympathy.

980
01:07:30,415 --> 01:07:33,401
Well, it's a lot more than you
ever said when Kate left me.

981
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:35,420
Well, I warned you about her!

982
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:38,131
She was a rampant little Yankee trollop.

983
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:42,577
You know what, Dad?
Of course Joan left you.

984
01:07:42,677 --> 01:07:46,623
You're a misanthropic, misogynistic asshole
who doesn't give a fuck about anybody,

985
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:51,127
least of all the poor saps who you got
to marry you in the first place.

986
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:54,606
Is that it? Is that all you've got?

987
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:59,069
And you did it all in the name
of some misguided credo called fun.

988
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:01,304
Which you brainwashed me
with in the first place.

989
01:08:01,404 --> 01:08:03,990
Guys, dig this song!

990
01:08:04,282 --> 01:08:05,367
Bugger off.

991
01:08:08,745 --> 01:08:11,189
That's it then, is it, boy wonder?

992
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:15,068
So you finally got it
off your chest, have you?

993
01:08:15,168 --> 01:08:17,337
You know what, Dad?

994
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:20,632
Why don't you just bugger off for once?

995
01:08:20,757 --> 01:08:22,300
For once...

996
01:08:22,425 --> 01:08:25,845
why don't you be the one to bugger off?

997
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,545
Brian, go back to my wife.

998
01:08:58,878 --> 01:09:00,614
Go on.

999
01:09:00,714 --> 01:09:04,284
Go on, just... just go back.

1000
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:06,411
Thank you for that wonderful sharing.

1001
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:10,807
Seriously, this has been
absolutely a marvelous session.

1002
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:14,310
I've learned so much.
Give yourselves a big hand. Everybody.

1003
01:09:14,436 --> 01:09:17,021
Wendy, I was wondering
if you could sign my form

1004
01:09:17,147 --> 01:09:19,732
to show that I've done the 10 sessions?

1005
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:23,778
I'm sorry, Richard, I can't.

1006
01:09:25,363 --> 01:09:30,034
Why? I mean, I came,
I did the whole "I'm an alcoholic..."

1007
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:33,621
But it's not about
just saying the words.

1008
01:09:33,746 --> 01:09:36,791
You have to actually mean them.

1009
01:09:42,881 --> 01:09:45,425
Great seeing you. Thanks so much.

1010
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:50,180
Cindy, right?

1011
01:09:50,305 --> 01:09:53,725
I just spent the last week listening
to that drivel so some witless little ninny

1012
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:56,836
won't sign a piece of paper
to say I'm an okay kind of guy.

1013
01:09:56,936 --> 01:10:00,356
Absolute bollocks. Sorry, excuse me.

1014
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:03,510
Hey, you want to get a drink?
Actually, maybe not.

1015
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:06,237
I've got a grueling lecture in an hour.

1016
01:10:06,362 --> 01:10:09,199
How about a joint?
Just kidding, bad joke.

1017
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:13,536
I didn't want my son to find it.
I don't touch the stuff. It's my dad's.

1018
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:15,788
Likes to puff.

1019
01:10:16,456 --> 01:10:19,876
- Good luck with your lecture.
- Thank you.

1020
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:31,121
I want you all to imagine
you're at Cambridge University.

1021
01:10:31,221 --> 01:10:33,556
The year is 1807.

1022
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:35,917
You walk across the quad
of Trinity College.

1023
01:10:36,017 --> 01:10:40,380
Into the lecture hall, you find
your fellow classmate, Lord Byron,

1024
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,193
who, in defiance
of college rules about dogs,

1025
01:10:45,318 --> 01:10:48,446
has brought a bear to class instead.

1026
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:05,296
You know what?

1027
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,757
Forget about that.

1028
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:11,636
Why are the Romantics relevant today?

1029
01:11:14,973 --> 01:11:16,724
Honestly...

1030
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:18,518
they're not.

1031
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:21,880
Stacy got it right.

1032
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:26,134
And Dwight, he can't stop thinking
about home runs and fastballs

1033
01:11:26,234 --> 01:11:28,945
when he reads Byron and Coleridge.

1034
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:34,492
Because...

1035
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:37,370
we're teaching words.

1036
01:11:38,496 --> 01:11:40,123
Words.

1037
01:11:40,915 --> 01:11:43,459
But we're not teaching meaning.

1038
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:47,130
I got it all wrong.

1039
01:11:47,547 --> 01:11:52,009
I can tell you about Byron and his bear,
Wordsworth falling in love with his cousin,

1040
01:11:52,135 --> 01:11:55,455
Coleridge falling in love with cocaine.

1041
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:58,433
I can tell you what's behind
the words from them,

1042
01:11:59,058 --> 01:12:02,478
but I can't tell you what's behind
those words for you.

1043
01:12:03,354 --> 01:12:06,899
Because this class is about you

1044
01:12:07,024 --> 01:12:09,610
learning to find your own meaning.

1045
01:12:10,945 --> 01:12:13,030
Your own voices.

1046
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:19,103
Go read the poems.
But know this, that at this moment,

1047
01:12:19,203 --> 01:12:24,233
you are the Romantics,
you are the relevant ones.

1048
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:28,780
Let Byron, Coleridge, Wordsworth
inspire you to do your thing,

1049
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,631
to go your own way.

1050
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:33,676
Stacy, quit texting.
Call him, right now.

1051
01:12:34,135 --> 01:12:38,164
Dwight, go play ball.
Ignore anyone who says no, you can't.

1052
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:42,810
Follow your hearts. Do good things,
be bold, and, above all else...

1053
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:45,980
stick it to the man.

1054
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,136
Well, Dad, I totally fucked up
my audition lecture.

1055
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:56,474
I stuck it to them all right.
I stuck it to myself in the process, too.

1056
01:12:56,574 --> 01:13:01,062
Hey, listen, you silly old sod,
you just bolted before I could apologize.

1057
01:13:01,162 --> 01:13:04,190
Why are you so thin-skinned these days?

1058
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,001
All right, call me back.

1059
01:13:21,933 --> 01:13:24,961
$4,000 should cover it.

1060
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:26,212
What?

1061
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:30,608
Your Mustang, Richard, it's got Sienna Red
paint there all over the back fender.

1062
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:32,635
Unmistakable.

1063
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:36,514
1954 MG TFs do not come cheap,
my friend.

1064
01:13:36,614 --> 01:13:38,991
Absolutely not. Can I give you a check?

1065
01:13:39,116 --> 01:13:41,118
I would prefer cash.

1066
01:13:44,622 --> 01:13:47,358
Wanted to be the first
to congratulate you.

1067
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:50,570
Welcome to the English department,
University of Los Angeles.

1068
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:52,697
Yes!

1069
01:13:52,797 --> 01:13:55,658
Oh, good. Oh, thank you, boss.

1070
01:13:55,758 --> 01:13:57,927
I guess we'll do the other side as well.

1071
01:13:58,052 --> 01:14:00,454
- Let's go have a pint.
- A pint of what? Oil?

1072
01:14:00,554 --> 01:14:04,642
A pint of what... Witty.
I'll always laugh at your jokes.

1073
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:16,345
I got the job. ULA!
Knocked it out of the ballpark.

1074
01:14:16,445 --> 01:14:19,265
- Congratulations!
- Home run! Fantastic!

1075
01:14:19,365 --> 01:14:22,894
And I feel fantastic about you
and what we did, making love.

1076
01:14:22,994 --> 01:14:24,562
No, listen please. Hear me out.

1077
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:27,023
Kate and I have been separated
for two years.

1078
01:14:27,123 --> 01:14:30,067
Why should we feel bad?
We're grownups, you know.

1079
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:34,196
And if Kate doesn't like it, she can
bloody well just go... Hey, you. Brian.

1080
01:14:34,296 --> 01:14:37,591
Okay, okay, in the vault.

1081
01:14:39,677 --> 01:14:41,762
Oh, Kate.

1082
01:14:43,889 --> 01:14:45,558
Olivia.

1083
01:14:46,559 --> 01:14:48,436
My best friend.

1084
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:52,023
Total trust.

1085
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:54,191
No secrets!

1086
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:58,529
- We were going to...
- You know what? If you want him, take him.

1087
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:00,322
But get out of my house.

1088
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:04,618
Well, now, maybe... okay.

1089
01:15:38,986 --> 01:15:40,654
Thank you.

1090
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:43,866
Ernesto. Sorry I'm late.

1091
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:47,912
- Where's your wife?
- Not coming. Sends her regards.

1092
01:15:49,288 --> 01:15:51,691
Okay, strike one, she's not here.

1093
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:55,361
Strike two, you failed
the recovery program.

1094
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:58,030
We may be 0-2, but we're going
to swing for the fences

1095
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:00,466
on the University of Los Angeles.

1096
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:01,509
Morning, officer Lewis.

1097
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:04,678
Why has it taken nearly three years
to schedule this interview?

1098
01:16:04,803 --> 01:16:08,140
Well, my client never received
all the notifications from ICE.

1099
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:12,211
Is this your handwriting, Mr. Haig?

1100
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:16,090
Some of it is.
Some of it's also my son's.

1101
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:18,426
Working on his cursive.

1102
01:16:18,526 --> 01:16:20,277
Can you explain this?

1103
01:16:20,653 --> 01:16:24,390
Yes, well, that's not my fault.
Painkillers, dental surgery.

1104
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,935
My client's done 10 sessions of a recovery
program to show his good character.

1105
01:16:28,035 --> 01:16:31,580
Where's the letter of completion?
In the mail, with "bew-locks" written on it?

1106
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:34,984
It's "bollocks," actually.

1107
01:16:35,084 --> 01:16:37,127
Officer Armstrong!

1108
01:16:42,508 --> 01:16:47,596
Please describe how Mr. Haig
tried to offer you marijuana.

1109
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:53,352
The other night, as I was leaving
the recovery center,

1110
01:16:53,477 --> 01:16:56,563
Mr. Haig asked me
if I wanted some marijuana.

1111
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:03,470
Under California law, the possession
of marijuana is a felony.

1112
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:05,322
That's true.

1113
01:17:05,447 --> 01:17:07,658
What is it you say, Mr. Haig? Cheerios?

1114
01:17:09,618 --> 01:17:12,646
There you have it, the whole sorry saga.

1115
01:17:12,746 --> 01:17:17,501
Ernesto did do one thing
to justify his exorbitant fee.

1116
01:17:18,752 --> 01:17:21,213
He got me this one hour with you.

1117
01:17:22,089 --> 01:17:25,034
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Jake.

1118
01:17:25,134 --> 01:17:27,469
- Time's up.
- Jake, please.

1119
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:36,937
I love you. Do you hear me?
I am so sorry.

1120
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,608
"That is no country for old men.

1121
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,363
The young in one another's arms,

1122
01:18:28,947 --> 01:18:30,808
birds in the trees,

1123
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:34,745
those dying generations...
at their song."

1124
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:37,564
So, what's Yeats saying here?

1125
01:18:37,664 --> 01:18:42,277
He's a 60-year-old man looking
at young people screwing and living,

1126
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:45,422
blissfully unthinking
about their own mortality.

1127
01:18:45,839 --> 01:18:48,258
Yeats knows he's just an aged man,

1128
01:18:49,176 --> 01:18:51,787
but his dreams...

1129
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:53,847
are of Byzantium.

1130
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:02,689
- Hello?
- <i>This is Memorial General.</i>

1131
01:19:02,815 --> 01:19:05,484
<i>We need to talk to you
about your father.</i>

1132
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:44,231
What the buggering hell
are you doing here?

1133
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,025
You hate hospitals.

1134
01:19:47,234 --> 01:19:49,219
You're right.

1135
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:52,097
I hate bloody hospitals.

1136
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:55,117
But I love the nurses.

1137
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:03,333
How's my little Jake?

1138
01:20:06,587 --> 01:20:08,880
He's all right, Dad.

1139
01:20:10,382 --> 01:20:12,426
You know, I...

1140
01:20:13,802 --> 01:20:17,097
I don't think I could have done
what you did.

1141
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,353
You stuck with that boy
through all the muck and bullets.

1142
01:20:26,106 --> 01:20:29,067
You're a better man than I, Gunga Din.

1143
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:36,783
I don't know about that, Dad.

1144
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:41,705
You still shagging the...
Yank totty's sister, are we?

1145
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:44,041
No, I blew that one.

1146
01:20:46,418 --> 01:20:49,529
Threw away a pearl beyond price.

1147
01:20:49,629 --> 01:20:53,342
Totty and Totty's sister.

1148
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:57,012
None of us are talking.
It's all a big mess.

1149
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:09,232
Marvelous bloody place,
though, isn't it? Californ-i-a?

1150
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:15,781
Sunshine, beaches, and girls. Yeah.

1151
01:21:17,157 --> 01:21:19,242
Marijuana.

1152
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:22,954
God, how the buggering hell
did I miss out on all that for so long?

1153
01:21:23,538 --> 01:21:25,457
You came.

1154
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,251
You saw it once.

1155
01:21:31,088 --> 01:21:34,174
It all goes so fast.

1156
01:21:36,051 --> 01:21:39,304
These buggers here,
they don't think I've got long.

1157
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:43,892
Well...

1158
01:21:44,184 --> 01:21:46,353
it's all a load of bollocks, really.

1159
01:21:46,937 --> 01:21:48,647
What is?

1160
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:54,027
You know, there's nothing honorable
in misery, Richard.

1161
01:21:55,028 --> 01:21:57,723
Carpe diem.

1162
01:21:57,823 --> 01:22:01,368
Boff and be merry.

1163
01:22:01,868 --> 01:22:05,731
Now, listen. You listen to me carefully.

1164
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:11,419
This might be the most important
bit of advice I'll ever give you.

1165
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:18,552
For God's sake, man...

1166
01:22:18,677 --> 01:22:21,346
go and get your bloody girl.

1167
01:22:21,805 --> 01:22:23,682
Go on.

1168
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:26,434
Bugger off.

1169
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:40,657
Hey, Richard.

1170
01:22:43,034 --> 01:22:45,328
You remember my epitaph.

1171
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,124
Of course I do, Dad.

1172
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,711
Of course I do.

1173
01:23:54,481 --> 01:23:57,942
Byzantium is the place he longs for.

1174
01:23:58,276 --> 01:24:00,595
He needs to make this journey.

1175
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:04,224
I'm going to sort this all out.
I promise you. Okay, Jake?

1176
01:24:04,324 --> 01:24:05,784
<i>How?</i>

1177
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:10,330
I'll Skype you tomorrow, okay?

1178
01:24:18,546 --> 01:24:20,090
Is she talking to Olivia yet?

1179
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:23,426
<i>Olivia's book launches here next week.
Kate isn't even going.</i>

1180
01:24:24,302 --> 01:24:27,764
- <i>She's icing everyone out, even me.</i>
- All right.

1181
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:29,624
See ya, Brian.

1182
01:24:29,724 --> 01:24:32,585
Yeats knows that unless
he makes this journey,

1183
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:36,940
unless he defies logic and authority,

1184
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:41,986
unless his soul claps hands
and sings out loud...

1185
01:24:44,864 --> 01:24:47,242
he is nothing more...

1186
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:51,329
than a tattered coat upon a stick.

1187
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:21,943
You old bugger.

1188
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:28,032
There is a country for old men.

1189
01:25:30,702 --> 01:25:32,871
If not now, when?

1190
01:25:34,122 --> 01:25:39,294
Ernesto, Richard Haig. <i>Cómo está?</i>

1191
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,144
<i>Adios! Adios, amigos.</i>

1192
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:51,449
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hi, Jakey.</i>

1193
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:53,701
<i>Go to the door and tell me what you see.</i>

1194
01:26:53,826 --> 01:26:55,578
Okay.

1195
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:07,423
Oh, look at you, boy! Oh, look at you.

1196
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:09,300
Richie!

1197
01:27:12,011 --> 01:27:15,598
Thank God you're here, dude.
Thank God. Thank God.

1198
01:27:15,723 --> 01:27:19,018
- You can let go now, Brian. That's okay.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

1199
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:22,397
Can you believe it, Mom?
He's really here.

1200
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:26,192
- Hi, Kate.
- Hey, how did you get here?

1201
01:27:26,317 --> 01:27:29,220
I just came across the border.
It's an old trick of mine.

1202
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,141
- What if you get caught?
- I won't. I'll be gone before they know it.

1203
01:27:33,241 --> 01:27:37,937
Remember my lawyer, Ernesto? He's going
to sort this whole mess out, okay?

1204
01:27:38,037 --> 01:27:39,647
- Yay!
- Don't you worry.

1205
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:41,816
It's only going to cost me a fortune.

1206
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:45,278
And look, Kate,
we can't keep going like this.

1207
01:27:45,378 --> 01:27:49,924
I mean, Jake, he needs his mom
and dad to be adults, right?

1208
01:27:50,424 --> 01:27:52,093
Yeah.

1209
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,706
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry we hurt you.

1210
01:27:56,806 --> 01:28:00,935
Olivia wanted to tell you,
and it was my fault she didn't.

1211
01:28:01,435 --> 01:28:05,298
But you're sisters. Come on.
Cut her some slack.

1212
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:07,900
Life is so short, Kate.

1213
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:11,779
Like my dad used to say, carpe diem.

1214
01:28:11,904 --> 01:28:14,532
Let's boff and be merry?

1215
01:28:16,826 --> 01:28:19,353
- Okay.
- Great.

1216
01:28:19,453 --> 01:28:22,748
Great. And... one last thing.

1217
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:26,586
- Can I take a shower, please?
- He really stinks.

1218
01:28:27,962 --> 01:28:33,159
Thank you, everybody, for coming.
I would like to thank my agent,

1219
01:28:33,259 --> 01:28:34,827
Tim Prince.

1220
01:28:34,927 --> 01:28:37,914
I would also like to thank my...

1221
01:28:38,014 --> 01:28:41,125
ex brother-in-law, Richard.

1222
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:44,670
He was the inspiration
for the burnt-out,

1223
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:49,066
recovering-alcoholic cop
who saves the day.

1224
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:52,236
Although he doesn't know it,
so let's not tell him.

1225
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:58,159
And, lastly, I would like to thank
somebody very special to me

1226
01:28:58,284 --> 01:29:01,020
who couldn't be here today,

1227
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,041
which is nobody's fault but mine.

1228
01:29:32,526 --> 01:29:34,904
All right. Here we are.

1229
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,794
Hey.

1230
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:57,118
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

1231
01:29:57,218 --> 01:29:59,203
I'm sorry, too.

1232
01:29:59,303 --> 01:30:01,764
Let's never fight again, okay?

1233
01:30:02,848 --> 01:30:04,684
Come here.

1234
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:16,862
- Let's go back inside.
- Just give me a minute, all right?

1235
01:30:16,987 --> 01:30:18,656
Okay.

1236
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:30,584
Hi.

1237
01:30:31,919 --> 01:30:35,965
- You came.
- I came. Piece of cake.

1238
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:42,138
I came because I love you.

1239
01:30:43,556 --> 01:30:45,975
I came because I need you.

1240
01:30:47,351 --> 01:30:49,603
I need my son.

1241
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,981
I need my family.

1242
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:54,150
That's why I came.

1243
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,680
- You want to hear something crazy?
- What?

1244
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,323
I knew you'd come.

1245
01:31:01,449 --> 01:31:04,660
- It's irrational.
- It's romantic.

1246
01:31:05,369 --> 01:31:07,396
You and I...

1247
01:31:07,496 --> 01:31:11,542
we've only had moments.
Now we have time.

1248
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:40,738
I spent my whole life
in opposition to this man.

1249
01:31:41,947 --> 01:31:44,825
Honestly, he never did
a bloody thing for me,

1250
01:31:45,743 --> 01:31:47,870
except this.

1251
01:31:49,455 --> 01:31:52,374
Asking me to scatter his ashes here.

1252
01:31:55,294 --> 01:31:57,671
And it saved my life,

1253
01:31:59,173 --> 01:32:02,509
because it brought me back to the people
I love most in this world.

1254
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:13,020
- Even you, Brian.
- You're the man, Richard.

1255
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:17,341
There comes a time, and there's always
a time, and I guess this is the time.

1256
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:21,487
So, Jakey, shall we set grandpa free?

1257
01:32:30,204 --> 01:32:32,247
Okay, Dad.

1258
01:32:32,873 --> 01:32:35,167
Enjoy paradise.

1259
01:32:42,758 --> 01:32:45,536
So how long are you staying?

1260
01:32:45,636 --> 01:32:48,289
Okay, Jakey, listen to me here.

1261
01:32:48,389 --> 01:32:50,641
I have to sort out a few things first.

1262
01:32:52,393 --> 01:32:54,211
But...

1263
01:32:54,311 --> 01:32:57,940
maybe marrying your aunt might help.

1264
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:03,696
- What?
- Well, I am down on one knee.

1265
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:09,993
Then get up and kiss me again.

1266
01:33:28,554 --> 01:33:31,932
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

1267
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:36,270
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

1268
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:40,799
<i>Up in the clouds, over the town</i>

1269
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:44,111
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

1270
01:33:44,903 --> 01:33:48,490
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

1271
01:33:49,074 --> 01:33:52,619
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

1272
01:33:52,995 --> 01:33:57,107
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

1273
01:33:57,207 --> 01:34:00,169
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

1274
01:34:01,295 --> 01:34:05,174
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

1275
01:34:05,299 --> 01:34:09,386
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

1276
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:13,348
<i>This will be our time</i>

1277
01:34:13,474 --> 01:34:17,711
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

1278
01:34:17,811 --> 01:34:21,690
<i>Out of the black night</i>

1279
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:25,594
<i>Into the bright light</i>

1280
01:34:25,694 --> 01:34:29,615
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

1281
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:34,119
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

1282
01:34:36,246 --> 01:34:38,290
<i>Yeah</i>

1283
01:34:50,344 --> 01:34:53,847
<i>My shadow is cast on the ground</i>

1284
01:34:54,473 --> 01:34:58,310
<i>I'm flying too fast to look down</i>

1285
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,671
<i>At the rooftops and trees</i>

1286
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:05,692
<i>And my family waving at me</i>

1287
01:35:06,902 --> 01:35:10,848
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

1288
01:35:10,948 --> 01:35:15,118
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

1289
01:35:15,244 --> 01:35:19,106
<i>This will be our time</i>

1290
01:35:19,206 --> 01:35:23,293
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

1291
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:27,447
<i>Out of the black night</i>

1292
01:35:27,547 --> 01:35:31,159
<i>Into the bright light</i>

1293
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:35,222
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

1294
01:35:35,347 --> 01:35:39,351
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

1295
01:36:16,013 --> 01:36:20,559
<i>I go crazy sometimes</i>

1296
01:36:20,976 --> 01:36:24,187
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1297
01:36:25,814 --> 01:36:28,675
<i>Yeah, I swear I'm fine</i>

1298
01:36:28,775 --> 01:36:33,613
<i>That I'm all right
but I'm barely breathing</i>

1299
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:39,035
<i>Thought I could find my way back home</i>

1300
01:36:39,536 --> 01:36:42,998
<i>But I get lost alone</i>

1301
01:36:43,623 --> 01:36:45,834
<i>But when I'm with you</i>

1302
01:36:45,959 --> 01:36:48,111
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

1303
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:52,716
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

1304
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:54,743
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

1305
01:36:54,843 --> 01:36:59,973
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

1306
01:37:06,104 --> 01:37:09,900
<i>I'm not trying to be dramatic, no</i>

1307
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,029
<i>Most times I'm pretty normal</i>

1308
01:37:16,031 --> 01:37:20,243
<i>Oh, let's be clear and honest here</i>

1309
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:24,247
<i>And do away with anything formal</i>

1310
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:29,444
<i>I can fake it on my own</i>

1311
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:33,465
<i>But I am lost alone</i>

1312
01:37:33,798 --> 01:37:35,951
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

1313
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:38,245
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

1314
01:37:38,345 --> 01:37:42,791
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

1315
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:44,835
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

1316
01:37:44,935 --> 01:37:50,065
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

1317
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:59,115
<i>Who I want to be</i>

1318
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:12,671
<i>But I am wide-eyed</i>

1319
01:38:13,046 --> 01:38:15,757
<i>With a pension for running</i>

1320
01:38:15,882 --> 01:38:18,677
<i>But how many times does it take</i>

1321
01:38:18,802 --> 01:38:21,329
<i>Till I find that I'm lost</i>

1322
01:38:21,429 --> 01:38:24,516
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1323
01:38:24,641 --> 01:38:28,336
<i>And that's not where I belong</i>

1324
01:38:28,436 --> 01:38:30,647
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

1325
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:33,175
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

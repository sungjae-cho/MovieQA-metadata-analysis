1
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,939
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,393
- Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? - Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,638
- You look kind of all in, at that.
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,167
- How is the insurance business,
Mr. Neff? - Okay.

5
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,841
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

6
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,642
They said I have
something loose in my heart.

7
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,214
- I say it's rheumatism.
- Yeah?

8
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,347
Twelve.

9
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,763
Office memorandum.

10
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,773
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

11
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,271
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

12
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,714
Dear Keyes...

13
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,309
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

14
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,752
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

15
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,949
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

16
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,719
because it was smack up
against your nose.

17
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,987
You think you're such a hot potato
as a Claims Manager...

18
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,258
such a wolf on a phony claim.

19
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,268
Maybe you are, but let's take a look
at that Dietrichson claim.

20
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,668
Accident and double indemnity.

21
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,704
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,605
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

23
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,448
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

24
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,447
You said it was murder. Check.

25
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,114
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

26
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,389
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

27
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,986
It was perfect.

28
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,589
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

29
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,567
just one little mistake.

30
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,603
When it came to picking the killer,
you picked the wrong guy.

31
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,271
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

32
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,971
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

33
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,974
I killed Dietrichson.

34
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,918
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

35
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,122
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

36
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,385
until a while ago, that is.

37
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,524
Yes, I killed him.

38
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,258
I killed him for money...

39
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,927
and for a woman.

40
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,902
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

41
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,738
Pretty, isn't it?

42
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,458
It all began last May.

43
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,924
Around the end of May, it was.

44
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,230
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver</i>
<i>a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

45
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,796
<i>On the way back I remembered this</i>
<i>auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

46
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,808
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

47
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,839
<i>It was one of those</i>
<i>California Spanish houses...</i>

48
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,813
<i>everyone was nuts about</i>
<i>10 or 15 years ago.</i>

49
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,317
<i>This one must've cost somebody</i>
<i>about $30,000.</i>

50
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,849
<i>That is, if he ever</i>
<i>finished paying for it.</i>

51
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,224
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

52
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,817
- Who wants to see him?
- My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

53
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,125
- If you're selling something... - Look,
it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

54
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,358
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,832
- Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
- How soon do you expect him?

56
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,096
He'll be home when he gets here,
if that's any help to you.

57
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,899
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

58
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,769
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,934
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

60
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,077
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

61
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,079
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

62
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,310
- Pacific all what? - The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

63
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,374
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

64
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,012
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

65
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,251
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

66
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,815
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

67
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,020
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

68
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,722
or something
while you're not...

69
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,059
fully covered.

70
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,530
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

71
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,436
- I've just been taking a sunbath.
- No pigeons around, I hope.

72
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,568
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

73
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,974
Oh, that's all right.

74
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,535
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

75
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,515
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

76
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,517
Where would
the living room be?

77
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,021
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

78
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,082
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

79
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,128
<i>The living room</i>
<i>was still stuffy...</i>

80
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,863
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

81
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,898
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

82
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,997
<i>and the sunshine coming in</i>
<i>through the venetian blinds...</i>

83
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,304
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

84
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,274
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames,</i>
<i>were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

85
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,578
<i>his daughter</i>
<i>by his first wife.</i>

86
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,082
<i>They had a bowl of those</i>
<i>little red goldfish...</i>

87
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,554
<i>on the table behind</i>
<i>the big davenport.</i>

88
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,985
<i>But to tell you</i>
<i>the truth, Keyes...</i>

89
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,084
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested</i>
<i>in goldfish right then.</i>

90
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:26,120
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr. Dietrichson</i>
<i>and his daughter Lola.</i>

91
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,100
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,</i>
<i>and the way she had looked at me...</i>

92
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,865
<i>and I wanted</i>
<i>to see her again, close...</i>

93
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,669
<i>without that silly staircase</i>
<i>between us.</i>

94
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,381
- I wasn't long, was I?
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

95
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,941
- Hope I've got my face on straight.
- It's perfect, for my money.

96
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,452
- Neff is the name, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,819
With two "F's," like in Philadelphia,
if you know the story.

98
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,450
- What story?
- <i>The Philadelphia Story.</i>

99
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,684
Suppose we sit down and you tell me
about the insurance.

100
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,252
My husband never
tells me anything.

101
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,698
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

102
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,161
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

103
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,763
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

104
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,975
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

105
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,704
As I was saying, we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

106
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,579
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

107
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,142
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

108
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,415
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

109
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,423
I suppose so. But he's never
home much before 8:00.

110
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,822
That's fine with me.

111
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,917
You're not connected
with the Automobile Club, are you?

112
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,395
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

113
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,433
Somebody from the Automobile Club
has been trying to get him.

114
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,333
- Do they have a better rate?
- If your husband's a member.

115
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,461
No, he isn't.

116
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,700
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

117
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,470
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,502
The Automobile Club's fine.
I can do just as well for you, though.

119
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,776
I have a very attractive
policy here.

120
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,512
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

121
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,146
For instance, we're writing
a new kind of 50% retention feature...

122
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,247
in the collision coverage.

123
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,225
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

124
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,853
- Well, I've been at it 11 years.
- Doing pretty well?

125
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,294
It's a living.

126
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,593
You handle just automobile insurance,
or all kinds?

127
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,105
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

128
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,606
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

129
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,003
Accident insurance?

130
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,306
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,444
Wish you'd tell me
what's engraved on that anklet.

132
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,409
- Just my name.
- As, for instance?

133
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,717
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh?

134
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,188
- I think I like that.
- But you're not sure?

135
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,423
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

136
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,226
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by
tomorrow evening around 8:30?

137
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,164
- He'll be in then.
- Who?

138
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,465
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

139
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,439
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

140
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,872
if you know what I mean.

141
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,378
There's a speed limit in this state,
Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

142
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,711
- How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say around 90.

143
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,416
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

144
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,715
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

145
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,516
Suppose it doesn't take.

146
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,955
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

147
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,926
Suppose I bust out crying
and put my head on your shoulder.

148
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,122
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

149
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,688
That tears it.

150
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,370
- 8:30 tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

151
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,102
- Will you be here, too?
- I guess so, I usually am.

152
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,508
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

153
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,604
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

154
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,515
I wonder if you wonder.

155
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,587
<i>It was a hot afternoon</i>
<i>and I can still remember...</i>

156
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,591
<i>the smell of honeysuckle</i>
<i>all along that street.</i>

157
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,891
<i>How could I have known that murder</i>
<i>can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

158
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,158
<i>Maybe you would</i>
<i>have known, Keyes...</i>

159
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,861
<i>the minute she mentioned</i>
<i>accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

160
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,800
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

161
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,770
<i>I went back to the office</i>
<i>to see if I had any mail.</i>

162
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,136
<i>It was the day you had that truck driver</i>
<i>from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

163
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,508
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

164
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,979
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

165
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,948
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

166
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,985
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

167
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,077
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

168
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,591
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi, George.

169
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,822
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

170
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,763
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

171
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,892
- You're in a jam and you know it.
- Says you.

172
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,198
- All I want is my money.
- Says you.

173
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,899
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

174
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,134
- This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
- Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

175
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,145
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

176
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,479
- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
- Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

177
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,719
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

178
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,085
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

179
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,148
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

180
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,261
- What little man?
- The little man in here.

181
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,557
Every time one of these phonies
comes along, it ties knots in my stomach.

182
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,066
I can't eat.

183
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,366
Yours is one of them, Garlopis.
That's how I knew your claim was crooked.

184
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,962
So what did I do?

185
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,634
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

186
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,574
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

187
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,168
And what did they find?

188
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,545
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

189
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,176
What shavings?

190
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,812
The ones you soaked with kerosene
and dropped a match on.

191
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,583
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy.
Maybe I made a mistake.

192
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,954
That's one way of putting it.

193
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,259
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

194
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,562
Here. Just a minute.
Sign this and you'll feel fine.

195
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,501
- Sign what? - It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

196
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,103
- Here?
- Here.

197
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,873
Now you're an honest man again.
Goodbye, Garlopis.

198
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,880
But I ain't got no more truck.

199
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,348
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

200
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,908
What's the matter, Garlopis,
don't you know how to open the door?

201
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,286
Just put your hand
on the knob, turn it to the left.

202
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,125
Now pull it toward you.

203
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,887
- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,529
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

205
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,333
Are we an insurance company,
or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

206
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,634
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

207
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,334
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

208
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,967
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

209
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,033
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

210
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,841
- before we accepted the risk.
- I know you did, Walter.

211
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,576
I'm not beefing at you. It's the company.
It's the way they do things.

212
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,742
The way they don't do things!

213
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,547
The way they'll write anything
just to get it down on the sales sheet.

214
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,111
And I'm the guy that has to
sit here up to my neck in phony claims...

215
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,124
so they won't throw more money out
the window than they take in at the door.

216
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,023
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

217
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,427
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up
after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

218
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,193
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

219
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,131
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

220
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,795
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

221
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,839
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

222
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,740
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

223
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,142
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

224
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,942
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

225
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,609
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

226
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,084
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

227
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,951
and find out if their calendar checked
with the <i>World Almanac's</i> calendar.

228
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,216
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

229
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,521
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

230
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,556
I love you, too.

231
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,530
<i>I really did, too,</i>
<i>you old crab...</i>

232
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,906
<i>always yelling your head off,</i>
<i>always sore at everybody.</i>

233
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,774
<i>But you never fooled me with your</i>
<i>song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

234
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,316
<i>I kind of always knew that behind</i>
<i>the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

235
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,784
<i>you had a heart</i>
<i>as big as a house.</i>

236
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,016
<i>Back in my office there was</i>
<i>a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

237
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,819
<i>about the renewals.</i>

238
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,093
<i>She didn't want me to come</i>
<i>tomorrow evening.</i>

239
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,856
<i>She wanted me to come</i>
<i>Thursday afternoon at 3.30 instead.</i>

240
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,665
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up</i>
<i>for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

241
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,703
<i>including a trip</i>
<i>down to Santa Monica...</i>

242
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,537
<i>to see a couple of live prospects</i>
<i>about some group insurance.</i>

243
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,702
<i>But I kept thinking</i>
<i>about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

244
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,313
<i>and the way that</i>
<i>anklet of hers cut into her leg.</i>

245
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,417
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

246
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,054
I'm considering it.

247
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,259
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

248
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,300
- Last night wasn't so convenient.
- That's all right.

249
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,460
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

250
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,697
I was just fixing some iced tea.
Would you like a glass?

251
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,036
Yeah, unless you've got
a bottle of beer that's not working.

252
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,701
There may be some.
I never know what's in the icebox.

253
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,970
Nettie.

254
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,576
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

255
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,382
- Oh, you did? - Yes. He'll renew
with you, he told me so.

256
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,015
As a matter of fact,
I thought he'd be here this afternoon.

257
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,251
- But he's not?
- No.

258
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,019
That's terrible.

259
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,653
Nettie!

260
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,026
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

261
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,003
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

262
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,370
- Lemon? Sugar?
- Fix it your way.

263
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,637
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

264
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,875
- Like running the vacuum cleaner.
- Fresh.

265
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,749
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

266
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,753
Not much money,
but you learn a lot about life.

267
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,518
I didn't think you'd learned it
from a correspondence course.

268
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,289
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

269
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,556
- You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

270
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,689
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

271
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,860
They say all native Californians
come from Iowa.

272
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,461
- Mr. Neff, I...
- Make it Walter, huh?

273
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,404
- Walter.
- That's right.

274
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,177
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

275
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,846
Twenty percent. Why?

276
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,542
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

277
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,211
- I can always use it.
- I was thinking about my husband.

278
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,686
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

279
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,053
- It's very dangerous.
- Not for an executive, is it?

280
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,524
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

281
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,891
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

282
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,190
It's got me worried sick.

283
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,595
You mean, some dark night
a crown block might fall on him?

284
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,133
- Please don't talk like that.
- But that's the idea.

285
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,193
The other day a casing line snapped
and caught the foreman.

286
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,069
- He's in the hospital
with a broken back. - That's bad.

287
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,632
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

288
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,940
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

289
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,707
- It could.
- Well...

290
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,381
don't you think he ought
to have accident insurance?

291
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,751
What kind of insurance
could he have?

292
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,052
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

293
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,183
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

294
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,660
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

295
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,994
- Capital sum? What's that?
- In case he gets killed.

296
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,199
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

297
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,635
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

298
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,103
Well, your husband
would understand.

299
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,971
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea
of some accident protection.

300
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,600
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

301
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,838
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

302
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,006
They're all tough at first.

303
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,043
He has a lot on his mind.

304
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,846
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

305
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,752
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

306
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:54,024
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

307
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,755
- Sounds pretty dull.
- So, I just sit and knit.

308
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,462
Is that what you
married him for?

309
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,695
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

310
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,433
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

311
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,871
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

312
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,034
- Wouldn't I?
- You bet your life, you wouldn't.

313
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,548
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

314
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,143
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

315
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,984
Could I get an accident policy for him
without bothering him at all?

316
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,084
How's that, again?

317
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,130
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

318
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,721
I have a little
allowance of my own.

319
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,996
I could pay for it and he needn't
know anything about it.

320
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,632
Why shouldn't he know?

321
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,106
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

322
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:47,111
- He's superstitious about it. - A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

323
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,343
If there was a way to get it like that,
all the worry would be over.

324
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,378
- See what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I got good eyesight.

325
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,184
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

326
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,283
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

327
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,158
- That's the setup, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

328
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,560
No, I think it's lovely.

329
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,065
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

330
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,191
What crown block?

331
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,362
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,768
I don't know what
you're talking about.

333
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,272
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

334
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,434
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

335
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,603
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

336
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,909
- Are you crazy?
- Not that crazy.

337
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,712
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

338
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,682
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

339
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,150
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

340
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,694
That's a horrible
thing to say.

341
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,059
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

342
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,496
A guy that walks into a good looking
dame's front parlor and says:

343
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,533
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

344
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,863
"You got one that's been
around too long?

345
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,596
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

346
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,571
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect."

347
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,302
- Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
- I think you're rotten.

348
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,571
I think you're swell,
so long as I'm not your husband.

349
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,580
- Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

350
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,843
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

351
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,261
<i>So I let her have it</i>
<i>straight between the eyes.</i>

352
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,855
<i>She didn't fool me</i>
<i>for a minute, not this time.</i>

353
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,566
<i>I knew I had hold</i>
<i>of a red-hot poker...</i>

354
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,364
<i>and the time to drop it</i>
<i>was before it burned my hand off.</i>

355
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,006
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer,</i>
<i>the one I had wanted all along...</i>

356
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,943
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get</i>
<i>rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

357
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,912
<i>and everything</i>
<i>that went with it.</i>

358
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,177
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office</i>
<i>so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

359
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,775
<i>at Third and Western</i>
<i>and rolled a few lines...</i>

360
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,947
<i>to get my mind thinking about</i>
<i>something else for a while.</i>

361
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,022
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when</i>
<i>I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

362
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,496
<i>So, I drove home, put the car away</i>
<i>and went up to my apartment.</i>

363
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,733
<i>It had begun to rain outside</i>
<i>and I watched it get dark...</i>

364
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,861
<i>and didn't even</i>
<i>turn on the light.</i>

365
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,738
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

366
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,638
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

367
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,541
<i>and I was still holding on</i>
<i>to that red-hot poker.</i>

368
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,677
<i>And right then it came over me that</i>
<i>I hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

369
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,214
<i>That the hook</i>
<i>was too strong...</i>

370
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,844
<i>that this wasn't the end</i>
<i>between her and me.</i>

371
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,579
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

372
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:16,091
<i>So at 8.00 the bell would ring and I'd know</i>
<i>who it was without even having to think.</i>

373
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,090
<i>As if it was the most</i>
<i>natural thing in the world.</i>

374
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,803
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

375
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,233
- Did I?
- Don't you want me to bring it in?

376
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,067
Sure.

377
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,573
Put it on the chair.

378
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,756
- How'd you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

379
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,354
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

380
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,293
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

381
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,457
Your husband out?

382
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,525
Yes. Long Beach.
They're spudding in a new well.

383
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,763
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

384
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,134
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

385
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,641
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

386
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,701
- Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

387
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,078
I must have said something that gave you
a terribly wrong impression.

388
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,050
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

389
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,381
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

390
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,287
- Not if you don't believe me.
- What do you want me to do?

391
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,986
I want you to be nice to me.

392
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,284
Like the first time
you came to the house.

393
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,592
It can't be
like the first time.

394
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,463
- Something's happened.
- I know it has.

395
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,031
It's happened to us.

396
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,566
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

397
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,880
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

398
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,473
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

399
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,876
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

400
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,649
- Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

401
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,020
- If you want to.
- Right now?

402
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,388
Sure, right now.

403
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,906
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

404
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,705
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

405
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,742
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

406
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,013
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

407
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,989
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

408
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,023
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

409
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,932
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

410
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,511
- Club soda?
- Plain water, please.

411
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,377
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

412
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,782
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

413
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,221
Only he had
accident insurance.

414
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,814
So they had an autopsy
and she didn't get away with it.

415
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,984
- Who didn't?
- His wife.

416
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,563
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

417
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,862
His wife said he was cleaning a gun
and his stomach got in the way.

418
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,561
All she collected was
a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

419
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,431
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

420
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,271
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

421
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,244
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

422
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,914
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

423
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,049
- Cook your own breakfast?
- Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

424
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,060
- Get the rest down at the
corner drugstore. - Sounds wonderful.

425
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,857
Just strangers beside you.

426
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,629
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

427
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,324
You don't have to
sit across the table...

428
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,598
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

429
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,936
What daughter? You mean
the little girl on the piano?

430
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,037
Lola. She lives with us.

431
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,635
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

432
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,446
- You ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

433
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,948
I suppose because
it'd cost him too much money.

434
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,577
He hasn't got any money.
Not since he went into the oil business.

435
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,416
But he had
when you married him?

436
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:08,018
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

437
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,493
But that's not the only reason.
I was his wife's nurse.

438
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,159
She was sick a long time.
When she died, he was terribly broken up.

439
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,695
- I pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

440
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,668
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

441
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,703
Every time I buy a dress or
a pair of shoes he yells his head off.

442
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,506
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

443
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,274
He's always been mean to me.

444
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,244
Even his life insurance
all goes to that daughter of his.

445
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,452
- That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all?

446
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,954
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

447
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,426
So you lie awake in the dark
and listen to him snore and get ideas.

448
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,496
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

449
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,892
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

450
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,797
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

451
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,605
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

452
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,205
- Is that it?
- Perhaps that, too.

453
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,476
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

454
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,380
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

455
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,185
and the motor still running.

456
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,253
And I thought what it would be like
if I didn't switch it off...

457
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,690
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

458
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:21,925
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

459
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,594
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

460
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,762
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

461
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,830
For him a setup like that'd be
just like a slice of rare roast beef.

462
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,738
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

463
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,903
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

464
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,139
In a half-hour you'd be
signing your name to a confession.

465
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,045
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

466
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,380
Not if there's an insurance company
in the picture, baby.

467
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,545
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

468
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,111
And if there's a death mixed up in it,
you haven't got a prayer.

469
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,250
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

470
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,618
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

471
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,599
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

472
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,832
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

473
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:05,267
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain</i>
<i>on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

474
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,341
<i>Maybe she had stopped</i>
<i>thinking about it, but I hadn't.</i>

475
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,637
I couldn't.

476
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,150
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

477
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,948
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

478
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,889
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

479
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,584
In this business
you can't sleep...

480
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,491
for trying to figure out
all the tricks they could pull on you.

481
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,028
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

482
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,395
watching the customers to make sure
they don't crook the house.

483
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,131
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

484
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,727
And do it smart.

485
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,898
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

486
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,101
You know every notch in it
by heart.

487
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,868
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

488
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,009
A shill to put down the bet.

489
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,174
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

490
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,684
and the whole setup
is right there in the room with you.

491
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,617
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

492
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:59,051
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

493
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,362
The stakes were $50,000,
but they were the life of a man, too.

494
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,737
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

495
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,033
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

496
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,804
<i>And I did.</i>

497
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,959
Will you phone me?
Walter?

498
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,661
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

499
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,666
- You believe me, don't you, Walter?
- Sure I believe you.

500
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,633
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

501
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,040
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

502
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,668
It's better than
going on this way.

503
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,905
They're not gonna
hang you because...

504
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,777
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

505
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,545
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure, I know what I'm saying.

506
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,108
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

507
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,314
- And I'm the guy that knows how.
- Walter, you're hurting me.

508
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,381
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

509
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,892
It's got to be perfect.

510
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,265
Call me tomorrow.
But not from your house. From a booth.

511
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,208
And watch your step
every single minute.

512
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,406
This has got to be perfect, you understand?
Straight down the line.

513
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,640
Straight down the line.

514
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,888
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

515
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,988
<i>The machinery had started to move</i>
<i>and nothing could stop it.</i>

516
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,157
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

517
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,369
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

518
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,933
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

519
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:31,012
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

520
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,512
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

521
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,711
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

522
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:40,281
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

523
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,823
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

524
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:47,655
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

525
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,226
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

526
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,796
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

527
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,931
to have her sitting right there
in the room, playing Chinese checkers...

528
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,601
<i>as if nothing</i>
<i>were going to happen.</i>

529
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,173
I suppose you realize,
Mr. Dietrichson...

530
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,544
that, not being an employee...

531
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,913
you are not covered by
the State Compensation Insurance Act.

532
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,284
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

533
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,515
Yeah, I know
all about that.

534
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,056
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

535
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,651
earthquake insurance and
lightning insurance and hail insurance.

536
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,457
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

537
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,326
we'd stay broke paying for it,
wouldn't we, honey?

538
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,266
What keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack.

539
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,030
Who needs a hat in California?

540
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,799
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

541
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,306
accident insurance is
the cheapest coverage you can buy.

542
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,242
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

543
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,403
Just as you say.

544
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,277
Suppose we just settle
that automobile insurance tonight.

545
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,576
Sure.

546
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,217
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

547
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,184
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

548
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,621
- It bores me stiff.
- Got something better to do?

549
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,953
Yes, I have.

550
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,058
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

551
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,257
- Run along where? Who with?
- Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

552
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,095
- Anne who?
- Anne Matthews.

553
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,135
It's not that
Nino Zachetti again, is it?

554
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,601
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

555
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,898
If I ever catch you
with that...

556
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,337
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

557
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,500
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

558
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,669
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

559
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,213
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

560
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,841
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

561
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,281
- Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

562
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,344
- I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...
- Neff.

563
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,083
Good night, Mr. Neff.

564
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,094
A great little fighter
for her weight.

565
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,589
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

566
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,065
- Sign what? - The applications
for the auto renewals.

567
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,102
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

568
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,865
- When will that be?
- About a week.

569
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,872
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

570
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,771
- San Francisco?
- Palo Alto.

571
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,571
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

572
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,078
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

573
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,707
What's wrong with that? Can't I have
a little fun, even once a year?

574
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,444
Great football school,
Stanford.

575
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,509
- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard.

576
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,214
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

577
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,620
The bottom line.

578
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,286
- Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

579
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,660
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

580
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,690
- I need it for my files.
- Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

581
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,908
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

582
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,809
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

583
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,109
- How much you taking me for?
- $147.50.

584
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,877
I think that's enough
insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.

585
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,145
Plenty.

586
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,718
Bring me some soda when you
come up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

587
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,816
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,487
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

589
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,808
Good night, Mr. Neff.

590
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,676
- All right, Walter?
- Fine.

591
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,650
- He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

592
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,653
Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto.
When does he leave?

593
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,710
End of the month.

594
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,777
- He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

595
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,483
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

596
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,116
- Why? - Because it's
all worked out for a train.

597
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,559
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

598
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,494
a little thing called
double indemnity.

599
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,465
The insurance companies put it in
as a sort of come-on for the customers.

600
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,695
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

601
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,396
The kind that almost
never happen.

602
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,962
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

603
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,474
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

604
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,977
- I see.
- We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

605
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,570
That's why
it's got to be the train.

606
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,715
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

607
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,685
Straight down the line.

608
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,665
Hello, Mr. Neff.

609
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,304
It's me.

610
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,411
- Is anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,572
For me? Why?

612
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,947
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

613
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,548
- Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

614
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,619
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

615
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,028
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

616
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,437
Going roller-skating, huh?

617
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,938
- You like roller-skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

618
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,010
- Only tonight you're leaving it?
- Yes, I am.

619
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,041
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

620
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,483
My father doesn't understand me
and Phyllis hates me.

621
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,447
- Sounds tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

622
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,922
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

623
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,926
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

624
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,122
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

625
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,266
You won't tell on me,
will you?

626
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,063
- I'd have to think it over.
- Nino's not what my father says at all.

627
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,230
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

628
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,275
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

629
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,004
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

630
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:05,104
Then he lost his job for talking back.
He's so hot-headed.

631
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,614
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

632
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,176
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

633
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,484
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

634
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,322
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

635
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,923
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

636
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:24,161
I suppose it will sometime.
This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

637
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,368
Nino? Over here, Nino.

638
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,609
- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

639
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,318
The name is Zachetti.

640
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,048
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave me
a ride from the house.

641
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,214
I told him all about us.

642
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,655
Why does he have to
get told about us?

643
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,716
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

644
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,352
I'm not doing any worrying.

645
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,726
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

646
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,526
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

647
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,089
- Why, he's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

648
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,432
If I did, I like to pick them myself.
Come on.

649
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,835
Look, sonny, she needed a ride,
so I brought her along.

650
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,067
Is that anything
to get tough about?

651
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,609
All right, Lola, make up your mind.
Are you coming or aren't you?

652
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,474
Of course I'm coming.

653
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,314
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

654
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,717
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

655
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,823
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

656
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,064
<i>Maybe he was a little better</i>
<i>than he sounded.</i>

657
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,567
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling</i>
<i>to be thinking about them at all...</i>

658
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:34,331
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head</i>
<i>that had her father's signature in it...</i>

659
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,532
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

660
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,837
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

661
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:42,978
<i>It was only a question of time,</i>
<i>and not very much time at that.</i>

662
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,777
<i>You know that big market</i>
<i>up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

663
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,077
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I</i>
<i>had picked for a meeting place.</i>

664
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,247
<i>I already had most of</i>
<i>the plan in my head...</i>

665
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,621
<i>but a lot of details</i>
<i>had to be worked out.</i>

666
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,253
<i>And she had to know them</i>
<i>all by heart when the time came.</i>

667
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,290
<i>We had to be very careful</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

668
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,060
<i>We couldn't let anybody</i>
<i>see us together.</i>

669
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,036
<i>We couldn't even talk to each other</i>
<i>on the telephone.</i>

670
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,971
<i>Not from her house</i>
<i>or at my office, anyway.</i>

671
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,974
<i>So she was to be in the market</i>
<i>every morning about 11.00, buying stuff.</i>

672
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,648
<i>And I could sort of run into her there</i>
<i>any day I wanted to.</i>

673
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,048
<i>Sort of accidentally</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

674
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,410
- Walter, I wanted to...
- Not so loud.

675
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,551
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

676
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,752
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

677
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,318
The accident policy came through.
I've got it in my pocket.

678
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,331
I got his check, too.
I saw him down in the oil fields.

679
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,526
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

680
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,468
The check's just made out to the company,
so it could be for anything.

681
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,336
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

682
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,467
It'll be all right that way,
because one of the cars is in your name.

683
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,307
Open your bag. Quick.

684
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,883
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

685
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,943
- Yes. We both have keys.
- Fine.

686
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,319
But don't put the policy
in there yet. I'll tell you when.

687
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,120
Remember, you never saw it, you never
even touched it, you understand?

688
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,787
- I'm not a fool. - Okay.
When is he leaving on the train?

689
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,329
- That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

690
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,297
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

691
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,957
What happened?

692
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,538
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

693
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,266
That one up there?

694
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,043
I don't know why they always put
what I want on the top shelf.

695
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,008
Go ahead. I'm listening.

696
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,448
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

697
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,248
- Broke his leg?
- What do we do now, Walter?

698
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,948
- Nothing. We just wait.
- Wait for what?

699
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,490
Until he can
take the train.

700
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,786
I told you it's got
to be the train.

701
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,191
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

702
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,253
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

703
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,095
- There are other ways.
- We're not gonna do it other ways.

704
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,259
But we can't leave it
like this.

705
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,270
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

706
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,397
Plenty. But not as bad as sitting
in that death house.

707
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,271
Don't ever talk like that. - Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

708
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,538
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

709
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,780
Excuse me.

710
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,479
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

711
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,045
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

712
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,590
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

713
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,684
- But we've got to wait.
- Maybe we have, Walter, only...

714
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,219
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

715
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,332
I better go, baby.
I'm thinking of you every minute.

716
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,937
<i>After that, a full week went</i>
<i>by and I didn't see her once.</i>

717
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,504
<i>I tried to keep my mind off her</i>
<i>and off the whole idea.</i>

718
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,483
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe</i>
<i>those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

719
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,284
<i>had gotten together and broken his leg</i>
<i>to give me a way out.</i>

720
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,349
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.</i>
<i>You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

721
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:48,095
<i>You came into my office</i>
<i>around 3.00 in the afternoon.</i>

722
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,063
Hello, Keyes.

723
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,362
I just came
from Norton's office.

724
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,925
The semiannual sales
records are out.

725
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,904
You're high man, Walter.
That's twice in a row. Congratulations.

726
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,669
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

727
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,233
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

728
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,576
- Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? - No, I'm serious.

729
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,946
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

730
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,348
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

731
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,444
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

732
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,421
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

733
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,888
Me? Why pick on me?

734
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,483
Well, because I've got a crazy idea
you might be good at the job.

735
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,959
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

736
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,225
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

737
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,061
You're too good
to be a salesman.

738
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,260
- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
- Phooey!

739
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,828
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

740
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,067
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

741
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,665
- Well, that'd trouble anybody.
- Now look, Walter.

742
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,712
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

743
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,679
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

744
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,874
It's the hottest job
in the business.

745
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,177
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

746
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,377
- I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
- Desk job?

747
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,045
Is that all you can see in it?

748
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,090
Just a hard chair to park your pants on
from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

749
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,887
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around,
and five sharp pencils...

750
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,329
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

751
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,423
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

752
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,596
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

753
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,504
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

754
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:07,374
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

755
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,572
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

756
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,976
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

757
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,281
A claims man, Walter,
is a doctor and a bloodhound and a...

758
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,883
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

759
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,286
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

760
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,056
and a father confessor,
all in one.

761
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,688
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

762
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:28,925
You don't want to work
with your brains?

763
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,058
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

764
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,662
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

765
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,263
- Walter Neff speaking.
- I had to call you, Walter.

766
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,706
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

767
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,338
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

768
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,245
No, you can't.
I've only got a minute. It can't wait.

769
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,616
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.
Are you listening?

770
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,282
- Walter?
- Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

771
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,516
- Only, make it snappy, will you?
- He's on crutches.

772
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,926
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

773
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,761
It's wonderful, Walter.
Just the way you wanted it, on a train.

774
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,393
Only with the crutches
it makes it much better, doesn't it?

775
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,903
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

776
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,803
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

777
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,604
- Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
- That's all right. I'll wait.

778
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,111
Only tell her
not to take all day.

779
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,007
Go ahead.

780
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,409
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

781
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,317
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

782
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,653
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

783
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,449
No.

784
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,716
Oh, uh...

785
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,887
what color did you pick?

786
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,864
Blue. Navy blue.
And the cast is on his left leg.

787
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,794
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,859
Yeah, that suits me fine.

789
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,201
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

790
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:45,298
But it's straight down the line
for both of us.

791
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,502
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

792
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,480
- Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?

793
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,278
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

794
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,216
If I told you
it was a customer...

795
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,445
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

796
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,387
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

797
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:04,518
- Why don't you, for instance?
- I almost did, once. Long time ago.

798
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,358
Now look, Keyes,
I've got to call on a prospect.

799
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,955
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

800
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,262
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

801
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,168
I was on my way to the jewelry store
to buy the ring.

802
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,832
And then suddenly that little man
in here started working on me.

803
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,431
So you went back
and had her investigated?

804
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,943
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

805
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,278
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

806
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,873
There was a manic depressive
in her family, on her mother's side.

807
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,577
She already had one husband.

808
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,745
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

809
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,880
- And as for her brother...
- I get the general idea.

810
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,585
- She was a tramp from a long line
of tramps. - Yeah. All right, all right.

811
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,390
Now what do I say to Norton?
What about this job I want you for?

812
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,021
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

813
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,589
- Thanks just the same.
- Fair enough.

814
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,765
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

815
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,998
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

816
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:52,405
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

817
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,575
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

818
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,947
You're just a little taller.

819
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,231
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

820
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,896
<i>Those Fates I was talking about</i>
<i>had only been stalling me off.</i>

821
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,338
<i>Now they had thrown the switch.</i>
<i>The gears had meshed.</i>

822
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,069
<i>The time for thinking</i>
<i>had all run out.</i>

823
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:31,542
<i>I wanted my movements accounted for</i>
<i>up to the last possible moment.</i>

824
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,745
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate book</i>
<i>on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

825
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,844
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

826
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,019
<i>From here on, it was a question</i>
<i>of following the timetable...</i>

827
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,116
<i>move by move.</i>

828
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:48,056
<i>I got home about 7.00 and</i>
<i>drove right into the garage.</i>

829
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,066
<i>This was another item</i>
<i>to establish my alibi.</i>

830
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,734
- Hi, Mr. Neff.
- Hello, Charlie.

831
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,636
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

832
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,867
How soon you gonna want it?

833
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,340
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

834
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,933
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

835
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,241
- I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

836
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,315
<i>Up in my apartment</i>
<i>I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

837
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,680
<i>one of the salesmen</i>
<i>that shared my office.</i>

838
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,152
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll call</i>
<i>and there'd be a record of it.</i>

839
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,519
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my rate book</i>
<i>and needed some dope...</i>

840
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,525
<i>on the public liability bond</i>
<i>I was figuring.</i>

841
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,426
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit like</i>
<i>Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

842
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,591
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back</i>
<i>and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

843
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,101
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and</i>
<i>a roll of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

844
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:30,162
<i>so I could fake something that</i>
<i>looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

845
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,265
<i>Next, I stuck a card</i>
<i>inside the telephone box...</i>

846
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,175
<i>so that it would fall down</i>
<i>if the bell rang.</i>

847
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,737
<i>That way I'd know if anybody had</i>
<i>called me while I was away.</i>

848
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:43,013
<i>Then I did the same thing to the doorbell</i>
<i>in case anybody came to see me.</i>

849
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,149
<i>I left the apartment</i>
<i>by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

850
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,423
<i>I walked all the way from my apartment</i>
<i>to the Dietrichson house.</i>

851
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,860
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>to take the bus...</i>

852
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,593
<i>because there was always the chance that</i>
<i>someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

853
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,658
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

854
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,663
<i>I could smell that</i>
<i>honeysuckle again.</i>

855
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,935
<i>Only it was even stronger,</i>
<i>now that it was night.</i>

856
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,543
<i>I slid the garage door open</i>
<i>as quietly as I could.</i>

857
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,943
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,</i>
<i>just the way I told her to.</i>

858
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,509
<i>I'd figured it was</i>
<i>safer that way...</i>

859
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,647
<i>in case he got into the car</i>
<i>before she drove it out.</i>

860
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,022
<i>I got into</i>
<i>the back of the car.</i>

861
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,561
<i>I lay there on the floor</i>
<i>and waited.</i>

862
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,723
<i>All the time I was thinking about that</i>
<i>dark street on the way to the station...</i>

863
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,596
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

864
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,431
<i>and the three honks on the horn</i>
<i>that were to be the signal.</i>

865
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,903
<i>About 10 minutes later</i>
<i>they came down.</i>

866
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,702
- All right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,208
I'll have the car out
in a second.

868
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,313
- Take it easy, honey.
We've got lots of time. - Yeah.

869
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,762
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

870
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,567
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

871
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,440
So what? I could break
the other one and match them up again.

872
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,302
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

873
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,077
It's only for four days.
I'll be back Monday at the latest.

874
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,466
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

875
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,534
What are you doing that for?

876
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,012
What are you
honking the horn for?

877
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,164
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

878
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,574
- Don't worry.
- Keep away from me as much as you can.

879
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,112
- Tell them I don't want to be helped.
- I said, don't worry, Walter.

880
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,410
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

881
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,144
When you get to the refinery,
turn off the highway onto the dirt road.

882
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,776
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

883
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,286
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

884
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,880
- I remember everything.
- No speeding.

885
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,921
You don't want any cops stopping you
with him in the back.

886
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,361
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

887
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,694
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

888
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,892
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

889
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,630
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

890
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,764
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

891
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,245
- San Francisco train, lady?
- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.

892
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,804
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

893
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,824
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

894
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,757
Car number 8. Up there.

895
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,661
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

896
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,672
- Here're the tickets. - Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

897
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,106
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

898
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,612
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Section 11, sir.

899
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,380
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

900
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,610
- Goodbye, honey.
- All aboard!

901
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,052
Good luck, honey.

902
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,260
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

903
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,395
Yes, sir.

904
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,166
I'm going back to
the observation car for a smoke.

905
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,935
Right this way, sir.

906
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,240
Like a chair?

907
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,378
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

908
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,182
- You going far?
- Palo Alto.

909
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,110
My name's Jackson.

910
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:53,383
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

911
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,781
I had a broken arm once.

912
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,592
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

913
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,994
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

914
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:06,126
Palo Alto's a nice little town.
You a Stanford man?

915
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:11,134
- I used to be. - I'll bet you
left something behind.

916
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,307
I always do.

917
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,843
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

918
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,246
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

919
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,306
Dietrichson.

920
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,309
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

921
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,218
- Maybe the porter could...
- Well, I could get your cigars for you.

922
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,658
- Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
- If it's not too much trouble.

923
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,528
- Car 9, section 11.
- Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.

924
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,367
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

925
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,936
Here, take his hat.
Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.

926
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,075
Okay, baby. That's it.

927
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,167
All right. Let's go.

928
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,880
<i>On the way back,</i>
<i>we went over once more...</i>

929
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,384
<i>what she was to do</i>
<i>at the inquest...</i>

930
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:13,183
<i>if they had one, and about the insurance,</i>
<i>when that came up.</i>

931
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,383
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces</i>
<i>a little, now that we had done it.</i>

932
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:21,055
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves.</i>
<i>Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

933
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,125
<i>She dropped me a block</i>
<i>from my apartment house.</i>

934
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,393
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

935
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,938
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

936
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,142
- I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

937
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:02,067
<i>It was two minutes past 11.00,</i>
<i>as I went up the service stairs again.</i>

938
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:06,131
<i>Nobody saw me this time either.</i>
<i>In the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

939
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,201
<i>The cards hadn't moved.</i>
<i>No calls. No visitors.</i>

940
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,672
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.</i>
<i>That left one last thing to do.</i>

941
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:19,645
<i>I had to go down to the garage.</i>
<i>I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

942
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,230
You gonna use your car, after all?
I'm not quite through.

943
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,164
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

944
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,327
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

945
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,372
Been working upstairs all night.
My stomach's getting a little sore at me.

946
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,031
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

947
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,967
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

948
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,707
<i>Nothing had slipped,</i>
<i>nothing had been overlooked.</i>

949
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,181
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>to give us away.</i>

950
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,879
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down</i>
<i>the street to the drugstore...</i>

951
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,390
<i>suddenly it came over me that</i>
<i>everything would go wrong.</i>

952
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,654
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,</i>
<i>but it's true, so help me.</i>

953
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,227
<i>I couldn't hear</i>
<i>my own footsteps.</i>

954
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,629
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

955
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,103
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

956
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:20,047
and the next day was worse,
when the story had broke in the papers...

957
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,016
and they started talking
about it at the office...

958
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:25,316
and the day after that,
when you started digging into it.

959
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:29,324
I kept my hands in my pockets because
I thought they were shaking.

960
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,622
I put on dark glasses
so people couldn't see my eyes.

961
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:35,653
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

962
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,428
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

963
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,760
<i>I could feel my nerves</i>
<i>pulling me to pieces.</i>

964
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,340
- Oh, Walter?
- Hello, Keyes.

965
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,771
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

966
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:52,144
- The Dietrichson case?
- Must be.

967
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,283
- Anything wrong?
- Well, the guy is dead.

968
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:58,252
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

969
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,585
- What have they got so far?
- Autopsy report.

970
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,286
No heart failure, no apoplexy,
no predisposing medical cause of any kind.

971
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,225
Died of a broken neck.

972
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,387
- When's the inquest?
- Had it this morning.

973
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,523
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

974
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,398
The train people and some of
the passengers told how he went through...

975
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,731
to the observation car.

976
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,365
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

977
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,443
What do the police figure?

978
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,173
That he got tangled up
in his crutches and fell off the train.

979
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,874
They're satisfied.

980
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,576
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

981
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,918
All right. Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

982
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,216
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

983
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,622
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

984
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,560
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

985
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,198
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

986
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,261
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton,
but I didn't know this was formal.

987
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,703
- Sit down, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

988
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,797
Any new developments?

989
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,502
I just talked to this Jackson
long distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

990
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:55,601
Who's Jackson?

991
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,202
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

992
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,840
They were out on the
observation platform together, talking.

993
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,975
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

994
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,712
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

995
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,152
When he returned to the
observation platform, no Dietrichson.

996
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,087
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

997
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,125
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

998
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,923
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

999
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,486
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1000
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,556
Anything else?
No, not much.

1001
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,625
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1002
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:24,070
There's a daughter, but all she remembers
is Neff talking to her father...

1003
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,370
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1004
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:27,807
I couldn't sell him at first.

1005
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,812
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1006
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,077
Later I saw him
in the oil fields and closed him.

1007
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,175
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1008
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,652
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1009
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,348
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1010
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,391
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1011
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,723
Are your salesmen supposed to know
a customer is going to fall off the train?

1012
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,595
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1013
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,264
- I don't get it.
- You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1014
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,825
Then what do you
think of this case?

1015
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,666
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1016
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,865
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1017
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,703
Just what is your opinion?

1018
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,505
- No opinion at all.
- Not even a hunch?

1019
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,943
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1020
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,344
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1021
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:09,111
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.
I've formed a very definite opinion.

1022
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,848
I think I know. In fact, I know
I know what happened to Dietrichson.

1023
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,289
- You know you know what?
- I know it was not an accident.

1024
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:22,222
- What do you say to that?
- Me?

1025
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,999
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1026
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,629
There's a widespread feeling that
just because a man has a large office...

1027
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,404
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1028
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,503
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1029
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,879
just because a man has a large office,
he must be an idiot.

1030
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,884
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1031
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,921
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1032
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,615
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1033
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,228
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1034
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,061
I assure you I appreciate it.
This is Mr. Keyes.

1035
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,600
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1036
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,693
- And Mr. Neff.
- I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1037
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,330
- Mrs. Dietrichson.
- Won't you sit down?

1038
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,806
May I extend our sympathy
in your bereavement?

1039
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,368
I hesitated before asking you
to come here so soon after your loss.

1040
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:14,109
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1041
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,741
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1042
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,412
No. All I know is that your secretary
made it sound very urgent.

1043
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,614
Your husband had
an accident policy with this company.

1044
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,385
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1045
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,188
No. I remember some talk at the house,
but he didn't seem to want it.

1046
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:28,560
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1047
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,122
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1048
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,963
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1049
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,026
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1050
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,799
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1051
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,306
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1052
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,001
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1053
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,100
What sort of things?

1054
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,671
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1055
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,806
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1056
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,477
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1057
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,048
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1058
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,622
a suicide.

1059
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,396
- I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? - Please.

1060
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,501
Thank you.

1061
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,039
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1062
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,879
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1063
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,284
He was perfectly all right and
I don't know of any financial worries.

1064
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,481
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1065
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:31,686
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1066
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,762
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1067
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,492
- Do what? - Next, he goes
on this trip entirely alone.

1068
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:41,161
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1069
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,900
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1070
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,235
Once there, he finds he is not alone.
There is a man there.

1071
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,042
- What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1072
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,245
So he gets rid of this Jackson
with some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1073
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,618
- And then he is alone.
And then he does it. - Does what?

1074
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,386
He jumps. Suicide. In which case,
the company is not liable.

1075
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,626
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1076
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,496
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1077
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,999
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1078
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,971
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1079
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,507
A settlement for a certain sum,
a part of the policy value.

1080
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:23,272
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1081
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,371
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1082
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,882
Now you tell me you want to
pay me a part of it, whatever it is.

1083
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,282
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1084
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,720
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1085
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:37,520
In fact, I don't like you, Mr. Norton.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,596
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1087
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,033
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1088
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,300
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass
and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1089
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,308
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1090
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,402
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1091
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,969
Oh, can we?

1092
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,881
Mr. Norton, the first thing
that struck me was that suicide angle.

1093
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:05,682
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1094
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:09,316
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1095
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,860
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1096
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,054
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1097
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,893
Yeah, in the front office.

1098
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,128
Come now, you've never read
an actuarial table in your life, have you?

1099
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,465
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1100
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,334
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1101
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,397
by sex, by seasons of the year,
by time of day.

1102
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,841
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1103
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,573
Suicide by poison,
subdivided by types of poison...

1104
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,275
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1105
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,817
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1106
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,581
Suicide by leaps, subdivided by
leaps from high places...

1107
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,781
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1108
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,121
under the feet of horses,
from steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1109
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,887
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1110
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,328
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1111
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,161
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1112
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,202
at the point where the body was found?
15 miles an hour.

1113
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,431
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1114
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,372
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1115
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,137
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1116
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,304
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1117
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,972
May I have this?

1118
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,910
Come on, Walter.

1119
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,251
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1120
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,142
<i>I could have hugged you</i>
<i>right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1121
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,769
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1122
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,576
<i>You were the only one</i>
<i>we were really scared of...</i>

1123
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,378
<i>and instead you were</i>
<i>almost playing on our team.</i>

1124
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:45,891
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1125
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:47,993
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1126
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,868
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1127
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,204
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1128
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:55,938
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1129
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,754
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1130
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,148
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1131
01:09:09,225 --> 01:09:12,456
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1132
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,053
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1133
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:17,725
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1134
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:20,060
- Can I come up?
- Okay. But be careful.

1135
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:21,899
Don't let anybody see you.

1136
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:49,664
Hello, Keyes.

1137
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:57,966
- What's on your mind?
- That broken leg.

1138
01:09:58,508 --> 01:10:01,602
- The guy had a broken leg.
- What are you talking about?

1139
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:05,204
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1140
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,540
- Yeah.
- Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1141
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:09,551
- So what?
- And he didn't put in a claim.

1142
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:13,385
- Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?
- What are you driving at?

1143
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:18,357
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1144
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,122
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1145
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:22,528
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1146
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,432
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1147
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,494
Maybe he just didn't know
that he was insured.

1148
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,164
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1149
01:10:33,242 --> 01:10:35,437
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1150
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:36,535
- Yeah.
- You got his check?

1151
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:37,772
Sure I did.

1152
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:41,516
- Got any bicarbonate of soda?
- No, I haven't.

1153
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:45,914
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1154
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:49,083
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1155
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,592
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1156
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:53,253
No. Not suicide.

1157
01:10:53,863 --> 01:10:56,923
- But not an accident, either.
- What else?

1158
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:58,694
Now look, Walter.

1159
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,737
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1160
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:02,862
if he's killed on a train.

1161
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:04,839
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1162
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:08,900
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1163
01:11:08,978 --> 01:11:11,640
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1164
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:14,615
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1165
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:20,048
And add to that the broken leg.
No, it just can't be the way it looks.

1166
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:24,617
- Something has been worked on us.
- Such as what?

1167
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:33,829
Murder?

1168
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:36,202
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1169
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:39,070
- Sorry. Want a little soda water?
- No, no, no.

1170
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:41,432
Who do you suspect?

1171
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,444
Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1172
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:45,537
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1173
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:46,707
- You mean the wife?
- Yeah.

1174
01:11:46,782 --> 01:11:49,342
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1175
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:51,443
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1176
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,782
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1177
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,085
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1178
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:57,591
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1179
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,389
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1180
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:02,431
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1181
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:05,194
- Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1182
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,469
- See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1183
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:12,099
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1184
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:16,338
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1185
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:19,074
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1186
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:20,706
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1187
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:23,616
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1188
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:25,711
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1189
01:12:25,788 --> 01:12:28,086
Oh, not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1190
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:32,389
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1191
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,827
Can I have
one of those things?

1192
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:50,168
- Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1193
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,789
- How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1194
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,591
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1195
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:10,996
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1196
01:13:11,067 --> 01:13:15,060
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1197
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:19,633
- How long a while?
- Until this dies down.

1198
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:20,698
You don't know Keyes.

1199
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:22,835
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1200
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:24,607
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1201
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,478
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1202
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,041
- You afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1203
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:35,112
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.
We're not the same anymore.

1204
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:38,354
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1205
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:40,190
- Isn't it, Walter?
- What are you talking about?

1206
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:43,959
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1207
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:46,924
Shut up, baby.

1208
01:13:51,173 --> 01:13:53,573
<i>Pacific All Risk.</i>
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1209
01:13:55,877 --> 01:13:57,469
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1210
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,505
- Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.

1211
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:03,817
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

1212
01:14:03,952 --> 01:14:06,147
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1213
01:14:06,221 --> 01:14:08,655
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1214
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,085
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1215
01:14:17,432 --> 01:14:19,593
Is it something about
what happened?

1216
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:23,263
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1217
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:25,931
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1218
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,272
Lou, do you mind if I use the office
alone for a few minutes?

1219
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,247
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1220
01:14:41,223 --> 01:14:42,781
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1221
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:46,316
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical.
I'm not even crying.

1222
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:50,853
But I have the awful feeling
that something's wrong...

1223
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:54,966
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1224
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:56,060
When your mother died?

1225
01:14:56,138 --> 01:14:58,538
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1226
01:14:58,607 --> 01:14:59,596
We had a cabin there.

1227
01:14:59,674 --> 01:15:04,008
It was winter and very cold.
My mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1228
01:15:04,312 --> 01:15:06,041
She had a nurse with her.

1229
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:09,140
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1230
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:11,947
One night I got up
and went into my mother's room.

1231
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,885
She was delirious with fever.

1232
01:15:13,955 --> 01:15:17,652
All the bed covers were on the floor
and the windows were wide open.

1233
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:18,919
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1234
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:21,189
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1235
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:23,993
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1236
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:26,498
The nurse stood there.

1237
01:15:27,035 --> 01:15:30,664
She didn't say a word,
but there was a look in her eyes...

1238
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:32,500
I'll never forget.

1239
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:37,670
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1240
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:43,314
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1241
01:15:43,518 --> 01:15:45,179
- No. Who?
- Phyllis.

1242
01:15:45,654 --> 01:15:48,020
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1243
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:51,252
He wouldn't listen to me.
Six months later she married him...

1244
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:55,729
and I kind of talked myself out of the idea
she could have done anything like that.

1245
01:15:55,797 --> 01:16:00,257
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1246
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:04,169
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.
Your father fell off a train.

1247
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:07,265
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1248
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:09,833
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1249
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:11,242
pinning a black veil to it.

1250
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:14,714
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1251
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:16,841
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1252
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:18,545
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1253
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:20,086
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1254
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:23,181
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1255
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:24,748
That same look.

1256
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,223
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1257
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:29,126
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1258
01:16:29,197 --> 01:16:31,631
I loathe her because she did it.
She did it for the money.

1259
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,032
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1260
01:16:34,102 --> 01:16:37,230
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1261
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:38,795
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1262
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:43,208
- You'd better be careful, saying things...
- I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1263
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:52,850
I'm sorry.

1264
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:58,522
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1265
01:16:59,794 --> 01:17:02,854
All this that you've been telling me,
who else have you told?

1266
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,125
No one.

1267
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:06,757
- How about your stepmother?
- Of course not.

1268
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:09,260
I've moved out.

1269
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:12,499
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1270
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:15,134
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1271
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:18,111
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1272
01:17:19,714 --> 01:17:21,545
Where are you living now?

1273
01:17:21,616 --> 01:17:24,608
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1274
01:17:24,886 --> 01:17:27,855
Four walls, and you just sit
and look at them?

1275
01:17:28,723 --> 01:17:30,213
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1276
01:17:33,061 --> 01:17:34,585
<i>So that evening</i>
<i>I took her to dinner...</i>

1277
01:17:34,663 --> 01:17:38,326
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera</i>
<i>Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1278
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,391
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1279
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:44,238
<i>The next day was Sunday and we went</i>
<i>for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1280
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:47,036
<i>She had loosened up a bit,</i>
<i>she was even laughing.</i>

1281
01:17:47,108 --> 01:17:50,669
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell</i>
<i>that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1282
01:17:50,745 --> 01:17:53,680
<i>It was dynamite,</i>
<i>whether it was true or not.</i>

1283
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:55,713
<i>And I had no chance</i>
<i>to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1284
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:57,979
<i>You were watching her</i>
<i>like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1285
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:02,387
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I</i>
<i>was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1286
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:06,583
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my</i>
<i>desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1287
01:18:06,661 --> 01:18:09,630
<i>For a minute I wondered</i>
<i>if it could be about Lola.</i>

1288
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,165
<i>It was worse.</i>

1289
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:15,692
<i>Outside your door was the last guy</i>
<i>in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1290
01:18:24,846 --> 01:18:26,837
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1291
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:31,251
- Hello, Keyes.
- I want to ask you something.

1292
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:33,551
After all the years
we've known each other...

1293
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:35,555
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1294
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:37,215
- About what?
- About me.

1295
01:18:37,826 --> 01:18:40,488
- Walter, I'm a very great man.
- Yeah?

1296
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:43,326
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1297
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:45,389
and murders don't come
any neater.

1298
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:48,334
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1299
01:18:48,403 --> 01:18:50,667
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1300
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:54,041
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1301
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:57,943
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1302
01:18:58,013 --> 01:19:00,743
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You know what?

1303
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:04,051
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1304
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,245
- He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1305
01:19:08,823 --> 01:19:11,121
Now look, Walter.
You can't be sure of killing a man...

1306
01:19:11,192 --> 01:19:14,320
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1307
01:19:14,396 --> 01:19:16,864
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1308
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:18,865
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1309
01:19:18,933 --> 01:19:21,128
Now that would mean
either killing him on the train...

1310
01:19:21,202 --> 01:19:24,933
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1311
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:26,200
and put him on the tracks.

1312
01:19:26,274 --> 01:19:29,539
Two possibilities,
and I personally buy the second.

1313
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:32,303
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1314
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:34,177
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1315
01:19:34,449 --> 01:19:38,112
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1316
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:41,787
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1317
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:43,619
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1318
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:46,251
then they put the body on the tracks
where the train had passed.

1319
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:48,989
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1320
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,925
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1321
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,524
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1322
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:56,069
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1323
01:19:56,137 --> 01:19:58,298
Fancy all right, Keyes,
but maybe it's a little too fancy.

1324
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:01,740
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1325
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,310
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1326
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:07,280
The only guy who really got a good look
at this supposed Dietrichson...

1327
01:20:07,348 --> 01:20:09,475
is sitting
right outside my office.

1328
01:20:09,551 --> 01:20:12,987
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1329
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:17,555
- Come here, Mr. Jackson.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1330
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:19,320
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1331
01:20:19,394 --> 01:20:21,123
- Two for a quarter.
- That's what I said.

1332
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,754
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1333
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,856
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1334
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:26,764
- Very thoroughly.
- Have you made up your mind?

1335
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:28,826
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1336
01:20:28,903 --> 01:20:31,064
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1337
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:34,165
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1338
01:20:34,242 --> 01:20:36,472
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1339
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:37,533
Yes.

1340
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:40,274
- Then my answer is no.
- What do you mean, no?

1341
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:42,543
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1342
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:43,811
Will you swear to that?

1343
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:45,876
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1344
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:48,320
If I say it, I mean it.
If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1345
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:50,016
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1346
01:20:50,091 --> 01:20:51,752
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1347
01:20:51,826 --> 01:20:53,817
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
- Pleased, indeed.

1348
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:55,260
- How are you?
- Very fine, thank you.

1349
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,696
- Never was better.
- Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1350
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:01,132
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1351
01:21:01,202 --> 01:21:03,932
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1352
01:21:04,038 --> 01:21:07,007
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1353
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,100
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1354
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:11,577
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1355
01:21:11,646 --> 01:21:14,513
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1356
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:17,240
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1357
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:19,582
Come to think of it,
he tried to keep his back towards me.

1358
01:21:19,654 --> 01:21:22,282
- But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1359
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:24,791
Of course, you understand
this matter is strictly confidential?

1360
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:27,953
We may need you again down here in
Los Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1361
01:21:28,029 --> 01:21:30,793
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1362
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:34,164
- Expenses paid, of course.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1363
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:38,365
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1364
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,099
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1365
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:45,272
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1366
01:21:45,346 --> 01:21:48,144
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1367
01:21:48,216 --> 01:21:49,979
the Dietrichson claim.

1368
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:53,179
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1369
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:54,346
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1370
01:21:54,422 --> 01:21:55,446
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1371
01:21:55,523 --> 01:21:57,047
No. Never been up there.

1372
01:21:57,258 --> 01:21:59,852
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1373
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:03,591
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
- Nope. I don't fish.

1374
01:22:03,898 --> 01:22:07,197
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1375
01:22:07,735 --> 01:22:10,329
- There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. - No relation.

1376
01:22:10,405 --> 01:22:12,805
Let me see. This man's
an automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1377
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:15,206
- A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
- All right, Mr. Jackson.

1378
01:22:15,276 --> 01:22:16,800
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1379
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:18,345
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1380
01:22:18,413 --> 01:22:21,712
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1381
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:22,772
Tonight?

1382
01:22:22,884 --> 01:22:26,115
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1383
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:28,985
- I'd like to see before I leave.
- Osteopath?

1384
01:22:29,524 --> 01:22:32,584
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1385
01:22:33,494 --> 01:22:35,018
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1386
01:22:35,096 --> 01:22:37,394
- It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1387
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:43,637
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1388
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:46,435
Murder's never perfect.
Always comes apart sooner or later.

1389
01:22:46,507 --> 01:22:48,975
And when two people are involved,
it's usually sooner.

1390
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:51,944
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1391
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:54,038
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1392
01:22:54,115 --> 01:22:56,982
He'll show. He's got to show.
Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.

1393
01:22:57,051 --> 01:22:58,348
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1394
01:22:58,419 --> 01:23:01,855
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1395
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:04,391
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1396
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:05,858
But it isn't twice as safe.

1397
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:09,090
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1398
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:11,290
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1399
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,129
where they can get off
at different stops.

1400
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:15,465
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1401
01:23:15,536 --> 01:23:17,003
all the way to
the end of the line.

1402
01:23:17,071 --> 01:23:19,403
And it's a one-way trip,
and the last stop is the cemetery.

1403
01:23:19,474 --> 01:23:21,271
She put in her claim.

1404
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:24,503
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1405
01:23:30,084 --> 01:23:31,847
Let her sue us if she dares.

1406
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:34,717
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1407
01:23:34,789 --> 01:23:37,314
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1408
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:48,429
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1409
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:51,495
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1410
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:55,133
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1411
01:24:22,203 --> 01:24:24,831
- Hello, Walter.
- Come over here.

1412
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:31,478
- What's the matter?
- Everything's the matter.

1413
01:24:33,514 --> 01:24:34,845
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1414
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,510
He's sitting back with his
mouth watering, waiting for you to sue.

1415
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:39,382
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1416
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:42,355
- What's he got to stop me?
- He's got plenty.

1417
01:24:45,226 --> 01:24:46,591
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1418
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,458
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1419
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:50,360
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1420
01:24:50,431 --> 01:24:52,797
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1421
01:24:52,867 --> 01:24:56,359
Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot
of other things are going to come up.

1422
01:24:56,437 --> 01:25:00,271
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1423
01:25:00,441 --> 01:25:02,272
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1424
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:03,367
The way she died.

1425
01:25:03,444 --> 01:25:06,470
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1426
01:25:06,547 --> 01:25:08,310
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1427
01:25:08,383 --> 01:25:10,715
- She's been seeing you. - I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1428
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:12,480
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1429
01:25:12,553 --> 01:25:15,283
She's putting on an act for you,
crying all over your shoulder, the lying...

1430
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:17,688
Keep her out of this. All I'm telling you
is we're not going to sue.

1431
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:18,953
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1432
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:20,220
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1433
01:25:20,294 --> 01:25:21,488
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1434
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:24,827
It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks.
We're pulling out, do you understand?

1435
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:27,834
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1436
01:25:27,902 --> 01:25:30,166
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1437
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,105
You're afraid she might find out someday
and you can't take it, can you?

1438
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:35,108
I said, leave her out of this.

1439
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:41,343
It's me I'm talking about.

1440
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:43,577
- I don't want to be left out of it.
- Stop saying that.

1441
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:45,050
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1442
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:47,747
- We can't go through with it, that's all.
- We have gone through with it.

1443
01:25:47,822 --> 01:25:48,914
The tough part
is all behind us.

1444
01:25:49,023 --> 01:25:51,491
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1445
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:54,293
stick close together
the way we started out.

1446
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:55,624
Watch it.

1447
01:26:13,414 --> 01:26:16,008
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1448
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:19,575
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1449
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:23,283
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1450
01:26:23,858 --> 01:26:26,520
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1451
01:26:26,594 --> 01:26:30,291
- Is that what you're telling me?
- And nobody's pulling out.

1452
01:26:30,465 --> 01:26:33,025
We went into this together,
we're coming out at the end together.

1453
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,831
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1454
01:26:43,544 --> 01:26:45,205
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1455
01:26:46,547 --> 01:26:49,846
<i>Just like I remembered</i>
<i>what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1456
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:52,385
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1457
01:26:52,453 --> 01:26:54,853
<i>and how there was no getting off</i>
<i>till the end of the line...</i>

1458
01:26:56,491 --> 01:26:58,391
...where the cemetery was.

1459
01:26:59,827 --> 01:27:03,092
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1460
01:27:03,764 --> 01:27:05,994
They're to put dead people in.

1461
01:27:07,735 --> 01:27:11,398
I guess that was the first time
I ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1462
01:27:11,472 --> 01:27:12,996
Dead, I mean.

1463
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,769
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1464
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,877
<i>I saw Lola three or four times</i>
<i>that week.</i>

1465
01:27:21,549 --> 01:27:25,383
<i>One night we went up into the hills</i>
<i>behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1466
01:27:25,586 --> 01:27:28,419
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,</i>
<i>but it was only with her that...</i>

1467
01:27:28,489 --> 01:27:30,923
<i>I could relax</i>
<i>and let go a little.</i>

1468
01:28:01,088 --> 01:28:02,817
Why are you crying?

1469
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:06,955
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1470
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:11,030
Of course I will, Walter.
I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1471
01:28:12,266 --> 01:28:15,167
- It's about Nino.
- Zachetti? What about him?

1472
01:28:15,336 --> 01:28:18,203
They killed my father together.
He and Phyllis.

1473
01:28:18,272 --> 01:28:20,763
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1474
01:28:21,576 --> 01:28:23,544
What makes you say that?

1475
01:28:23,945 --> 01:28:27,244
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1476
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:29,715
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1477
01:28:29,984 --> 01:28:34,045
Maybe he was just going with me as
a blind. And the night of the murder...

1478
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:36,214
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1479
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:39,817
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1480
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:42,795
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1481
01:28:43,598 --> 01:28:44,690
Sick!

1482
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:51,170
He couldn't show up, because the train
was leaving with my father on it.

1483
01:28:56,777 --> 01:29:00,076
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1484
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:03,140
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1485
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:07,313
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1486
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:17,095
<i>Zachetti.</i>
<i>Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1487
01:29:18,799 --> 01:29:22,860
<i>What was he doing up at her house?</i>
<i>I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1488
01:29:24,505 --> 01:29:27,599
<i>I tried to make sense out of it</i>
<i>and got nowhere.</i>

1489
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:31,101
<i>But the real braintwister</i>
<i>came the next day.</i>

1490
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:35,675
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes,</i>
<i>after office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1491
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,650
<i>down in the lobby</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

1492
01:29:37,718 --> 01:29:39,948
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1493
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:47,618
- Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1494
01:29:47,695 --> 01:29:49,663
- What for?
- Oh, nothing much.

1495
01:29:49,897 --> 01:29:52,798
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1496
01:29:53,067 --> 01:29:56,093
- How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1497
01:29:57,304 --> 01:29:59,534
- What guy?
- The guy who helped her do it.

1498
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:01,302
The somebody else?

1499
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:04,905
- No kidding?
- Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1500
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:06,276
It's okay by me.

1501
01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:09,407
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1502
01:30:09,483 --> 01:30:11,713
- Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1503
01:30:11,786 --> 01:30:12,775
With two olives.

1504
01:30:12,853 --> 01:30:15,151
No, I've got to get a shave
and a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1505
01:30:15,222 --> 01:30:18,316
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1506
01:30:18,926 --> 01:30:20,655
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1507
01:30:20,728 --> 01:30:22,025
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1508
01:30:22,096 --> 01:30:26,226
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1509
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:32,596
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1510
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:35,740
<i>Maybe you were playing</i>
<i>cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1511
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:38,973
<i>Maybe you knew all along</i>
<i>I was the somebody else.</i>

1512
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:43,578
<i>I had to find out, and I knew</i>
<i>where to look. In your office.</i>

1513
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,640
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1514
01:31:17,718 --> 01:31:19,379
<i>Confidential.</i>
<i>Dietrichson file.</i>

1515
01:31:20,187 --> 01:31:22,951
<i>With regard to your proposal</i>
<i>to put Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1516
01:31:23,023 --> 01:31:24,718
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1517
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:27,158
<i>I have investigated his</i>
<i>movements on the night of the crime...</i>

1518
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:31,062
<i>and he's definitely placed</i>
<i>in his apartment from 7.15 p.m. on.</i>

1519
01:31:31,665 --> 01:31:35,101
<i>In addition to this, I have known</i>
<i>Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1520
01:31:35,169 --> 01:31:38,468
<i>and I personally vouch for him</i>
<i>without reservation.</i>

1521
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:47,112
<i>Furthermore, no connection whatsoever</i>
<i>has been established...</i>

1522
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,547
<i>between Walter Neff and</i>
<i>Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1523
01:31:49,617 --> 01:31:53,417
<i>whereas I am now able to report that</i>
<i>such a connection has been established...</i>

1524
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:55,614
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1525
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,657
<i>This man has been observed</i>
<i>to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1526
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:02,093
<i>on the nights of July 9th,</i>
<i>10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1527
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:06,561
<i>We have succeeded in</i>
<i>identifying him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1528
01:32:06,667 --> 01:32:09,158
<i>former medical student,</i>
<i>age of 28...</i>

1529
01:32:09,236 --> 01:32:11,500
<i>residing at</i>
<i>Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1530
01:32:11,572 --> 01:32:14,473
<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1531
01:32:15,009 --> 01:32:18,467
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements</i>
<i>on the night of the crime...</i>

1532
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:21,344
<i>and have found that</i>
<i>they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1533
01:32:21,782 --> 01:32:25,013
<i>I am preparing a more detailed report</i>
<i>for your consideration.</i>

1534
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:28,782
<i>It is my belief that we already have</i>
<i>sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1535
01:32:28,856 --> 01:32:31,916
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson</i>
<i>to justify police action.</i>

1536
01:32:32,193 --> 01:32:35,185
<i>I strongly urge that this whole matter</i>
<i>be turned over to the office...</i>

1537
01:32:35,262 --> 01:32:37,196
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1538
01:32:37,264 --> 01:32:39,357
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1539
01:33:15,536 --> 01:33:19,267
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1540
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,733
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1541
01:33:23,344 --> 01:33:24,743
How's 11:00?

1542
01:33:25,913 --> 01:33:27,710
Don't worry about Keyes.

1543
01:33:27,781 --> 01:33:30,750
Just leave the front door unlocked
and put the lights out.

1544
01:33:30,818 --> 01:33:33,753
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1545
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:38,314
It's just for the neighbors.
I told you not to worry about Keyes.

1546
01:33:39,393 --> 01:33:42,294
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1547
01:33:44,098 --> 01:33:45,588
Goodbye, baby.

1548
01:33:49,536 --> 01:33:51,265
<i>I guess I don't have to</i>
<i>tell you...</i>

1549
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:54,000
<i>what I intended to do</i>
<i>at 11.00, Keyes.</i>

1550
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:57,635
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to get</i>
<i>clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1551
01:33:57,711 --> 01:34:00,544
<i>and of Phyllis, too,</i>
<i>all at the same time.</i>

1552
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:03,008
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1553
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:07,018
<i>What I didn't know was that</i>
<i>she had plans of her own.</i>

1554
01:35:06,513 --> 01:35:08,105
In here, Walter.

1555
01:35:22,963 --> 01:35:24,362
Hello, baby.

1556
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,296
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody. Why?

1557
01:35:30,838 --> 01:35:33,739
- What's that music?
- A radio up the street.

1558
01:35:42,249 --> 01:35:45,184
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1559
01:35:45,252 --> 01:35:48,085
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1560
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,980
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1561
01:35:52,059 --> 01:35:53,959
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1562
01:35:54,028 --> 01:35:55,893
And what are you
thinking about now?

1563
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:58,261
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1564
01:35:58,465 --> 01:36:00,729
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

1565
01:36:00,968 --> 01:36:04,961
- Where are you going? - You're
the one that's going, baby. Not me.

1566
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:07,833
I'm getting off the trolley car
right at this corner.

1567
01:36:07,908 --> 01:36:10,399
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1568
01:36:10,477 --> 01:36:13,913
All right, I'll tell you.
A friend of mine's got a funny theory.

1569
01:36:14,314 --> 01:36:17,283
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1570
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:19,979
on a trolley car together.
One can't get off without the other.

1571
01:36:20,054 --> 01:36:22,352
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1572
01:36:22,423 --> 01:36:24,721
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1573
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:27,090
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1574
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:30,324
- Maybe he's got something there.
- You bet he has.

1575
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:33,161
Two people are gonna ride
to the end of the line, all right.

1576
01:36:33,233 --> 01:36:37,670
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1577
01:36:37,738 --> 01:36:41,196
- Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours.

1578
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:42,606
A Mr. Zachetti.

1579
01:36:42,676 --> 01:36:44,473
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1580
01:36:44,545 --> 01:36:47,173
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1581
01:36:47,247 --> 01:36:48,271
I was a sucker.

1582
01:36:48,348 --> 01:36:51,112
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1583
01:36:51,185 --> 01:36:53,847
- Nobody wanted to brush you off.
- Save it. I'm telling this.

1584
01:36:54,288 --> 01:36:56,347
It's been you and that
Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?

1585
01:36:56,423 --> 01:36:58,015
That's not true.

1586
01:36:58,092 --> 01:37:01,220
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1587
01:37:02,496 --> 01:37:05,988
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1588
01:37:06,066 --> 01:37:09,126
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1589
01:37:09,203 --> 01:37:12,570
- What's happening to me all this time?
- Don't be silly, baby.

1590
01:37:17,845 --> 01:37:22,009
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1591
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,379
That's what Keyes thinks.

1592
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:25,714
And what's good enough
for Keyes is good enough for me.

1593
01:37:25,786 --> 01:37:30,120
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1594
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,055
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1595
01:37:32,192 --> 01:37:36,686
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1596
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:41,057
And if it was you, they'd charge that up
to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1597
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:44,832
Sure they would, and that's just
what's gonna happen, baby.

1598
01:37:45,272 --> 01:37:47,763
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1599
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:51,299
With the cops right behind him.
It's all taken care of.

1600
01:37:52,412 --> 01:37:54,676
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1601
01:37:54,748 --> 01:37:58,650
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1602
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:00,186
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1603
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:03,480
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1604
01:38:03,557 --> 01:38:05,889
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1605
01:38:05,959 --> 01:38:07,392
so we can get the money
and be together.

1606
01:38:07,794 --> 01:38:10,922
- That's cute. Say it again. - He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1607
01:38:10,998 --> 01:38:13,057
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1608
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:15,124
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1609
01:38:15,202 --> 01:38:17,397
I kept hammering into him
that she was with another man...

1610
01:38:17,471 --> 01:38:21,874
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1611
01:38:21,942 --> 01:38:24,638
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1612
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:28,772
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1613
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,311
We're both rotten.

1614
01:38:31,418 --> 01:38:33,079
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1615
01:38:33,153 --> 01:38:35,246
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1616
01:38:35,322 --> 01:38:38,849
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1617
01:38:38,926 --> 01:38:41,986
Then somebody else would have come along
to take care of Zachetti for you.

1618
01:38:42,062 --> 01:38:44,758
- That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? - Suppose it is.

1619
01:38:44,831 --> 01:38:48,130
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1620
01:38:48,969 --> 01:38:52,666
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1621
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,895
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1622
01:39:16,129 --> 01:39:17,892
Better try it again.

1623
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:22,999
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1624
01:39:33,513 --> 01:39:36,004
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1625
01:39:45,025 --> 01:39:47,425
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1626
01:39:53,133 --> 01:39:57,092
Don't tell me it's because you've been
in love with me all this time.

1627
01:39:57,170 --> 01:40:00,628
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1628
01:40:00,874 --> 01:40:04,105
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1629
01:40:04,177 --> 01:40:06,611
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1630
01:40:07,781 --> 01:40:09,510
until a minute ago...

1631
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:13,279
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1632
01:40:14,888 --> 01:40:17,618
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1633
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:21,185
- Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
- I'm not asking you to buy.

1634
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:22,990
Just hold me close.

1635
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:30,926
Goodbye, baby.

1636
01:41:25,559 --> 01:41:26,821
Zachetti.

1637
01:41:28,995 --> 01:41:30,326
Come here.

1638
01:41:36,203 --> 01:41:37,864
I said, come here.

1639
01:41:40,607 --> 01:41:43,633
- My name is Neff.
- Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1640
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:45,337
What do you want?

1641
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:46,709
Look, kid.

1642
01:41:47,881 --> 01:41:51,146
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1643
01:41:51,318 --> 01:41:53,377
- What's the gag?
- Suppose you go on back down the hill...

1644
01:41:53,453 --> 01:41:55,045
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1645
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:57,215
Keep your nickel and buy yourself
an ice-cream cone.

1646
01:41:57,290 --> 01:41:59,053
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1647
01:41:59,126 --> 01:42:01,686
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1648
01:42:01,762 --> 01:42:02,854
She isn't worth a nickel.

1649
01:42:02,929 --> 01:42:05,420
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1650
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:06,523
Tough, aren't you?

1651
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,625
Here, take the nickel
and call her. She wants you to.

1652
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:10,465
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1653
01:42:10,737 --> 01:42:13,297
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1654
01:42:13,373 --> 01:42:15,898
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1655
01:42:15,976 --> 01:42:18,206
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1656
01:42:18,278 --> 01:42:21,543
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1657
01:42:22,215 --> 01:42:23,807
Go on. That way.

1658
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,221
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1659
01:42:37,597 --> 01:42:38,655
It's cold.

1660
01:42:40,734 --> 01:42:44,329
I wonder if she's still lying alone
up there in that house...

1661
01:42:44,404 --> 01:42:46,531
or if they've found her
by now.

1662
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:51,507
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1663
01:42:55,782 --> 01:42:58,774
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1664
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:04,590
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1665
01:43:06,259 --> 01:43:09,956
And I want you to take care of her
and that guy Zachetti...

1666
01:43:14,568 --> 01:43:17,366
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1667
01:43:19,339 --> 01:43:20,806
Hello, Keyes.

1668
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,877
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1669
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:37,654
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1670
01:43:38,391 --> 01:43:41,554
Or did that little man of yours
pull you out of bed?

1671
01:43:41,628 --> 01:43:43,220
The janitor did.

1672
01:43:44,064 --> 01:43:46,692
Seems you leaked a little blood
on the way in here.

1673
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:47,858
Yeah.

1674
01:43:48,335 --> 01:43:50,200
Wouldn't be surprised.

1675
01:43:51,638 --> 01:43:55,199
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1676
01:43:55,575 --> 01:43:56,974
So I gather.

1677
01:43:58,645 --> 01:44:02,012
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1678
01:44:02,082 --> 01:44:05,074
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1679
01:44:05,986 --> 01:44:07,977
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1680
01:44:08,054 --> 01:44:10,488
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1681
01:44:11,124 --> 01:44:13,854
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1682
01:44:15,128 --> 01:44:17,722
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1683
01:44:18,765 --> 01:44:21,700
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1684
01:44:22,903 --> 01:44:24,700
Let's have it, Keyes.

1685
01:44:26,072 --> 01:44:29,269
Walter, you're all washed up.

1686
01:44:31,878 --> 01:44:34,403
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1687
01:44:35,749 --> 01:44:37,876
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1688
01:44:40,086 --> 01:44:42,714
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1689
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:46,452
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1690
01:44:46,526 --> 01:44:49,927
So I can walk into that gas chamber up
at San Quentin on my own power?

1691
01:44:49,996 --> 01:44:51,588
Is that it, Keyes?

1692
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:53,326
Something like that.

1693
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:56,599
- I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1694
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:58,035
Look, Keyes.

1695
01:44:58,405 --> 01:45:00,805
Suppose you went back to bed
and didn't find these cylinders...

1696
01:45:00,874 --> 01:45:03,240
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1697
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:05,904
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1698
01:45:05,979 --> 01:45:08,573
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1699
01:45:08,848 --> 01:45:12,784
- Give me one good reason. - I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1700
01:45:12,852 --> 01:45:16,049
- You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1701
01:45:16,957 --> 01:45:19,858
- I'm going across the border.
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1702
01:45:19,926 --> 01:45:21,484
Good enough to try for.

1703
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:24,997
- You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1704
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:27,189
Just watch me.

1705
01:45:27,634 --> 01:45:29,795
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1706
01:45:30,036 --> 01:45:31,025
So long, Keyes.

1707
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:01,964
Hello...

1708
01:46:02,035 --> 01:46:04,663
send an ambulance to
the Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1709
01:46:06,873 --> 01:46:08,841
Yeah. It's a police job.

1710
01:46:28,662 --> 01:46:31,222
- How you doing, Walter?
- Fine.

1711
01:46:33,466 --> 01:46:36,993
Only somebody moved the elevator
a couple of miles away.

1712
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:39,299
They're on the way.

1713
01:46:43,643 --> 01:46:46,271
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1714
01:46:46,346 --> 01:46:47,836
I'll tell you.

1715
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:51,646
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1716
01:46:51,718 --> 01:46:54,346
He was right across
the desk from you.

1717
01:46:54,554 --> 01:46:56,545
Closer than that, Walter.

1718
01:47:00,694 --> 01:47:02,218
I love you, too.

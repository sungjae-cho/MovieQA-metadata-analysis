1
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,400
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,280
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,320
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,640
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,440
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,080
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,120
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,320
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,200
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,480
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,600
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,640
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,560
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,440
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,080
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,320
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,400
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
Go!

30
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,680
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
See you.

36
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,280
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,520
Pizza time.

38
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
You're late.

39
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,680
Elevator.

41
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,160
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,640
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,240
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

45
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

46
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,920
<i>You're fired.</i>

47
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,200
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

48
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,160
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,520
- Boss.
- Not now.

51
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,280
<i>The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.</i>

52
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,280
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,720
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

54
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,480
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,240
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,640
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

61
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,920
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,640
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,360
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,040
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

71
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

72
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
That's outrageous.

73
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,400
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
Hi.

76
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,440
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
- Right.
- Sorry.

79
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,960
Hey.

80
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,960
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,080
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
To your class.

85
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
My class is over.

86
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,280
See me standing here?

87
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
Then be here.

89
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,280
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,920
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,880
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,240
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,440
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,720
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,960
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,320
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Surprise!

99
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,920
Well, say something.

100
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,280
What's the occasion?

101
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,120
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,640
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

106
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,440
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,200
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I've been busy.

113
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,000
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,040
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,880
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,120
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,000
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,320
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,400
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,840
Thank you.

122
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,840
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

124
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,680
You'd introduce me?

125
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,920
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,040
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,080
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,720
What do you mean?

130
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,240
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,080
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,520
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,960
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,560
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,320
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,360
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,240
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,240
I want this guy dead.

142
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,080
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,640
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,640
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,800
You're family, Pete.

146
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,920
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,400
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
May.

149
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Wait.

151
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

152
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
Did they have a good time?

155
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,160
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,680
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,760
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,280
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, well.

162
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
So?

163
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm a little behind.

164
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,280
Everybody is.

165
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,680
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,560
You need it more than I do.

169
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,160
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

170
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,280
You can take this money from me.

171
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,040
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,600
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,960
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,320
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,560
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

178
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
Now...

180
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,760
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey.

182
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,160
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,520
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,920
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,520
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,760
How about yours?

191
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm fine.

192
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,920
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,200
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
I plan to.

195
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,880
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,160
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,080
Nothing.

199
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Do you want to say something?

200
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,320
I...

201
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
...was...

202
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,320
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,040
You're such a mystery.

204
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,600
Peter.

205
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,400
What?

206
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,840
Happy birthday.

207
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,160
- Therapy.
- No.

209
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
A person, a man.

210
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,200
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,600
What?

213
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,880
Nothing.

214
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,800
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

215
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,040
May be more than that.

216
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,560
More?

217
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
I don't know.

218
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,880
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

220
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,440
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,400
I won't.

222
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,480
Rent.

223
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,360
Can I spend it?

225
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,920
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

226
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,280
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

227
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,760
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,000
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

232
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,200
Hello?

233
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
Rent?

234
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,080
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,040
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,800
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,680
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Who do we have here?

239
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,840
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,720
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

242
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,240
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,520
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

245
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,600
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,000
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,600
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,840
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,160
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,720
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,080
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,600
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.

258
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,240
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.

261
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
Excuse me.

262
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
Is that it?

263
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,240
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,320
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,920
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,880
Go on.

268
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,840
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,600
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,960
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,040
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,600
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

274
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,280
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,280
This is my life's work.

276
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,200
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,080
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,920
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,040
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,600
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,880
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,760
<i>Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?</i>

286
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,200
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,640
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,400
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,920
Well...

290
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
I don't really know.

291
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,560
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,640
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,920
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,120
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,560
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
We both did.

298
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,720
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,440
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,720
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,920
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,320
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,120
<i>Time present and time past</i>

304
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present</i>

305
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
<i>- In time future
- In time future</i>

306
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,640
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,960
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

308
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,520
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,880
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,760
Poetry.

311
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,760
Never fails.

312
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,920
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

313
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

314
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

315
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

316
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,160
Rent!

317
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,640
Where is my money?!

318
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,440
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
You never know who's coming.

320
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,880
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
How'd you do that?

322
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,680
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,880
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,880
Come on. Go.

326
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,040
Keep it steady.

327
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,080
It's a web.

328
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
We got trouble!

330
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,520
Get me down!

331
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,360
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,680
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,920
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,240
Yes.

335
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,160
I mean, no.

336
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,400
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
Whatever.

338
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,360
Shoelace.

339
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,240
You might want to...

340
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,400
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,280
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,520
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,160
I understand.

344
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,360
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,960
But not to come late.

346
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,640
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

347
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,440
Listen, can't you...?

348
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,280
<i>A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man</i>

349
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
<i>A- does whatever a spider can</i>

350
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,360
<i>A- spins a web, any size</i>

351
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>Catches thieves a-just like flies</i>

352
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,040
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

353
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,720
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,200
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,160
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

356
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,000
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

357
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,880
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,400
What are you doing here?

359
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
You hungry?

360
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,440
Starved.

361
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,840
What was that?

362
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,840
Okay.

363
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
How you doing?

364
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,640
Good.

365
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,480
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,320
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.

367
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,480
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...

368
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,280
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,160
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,040
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.

371
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,440
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,200
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,440
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,280
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,040
How about a children's book?
You could...

377
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,920
<i>Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.</i>

378
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,360
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,760
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,200
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,880
Let me give you a card.

382
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,720
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
Yeah.

384
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,480
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,200
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.

387
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,240
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,040
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,400
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,920
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,000
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...

392
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,080
<i>Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.</i>

393
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,080
Hi, M.J.

394
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,520
This is Peter.

395
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,960
<i>I was on my way to your show and...</i>

396
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,520
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

397
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,840
<i>Are you there?</i>

398
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,120
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,840
And...

400
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,440
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,320
Bingo.

402
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,920
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

403
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,520
<i>How complicated a simple thing...</i>

404
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,640
<i>... like being someplace at 8:00
can become.</i>

405
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,040
<i>Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.</i>

406
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,320
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

408
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,600
<i>Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.</i>

409
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,320
Here it is.

411
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,880
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
Weird, huh?

413
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,280
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,880
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,680
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,280
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,040
But first, before we start...

420
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,400
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,120
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
But thank you for coming.

424
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,440
Today...

425
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,960
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,640
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,880
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,360
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,960
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,400
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,680
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,760
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,640
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,120
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,040
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,120
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
How right you are.

439
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,640
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,080
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,440
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,080
And now on to the main event.

443
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,040
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,560
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,720
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,240
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,960
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,760
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,520
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,880
Thank you.

453
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,880
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,000
The power of the sun...

455
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,680
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,880
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,800
It'll soon stabilize!

458
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,720
We have a containment breach!

460
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,360
Otto, please get back!

461
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,040
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,920
It will stabilize! It's under control!

463
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm in charge here!

464
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,800
It's my money! I'm in con...

465
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,200
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,640
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

467
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,240
No!

468
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,920
Rosie!

469
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,480
Watch it.

470
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,840
That was too close.

471
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,880
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,440
I'm ruined.

473
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,400
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,200
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,920
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,560
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,560
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,640
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,840
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,440
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,680
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,720
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,120
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,440
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C 7-T1 to T12.

485
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,920
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,880
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,760
No! No! No!

488
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,960
Help me! Help me!

489
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,440
No!

490
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,640
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

491
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,880
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,760
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,760
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,720
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,040
Hoffman!

496
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,400
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,720
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

498
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,360
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

499
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

500
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,360
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,720
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

502
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,520
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,560
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,320
Get out.

505
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,200
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,480
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,880
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,280
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,880
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,320
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,080
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,760
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,120
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

514
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,600
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,600
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,440
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,480
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,160
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,320
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,080
My dream is dead.

521
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,840
And these...

522
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,120
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,200
...along with me.

524
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,320
Something...

525
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,160
...in my head.

526
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,200
Something talking.

527
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,480
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,240
Gone.

529
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,080
Rebuild.

530
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,960
No.

531
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,480
Peter was right.

532
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,240
I miscalculated.

533
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,520
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,440
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,480
Yes.

536
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,400
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,720
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,320
But we need money.

539
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,320
Steal it?

540
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,160
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,000
That's right.

542
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,920
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,000
We'll do it here.

544
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,840
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,520
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,000
Nothing!

547
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,720
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

548
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,600
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,920
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,000
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,680
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,160
You are?

553
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,120
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,760
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,160
But the fact is...

556
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,480
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,560
Well...

558
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,040
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,040
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,080
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,040
Okay.

562
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,880
Peter?

564
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,520
Don't leave me.

565
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,640
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,320
Hold it!

567
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,600
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,240
Here's your change!

569
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,200
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

571
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,880
Not anymore.

572
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,120
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

573
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,680
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

574
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,120
Wait a second.

575
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,280
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

576
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,240
Easy, now.

577
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,480
Butterfingers.

578
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,480
Look out!

579
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,440
Help me!

580
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,960
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

581
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,800
Hang on!

582
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,640
Help!

583
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,320
Thank you.

584
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,720
Aunt May.

585
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,720
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,800
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,680
Come on.

588
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,560
Shame on you.

589
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,080
There you go.

590
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,240
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,600
We sure showed him.

592
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,480
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,720
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

594
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,680
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,480
Penny! Over here!

596
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,080
Leave it.

597
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,360
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,800
Why? It's a party.

599
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,800
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,160
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,080
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,840
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,360
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

604
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,200
Parker!

605
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,040
Parker!

606
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,480
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,560
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,560
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,200
Beautiful tie.

610
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,560
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,360
Beautiful dress.

612
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,400
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,200
Wife.

614
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,400
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,680
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

617
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,480
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,560
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,520
...Captain John Jameson.

620
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,840
Hi.

621
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,280
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

622
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,600
But there was a disturbance.

623
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know you.

624
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,640
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,080
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,560
Whatever that means.

627
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,400
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

628
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,520
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...</i>

629
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,480
Don't start.

630
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,640
Can I get you a drink?

631
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,440
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,640
John.

633
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,560
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,560
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,120
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,480
Even my father.

637
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,240
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,000
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,240
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,360
After all these years...

641
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,120
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,800
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,120
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,240
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

645
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,120
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,760
You stole M.J. From me.

647
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,960
You stole my father's love.

648
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,400
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,720
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,640
Huh, brother?

651
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,720
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

653
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,240
What a surprise.

654
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,200
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,400
Oh, no. No!

656
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,040
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,400
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,920
It felt right.

659
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,720
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,720
Congratulations.

661
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
Good luck in the world.

662
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,920
John loves me.

663
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,640
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,320
No man will ever want you."

665
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,720
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,000
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,080
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,280
- Very much.
- "Very much"?

669
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,880
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,360
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,360
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,920
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,200
He's all I can think about.

674
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,240
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,280
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,400
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,400
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,240
That's the answer I need.

679
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,120
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,400
You read too many love stories.

681
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,800
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,360
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.

683
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,840
That's all he is.

684
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,360
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,400
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,360
My diagnosis?

687
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,240
It's up here.

688
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,720
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,480
There is one dream where...

690
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,280
...in my dream...

691
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,720
...I'm Spider-Man.

692
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,480
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,440
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,800
In my dream.

695
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,160
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,360
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,240
- What's your major? Theater Arts?
- Science.

698
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,640
Connors?

699
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,320
He flunking you?

700
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,880
He says he might.

701
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,880
There you go.

702
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,040
What about this friend?

703
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,920
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,160
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,400
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,240
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,920
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,000
Identity. Big one.

709
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,360
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
What does he tell you?

711
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,480
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,080
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,720
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...

714
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,560
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,080
Listen...

716
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:25,360
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,400
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,600
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,400
I have a choice.

720
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,000
<i>All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...</i>

721
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,440
<i>... make me sad.</i>

722
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,720
Can't you understand?

723
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,520
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,520
You know I understand.

725
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,120
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,360
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,280
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,320
...fairness, justice...

729
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,160
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,080
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,600
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,480
I want a life of my own.

733
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,680
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,080
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,080
Take my hand, son.

736
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,360
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,520
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,880
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,240
...no more.

740
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,640
No more.

741
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,960
No more.

742
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,520
- You punk!
- Sorry.

743
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,840
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

744
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,160
Hurry up!

745
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,120
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

746
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,040
Someone, please?

747
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,200
.23 electron volts.

748
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,040
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,880
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

751
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,920
...in a very inexcusable manner.

752
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,160
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

753
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,400
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

754
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,240
That would be hypocrisy.

755
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,520
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

756
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,520
"I am glad."

757
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,200
"I am glad."

758
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,200
"I am glad."

759
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,080
Are you glad to hear it?

760
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,440
I am glad...

761
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,960
...to hear it.

762
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,760
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

763
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,440
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

764
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,160
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

765
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,240
You could've told me
you were coming.

766
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,680
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

767
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,840
You look different.

768
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,280
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

769
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,240
I do my homework now.

770
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,040
You wanna get some chow mein?

771
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,560
Peter...

772
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,480
...I'm getting married.

773
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,920
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

774
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,880
And who's the groom?

775
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,840
You hadn't decided yet.

776
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,160
You think just because
you saw my play...

777
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,640
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

778
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,960
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

779
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,480
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

780
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,440
You're too late.

781
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,800
Will you think about it?

782
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,240
Think about what?

783
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,320
Picking up where we left off.

784
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,760
Where was that?

785
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,320
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

786
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,840
I don't think it's that simple.

787
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,160
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

788
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,880
You don't understand.

789
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,720
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

790
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,600
I'm different.

791
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,080
Punch me, I bleed.

792
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,520
I have to go.

793
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,440
I'm getting married in a church.

794
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,360
You are different.

795
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,720
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

796
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,840
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

797
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,920
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

798
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,120
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

799
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,840
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

800
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,040
Where the hell did you get that?

801
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,640
In the garbage.

802
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,200
In the garbage?

803
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,720
He must've given up.

804
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,640
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

805
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,440
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

806
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

807
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,360
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

808
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,440
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

809
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,120
Your wife is still on that line.

810
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,160
Flowers? How much?

811
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,840
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

812
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,200
Get plastic.

813
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,840
Gotta go, big story.

814
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,600
<i>Spider-Man
Spider-Man</i>

815
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,640
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

816
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,080
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

817
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,800
Come on, man. Get the money.

818
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,160
Come on, come on.

819
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,880
Help!

820
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,840
Come on!

821
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,280
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

822
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,520
He was a peaceful man.

823
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,600
And it was all my doing.

824
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,400
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

825
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,520
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

826
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,920
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

827
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,160
...and he wanted to drive you.

828
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,920
If only I had stopped him.

829
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,400
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

830
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,000
I'm responsible.

831
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,960
For what?

832
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,000
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

833
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,360
But you were at the library.

834
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,400
You were doing your homework.

835
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,560
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

836
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,920
What do you mean?

837
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,240
I went someplace else.

838
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,280
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

839
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,080
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

840
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,080
...to impress Mary Jane.

841
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,080
It happened so fast.

842
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,920
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

843
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,720
The thief...

844
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,560
...was running towards me.

845
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,800
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

846
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,960
...revenge.

847
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,360
I let him go.

848
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,000
I let him get away.

849
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,320
He wanted a car.

850
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,680
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

851
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,000
Uncle Ben said no...

852
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,480
...and then he shot him.

853
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,480
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

854
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,000
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

855
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,280
And I...

856
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,520
I held his hand...

857
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,640
...when he died.

858
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,760
I've tried to tell you so many times.

859
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,000
Just one more little chore.

860
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,680
Where are you?

861
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,480
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

862
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,240
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

863
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,960
Good night, Bernard.

864
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,320
Hello, Harry.

865
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,640
Otto. What do you want?

866
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,720
That precious tritium.

867
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,160
But I need more of it this time.

868
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,680
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

869
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,360
Hey! Hey!

870
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,400
Stop! Stop! All right!

871
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,440
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

872
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,000
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

873
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,560
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

874
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,920
How do I find him?

875
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,760
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

876
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,120
<i>He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.</i>

877
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,680
Make him tell you where he is.

878
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,480
Have it ready.

879
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,680
Don't hurt Peter!

880
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,720
Somebody, help!

881
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,120
Fire!

882
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,840
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

883
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,680
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

884
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,640
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

885
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,280
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

886
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,120
Hey, where you going?!

887
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,800
I'm coming!

888
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,080
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

889
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,560
Come on. Come on.

890
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,240
Mama.

891
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,240
You got some guts, kid.

892
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,840
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

893
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,520
Oh, man.

894
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,600
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

895
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,480
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

896
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,840
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

897
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,200
What I need?

898
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,800
What am I supposed to do?

899
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,760
I shouldn't have without...

900
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,480
...knocking.

901
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,400
Come in.

902
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

903
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,760
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

904
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,040
Okay.

905
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,400
And a glass of milk?

906
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,560
That would be nice.

907
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,640
Okay.

908
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,760
Thank you.

909
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,840
You got a message.

910
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,360
It's your aunt.

911
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,240
Thanks.

912
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,800
What's going on?

913
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,600
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

914
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,280
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

915
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,840
Why didn't you tell me?

916
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,200
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

917
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,600
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

918
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,200
...and I'm giving him $5.

919
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,880
That's Henry Jackson?

920
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,560
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

921
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,160
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

922
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,880
Listen, about my last visit...

923
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,320
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

924
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,840
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

925
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,840
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

926
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,840
And I'm proud of you.

927
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,160
And I thank you, and I...

928
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,640
I love you, Peter.

929
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,240
So very, very much.

930
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,760
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

931
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,680
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

932
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,760
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

933
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,440
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

934
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,880
You're getting tall.

935
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,960
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

936
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,040
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

937
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,240
I used to.

938
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,560
Where is he?

939
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:13,840
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

940
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,160
He...

941
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,520
...quit.
- Why?

942
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,200
Wanted to try other things.

943
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,880
He'll be back, right?

944
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,360
I don't know.

945
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,600
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

946
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,680
Spider-Man.

947
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,600
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

948
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,320
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

949
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
...saving old girls like me.

950
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,240
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

951
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,160
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

952
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,560
...setting examples for all of us.

953
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,320
Everybody loves a hero.

954
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,920
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

955
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,040
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

956
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,840
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

957
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,320
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

958
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,720
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

959
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,240
...that keeps us honest...

960
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,440
...gives us strength...

961
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,560
...makes us noble...

962
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,000
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

963
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:30,120
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

964
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,920
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

965
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,440
Even our dreams.

966
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,880
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

967
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,400
...and he wonders where he's gone.

968
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,320
He needs him.

969
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,080
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

970
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,600
But don't strain yourself.

971
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,320
Okay.

972
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,440
Strong focus on what I want.

973
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,760
I'm back!

974
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,200
I'm back!

975
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,440
My back.

976
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,640
My back.

977
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,960
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

978
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,680
Peter Parker?

979
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,960
Positive.

980
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,360
Thought he was your pal.

981
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,920
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

982
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,280
He's just a great big jerk.

983
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,360
The world's full of great big jerks.

984
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,480
You're adorable.

985
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,400
It's just the uniform.

986
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,560
Lean your head back for me.

987
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,200
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

988
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,760
Just put my head back?

989
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,000
Okay.

990
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,720
Wow.

991
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,160
I'm back on the moon.

992
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,040
You up there with me?

993
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,080
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

994
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,680
Very.

995
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,320
Thanks for coming.

996
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,520
Everything okay?

997
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,120
You might say so.

998
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,040
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

999
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,920
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1000
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,080
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

1001
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,120
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1002
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,720
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1003
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,440
I was afraid to trust you.

1004
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,960
But I've been thinking about it...

1005
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,640
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1006
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:51,200
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

1007
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,880
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1008
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,280
I'm saying...

1009
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,080
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1010
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,000
...but I can't.

1011
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,400
My mind was playing tricks too.

1012
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,400
Do you love me, or not?

1013
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,720
I...

1014
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,080
...don't.

1015
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,600
You don't.

1016
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,920
Kiss me.

1017
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,480
Kiss you?

1018
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,440
I need to know something.

1019
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,400
Just one kiss.

1020
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,680
What's happening?

1021
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,080
Peter Parker...

1022
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,640
...and the girlfriend.

1023
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,680
What do you want?

1024
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,480
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1025
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,200
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1026
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,440
I don't know where he is.

1027
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,400
Find him.

1028
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,320
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1029
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,400
If you lay one finger on her...

1030
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,840
You'll do what?

1031
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,120
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiance.

1032
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,840
Sorry, Jonah.

1033
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,280
It's all my fault.

1034
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,240
I drove Spider-Man away.

1035
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,520
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1036
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,160
Yes.

1037
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,920
Spider-Man was a hero.

1038
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,960
I just couldn't see it.

1039
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,880
He was a...

1040
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,640
A thief! A criminal!

1041
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,320
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1042
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,360
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1043
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,600
I want him strung up by his web!

1044
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,560
I want Spider-Man!

1045
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,160
Where is she?

1046
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,800
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1047
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,120
What the hell?

1048
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,160
You have a train to catch.

1049
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,400
Help!

1050
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,760
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1051
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,200
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

1052
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,680
Tell everyone to hang on!

1053
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,640
Brace yourselves!

1054
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,200
Any more bright ideas?

1055
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,800
I got a few, yeah!

1056
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,000
Whoa, watch out!

1057
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,600
We're slowing down.

1058
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,880
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1059
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,240
Slower. Gently.

1060
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,560
Is he alive?

1061
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,360
He's...

1062
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,040
...just a kid.

1063
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,960
No older than my son.

1064
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,240
It's all right.

1065
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,200
We found something.

1066
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:16,200
We won't tell nobody.

1067
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,720
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1068
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,480
He's mine!

1069
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,880
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1070
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,480
And me.

1071
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,360
Me too.

1072
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,600
Very well.

1073
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,280
Where do you want him?

1074
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,200
And the tritium?

1075
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,560
Yes.

1076
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,360
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1077
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,320
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1078
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,840
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1079
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,960
Pete.

1080
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,960
No.

1081
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,880
It can't be.

1082
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,440
Harry.

1083
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,200
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1084
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,280
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1085
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,240
Tritium?

1086
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,080
He's making the machine again.

1087
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,920
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1088
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,760
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

1089
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,640
...you killed my father.

1090
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,520
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1091
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,880
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1092
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,680
Hey!

1093
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,320
Hey!

1094
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:50,360
I'm talking to you!

1095
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:54,040
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1096
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,000
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1097
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,600
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1098
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,920
He's not dead.

1099
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,720
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1100
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,000
Surprise.

1101
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,840
As soon as you get free...

1102
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,720
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1103
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,840
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1104
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,280
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1105
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,160
Well, I'm not.

1106
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,520
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1107
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,000
Run!

1108
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,800
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1109
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,800
Now what?

1110
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,720
Dr. Octavius.

1111
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,960
We have to shut it down.

1112
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,280
Please tell me how.

1113
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,840
Peter Parker?

1114
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,200
"Brilliant but lazy."

1115
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,880
Look at what's happening.

1116
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,680
We must destroy it.

1117
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,560
I can't destroy it.

1118
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,920
I won't.

1119
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,280
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1120
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:36,680
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1121
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,680
A privilege.

1122
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,240
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1123
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,040
Don't listen to them.

1124
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,160
It was my dream.

1125
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:57,640
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1126
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,200
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1127
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,600
Even our dreams.

1128
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,960
You're right.

1129
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,840
He's right.

1130
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,040
Listen.

1131
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,320
Listen to me now.

1132
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:31,320
Listen to me now.

1133
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,760
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1134
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,400
It can't be stopped.

1135
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,760
It's self-sustaining now.

1136
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,920
- Think!
- Unless...

1137
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,080
The river.

1138
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,920
Drown it.

1139
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,120
I'll do it.

1140
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,160
No!

1141
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,240
Hi.

1142
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,440
Hi.

1143
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,520
This is really heavy.

1144
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,080
M.J.

1145
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,600
In case we die...

1146
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,280
You do love me.

1147
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,000
I do.

1148
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,920
Even though you said you didn't.

1149
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,120
I will not die a monster.

1150
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,720
I think I always knew...

1151
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,320
...all this time...

1152
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,160
...who you really were.

1153
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,200
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1154
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,200
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1155
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,560
I can't let you take that risk.

1156
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,360
I will...

1157
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,160
...always be Spider-Man.

1158
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:14,160
You and I can never be.

1159
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,400
Mary Jane!

1160
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,520
Hello?

1161
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,160
Who's that?

1162
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,160
Son.

1163
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,680
I'm here.

1164
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,360
Dad?

1165
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,480
- I thought you were...
- No.

1166
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:33,960
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1167
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,440
Now it's your turn.

1168
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,520
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1169
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,480
Now make him pay.

1170
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,360
But Pete's my best friend.

1171
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,040
And I'm your father.

1172
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,360
You're weak.

1173
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:52,480
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1174
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,240
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1175
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:58,560
Be strong, Harry.

1176
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,880
Avenge me.

1177
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,520
- Avenge me!
- No!

1178
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:25,640
Call Deborah.

1179
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,560
The caterer?

1180
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,520
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1181
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,280
Had to do what I had to do.

1182
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:15,160
Mary Jane.

1183
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,480
Peter.

1184
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,040
I can't survive without you.

1185
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,360
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:36,360
I know you think we can't be together.

1187
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:40,960
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1188
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:43,840
I know there'll be risks.

1189
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:47,200
But I want to face them with you.

1190
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:51,560
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1191
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,400
...half of ourselves.

1192
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,320
I love you.

1193
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,320
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1194
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,960
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:17,120
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1196
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,560
Well, say something.

1197
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,360
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1198
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,600
Go get them, tiger.

not so very special day,

1744
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,500
I went to my typewriter,

1745
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,800
I sat down...

1746
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,800
and I wrote our story.

1747
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,700
A story about a time,

1748
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:51,000
a story about a place,

1749
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,300
a story about the people.

1750
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:57,100
But above all things,

1751
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:00,600
a story about love.

1752
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,700
A love...

1753
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,700
that will live...

1754
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,700
forever.

1755
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,400
The...

1756
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,400
end.

1757
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:22,200
[Christian]
The greatest thing

1758
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:28,500
You'll ever learn

1759
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:34,200
Is just to love

1760
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:38,800
And be loved

1761
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:46,500
In return

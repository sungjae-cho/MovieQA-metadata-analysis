00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000


2
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,871
What are you doing?
Going behind my back,

3
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,071
Telling people i'm screwing up this operation?

4
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:35,588
I got you a suite at The fucking Plaza Hotel.
- The shittiest suite..

5
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,788
What?
-..The shittiest fucking suite.

6
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:37,988
Based on what?
- The food is wrong...

7
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:42,029
And, What is this?
- You got like one of my closet or something.

8
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,279
No.
- Are you dressing him, like you're dressing me?

9
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,243
<i>No, what are you thinking?
This is not about you...</i>

10
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:48,152
Are you trying to dress me so that,
I look like him?

11
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,792
<i>No, you're not dressed like him.
- I do look..I look like him. - No.</i>

12
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:53,410
He's in like velvet...
- You asked me to show you, how this is done.

13
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,722
You wanna fuck it up, be my guest.
- Look, i never laid a hand on her, Alright?

14
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:57,922
Is that what, this is about?

15
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,908
<i>Technically, that's not true.</i>

16
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,761
Look, we never had sex okay?
I just wouldn't do...

17
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:05,743
What will I do...
I put my hand like this...

18
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,852
Don't you fucking touch me.

19
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,051
That, bothers me.

20
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:11,819
Oh, it does?
- Oh, yeah.

21
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,021
That bothers you?
- Yes.

22
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,619
You know, a lot of shit bothers me too.

23
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,566
But, i was just trying to help you.
If I wanted to bother you.

24
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,642
If I really wanted to fucking bother you?

25
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:20,472
This is what I'd do.

26
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,926
If I try to bother..
that's what i would do.

27
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,767
You shouldn't have done that.

28
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,598
How's that, you bothered now?

29
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,006
Alright, don't make a thing of it.

30
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,888
You shouldn't have touched him.
He doesn't like that.

31
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:39,405
<i>Oh, my God! Fix his hair..Jesus Christ!
- ..it takes some time, okay. It's not like just..</i>

32
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,977
We gotta get in the other room.
Come on.

33
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:46,346
The Mayor is in there.
- Yes, I know that.

34
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,074
So, you go to the beauty parlour?
Is that what you do?

35
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,196
How does it look?

36
00:03:58,396 --> 00:03:59,740
Fine.

37
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,947
Let's go.

38
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:33,246


39
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:38,503


40
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,603
<i>This is face to face..
person to person...</i>

41
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,274
<i>This is why..call me old fashion, but...</i>

42
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:08,357
Hey, what?
Excuse me, excuse me.

43
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,071
I'll handle that for The Mayor.

44
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,251
Well, th..it's for The Mayor.

45
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:17,336
It'd be a sign of disrespect to the Sheikh
If The Mayor didn't take it.

46
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:18,537
This is for you Mayor.

47
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,117
What're doing?
Carl...what the fuck? What is this?

48
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:24,076
I'll take care of it. Everything's good.
I got everything under control.

49
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:25,515
Whoa..whoa! Hey...hey.

50
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,467
What is this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

51
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,967
I don't know you.

52
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:33,695
I don't know what the fuck, that is.
But, it's weird. You understand?

53
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,460
A misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding.

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,316
Look, I came here to meet a Sheikh.
That's all i know.

55
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,345
I'm very interested in that.
He's not here, apparently.

56
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,738
I'm very interested in meeting The Sheikh.

57
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:47,024
You let me know, when I get that.

58
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,207
Thank you, have a good day!

59
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:50,865
Richie,

60
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,611
you better go and get him.

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,606
Go out there and get him right now.

62
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,249
I don't wanna do this in the first place.
This is your show...

63
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,482
..you go get him.
- Look, you have no choice.

64
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,248
You have to go get him.
Now, go get him.

65
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,400
So, he takes the briefcase by himself.

66
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:07,601
That's the whole plan, Irving.

67
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,503
What were you doing,
pushing the fucking briefcase, dummy?

68
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,003
Huh?

69
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:17,036
You know, how much this fucking cost?
With this goddamn hotel, that you fucking asked for.

70
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:20,121
Now, I gotta go..mop up your mess.
I'm gonna go fucking mop up..

71
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,321
...your mess!

72
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,516
Do you understand that he had..
it was working until..

73
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,592
he was upset about the Sheikh.

74
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,077
Did you ever had to find a way,
to survive?

75
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,072
And you know, your choices were bad.

76
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,273
I learned how to survive..

77
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,350
When I was a kid.

78
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,779
My father, had a glass business.

79
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,716
I would rather be on the taking side;
Then, the getting taken side,

80
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:55,629
any day of the week.
Specially, after I saw my father get taken.

81
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:59,358
I mean, seeing that.
Scarred me for life.

82
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,751
I took it upon myself to..
drum up business.

83
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,252
I became a different kinda then my father.

84
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,363
I became a Con artist.
For real.

85
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,800
From the feet up.

86
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,391
I was gonna survive...

87
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,477
..no matter what.

88
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,864
I still had the glass business.

89
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,365
And, a few dry cleaning stores also.

90
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,864
And i did, some art dealing on the side.

91
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,368
Stolen or forged art.

92
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:31,386
I'm your host..enjoy. Enjoy!

93
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:35,216
So, I go to this pool party and wham.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,260
Meet my friends.

95
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,498
Is that Duke Ellington,
on your bracelet?

96
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:07,480
Yeah, as a matter of fact..it is.
He died this year, you know?

97
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,155
I know.
I doubt anyone else here,

98
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,354
knows or cares about it.

99
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,140
Well, i care about it.
He saved my life many times.

100
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,646
Mine too. Which one?

101
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,776
Jeep's Blues.-: D

102
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:22,977
Jeep's Blues?

103
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,226
mmhmm.
Jeep's Blues.

104
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,677
You wanna hear it?
- Right now?

105
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,627
Yeah.
- Sure.

106
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,110
Who starts a song like that?!

107
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:58,650
It's magic.

108
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,774
Magic.

109
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:09,065
He wasn't necessary in good shape..

110
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,900
..and he has this calm over.
That was rather, elaborate.

111
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:16,953
He had this air about him.

112
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:20,658
And, he had this confidence
that drew me to him.

113
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:23,408
He was, who he was.

114
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,560
He didn't care.

115
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,945
I mean, she was a very particular person.

116
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:40,312
Like me, she come from a place
where her options were limited.

117
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:51,006
It actually can feel kind of sexy, sometimes.

118
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,949
There was a boldness in it.

119
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:58,779
But, where would that boldness take me?

120
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,110
I didn't know.

121
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,907
But, I was gonna find out.

122
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:11,204
Like me, she learned to survive
and reinvent herself.

123
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:14,991
She knew she had to reinvent her life
and her identity.

124
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:16,989
Like me, she envisioned a better..

125
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,435
..elegant future for herself.

126
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:23,001
Like me, she knew she had to have a vision.

127
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,327
She came to New York;

128
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,390
She visioned it.
And, just like that...

129
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:31,698
She applied for a job.
At the Cosmopolitan Megazine.

130
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,900
You're obviously here for a reason,
let's get to it.

131
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:36,762
Our cover story right now
is on Cunnilingus.

132
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,963
What do you think about that?

133
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,011
I like it.

134
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:44,481
Do you have any clerical skills?
Can you type?

135
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,994
She loved the world.
But, she was stuck in this clerical..

136
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:49,494
..job that she was too smart for it.

137
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,702
She was a smart girl.
I never met anygirl like it.

138
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,356
She knew her stuff.

139
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,626
I was broke...

140
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,209
fearless.

141
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:09,272
Got nothing to loose.
And my dream, more than anything..

142
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:14,906
was to become anyone else;
other than who I was.

143
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,522
He had a chain of Dry cleaning stores.

144
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,975
I got two in the Bronx...
and uh..three in Manhattan.

145
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:31,175
Hey, Byron.

146
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,757
How're you doing?
This is Sydney.

147
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,257
He asked me, If I wanted
to come in and upgrade my wardrobe.

148
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,756
He said he had a lot of nice things.

149
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:41,460
That got left behind by people
then forgot over the years.

150
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,146
Hey, you wouldn't believe the shit
that people leave behind here.

151
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:47,434
They're unbelievable.
- People leave stuff here?

152
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,254
Oh, yeah.
They got out for the night.

153
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:50,456
You know, they drink.

154
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,849
Come in the morning..

155
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,974
put their clothes in and they forget.

156
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,569
Is that nice or not?

157
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,757
Some of these almost had been for years.

158
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:04,507
They are not picking it up.
Someone's to pick it up.

159
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,989
Sydney, it's yours.

160
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,189
You want it..it's yours.

161
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,137
Whooo, I like it.

162
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:19,448
You look fantastic!

163
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,713
My God! I can only dream about it.
These dresses are beautiful.

164
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,790
This. No, it's beautiful.

165
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,290
Put it on, come on.

166
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,106
Look at that, Please?

167
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,810
Really?

168
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,570
I felt like we had a secret.

169
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,769
Just the two of us.

170
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,719
You know, like that thing..
when you just wanna be with..

171
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:52,918
the one person all the time.
And..

172
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:58,233
You feel like just the two of you
understand that nobody else gets.

173
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,779
I could just..

174
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,767
tell her everything about myself.

175
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:13,856
And, I never had anybody like that,
in my life before.

176
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:17,630
It felt like, finally...
I can truly be myself.

177
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:22,351
Without being ashamed..
without being embaressed.

178
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,539
What is this place?

179
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,739
Do you sell lies here?

180
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,380
Yeah, sometimes. It's my office.

181
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,993
I know it's your office.
But..

182
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,991
.. you have all these other places.
So, what's this for?

183
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:38,767
Why did you bring me here?

184
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,764
This is getting to be my uh..
my main business.

185
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,441
My going business.

186
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:49,018
I hold that loans to guys who can't get loans.

187
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:50,218
You know, like their last resort.

188
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,418
You're their last resort.

189
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,870
Since, interest rates are north
to 12% and heading to 18%.

190
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,104
That's nice smarty pants.

191
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,122
Fucking Jimmy Carter.

192
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,832
Fucking Nixon really.

193
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,709
The war and the defecit..
and all that shit..

194
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,909
I fucking love it,
you're so smart.

195
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:07,284
You are.

196
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,575
Thanks Kid. But, how do you
get them the money?

197
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,964
Well...
- You don't..do you?

198
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:20,220
You don't.

199
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,282
Thes..these guys are lousy risks.
You know?

200
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,561
I can't get them the loan.
But, i get my fee..five thousand.

201
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,187
Five thousand?

202
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,409
You take five thousand,
and you don't get them anything.

203
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,503
These are bad guys, you know?
They get pair of divorces, gambling habits..

204
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,902
embezzling..and all that shit.

205
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,177
Everybody at the bottom
crosses path eventually; In a..

206
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:45,333
pool of desperation and..

207
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,670
..you are waiting for them.

208
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,326
How about we?

209
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:54,879
We?
- mmhmm.

210
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,078
How about it?

211
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:04,551
Sydney? Sydney, I'm sorry.
That was too much, i went too far.

212
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,479
I didn't wanna upset you,
Sydney please, i'm sorry!

213
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,287
I know it ain't for everybody.

214
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,797
Oh, God! I love getting to know you!

215
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:14,984
Alright..why did you have to tell the truth?

216
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:16,781
Telling the truth?

217
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,355
Why did you do that for?
Why did you do that for?

218
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,471
I should've never tell the woman the truth.

219
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:31,671
But, she's so smart.
She is terrific.

220
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,577
She is terrific.

221
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,268
God!

222
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,280
You said, it was nice knowing me.

223
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,980
You said, it was nice to meet me.

224
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:50,864
- Yeah.

225
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,664
Would you like..to meet.

226
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:58,343
Lady Edith Greensley.

227
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,053
I have royal banking connections..

228
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,062
in London.

229
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:08,009
I'd love to help you with loans.
But, of course i have to be very...

230
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,717
Selective.

231
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:16,460
That was fucking fantastic.

232
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:20,076
Thank you. Did you like it?
- I liked it.

233
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,276
Thank you for coming back.

234
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,232
Thank God you came back.
- I wasn't going anywhere.

235
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:28,253
I fucking love you.
- You have me.

236
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,365
And, so...Irving and I began our partnership.

237
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:32,717
In love and commerce.

238
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:33,918
Rebecca..

239
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,117
hold on.

240
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:36,318
You're Edith right?
- He told me to tell my friends..

241
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,201
I had London Banking connections.

242
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,481
She told me, you'd get me a line of credit.

243
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,455
I know you have banking connections
in London, England.

244
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:44,655
And, after that say 'No'.

245
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:45,855
A lot.

246
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:52,050
Until, the guy is hook.
- listen, tell her. I've never missed a check.

247
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:56,116
It was almost scary,
how easy it is to take money from..

248
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,317
Desperate people.

249
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,905
Lady Edith Greensley.

250
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,405
It's so good to see you, Ken.
- Lady..Your Ladyship..

251
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:04,506
Thank you, again.
- These are the roles...

252
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,305
..that we were meant to play.
- We are very selective.

253
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,959
Without strong application.
We talked about it.

254
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,159
I don't take a deal..

255
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,949
that i can't close.
- You're not being aggressive enough.

256
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,449
If you've ever been to great nick.

257
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,801
<i>Everybody knows my dealership.
- Five thousand gets me fifty, right?</i>

258
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:25,013
Five grands get me fifty?

259
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,710
I was doing so much more business with her.
We doubled..we tripled!

260
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:33,952
I've never met anyone,
Men or Women;

261
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,452
In business.
Who's so careful and precise about..

262
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,952
... everything!
Every stylishtic details.

263
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,153
Congratulations!
- We kept selling art together too.

264
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,392
Its 'A Boy and His Dog'.
It's a non-religious painting.

265
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,524
Before we go any further.
Is this legit?

266
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,012
Ah, let's just say..
you know it's missing from Spain.

267
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,212
Let's leave at that.

268
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,155
Don't show it to any Spanish friends.

269
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:07,491
I mean, it just took off!

270
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:08,690
We got a better office.

271
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:09,890
We called it, London Associates.

272
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,158
When I was around her,
I felt 'joy'.

273
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,359
Fucking Joy!

274
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,559
And, love.

275
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,450
That's what i felt.

276
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,233
As..as far as I can see.

277
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,199
People are always conning each other.
To get what they wanted.

278
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,755
We even 'Con' ourselves.

279
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:51,255
We talk ourselves into things, you know.
We sell ourselves things..

280
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,755
whether we do need or want.

281
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:56,254
You know, we are dressing 'em up.

282
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:59,035
We leave out the risk.
We leave out the ugly truth.

283
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,045
Pay attention to that.

284
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,609
Cos, we are always conning ourselves
in one way or another.

285
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,825
Just to get through life.

286
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,334
<i>He was married and he had a son.</i>

287
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:17,194
Daddy!

288
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,243
<i>He had adopted her son.</i>

289
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,893
<i>He's a really good dad.</i>

290
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,074
<i>I respected him, for that.</i>

291
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:28,951
<i>It was a tough situation for everyone.</i>

292
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:31,877
What did you do today?

293
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,652
That kid Donovan is being mean to me.

294
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:35,851
That big kid?
But, he..

295
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:40,150
Mommy was picking you up.
So, he couldn't bother you.

296
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:42,341
She was late.

297
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,249
And then, after we put out the fire.
Mommy said,

298
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,728
to stay in my
room with my baseball cards.

299
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:53,334
What fire?
- Did you know they made a lamp that had the sun in it?

300
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:54,683
Mommy got the lamp.

301
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:57,961
She made a special drink
and the lamp made a fire.

302
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:01,890
I put out the fire.

303
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,577
The fire is out!

304
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,941
First time in my life, I do the right thing.
- Oh, shut up!

305
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,200
No, no..no.
Save, a young single mother..

306
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
..and a kid.

307
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,468
I married you. I adopt him.
- You fell in love.

308
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:22,053
Don't you dare forget that part.
We fell madly in love!

309
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:24,231
Yes, I fell in love.
My God, I fell...yes.

310
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:27,146
But, you know I thought you were mysterious
like my mother. Until, it turned out..

311
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,905
the mysterious just meant depressed.
Alright? Hard to reach.

312
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,107
I mean, i'm dying here!

313
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,558
You're young..you're beautiful.
You gotta find somebody else you gotta..

314
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:39,299
go out and get some friends. Alright?
- I don't like going out.

315
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,913
You know that I get anxiety
when i get to meet people.

316
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,113
You know how hard that is.

317
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:46,714
You cannot just stay in the house,
with a fucking sunlamp!

318
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,218
Alright? I can't..
I mean look...

319
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,162
I can't trust you with Danny.
When you're...

320
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,361
the fire and everything.

321
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:55,237
I put the fire out Irving.
There's no fire...

322
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:58,386
Maybe, if you were here more. Then,
there wouldn't have been a fire  in the first place.

323
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,565
There wouldn't have been a fire,
if i was here?

324
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,406
Just stop with the whole fire thing!
God! It was a mistake.

325
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:04,779
I'm sure million people do that.

326
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:05,978
All the time.
Those sunlamps are dangerous.

327
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,048
I shouldn't have it in the house, really.

328
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:10,906
I bet that happens all the time.

329
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:14,142
This was nothing.

330
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:17,881
We are not happy, alright?

331
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,723
You know that I could take Danny.

332
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:24,924
You know that most your work is illegal.

333
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:28,864
And, you know that if you try to divorce me;
you know that, i'm not saying that I would.

334
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,064
But, i'm saying that I could.

335
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:33,369
But, i'm saying that.
That is why, I don't like divorce Irving.

336
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,570
Women do that in divorces.

337
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,413
Women get the children
and the father never gets to see them.

338
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:41,217
My mother never got divorce.
My granmother never got divorce.

339
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,417
There are no divorces in my family.

340
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:44,367
I am not..getting a divorce.

341
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,798
Come on, what are we doing here?

342
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,944
We fight and we fuck.
And, that's what we do.

343
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:49,145
That's our thing!

344
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,905
She's the Picasso of
Passive agressive karate.

345
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:55,201
She was better than any con artist
they ever met.

346
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:58,654
Including myself.
And, she had me like nobody had me.

347
00:22:58,854 --> 00:23:00,859
Irving come the fuck up.
Come on.

348
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:05,454
You might say, she was my Karma.
For how i took advantage of people.

349
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:09,652
Oh, my God!
- Come here.

350
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,706
Come on, get in the bed.

351
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:15,891
No, wait.
- Baby, there's such good stuff here.

352
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,522
I did not wanna leave kid behind.
He's my son!

353
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,943
She had me.
I..was her mark.

354
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,045
Now, I can't assure you.

355
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:27,794
That your loan will be approved.

356
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:30,939
But, I can tell you
that any deal I take..I close.

357
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,112
However...my fee is not refundable.

358
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,311
Just like my time.

359
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:40,220
I wanna thank you very much.
Irving, for seeing me.

360
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,421
Sorry, i'm so nervous.

361
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:44,625
Is that..am I not buttoned?

362
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:49,280
I just gotta say Mr.Rosenfeld
that Lady Edith was uh...

363
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,981
very...you're top notch and..

364
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,464
I really need your help.
I am desperate.

365
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,631
I mean, I got the house leashed
..and uh..

366
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:00,702
Two boats and..I forgot to mention,

367
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,139
that i have a little piece of real estate,

368
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:04,707
in Long Island.
- Hmm..you didn't mention that.

369
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:06,695
Two lunch with you,
you never mentioned that.

370
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,214
Oh, I was gonna mention it.
Then, the guy with the hat walked in.

371
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,409
The hat.
- You remember that?  - I do.

372
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,080
That second time we had lunch.
- Yes.

373
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:20,218
We couldn't see his eyes.
Like he had no eyes.

374
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,417
Did they sell hats like that?
- I don't know.

375
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,295
Actually, i went down the store
and i thought the hat store down the street..

376
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:29,365
I thought..
I was gonna get you one as like..

377
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,276
It was like a momento.
- Two lunches?

378
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:31,918
Yes.

379
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:34,434
Really?
- It's two lunches. What's the big deal?

380
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:35,634
That's unusual.

381
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,978
Just trying to get him,
to be more agressive.

382
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,393
On his loan, that is.
- You showed me whole new side of the city.

383
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:41,592
I've never seen before.

384
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,021
You're welcome.
- No, thank you.

385
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:48,307
Yeah. Should I take Edith?

386
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:49,506
You'd like it.
- Yes.

387
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:51,287
So, I'll take you there twice.

388
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:52,036
Stop.

389
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,156
You like this guy?
- Yes, I like this guy.

390
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,254
Fine, you play your part.

391
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:10,926
Take it to your people, in London.

392
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:12,615
Please.

393
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:13,925
Take it to them.

394
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,622
I got the cashier's check right here.

395
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,835
I give you five and you give me
fifty back, right?

396
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,036
Please.

397
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,494
Please, don't reject me.

398
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,735
Give a guy, a chance.

399
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:38,896
Zurich, you got office in Zurich?

400
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:42,653
Paris, I can call Paris?

401
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,654
Do whatever you need to do.

402
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:48,191
Go ahead, take your time.

403
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,103
Stick around for a little bit.

404
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:54,238
See my friends over there?

405
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:58,022
You got the wrong office.
You're gonna be embarrassed.

406
00:25:58,258 --> 00:25:59,895
Hey, hey..hey..hey!
Go easy on her.

407
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,509
I may not have you Irving.
But, i have her on fraud.

408
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,921
Impersonating another individual.
- On fraud..on fraud?

409
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:08,161
What is that? Identity fraud?
- You may be from England..

410
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:10,661
but you're not royal
and you have no banking connections.

411
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,145
That's a felony.

412
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,821
How long is it?
That's three to five years.

413
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:16,243
Oh, really?
That's interesting.

414
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,443
I don't even know your name.

415
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,225
Richie DiMaso, F.B.I
Nice to meet you.

416
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:23,388
You gotta keep away from this guy.

417
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:31,138
He wouldn't let me see her, for three days.

418
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,340
Even managed to delay a lawyer.

419
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,032
She couldn't handle it.

420
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:46,110
Chuck, how come the fluorescence is on?
Can we kill that please?

421
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,666
Jesus Christ, i put this lamp here for you.

422
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,705
Cos i thought it will be better for you.
This wires here...

423
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,729
They're scared b'cos people hang themselves.

424
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:53,929
But, i know..
you're too smart for that.

425
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,480
Where is the table and chair?

426
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,949
It's like a fucking asylum.
Joe, is everybody off today?

427
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,150
Jesus Christ!
It's scary.

428
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,971
Maybe, i wanted to scare you.
I don't know.

429
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,170
Maybe, i'm little off..

430
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,711
the beaten path. You know?
I don't know, maybe.

431
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:09,961
You look dehydrated.
You wanna have some tea?

432
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:23,728
I know you think..look at me.
Hey,

433
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,238
Edith. I know you think
Irving loves you.

434
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,767
I know you thinking that uhm...

435
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:33,067
You think that he sees the world
as this...

436
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:35,417
a cold dark place.

437
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,834
He cares about nobody.
But, are very few people in the short list.

438
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:46,760
What if you are not?
What if you are not on that list?

439
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,063
What if you're not on
that list, at all?

440
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:54,045
He'd be in here right now.
If he took the check. But, no you did.

441
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:58,213
God! It's so clear to me.
It's so crazy clear to me...

442
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:00,363
But it's not clear to you.
He uses you, Edith.

443
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:02,455
To protect himself.
To protect his son..

444
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:03,654
and his wife in long Island.

445
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,975
No? Yes!

446
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:08,745
He put a ring on her finger.
He adopted her son.

447
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,319
They have huge house,
they have two cars.

448
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:13,284
What does she do all day?
I'll tell you what she does.

449
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,850
She plays with her nail..
she watches T.V and she spends your money.

450
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,618
The money that you make.

451
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:21,964
I don't like that you're in jail.
While he is going free.

452
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:24,959
I don't like any of that.
I wanna help you.

453
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:29,239
All the 'razzle-dazzle' that he does is not good.
It's not real. It's fake.

454
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,056
It's not real.
Who you are is who you are.

455
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:32,256
Between, you and God.

456
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:34,496
You and your soul.
That's what matters. That's what counts.

457
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:35,696
That's what i'm about.

458
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:36,896
That's what I see in you.

459
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:39,006
Tell me, you didn't feel,
the first time we saw each other.

460
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:40,822
Am I crazy?
I don't think so.

461
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:45,424
I am not supposed to be talking about this.
I don't care. I'll break the rules.

462
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:49,028
Okay, Edith..Edith.
I wanna help you.

463
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,228
I like you.

464
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,800
<i>I like you.</i>

465
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:56,835
I like you.

466
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,341
Been in here three days.

467
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:07,602
This doesn't look good for her.

468
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,431
How does it make you feel, her in there?

469
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,694
That check was for you, right?

470
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:21,760
But, you knew something was off.

471
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,679
Because you're good.
You're like the best of the whole country,

472
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:26,881
Aren't you?

473
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,731
You know, if the country were run by
people like you, Irving Rosenfeld.

474
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:35,231
We're gonna be up stringing like Guatemala.
You ever been to Guatemala?

475
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,949
If you ever tried to get a telephone or an apartment,
or anything in..

476
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,515
Guatemala.

477
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:43,526
That's what this country would be like.
If we let people like you run this country.

478
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:44,727
Who made you God and Judge?
Hmm.

479
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,648
My Aunt Gria lived to be 93 years old.
Never lied in her life.

480
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,698
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

481
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:51,999
I'm proud of that too.

482
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,858
Except make you another good person.
Isn't that something to strive for?

483
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,058
Why are you breaking my balls, huh?

484
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:58,833
Get to the point.

485
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,500
I see something in you, Irving.

486
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,054
I get very excited.
I think that we have a lot of potential here.

487
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:05,198
Now, look?

488
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,818
I came up with the idea.
It's all for me. I wanna change things.

489
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:11,423
I wanna go after,
White collar crime.

490
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,248
Irving, you're a very skilled man.

491
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:14,448
And I want you to teach me;

492
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,964
Hell, we can do this.
I want four people to do what you do.

493
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:19,106
Fraudulent investments.
Fake certificates of deposits.

494
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:21,597
Stolen art..fake art.
You get me four people.

495
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:22,797
You're off the hook!

496
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:23,997
Four busts...

497
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:26,166
..And you will leave us alone?

498
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:27,957
We don't have to testify?

499
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,427
If you got it, you're done.
Anything you want.

500
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,194
But, if you run..then your life is over.

501
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,616
You're gonna be hunted.
You're gonna be very difficult..

502
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:39,749
..for Rosalyn and the kid.
To live in this country.

503
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:42,251
We need to leave.

504
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:43,452
We need to run and we need
to do it now.

505
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:48,405
Right, we'll go to Estonia or Romania;
I don't care.

506
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:50,556
We talked about it a hundred times!
- What about Danny?

507
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:52,405
What about Danny?

508
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,610
I adopted him.
I gave him my name.

509
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,810
I'm not leaving him wih Rosalyn.
She's..

510
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:57,963
...unstable!
- That is a manipulation.

511
00:30:58,164 --> 00:30:59,163
Rosalyn will never let you go.

512
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:02,895
She used Danny against you.
Because she's too messed up to let you leave.

513
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,610
I can't leave him.
I love him, alright?

514
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,100
He is my son.

515
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:13,697
Richie said, you will say that.

516
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:14,897
Richie?
- Yeah.

517
00:31:15,096 --> 00:31:16,097
The cop?
-Yeah.

518
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:17,962
You're on a first name basis, what?
- Yes, i am.

519
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:19,161
I am not even on your list, am i?
- What list?

520
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,290
Your list. Your short list...
your long list.

521
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,489
I'm not even on any of your fucking list.

522
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,905
I thought that you love me.
- I love you.

523
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:27,203
...that we have something.
- We do have something. It's perfect!

524
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,371
What are you saying?
We're gonna go to Romania.

525
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:30,570
Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

526
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:32,081
Yes, that's what I am saying.

527
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,138
You..Me..Danny.
Yes.

528
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,589
Well, you never said that before.
- Well, i am saying it now.

529
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:38,987
We are us.
We can make it an adventure, like we did.

530
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,062
We can make it an adventure,
like we make everything, alright?

531
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:42,591
Alright.
- Okay?

532
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:45,162
We have to go now, alright?
Trust me.

533
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,363
We have to leave right now.

534
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:47,563
I can't leave Danny, without custody.

535
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:50,411
- No, you have to take me away.
We have to leave.

536
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,160
No, what are you saying?
What are you saying?!

537
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:56,896
Will you pull it together.

538
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,571
Don't say I don't love you.
That is bullshit.

539
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:04,151
This is bullshit.

540
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,060
WE..are bullshit.

541
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,090
You are bullshit.

542
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,558
You are bullshit.

543
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:13,758
Please, don't do this.

544
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,799
I just never thought that
you're conning me.

545
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,889
I can never con you.

546
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:23,759
I love you.

547
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:27,989
Please don't say this.

548
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:36,209
No, I am done.

549
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,362
Don't say that.

550
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,981
I'm gonna do these four busts,
these four cons.

551
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:46,578
To get us out of this.
Not just me, but us.

552
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,999
And, i'm gonna get really close..

553
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:52,863
with Richie. The Cop.

554
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:54,857
In case, we need to use him.

555
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,163
If we need another move.

556
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:58,362
We won't need another move.

557
00:32:58,563 --> 00:32:59,562
We need four busts.

558
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:01,778
Then, we are done.

559
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:05,377
We are gonna need another move.
Trust me.

560
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,074
The key to people is what they believe.
And, what they want to believe.

561
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:12,509
So, I want to believe that we were real.

562
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,187
We are real.
- And, I want to believe,

563
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:15,386
that a man could want me.

564
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,127
And, i'm gonna take all of that heartbreak.

565
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,416
And, all of that sorrow and
I am going to use it.

566
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:23,862
And, i'm going to make Richie think
that I want him...

567
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,266
..and that I like him.

568
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:30,479
And, I'm gonna be..
very, very convincing!

569
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:35,982
And, I am pissed at you.

570
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,679
Cos, I am pissed at you!

571
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:42,769
Maybe, I do like him.

572
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,559
Maybe, I like him a lot.

573
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,655
From the feet up, right?

574
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:55,855
Baby?

575
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:04,476
Quit, bellyaching and come up
with something to get us out of this.

576
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,814
You're right, I am in no state
to deal with this.

577
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:09,660
So, what's it gonna be Mr.Mastermind.

578
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:14,778
An Arab Sheikh.

579
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:17,342
What do we want an Arab Sheikh, for?

580
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,892
What do you think this was, stupid?

581
00:34:19,972 --> 00:34:22,682
If you could not call him Stupid.
Which he isn't.

582
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:23,882
He is smarter than you.

583
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:28,052
Last time i checked, he's in control;
and we work for him. Now, be nice.

584
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:35,632
To set this up.

585
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:37,572
To bust the Con artist.

586
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:42,166
We need to make the honey pot.
To attract the bees.

587
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,691
To attract the bees,
we need to offer them..

588
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,477
..wealthy individual.
That they can take advantage of.

589
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:51,036
Someone special. Someone new...
someone amazing.

590
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:55,233
And, those guys that I wanna sell
fake bank sheets leads to that guy.

591
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,490
Thinks the Sheikh's money. You see?

592
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,113
Only, they can't get into his money.
Unless, they knew somone.

593
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,530
And, that someone is us.
- Oh, that's good!

594
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,875
So, if wanna get something like,
your con artist friend..that called Elway.

595
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,549
He keep him wanna buying.
- Keep your voice down.

596
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,239
There you go. We can pinch him.

597
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:17,698
That's right.
But, I don't tell who is Sheikh.

598
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:20,068
I wait for him to call me.

599
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:21,949
The art world is a small world.

600
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,908
And one of Elway's acquaintance..

601
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:27,679
...is clocking us right now.

602
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:29,138
Where?
- Number one.

603
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:36,307
You have a good look?

604
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:39,048
How do you know the Sheikh?

605
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,766
This is my friend Dal, from Queens.

606
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:47,319
I do aluminium siding and roofing.

607
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:51,149
I wanna show you something.

608
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:55,798
People come from
all over the world to see this.

609
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,487
Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

610
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,436
It's a fake.

611
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:02,332
But..it's impossible.

612
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:04,686
People believe, what they wanna believe.

613
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:06,655
The guy who made this,

614
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:08,166
was so good.

615
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:11,195
That it's real.
To everybody.

616
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:13,805
Now, who is the Master?

617
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:15,645
The Painter..

618
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:17,135
or the Forger?

619
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,406
That's a fake?

620
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,315
This is the way,
the world works.

621
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:26,071
Not, black and white.
Like you were saying.

622
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:28,404
Extremely, grey.

623
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:33,864
Irving, could I?
- How many time I gotta tell you.

624
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:38,365
Not yet. Wait your turn.
- Arthur, Hi.

625
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:40,535
Edith.
- Edith, Hi.

626
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,883
Yes, I wanted to introduce you
to Robert Spencer.

627
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,084
We are advising the Sheikh, together.

628
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:48,316
Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheikh. Yeah.

629
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:49,683
What's this about, a goddamn Sheikh?

630
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:51,943
Why are you leaving me out of this?

631
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:54,552
Huh? I gotta hear it from my friends?

632
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,673
It ain't for you, Carl.
- What do you mean, it ain't for me?

633
00:36:56,874 --> 00:36:57,873
No, it ain't for you.

634
00:36:58,073 --> 00:37:00,148
We gotta do certificates of deposits.

635
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,181
I can print as many as you need.
- I got my associates, it's the right guys.

636
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,133
C'mon, this is not one man operation.
- Look, I can get other guys.

637
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,228
What are you talking about, Irving?
- Are you telling me that...

638
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:08,428
you can get four guys.

639
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:10,742
To sell, fake certificate of deposits.

640
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:15,081
To my investor, Within a week?
- Yes, I can make that happen.

641
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:17,612
Carl no way can do what he says,
he can do.

642
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,451
That's interesting.
But you know, other guys lined up;

643
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,092
I gotta meeting.

644
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:25,780
Carl, his associate says here..

645
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
He's got a meeting, he has gotta go to.

646
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,876
I gotta run.
- Listen, don't go...don't go.

647
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:31,145
<i>The crazy thing about people,
The more you say 'no'..</i>

648
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,841
<i>The more they want in on something.</i>

649
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,450
<i>It is so stupid.
- I gotta run!</i>

650
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,280
C'mon, I'll tell him. Don't worry, I'll tell him.

651
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,479
Hey, you know what?
Carl just told me.

652
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,397
He said we could do this whole thing,
with four guys...

653
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:43,961
..within a week.

654
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,162
We could do something much bigger.

655
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,899
Something bigger? Yes, my guy deals
with hundreds of million of dollars.

656
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,398
How much bigger?
- Hundreds of million...

657
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,959
I knew you were holding out on me, Irving.

658
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,920
Like, i'm talking about
we can say never the fuck mind to see this.

659
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,988
And, we could have some complete access
to something huge!

660
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,853
Huge..like what?
Robert Spencer, I'm advisor to the Sheikh.

661
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:03,054
Carl Elway.

662
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:05,788
I want you to think, the most under valued
asset in the state of New Jersey.

663
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:09,329
The rebuilding of Atlantic city.

664
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:15,309
Look, maybe they legalized gambling
a year ago..

665
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:16,509
But nothing is happening.

666
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,547
Hey, quit while you're ahead, Carl.

667
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:21,783
I know the guy, the right people
that are gonna help you out.

668
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:24,013
Who's the guy?
- The guy is Carmine Polito.

669
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:25,896
Who's Carmine Polito?

670
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,096
Carmine Polito?

671
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,762
Carmine Polito, No.

672
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,836
My boss started proceeded to tell  me that,
Carmine Polito was..

673
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:35,547
the most quietly powerful person
in the state of New Jersey.

674
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:39,410
A lifetime native of the very
racially mixed Camden.

675
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,609
Which had become a ghetto.

676
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:42,327
And, where he had been Mayor
for ten years.

677
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:44,466
A very beloved guy.

678
00:38:45,016 --> 00:38:46,646
A guy, who never gave up for his people.

679
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:51,306
His father had immigrated from Italy.
And, had stoked coal.

680
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:53,465
A BIG family guy with five kids.

681
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:58,463
They even adopted some other kid,
a black kid..from boys and girls club,

682
00:38:58,663 --> 00:38:59,662
from a Boston family.

683
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:02,275
I mean, his house hold was a Jewish place.

684
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:06,424
And, his wife Dolly..
well she was the apple of his eye.

685
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,014
And, the centre of the household.

686
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:12,035
I mean everyone, love this guy.

687
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:15,674
And, he had a huge heart.

688
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:20,854
<i>The W.P.A employed craftsmen to paint this,
during the depression.</i>

689
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:23,614
Why can't we employ people, today?

690
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:26,373
<i>To do work like this,
and rebuilding Atlantic City?</i>

691
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,367
He worked with all the unions.
He was the leader of the state assembly.

692
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,730
And, he just got gambling legalized in
New Jersey, to create jobs.

693
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,163
But, he couldn't get the funds
to rebuilt Atlantic City.

694
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:38,522
And that, was his problem.

695
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:40,929
So, with out help..

696
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,541
He was about to have his hand
in the wrong pocket, at the wrong time.

697
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,472
And to me, that meant corrupt.

698
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:49,485
You said, grifters..con artists..

699
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:52,056
We are not going after
some politicians. This is..

700
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,256
This is a bad idea, Richie.

701
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,802
Look, it's really simple.
All you need..

702
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,852
..is to put two million.

703
00:39:58,282 --> 00:39:59,669
In a Chase account.
- What?!

704
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:00,868
Under the Sheikh's name.

705
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,068
Whose, two million dollars?

706
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,511
Sh..just listen.

707
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:05,021
Two miliion dollars,

708
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,831
under the Sheikh's name..
In a Chase account.

709
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,050
That will be controlled.

710
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:11,051
Carmine,

711
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,631
calls up on the telephone,
calls the bank;

712
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:18,330
And, he sees that the Sheikh is real.
And he has a real account.

713
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:19,540
Five days.

714
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,455
I'm not taking 2 million dollars of the
tax payers money,

715
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,655
putting it anywhere for five days.

716
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,640
I don't care, if we control it the whole time.

717
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,670
Start let us do, what we need to do.
To rule out corruption.

718
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,929
And, to get rid of the pay-offs.
Guys that are ruining this country.

719
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:35,296
That's my dream.
Don't smirk,  please.

720
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,249
- You know, Richard
I understand your eagerness.

721
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,679
I really do.

722
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,813
You know, i'm from Michigan right?

723
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,066
Let me tell you a story.

724
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,376
About me and my dad, my brother.

725
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,364
We used to go, ice fishing every November.

726
00:40:46,564 --> 00:40:49,009
Ice fishing..that's all anybody..
that's what we live for.

727
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:50,208
Just listen to me!

728
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,978
It's beautiful!
We had a little stove,

729
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:54,449
You huddle around.
We keep each other warm.

730
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:57,039
You drop a line..
and you just wait.

731
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,067
One year, my brother says..
let's go on october.

732
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:02,787
He wants to go ice fishing in October.
My Dad says, 'no, the ice is too thin'.

733
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:06,146
My brother says, I love my brother...
- I understand what that was..

734
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:08,646
Is that your brother went out on the ice,
the ice was too thin. He fell through the ice.

735
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,080
Went into the water,
b'cos he was too eager. Just like i'm too eager.

736
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:12,282
Is that what you're saying?
- No, i'm not saying.

737
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:13,636
What are you saying?

738
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:17,425
You know, we'll finish the ice story
another time, young man.

739
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:19,166
For now, no Carmine Polito.

740
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,696
Go do your job.

741
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,280
Staunton shot the whole thing down.
- Boring.

742
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,317
But, Edith was a genius.

743
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:31,507
She somehow, found this woman.
Who controlled the wire room.

744
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:36,135
A woman, I had never even heard of.

745
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:40,456
Way back, in the dorm buried
in the bureau.

746
00:41:41,605 --> 00:41:43,506
This cat lady no one even talk to.

747
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,355
And, Edith met her in the ladies room.

748
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:48,934
Yeah, became friends with her.

749
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:52,754
Hi, how are you?
- This lady handles all the wires.

750
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:54,604
And now, she was working with us.

751
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:58,682
She was excited, to be included in the operation.
Instead of just...

752
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,766
..being on the other end of a memo.

753
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,089
It was beautiful.

754
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:03,699
This is from England?
- yeah.

755
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:04,898
Oh, I brought you some tea as well.

756
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:06,099
Oh, thank you so much!

757
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:08,546
Nobody ever talks to me.
- I know.

758
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:12,581
<i>They just say, ' Brenda, do the clerical wiring
stuffs and don't ask questions'.</i>

759
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,781
You need to tell Richie about your cats.

760
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:16,217
He loves cats.
-My Cats?!

761
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,761
Well, that's Perry.
Look at him, standin up.

762
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:19,961
Isn't that sweet?!

763
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,212
And, that's Wendy,
she's a rascal.

764
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:24,528
But, Bernaby..that's another story.

765
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:25,728
Bernaby plays the piano.

766
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,572
That's impressive.

767
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:32,274
We got her to wire, 2 million dollars
to an FBI controlled account at Chase.

768
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:33,742
It'd be there for five days.

769
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:36,852
And, if Polito called?
He would see that the Sheikh was real.

770
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,670
And, by the time he Stauton
caught up to us.

771
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:42,401
Edith made sure, his boss
was impressed by my idea.

772
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,513
So, before he even knew it was happening.

773
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:46,719
His boss was calling to congratulate him.

774
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:50,505
Anthony Amado.

775
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:53,092
He had a major hard on,
for to make a name for himself.

776
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,291
I mean, this guys love the idea
of being famous.

777
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:58,929
And, Stauton had to say
it was all his own idea.

778
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,777
or he'd look stupid,
in front of his boss.

779
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,620
You made me accept, praise from my boss,

780
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,338
thanking me, for something
that never should have happened.

781
00:43:05,537 --> 00:43:07,753
Something that I didn't approve.
- You should be happy.

782
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,459
There's an imaginative things
happening in this office.

783
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:11,939
Alright, we're not just working in a box.

784
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,949
We got the two million to
put Carmine and the Sheikh together.

785
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,219
I like being on the side of the line.

786
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,259
But, someone had been left out.

787
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,199
We succeed because,
we stayed small.

788
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:25,019
You took on Elwey,

789
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,978
you both still went on.

790
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,808
So, if we max this.
That's enough.

791
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,007
It's three one, no politicians.

792
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:34,770
You're gonna do this, because..

793
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:35,969
.. you got no choice.
You work for me.

794
00:43:36,678 --> 00:43:38,278
Now, you keep changing the rules.

795
00:43:38,598 --> 00:43:40,655
Now, you're getting a...little
power drunk.

796
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:43,112
Richard, now you wanna tell me.
You wanna wake him up?

797
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:45,644
Oh, no. I said, we shouldn't do any of it.
Irving, you know I said that.

798
00:43:45,843 --> 00:43:46,844
So, now I support Richie.

799
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:49,175
He's got vision.
Do it heavy, or don't do it.

800
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,948
I mean, he's the one ruining America,
not me.

801
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,832
How the fuck am I ruining America?

802
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,906
Because, people just got over
Wategate and Vietnam, alright?

803
00:43:57,106 --> 00:43:58,932
You're gonna shit all over
politicians again?

804
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,436
Is it because you wanna be a big shot,
and get a promotion?

805
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:03,111
No, I'm thinking big.

806
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:04,312
Alright, this is gonna be fantastic.

807
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:05,512
We're doing video surveillance.

808
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,557
I'm doing this,
from the feet up!

809
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,019
You will never do it properly.

810
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,648
Because, you got too much
government attitude,

811
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:11,849
to be small and sleek.

812
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:14,401
I'm like the fucking the A con-man, alright?

813
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm in and i'm out.

814
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:16,801
I was there the whole time.

815
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,000
You don't know it, alright?

816
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,201
That's, the fucking art.

817
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,684
To become somebody,
who people can't pin and the police..

818
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:24,578
dreams on.

819
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:25,777
You can't do it.

820
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:28,473
How about the suite at the Sheraton Hotel?

821
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:31,308
For Carmine Polito and rebuilding, Atlantic City?

822
00:44:31,508 --> 00:44:32,508
Why not?
- We need a luxury for the Sheikh.

823
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:35,687
Oh, Come on! Carmine is used to dealing
back door all the time.

824
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:37,677
We don't have a budget for that, Irving.

825
00:44:37,877 --> 00:44:38,877
We are gonna knock..

826
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:42,093
The Mayor..
the speaker of the state assembly.

827
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,424
You gotta knock him off
his fucking feet. Alright?

828
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:45,624
He's gotta feel like he is out of his league.

829
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:48,874
What you're offering this deal,
I mean, this is unheard of.

830
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,974
In the state of New Jersey.
Maybe, in the whole fucking country alright?

831
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:56,833
Hey Sheikh, you're loaning us million
of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City.

832
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:59,442
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's gigantic, alright.

833
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,941
The mayor, he's gonna want to see the cash.

834
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:04,852
He's gonna want to see an account.
He's gonna want to see it right now...

835
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,051
And, he will check.

836
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:08,164
That's why, this meeting isn't happening.

837
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:09,363
Because, to get millions...

838
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:11,102
..you need millions.

839
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,213
We already did it.

840
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:19,060
What?

841
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:22,761
We got the Bureau to park
two million dollars for three days.

842
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:23,960
We got the account numbers.

843
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,221
WE, meaning you and him?

844
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:31,091
Yeah, me and that guy.

845
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,301
She showed me.
- Show him, our thing?

846
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:36,841
You did that without me?

847
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:38,041
Are you kidding?

848
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,571
What are you gonna do?

849
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,970
You're playing me?

850
00:45:57,569 --> 00:45:58,580
Or you're doing this,
you're playing him.

851
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,913
____

852
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:03,460
You're gonna have to decide
for yourself, kid.

853
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:04,661
I just laid everything
on the table.

854
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:11,759
This is all very exciting.

855
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,289
I didn't know I could be like this.

856
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,451
To be wild.

857
00:46:27,178 --> 00:46:29,815
You know we're taking down
bad guys.

858
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,831
A very important politician.

859
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:21,504
This is agent, Richie Dimaso.

860
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:24,295
I'm placing 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase,

861
00:47:24,995 --> 00:47:27,438
for Mayor Carmine Polito.
To procure..

862
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:30,562
Casino lisence and building permits
for Atlantic City.

863
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,031
<i>I don't know what that is.
This is very weird.</i>

864
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:46,500
<i>This is very weird.
I don't know what the fuck that is.</i>

865
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:52,483
Mr.Mayor?!

866
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:54,230
Please, stop listen.

867
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,263
I apoligize, if that punk offended you.

868
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:57,462
I really apologize.
- I'm alright. Thank you.

869
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:01,009
No, i'm fucking embarassed
to be associated with that guy at all.

870
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,211
Can i just say, something to you please.

871
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:06,763
Don't loose this opportunity,
to fucking Florida. Alright?

872
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:07,963
Just because of some...

873
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:09,852
Bullshit,

874
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,936
from that punk advisor.
With his diploma, alright.

875
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:16,398
Who could never get into
the school that we come from.

876
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,771
Don't loose that opportunity.

877
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,191
Where are you from?
- From the Bronx.

878
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,821
Way on dock house
164th street.

879
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:30,901
I got lot of friends
who lives up there.

880
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,919
Yeah, got Tomasso running..

881
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,418
Tomassos on Arthur avenue?
- Yeah, the clams there...

882
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:38,918
Clams..oh, those are fucking to die
for, those things.

883
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,000
I haven't been there in a while.
I like that place.

884
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,469
Well, you know what..

885
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,720
Can I call you Carmine?

886
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:47,850
You know, Carmine...

887
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:50,379
Hey, my fucking heart is done..

888
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:52,853
Running down...
i'm not used to running.

889
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:54,053
It's a lot of green grass..

890
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:57,758
in that hotel room. Up there.
Alright?

891
00:48:57,957 --> 00:49:00,111
And, all the deals
will flow through you.

892
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,024
You'll get a serious piece
on both ends, alright?

893
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:03,225
You do with that
what you will, man.

894
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,816
I live in the real world. Alright?
I'm a family man,

895
00:49:06,016 --> 00:49:07,457
I got mouths to feed and
everything like that.

896
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,657
But, you know...this..

897
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:11,978
You gotta grease it directly.

898
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:14,014
No middle man, no bullshit.
It's the Arab's way.

899
00:49:14,214 --> 00:49:15,214
That's it..that's it.

900
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,415
Alrigh, look I understand.

901
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,348
It's a great opportunity,
you understand...

902
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:22,050
I was a little thrown by
going into meeting with somebody,

903
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:23,251
I didn't even know would be in there.

904
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:26,702
I was thrown as well.
- Understand, I'll deal with you directly.

905
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:29,277
Not any middle man or
any other bullshit.

906
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:30,478
Done!
- I'll deal with you directly.

907
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:31,678
I like you.
Eye to eye.

908
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:34,118
We can do business together.
- That's fine.

909
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:35,936
How long have you known this guy?

910
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,055
You've work with this guy, before?
- I gotta work with him. It's the Sheikh.

911
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:41,256
Alright
- But, I still need to meet the Sheikh.

912
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:42,455
Okay?
- Done. After you.

913
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:45,939
I'm going out for dinnner,
with Carmine and the wives in Camden.

914
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:47,140
Who?

915
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:48,340
Carmine and myself with the wives.

916
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,319
What? Without me?!

917
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:51,519
- He doesn't like you.
What do you want from me?

918
00:49:51,718 --> 00:49:53,883
I got him to come back,
take the money.

919
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,082
You got him on tape.

920
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:57,081
I can't make him like you.

921
00:49:57,675 --> 00:49:59,004
I did my job.

922
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,998
Did you tell him you're working with me.
And, that i'm the Sheikh's associate.

923
00:50:03,535 --> 00:50:05,297
I just fucking told you!
He doesn't like you.

924
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:07,322
I mean, let him have a nigh out with a human being.
For fucks sake.

925
00:50:07,523 --> 00:50:08,522
Alright? He is going to jail soon.
You're done with him.

926
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:11,033
You got him on tape, taking a bribe.

927
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:13,295
Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving.

928
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:15,841
We're gonna use Carmine.
Yeah, no..no, no.

929
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,900
Carmine will get us other people.

930
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:19,874
What? Like who?

931
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:22,678
Carmine is gonna use the Sheikh's
to pay off people.

932
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:23,878
Are you fucking nuts?
Are you...

933
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:27,038
We're gonna let Carmine,
show the Sheikh Atlantic City.

934
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,515
How he's gonna renovate hotels
and see who shows up!

935
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:32,649
Whoever the Sheikh pays off.
For lisences and casinos...

936
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:33,848
That's who, we're gonna go after.

937
00:50:34,048 --> 00:50:35,050
We are gonna go after all of them!

938
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:37,111
No more politicians?
- Yeah.

939
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:39,363
You realize how fucking dangerous that is?

940
00:50:39,563 --> 00:50:40,564
There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

941
00:50:40,593 --> 00:50:43,092
Alright, Edith and I
were so sucessful for so long..

942
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:45,591
Because, we kept it just
small enough.

943
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:48,524
You're taking us to a very
fucking dangerous place,

944
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:50,558
with very serious numbers!

945
00:50:51,112 --> 00:50:54,528
If you're that sucessful,
how come you wound up with me. Right now?

946
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:56,182
Taking orders from me.

947
00:50:57,061 --> 00:51:00,301
You're taking your wife out to dinner?
Your fucking wife, did i hear you correctly?

948
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:02,371
That's the one thing you heard me say?

949
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:04,941
I just find it rather shocking, that's all.

950
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,521
I get to handle two wives,
with one dinner. Alright?

951
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:11,073
I take Rosalyn out,
she keeps her mouth shut..

952
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:12,841
She sees that my work is legitimate.

953
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,041
I get to keep my kid and
I get to keep...

954
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,540
..that fucking wife happy.
Both wives happy.

955
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,009
Richard, what are you doing?

956
00:51:32,678 --> 00:51:36,517
Richard don't eat in the bathroom.
I told you so many times!

957
00:51:36,717 --> 00:51:40,507
And I have brought Napoleans.
Come out of the bathroom and pray.

958
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:43,837
Oh, my god! What did you do?
- Richard,

959
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,337
The filter is broken in the fishtank.

960
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:49,139
It's the problem.
- See, my job is to do the ground.

961
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:50,898
When you don't do the filter right,

962
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:52,508
You get all the fish die.

963
00:51:53,398 --> 00:51:57,268
See?
- I can't that top of the thing...

964
00:51:57,938 --> 00:51:59,254
And, please help Richard,

965
00:51:59,455 --> 00:52:01,733
to marry Diane so that
i may have granchildren,

966
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:02,933
And, the Pope may have more followers.

967
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:06,237
And, please bless this food.
That we are about to eat.

968
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,607
Richard?
- Yea, hello?

969
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:12,142
<i>Hi.
- Who's this?</i>

970
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:13,177
It's Edith.

971
00:52:13,836 --> 00:52:16,777
Sit down and pray properly.
- Are you alright?

972
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:18,936
Yeah, yeah I'm fine.
It's just..

973
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,805
..i'm alone, you know?
Irving is out with..

974
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,075
.. Carmine.
Oh, yes that's right.

975
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:27,133
He went out with Carmine
and his wife...

976
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,178
Yeah, you must not feel
so good about that.

977
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,379
<i>Richar sit down.</i>

978
00:52:30,486 --> 00:52:31,535
Wait, who is there?
Who are you with?

979
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:36,351
Oh, no. It's just people.
- People...? I'm your fiance, Richard?

980
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:39,022
Oh, you got a fiance.
You are engaged.

981
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:40,485
I don't know. I don't
have a fiance.

982
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:42,285
You don't know?

983
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:44,663
You don't know,
if you have a fiance.

984
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:45,863
I don't, no.

985
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,374
Hmm, interesting.

986
00:52:48,844 --> 00:52:50,024
You wanna get together?

987
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,999
Richard, Do something about the fishtank!

988
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:55,404
54th street?

989
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:56,604
Okay, 54th street.

990
00:52:57,193 --> 00:52:58,394
Okay, great.

991
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:02,034
That's what the phone call is about.

992
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:05,655
Everybody thought, "Oh, Richie DiMaso is
gonna stay in the office,

993
00:53:05,856 --> 00:53:08,003
pushing papers."
That's not gonna happen, Mom.

994
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:09,204
I'm outside on the field.
I got peoples working for me.

995
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:15,158
My ideas, I'm running the show.
I'm the quaterback and i'm not gonna settle

996
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,358
for no one, Mom.

997
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:41,870
Rocco, how are you?

998
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:45,514
Rocco, we like the..
chicken very thin, alright.

999
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:49,468
Look, the way you dresses the chicken..

1000
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:51,965
With the red sauce.

1001
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:54,178
They're so good.

1002
00:53:55,243 --> 00:53:56,404
Here it is! This is it.

1003
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:59,213
This right here, this right here.
Look at this.

1004
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:03,250
This is so..good. So good.

1005
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:05,315
This is so nice.

1006
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:11,833
Thank you, Rocco.
- Thank you, Rocco.

1007
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:14,638
I believe that, you should treat people;

1008
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,152
The way that, you want to be treated.

1009
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,643
Did Jesus say that, or something?
- He may have.

1010
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:20,843
I think also,

1011
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:24,287
<i>Always take a favour, over money.</i>

1012
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:26,461
I think, Jesus said that as well.

1013
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,235
I don't know if he said the second one.

1014
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:29,435
He might have said the first one.

1015
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:32,231
I chipped this moving furniture.
It's my new obsession.

1016
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:36,058
Moving, redecorating..
makes me feel better.

1017
00:54:36,257 --> 00:54:37,258
like, exercise. But, there is this...

1018
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:40,076
There is this top coat.
That you can only get from Switzerland.

1019
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,747
And, I don't know what i'm gonna do.
B'cos, i'm running out of it.

1020
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,076
But, i love the smell of it.
- Oh, I can get it for you.

1021
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:46,912
That would be amazing.
- Of course!

1022
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:48,112
There is something...the top coat.

1023
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:52,111
It's like, perfumy.
But, there is also something rotten?

1024
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:54,028
And, i know that sounds crazy.

1025
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:56,230
But, I can't get enough of it.
Smell it, it's true.

1026
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,208
Dolly, historically..

1027
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:01,673
the best perfumes in the world.
They're all laced with something nasty.

1028
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:02,872
It is true!

1029
00:55:03,073 --> 00:55:05,123
Irving loves them.

1030
00:55:05,323 --> 00:55:06,323
He can't get enough of that smell.

1031
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:09,642
I can't get enough.

1032
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:11,948
Carmine.
- Carmine, smell the nails.

1033
00:55:12,147 --> 00:55:13,147
Sweet and sour.
- Smell the nails.

1034
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:14,347
Rotten and delicious.

1035
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:16,850
It smells like flowers.

1036
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,049
Flowers, but with garbage.

1037
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:24,197
You know what that is for me.
It's coriander for me.

1038
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:27,776
That's what hooks him.

1039
00:55:27,977 --> 00:55:28,976
He always comes back for it.

1040
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:38,942
He's gonna say..
He is gonna say,

1041
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:41,443
'We have to talk business'.
In Five...

1042
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:45,069
four, three, two...
One.

1043
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:48,379
Dolly, Can me and Carmine talk
about business here?

1044
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,187
I'm not this drunk.

1045
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:18,145
Didn't your fiance
want to come out tonight?

1046
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:19,344
Yeah, uh..

1047
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:22,862
I don't know. Yeah..
No.

1048
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:24,061
I don't know.

1049
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:28,110
Oh, God..i'm sorry.

1050
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:29,715
I'm sorry.
We don't have to talk about it.

1051
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:32,277
I was just teasing you..
- That's alright.

1052
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:33,856
Ever think like, ' How did I end up here?'

1053
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:36,877
Like, how my life become
screwed? Ever think of that?

1054
00:56:38,956 --> 00:56:40,299
And, you wonder like...

1055
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:45,348
Can I ever gonna get up to a better place.
Or, this is it.

1056
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,380
You feel like that?
- Yeah.

1057
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:52,500
Yeah, I do.

1058
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,439
I definitely, know that.

1059
00:56:55,944 --> 00:56:58,500
I'm sorry, we don't have to go dancing.
We can go have coffee..

1060
00:56:58,701 --> 00:56:59,700
or talk..or just..
- No, no..no.

1061
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,994
No, no. I need this.

1062
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:06,271
Please, I need to go
dancing with you.

1063
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:08,254
Please.

1064
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,184
Okay baby,
Let's go dancing.

1065
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:24,864
<i>Hurry up and get out of this.</i>

1066
00:58:25,064 --> 00:58:26,064
I really fucking like you.

1067
00:58:27,113 --> 00:58:30,740
Yeah..yeah.
I like you too.

1068
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:32,604
I wanna live.

1069
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:35,705
Like, for real.

1070
00:58:35,906 --> 00:58:38,755
No more fake shit.
Right?

1071
00:58:40,444 --> 00:58:43,720
We're gonna wait until we
decide, we fall for real.

1072
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,369
That's when we fuck.

1073
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:47,483
Not till then.

1074
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:48,683
Okay?

1075
00:58:49,408 --> 00:58:50,681
Okay.

1076
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,883
No more fake shit.
- No more fake shit.

1077
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,849
No more fake shit.

1078
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,262
No..more..fake, shit!

1079
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,231
Get out.

1080
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:16,430
Get out.

1081
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,641
Boys..

1082
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:18,842
This guy right here, Julius?

1083
01:00:19,277 --> 01:00:20,477
This guy,

1084
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:22,637
Irving Rosenfeld.
You know what he's gonna do?

1085
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:25,978
He is gonna bring the Sheikh to Atlantic City.
That's what he's gonna do.

1086
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:30,595
Where we can build all those resorts,
there. Put everybody back to work.

1087
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:34,107
He's gonna get this community;
He's gonna get this state.

1088
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,216
Back on it's feet.
To where it belongs.

1089
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,325
Isn't that right?

1090
01:00:38,797 --> 01:00:40,076
He's gonna grow our tax base,

1091
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:44,185
And, create thousands and
thousands of jobs, for everyone!

1092
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:46,058
Do you understand that?

1093
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:47,258
You know what that means?

1094
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,458
To Irving!

1095
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:49,659
To Irving!

1096
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:53,915
Come on, this guy right here.
He's got a big heart.

1097
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,741
Let's just say, that
it didn't work out?

1098
01:00:58,105 --> 01:00:59,165
What do you mean?

1099
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:01,785
Of course, it's gonna work out.
Guys like you and me...

1100
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:07,238
right? We dream and we build.

1101
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:08,437
We never give up.

1102
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:11,340
We never quit.

1103
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:15,663
Hey, can i ask you a question?

1104
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:18,763
Yeah, sure.

1105
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:20,284
Is the Sheikh black?

1106
01:01:22,823 --> 01:01:24,352
The Sheikh, he is uh...
He is an Arab.

1107
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,273
That's black isn't it.

1108
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,143
I know it's just
a dumb question but...

1109
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:37,282
I was wondering..

1110
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,641
Why are you asking?

1111
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:41,602
I would like to,
arrange..

1112
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:43,313
the Sheikh..

1113
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:44,962
to see Camden.

1114
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:51,171
To see the people of Camden.

1115
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,960
Irv, i really want him to see.

1116
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:58,602
How good this is going to be
for the community.

1117
01:01:59,531 --> 01:02:01,510
How ready we are for
this opportunity.

1118
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,910
And, he could see how far
his dollar would go.

1119
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,041
You know what i mean.
What do you think?

1120
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:10,180
Yeah, we can do that, yeah.

1121
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,211
Ah, good.

1122
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,109
Oh, hey..I got something..
I wanna give you.

1123
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,290
Come on,
I got you a gift.

1124
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,521
Let's get out of here.

1125
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,128
The wive's gonna kill us.

1126
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:32,559
Here you go.

1127
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:34,729
What is it?

1128
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:36,537
It's a Microwave.

1129
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:37,737
It heats up everything.

1130
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:38,937
Pasta, Lasagna..meatballs.

1131
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:40,136
Whatever.
- Really?

1132
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:42,430
It's science. Yeah,
it's that how it heats up the food.

1133
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,630
It's scientific.
- And, you specifically, bought this

1134
01:02:46,168 --> 01:02:49,505
science oven..for me?

1135
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:50,704
Yeah.

1136
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:54,088
A new friend.

1137
01:02:57,837 --> 01:02:58,917
Thank you.

1138
01:02:59,778 --> 01:03:01,316
Thank you.

1139
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,111
Don't put metal it.

1140
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,856
Come on, let's get out of here.

1141
01:03:07,337 --> 01:03:09,069
I need a Jet at Tithe bora.

1142
01:03:09,657 --> 01:03:13,049
I need a Jet at Tithe bora, for the Sheikh.
- You don't..you don't need a Jet.

1143
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,249
Let him walk to the curb at JFK.

1144
01:03:15,077 --> 01:03:16,490
That's not how it works.

1145
01:03:16,691 --> 01:03:17,690
You gotta start from the feet up.

1146
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:20,233
That doesn't mean anything.
What does that mean?

1147
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:21,433
It means you gotta be committed.

1148
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:22,633
Means, you gotta be committed
to something in your life.

1149
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,833
For Christ sake, alright?

1150
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,678
I want a Jet at Tithe bora,
for the Sheikh.

1151
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:28,761
It can be a small jet,
Doesn't even have to take off.

1152
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,113
Cos, i know you're so worried about
the money the bureau's gonna fucking spend.

1153
01:03:31,313 --> 01:03:33,641
It can take off and land
on the tarmac, okay?!

1154
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:37,131
Alright, you can have the jet
for an hour.

1155
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,596
But, takes off and lands at Tithe Bora.
- I got the jet?

1156
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:40,796
You got the jet..
- Alright, thank you.

1157
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:44,334
Wait, tell me the rest of
the ice fishing story.

1158
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:46,954
Where was I?

1159
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,674
Your father walks in the blizzard
at the lake..come on. C'mon!

1160
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:53,354
Okay, when my brother and I
were on the ice..

1161
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:56,693
..and my father came out of the house;
and I could see him coming.

1162
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,483
Holding the lantern and there's blizzard,
and i knew he was gonna be angry.

1163
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:02,754
So, i went to intercept my father.

1164
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:05,371
B'cos I knew if he saw
what my brother was doing,

1165
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:08,106
He was gonna kill him.
- Oh, you tried to protect your brother,

1166
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:09,744
But, you couldn't.
And that's why you feel bad, b'cos..

1167
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,428
you're trying to protect me
and you're worried about me.

1168
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:12,627
Is that what the story is about?
It's about protection.

1169
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,162
<i>No, it's not about protection.
- No?  - No.</i>

1170
01:04:15,363 --> 01:04:17,528
Alright, fine.

1171
01:04:18,952 --> 01:04:22,728
'Don't put metal in that science oven,
Roselyn...'

1172
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:35,913
Another fire!
- NO, Danny! Not that one.

1173
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:38,113
That one's empty.
We gotta get the big one.

1174
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:40,595
I told you not to put metal
in the science oven.

1175
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:43,144
What did you do that for?
- Don't make such a big deal.

1176
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:44,346
Just get another one.

1177
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:46,977
I don't want another one.
I want the one Carmine gave me.

1178
01:04:47,177 --> 01:04:49,556
<i>Oh, Carmine..I want the one Carmine
gave me.</i>

1179
01:04:49,756 --> 01:04:52,000
Carmine, carmine.
Why don't you just marry Carmine.

1180
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:54,576
Get a little gold microwave
and put it on chain around your neck.

1181
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:56,061
You wanna be more like Carmine?

1182
01:04:56,261 --> 01:04:58,294
Why don't you build something,
like he does.

1183
01:04:58,493 --> 01:04:59,884
Instead of your empty deals.

1184
01:05:00,084 --> 01:05:01,083
They're just like your fucking science oven.

1185
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:04,517
You know, I read that
it takes all of nutritions out of our food.

1186
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,561
It's empty, just like your deals.
Empty, empty!

1187
01:05:07,762 --> 01:05:08,761
That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1188
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,690
I read it in an article.
Look..

1189
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:13,868
By Pulver Deur.

1190
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:16,828
Bringing something into this house,

1191
01:05:17,027 --> 01:05:19,884
That's gonna take all nutritions out
of our food and light our house on fire?

1192
01:05:20,498 --> 01:05:22,972
Thank God, for me.

1193
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:52,509
Alright, you got this.

1194
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:01,966
I don't think,
you should come to Carmine's party, tonight.

1195
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:05,240
You look beautiful.
By the way.

1196
01:06:06,831 --> 01:06:08,543
Don't look at me.

1197
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:09,743
Alright?

1198
01:06:09,943 --> 01:06:10,942
Don't look at my legs,
don't look at my head.

1199
01:06:11,143 --> 01:06:12,143
Don't smell my hair.

1200
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,342
Don't ask me how I am.

1201
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:16,150
Don't talk to me outside
of this rules cos, i'm done.

1202
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:18,510
Just stand still.
Get in the umbrella. Come on.

1203
01:06:18,986 --> 01:06:21,235
Just..Carmine wants
Rosalyn..

1204
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:23,902
.. to come.
- I don't care!

1205
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:26,904
You aren't listening.
I don't care if Rosalyn comes.

1206
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:28,978
Just do your job, okay?

1207
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:32,497
You're nothing to me,
Until you're everything.

1208
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,831
I'm not Rosalyn,
I'm not gonna put up with that shit.

1209
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:45,005
That's a fucking jet, right?

1210
01:06:45,206 --> 01:06:47,839
It's good.
- It's the kinda moves you need to make.

1211
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:51,205
Paco Hernandez?
I'm Richie DiMasso.

1212
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:52,405
It's nice to meet you in person.

1213
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:56,252
This is Irving Rosenfeld.
- Paco Hernandez, nice to meet you.

1214
01:06:56,573 --> 01:06:58,903
Paco..wait no, no.
He's not an Arab.

1215
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:02,158
No, Mexican, from Tucson.

1216
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:03,882
Where is my guy?
Where's Al?

1217
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:06,047
My friend from Queens.
Where is he?

1218
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:07,672
What are you doing?
- I gotta hire an FBI guy.

1219
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:10,876
<i>You speak any Arabic?
- Yeah, As-salamu alaykum.</i>

1220
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:13,404
That's it?
- No, i have a couple of phrases.

1221
01:07:13,702 --> 01:07:16,362
From feet up, you motherfucker.
What are you doing? C'mon.

1222
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:18,434
Act normal, that's it.
Just seem all like...

1223
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:20,772
You can't barely understand english.
You can't speak it.

1224
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:21,971
You say as little as possible,
you follow my lead.

1225
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:23,171
Alright?

1226
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:25,324
Who's running this?
I thought you're running this.

1227
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:26,524
I am running this.
We gotta listen to him.

1228
01:07:26,724 --> 01:07:27,723
He's the guy with the vision.

1229
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,719
I got the vision?
You know the vision I had?

1230
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,918
You just kissed my girl.
Right outside.

1231
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,154
That's what vision I have.
- I thought you guys broke up.

1232
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,910
I'm giving you a compliment.

1233
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:36,841
What's going on?

1234
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,157
Don't worry about it, alright?

1235
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:41,380
I got a knife.
This is for the mayor.

1236
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,902
You gotta present it, to the mayor.
Just look at me.

1237
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,540
Alright, look me in the eye.

1238
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:50,295
This means a lot to you.
Right? That knife, play it.

1239
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:51,495
You present it, alright?

1240
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:54,515
Friendship for life..alright.
You gotta feel it.

1241
01:07:54,715 --> 01:07:57,038
Sacred. Can you do it?
- Sacred.

1242
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,133
Sell it.
- If you believe it, sacred.

1243
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:01,746
They are sacred, alright?
- listen, the details. That's what makes..

1244
01:08:02,038 --> 01:08:04,728
...This guy a genius.
- Again? You're complimenting me again.

1245
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:06,703
Rubbing salt in the wound?

1246
01:08:06,903 --> 01:08:07,902
What are you?
- I'm complimenting you.

1247
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,948
You got any other questions?

1248
01:08:12,149 --> 01:08:14,364
Yeah, i think the name
of the operation is offensive.

1249
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:17,376
ABSCAM.
Arab Scam? It's racist.

1250
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,401
Are you fucking kidding me?

1251
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:22,071
What do you care?
You're a Mexican.

1252
01:08:36,868 --> 01:08:39,196
Hello, Sheikh.
- ___

1253
01:08:40,411 --> 01:08:41,393
Welcome!

1254
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:43,983
On behalf of the
great state of New Jersey.

1255
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:45,616
I wanna welcome you to New Jersey.

1256
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:51,658
Thank you, thank you.

1257
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,365
We have a great party planned
for this evening.

1258
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:58,898
What are you talking about,
I can't go?

1259
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:00,983
I just did my hair
and make up and everything!

1260
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:02,183
The Sheikh's a very particular.

1261
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,372
It's an international
cultural protocol. You know.

1262
01:09:04,572 --> 01:09:09,099
International Protocol.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1263
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:11,734
Do not answer that,
Do not answer!

1264
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:12,935
Hello?
- Robert Spencer for Irving.

1265
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:15,415
Robert Spencer,
I don't know a Robert Spencer.

1266
01:09:15,815 --> 01:09:16,904
What do you want?
- I'm a business associate..

1267
01:09:17,435 --> 01:09:19,360
Who is that?

1268
01:09:19,559 --> 01:09:21,485
For god's sake,
I told you not to call here.

1269
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:24,243
Alright?
- Two more Federal agents tonight.

1270
01:09:24,443 --> 01:09:25,443
No, what?

1271
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:27,605
Two Feds.
- No.

1272
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:29,868
I need them,
bodyguards for the Sheikh.

1273
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:31,904
No, no. Too many guys,
too many to control. No.

1274
01:09:32,104 --> 01:09:34,424
Irving? Remember who's
in charge here.

1275
01:09:35,662 --> 01:09:36,983
Rosalyn, get off the extention.

1276
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:38,909
I'm not on it.

1277
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,241
Look, don't call here again, alright.
Don't call at home.

1278
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:42,441
Alright. Okay, bye.
- Alright.

1279
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,613
It's a business call.
Don't interrupt. Alright?

1280
01:09:47,163 --> 01:09:51,552
Federal Agents?
- It's bodyguards for visiting dignitaries.

1281
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:52,752
That's all.

1282
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:55,384
What is it? An IRS thing.
Like a tax investigation?

1283
01:09:55,584 --> 01:09:57,415
Why you gotta say that?
That's why I can't invite you.

1284
01:09:57,616 --> 01:09:59,414
It's too complicated.
- Are you in trouble?

1285
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:01,403
Stop being nosy. Look at these shit.
- Well, i'm nosy.

1286
01:10:01,603 --> 01:10:02,603
Cos, you never tell me anything.

1287
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,091
Do not answer that!
- Hello?

1288
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,291
<i>It's Carmine.</i>

1289
01:10:09,571 --> 01:10:11,401
Oh, hi..Carmine.
We're just talking about you.

1290
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,004
Yeah, Irving is being a mean, boring man.

1291
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:15,204
<i>Saying that he doesn't want me tonight.
- Tell him he is crazy!</i>

1292
01:10:16,151 --> 01:10:18,091
Well, I agree.
Tell him yourself.

1293
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:21,238
Can you imagine.
- Cos, you're coming.

1294
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:23,500
Yeah, Tell him yourself.

1295
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,667
Irving, you're crazy.
Your wife is coming,

1296
01:10:26,867 --> 01:10:27,866
You're kidding me.
She's the life of the party.

1297
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,067
We enlist her.

1298
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:32,892
You know what she's like,
she is unpredictable.

1299
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,679
Hey, don't talk about me, like that!
What is Carmine saying?

1300
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,289
Carmine loves me.

1301
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:41,458
This is really big night for us.
You understand?

1302
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:45,705
C'mon, you gotta bring your wife.
Dolly has got something special for her, right?

1303
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:46,457
Listen, listen.

1304
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:49,865
I got the nail polish for you, sweetie.

1305
01:10:50,065 --> 01:10:51,064
What is it?

1306
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,418
Tell me.

1307
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:56,778
What is it?
You got a girlfriend coming?

1308
01:10:56,978 --> 01:10:58,711
C'mon, i thought we are friends.

1309
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,067
Look, we're handling this like men.
You understand? Bring your wife.

1310
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,266
We'll have a good time.

1311
01:11:07,287 --> 01:11:08,335
We'll see you there.
It'll be fun.

1312
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:11,337
That's an order from your mayor.
Goodbye.

1313
01:11:11,537 --> 01:11:13,978
Alright, you happy?
Go get ready.

1314
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,617
Yes, I am happy.

1315
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:18,313
I know who you are.

1316
01:12:18,983 --> 01:12:21,228
I know who that is, Irving.

1317
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:31,946
Oh, it looks beautiful.
- So, this is the lobby.

1318
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:36,561
Reminds you a week ago,
this place was a mess.

1319
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:39,528
But, what existed was this,
plaster work.

1320
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:40,728
Look at the detail.
It's beautiful.

1321
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:43,561
My son is a craftman.
Please, tell him what you did.

1322
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:48,612
I did birds, sky..clouds.
____

1323
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:51,822
This saved us 50 million.
Look at me.

1324
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:53,021
50 million,
right of the bat.

1325
01:12:53,222 --> 01:12:54,222
Like that.

1326
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:55,422
I waived a loan.
Got the help, right?

1327
01:12:56,341 --> 01:12:58,412
Instead of constructions having to
build ground up, new.

1328
01:12:58,612 --> 01:12:59,612
We don't do 'new'.

1329
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,394
We renovate, right.

1330
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:03,049
We used some temporary funds.

1331
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:06,503
The gaming tables, some roulette..
for people to have a good time.

1332
01:13:06,703 --> 01:13:07,455
It's for charity.

1333
01:13:08,205 --> 01:13:10,950
Support some legal programs and
some art programs.

1334
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:17,934
This is the Oyster room.

1335
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,564
There's some gentlemen,
sitting over there at the bar.

1336
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:29,404
That's a 130 years sitting right there.
That's how many times between them.

1337
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:30,922
They run the biggest casinos
in the united states.

1338
01:13:32,298 --> 01:13:33,568
We have to work with them.
- Right.

1339
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,698
The good new is..

1340
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:38,199
..they know how it's done.
They get it done.

1341
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:40,244
You don't have to worry.
Everyone makes their money.

1342
01:13:40,443 --> 01:13:42,583
You mean the mob?
- Yes, but they're business men.

1343
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:45,517
Spend at much or little time
with them as you like.

1344
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:46,716
But, we do have to deal with them.

1345
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:49,454
All we gotta do is go and say, 'Hello'.
Just gotta say, Hi.

1346
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:53,645
We gotta confirm before
we talk to those guys.

1347
01:13:53,844 --> 01:13:55,840
Confirm?
What is there to confirm about.

1348
01:13:58,252 --> 01:13:59,925
I don't understand,
they're casino guys!

1349
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:03,148
Irving, we came all this way.
We should be here.

1350
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:05,296
What is everybody scared of.

1351
01:14:06,051 --> 01:14:08,621
Those are the guys,
that you guys are all scared of?

1352
01:14:08,822 --> 01:14:11,119
Those guys over there?
They don't scare me.

1353
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,156
Rosalyn..Rosalyn?

1354
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:27,261
Irving, that's not the way to do this.

1355
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,207
I love this!

1356
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:39,734
Kids, I want you to go up and
get some soda and pizzas please.

1357
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,278
I think they got this room, all wrong.

1358
01:14:45,465 --> 01:14:47,009
Yeah? What would you do?

1359
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:50,499
I would do in all black and gold.

1360
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:53,981
I would do this bar like a big
warm, golden mirror.

1361
01:14:55,268 --> 01:14:56,778
Sounds beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1362
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:02,501
And, i love that ass.
____

1363
01:15:02,702 --> 01:15:05,701
I'm sorry, Is she a wife?
- No, she is my wife.

1364
01:15:06,478 --> 01:15:07,868
Look at these fine gentlemen.

1365
01:15:08,673 --> 01:15:11,492
How are you?
- Good to see you.

1366
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:20,912
Oh, i know because he's a party pooper.
He's so boring.

1367
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:23,961
May I present, Sheikh Abdullah.

1368
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,461
Gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi.

1369
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:30,012
Sheikh, these are professionals.
They run the best casinos in United States.

1370
01:15:30,213 --> 01:15:31,212
Mr.Sheikh,

1371
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:34,226
As a sign of our seriousness, Mr.Tallegio
came from Miami to meet you tonight.

1372
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,196
Mr.Tallegio?

1373
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:39,752
Why didn't you tell me, Mr.Tallegio is here.
- He's in the back room.

1374
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:42,294
It's a sign of disrespect to talk,

1375
01:15:42,493 --> 01:15:44,509
business. On the first meeting.
- That's not true.

1376
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:48,657
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
He's got it all wrong.

1377
01:15:48,857 --> 01:15:50,419
You wanna leave him back there,
in the back room waiting?

1378
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:51,618
We gotta meet him.

1379
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,819
My friend from New York
doesn't know the custom...

1380
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:56,855
Hey, Irving i'm gonna be having fun.
Maybe, it will be contagious, huh?

1381
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:05,442
Can you believe
that he talk to me that way?

1382
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:14,949
Carmine?

1383
01:16:15,758 --> 01:16:17,489
Victor Tellegio was from Miami.

1384
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:20,388
He was Meyer Lansky's right hand man.

1385
01:16:21,018 --> 01:16:23,648
With his prior reputation,
as an enforcer from..

1386
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:27,070
..20 years ago was known,
to never bury a body;

1387
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:30,256
B'cos, he felt it sent a stronger message.
To leave it on the street.

1388
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:37,748
This is the guy,
we now have to deal with.

1389
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,376
Are you sure, you don't wanna
go out there. It's new bar.

1390
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:44,646
It's beautiful out there..
- I don't have to go out there.

1391
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:46,585
I like it here.
There is an exit.

1392
01:16:46,785 --> 01:16:47,896
I'm like a ghost.

1393
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:50,197
Nobody knows i am here.

1394
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:53,656
Tell him, I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1395
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,696
We're very excited.
It's been our life long dream

1396
01:16:57,897 --> 01:17:00,246
to build Casinos resorts
in the east coast.

1397
01:17:03,426 --> 01:17:04,436
You told him that.

1398
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:08,829
They don't want the Jews to make money.
They don't want the Italians to make money.

1399
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,030
They definitely don't want
the blacks to make money.

1400
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:12,245
After, the oil embargo..

1401
01:17:12,735 --> 01:17:13,795
gasoline crisis.

1402
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:16,004
The hijacking, the olympics.

1403
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:17,595
They don't wanna see Arabs,

1404
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:20,907
make money.
Plus, not on our soils.

1405
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:23,724
I don't know, if you can tell him
in your own way.

1406
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,078
I've been in the casino business,
for forty years.

1407
01:17:27,278 --> 01:17:29,532
It's scrutinised more careful
then any other business.

1408
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:31,894
Carmine made this legal, but..

1409
01:17:32,824 --> 01:17:35,184
we must be careful or they
will take it away.

1410
01:17:36,624 --> 01:17:40,391
So, Mr.Tallegio..how do you think
we should approach this?

1411
01:17:40,592 --> 01:17:41,591
What do you wanna do?

1412
01:17:42,813 --> 01:17:45,803
If you wanna get the gaming
license and keep it.

1413
01:17:46,393 --> 01:17:49,322
We have to make our principle
investor here, The Sheikh.

1414
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:52,756
An American citizen.

1415
01:18:00,372 --> 01:18:02,223
Lots to expedite, citizenship.

1416
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:05,815
One that requires special treatment.

1417
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:11,132
Well, you would know
the right people to do that.

1418
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:15,276
U.S Senators.
U.S congressmen Senators.

1419
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:17,587
Wow! That's fantastic!

1420
01:18:18,962 --> 01:18:22,375
I say, stay away from that.
That's bad. That's trouble.

1421
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:25,719
Irving please?

1422
01:18:25,919 --> 01:18:28,379
Who is this guy?
Who are you..huh?

1423
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,031
What are you, a farmer?

1424
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,447
Mr.Tallegio, i'm sorry..
this is  Irving.

1425
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:36,120
He is Irving Rosenfeld.

1426
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:38,359
New York business man.
- What's the matter, Irving?

1427
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,809
What's the problem?
- Nothing, no problem.

1428
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:44,309
Don't get your balls in an uproar.

1429
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,922
Everything is fine.
Everything is good.

1430
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,121
It's all good. It's all good.

1431
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:49,349
It's all good.
I just hope....

1432
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,030
the other part of this
is all good.

1433
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,659
And real.

1434
01:18:53,169 --> 01:18:55,778
Because, we are real.
You know that.

1435
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:58,167
You deal with us,
we are real organisation.

1436
01:18:58,408 --> 01:19:00,685
We're dealing with..
we don't know what we're dealing with.

1437
01:19:08,168 --> 01:19:09,348
Where is he from?

1438
01:19:09,968 --> 01:19:11,542
Abu Dhabi.

1439
01:19:11,741 --> 01:19:13,774
Oh, he's from the Emirates?
- Yeah.

1440
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,626
I think..I think, what is...

1441
01:19:53,825 --> 01:19:55,896
Let him speak for himself.

1442
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:27,097
What are the fucking odds,

1443
01:20:27,298 --> 01:20:29,805
you got an italian guy from Miami,
knowing Arabic.

1444
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:32,588
It turns out, he's got casino
investments, in the middle east.

1445
01:20:32,789 --> 01:20:35,143
And, he spent two years
learning it to keep the upper hand.

1446
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:36,344
Listen to me carefully.

1447
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:39,218
If you really put 10 million in
the bank of our choice.

1448
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,541
In the next two weeks.
- Carmine, listen me carefully.

1449
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,670
You put 10 million in the bank or our choice.
In the next two weeks, or..

1450
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,587
Not only will the Sheikh feel something.

1451
01:20:47,787 --> 01:20:50,663
But, our friends in Florida
will feel deeply disrespected.

1452
01:20:50,862 --> 01:20:51,863
So, will I.

1453
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:04,777
Rosalyn, you need to come
with me, alright.

1454
01:21:04,976 --> 01:21:07,480
Oh, you want me to come with you?
- Please, just stop alright.

1455
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,679
Oh, you think I should
come with you?

1456
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:10,821
Get your fucking hands off me.

1457
01:21:16,726 --> 01:21:18,183
This is my hausband's whore!

1458
01:21:23,427 --> 01:21:24,532
You alright?

1459
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,399
Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1460
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:30,756
Alright?
- I always say that.

1461
01:21:30,956 --> 01:21:31,996
You say that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:21:32,196 --> 01:21:34,591
Kindred spirits.
- Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1463
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:36,159
Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1464
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,476
What the hell do you think
you are doing?

1465
01:21:52,677 --> 01:21:54,770
What do i think, what i'm doing?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1466
01:21:54,971 --> 01:21:56,817
You're gonna come and just me
for flirting..

1467
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:59,612
..while you've been fucking
my hausband for how many years?!

1468
01:21:59,822 --> 01:22:01,510
You don't have a fucking clue
what's going on.

1469
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:04,602
I got a ring on my finger.
We have a child together!

1470
01:22:05,037 --> 01:22:07,535
He doesn't love you, Rosalyn.
He loves me and you know it..

1471
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:09,924
And, I know it.
He knows it.

1472
01:22:10,123 --> 01:22:12,197
It maybe done now.
It was beautiful and it was real.

1473
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:13,916
And, we loved each other.
- Stop it.

1474
01:22:14,616 --> 01:22:17,179
Shut up!
- You scared him, you manipulate him...

1475
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:18,380
And, you use your son!

1476
01:22:21,706 --> 01:22:23,716
Well, he must like it on some level.
He must want it.

1477
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:25,709
Because, he keeps coming back for it.

1478
01:22:25,909 --> 01:22:27,364
It's like that perfume that you love,

1479
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:30,118
You can't stop smelling.
Even when there's something sour in it.

1480
01:22:30,318 --> 01:22:31,706
Can't get enough of it.

1481
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,876
But, guess what?
He's never gonna leave me.

1482
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,963
He is always going to want me.
And, I will make you so sorry Edith.

1483
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,936
I will make you so sorry
for what you've done to my family.

1484
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:45,137
Mark my words!

1485
01:22:45,344 --> 01:22:46,655
That's fucked up!

1486
01:22:47,285 --> 01:22:49,134
I would never say
anything that's fucked up..

1487
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:51,088
to anybody. But, you did.
B'cos you're gross inside.

1488
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:53,683
Oh, I'm gross inside?
Maybe, your gross inside...

1489
01:22:53,684 --> 01:22:56,481
both robbing people
and all that shit that you do.

1490
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,914
Maybe, we are both gross inside.
That's what Irving loves about us.

1491
01:22:59,114 --> 01:23:00,113
At least, he is consistant.

1492
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,404
You know sometimes in life,
all you have,

1493
01:23:02,804 --> 01:23:05,741
are fucked up,
poisonous choices.

1494
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,366
Ladies and gentlemen,
Our friend..

1495
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:32,408
working men friend..
My friend.

1496
01:24:32,608 --> 01:24:33,609

Just wanna work and live.

1503
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:05,506
They say, there's no money,
no where.

1504
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:08,202
You gotta be kidding me!

1505
01:25:08,402 --> 01:25:11,234
Don't they know,
we build this country!

1506
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:16,982
One thing we can all afree upon,
in the state of New Jersey,

1507
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:20,850
is that, we never;

1508
01:25:21,051 --> 01:25:22,050
- NO!!!

1509
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:29,222
Please, raise your glass with me.

1510
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:30,422
To a new era.

1511
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:32,720
It begins tonight.

1512
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:36,704
From me, and my family..

1513
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:39,474
We thank you.

1514
01:25:39,675 --> 01:25:40,674
For all the hard work that
you have given us.

1515
01:25:41,184 --> 01:25:42,981
In the community..

1516
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:46,319
Look what you've done.
It's beautiful!

1517
01:25:46,519 --> 01:25:49,315
Thank You!

1518
01:27:11,956 --> 01:27:13,373
Edith?

1519
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:19,748
Can I use your phone?

1520
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:28,958
Last night was insane.
I got it all figured out.

1521
01:27:33,153 --> 01:27:34,280
Stauton Thorson?

1522
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,783
Listen, I need the Sherman suite
at the Plaza Hotel, Okay?

1523
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,983
That's the whole floor of the hotel.

1524
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:41,204
No, no, no.
I need the whole floor.

1525
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:42,403
I need it for my operation.

1526
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:44,586
Stop calling it your operation, Richard.

1527
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,825
It's not you operation and
I'm not giving you a whole floor of..

1528
01:27:47,826 --> 01:27:48,918
the Plaza Hotel.

1529
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:51,421
I have members of the congress
coming in right now

1530
01:27:51,621 --> 01:27:53,567
trying to get the Sheikh
Citizenship, alright?

1531
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:54,766
They are taking bribes.

1532
01:27:54,967 --> 01:27:55,968
It's happening right now.

1533
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:57,167
That's happening right now!

1534
01:27:57,486 --> 01:28:00,385
Bribing members of congress..
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1535
01:28:00,856 --> 01:28:02,738
Stauton, Stauton!
Shut up!

1536
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:03,939
You know who Victor Tellegio..

1537
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:05,138
Victor Tellegio,

1538
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,690
works for Meyer Lansky.
You know who that is?

1539
01:28:09,356 --> 01:28:10,495
Resorts international.

1540
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:14,117
Alright? He wants 10 million dollars.
I have two weeks. I have...

1541
01:28:14,318 --> 01:28:16,672
Just listen to me. Listen to me..

1542
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:18,195
You're not listening to me!

1543
01:28:19,115 --> 01:28:20,474
I have two weeks!

1544
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:22,499
I have two weeks to put this
thing together.

1545
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:26,136
And, I need you to get me the Sheman
Suite at the Plaza Hotel!

1546
01:28:26,455 --> 01:28:27,554
<i>Lower your voice.
- How the fuck am I doing.</i>

1547
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:35,487
Help me out Edith.

1548
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:36,941
Calm me down.

1549
01:28:38,609 --> 01:28:40,242
You gotta calm me down.

1550
01:28:40,442 --> 01:28:41,441
You gotta calm me down.

1551
01:28:48,343 --> 01:28:50,696
Baby, let's do this right now.

1552
01:28:51,672 --> 01:28:54,422
No, no..no.
- I wanna do this right now.

1553
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,708
Look at your skin.
Oh, my god!

1554
01:28:56,908 --> 01:28:57,909
Your fucking skin is glowing, baby.

1555
01:28:58,108 --> 01:28:59,653
Your fucking skin is glowing.

1556
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:02,941
We are not gonna back on...
- I wanna do it now!

1557
01:29:03,141 --> 01:29:04,141
That's what we agreed on, alright.

1558
01:29:04,341 --> 01:29:05,341
So, we're not gonna do that, alright?

1559
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:07,851
Where are you?

1560
01:29:08,381 --> 01:29:11,167
You're acting all scared.
You okay? You're here with me?

1561
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:12,251
I love you.

1562
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:17,771
It is real now. I just..
I just said it.

1563
01:29:18,191 --> 01:29:19,511
So, now is the time.

1564
01:29:20,546 --> 01:29:22,522
Look at me, look at me.
I love you.

1565
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:25,429
I love you.

1566
01:29:27,204 --> 01:29:29,387
I just said that.

1567
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:52,349
I'm ready for real.

1568
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:54,289
This is real, Do you hear my voice?

1569
01:29:57,088 --> 01:29:57,999
This is real.

1570
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:01,469
This is real.
I want you to hear what's real.

1571
01:30:02,685 --> 01:30:04,287
What?

1572
01:30:05,758 --> 01:30:07,338
This is me.
- What do you mean?

1573
01:30:07,768 --> 01:30:09,057
Well, you're doing an accent?

1574
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:11,848
Your american accent?
- No, there's no english.

1575
01:30:12,048 --> 01:30:14,134
There's only American.
There's no English.

1576
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:16,518
What are you talking about?

1577
01:30:17,517 --> 01:30:21,206
Stop it, you're Edith.
Your birth records say..

1578
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,817
I falsified my records back to birth.
I falsified them.

1579
01:30:28,466 --> 01:30:31,902
My name is Sydney Prosser.
I am from Albuqurque, New Mexico.

1580
01:30:32,876 --> 01:30:35,016
I'm not Edith Greensly.
There is no Edith Greensly.

1581
01:30:45,746 --> 01:30:47,755
You're..freaking..me out.

1582
01:30:57,014 --> 01:30:58,145
No, you said it in the stall.

1583
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:00,945
That we are gonna be real.

1584
01:31:01,895 --> 01:31:03,574
And, that we aren't gonna fake it.

1585
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:05,484
I'm being real now.

1586
01:31:06,404 --> 01:31:07,645
This is who I am.
I am Sydney Prosser.

1587
01:31:08,115 --> 01:31:09,115
Okay?

1588
01:31:10,234 --> 01:31:12,844
So, why did you do an
english accent?

1589
01:31:14,484 --> 01:31:15,445
After that.

1590
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:18,504
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you
in the stall.

1591
01:31:19,393 --> 01:31:22,083
I created Edith, b'cos
I need it her to survive. Okay?

1592
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:23,283
But, i'm done with her now.

1593
01:31:23,614 --> 01:31:24,663
I'm so fucking done with it.

1594
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,330
Right..you do what you need to survive, right?

1595
01:31:30,332 --> 01:31:31,484
You uh...

1596
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:35,222
You know, you live with your mom.
You have a fiance, you don't even acknowledge.

1597
01:31:35,753 --> 01:31:37,742
That's what you do.
You curl your hair with your..

1598
01:31:38,172 --> 01:31:39,773
..fucking curlers. Which is..

1599
01:31:40,253 --> 01:31:41,432
No, it's okay.
You will go with it.

1600
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:43,161
You know..

1601
01:31:43,553 --> 01:31:45,647
You have straight hair.
That's what you do to survive.

1602
01:31:45,847 --> 01:31:48,086
You do all sorts of things.
You know, we all do.

1603
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,532
I'm confused.

1604
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:56,621
I'm confused.
- I'm fucking confused too. Alright?

1605
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:57,820
I think we should fuck.

1606
01:31:58,091 --> 01:31:59,491
And then, we'll feel it.

1607
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:02,601
And then, we won't be confused anymore.

1608
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,538
No, I wanna talk it over.
I don't wanna fuck, Okay? No.

1609
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:09,738
I think we will be better.

1610
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:14,961
No. I'm not fucking you.
I'm not FUCKING fucking you.

1611
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,141
Shit!

1612
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:23,719
Oh, my God!

1613
01:32:27,999 --> 01:32:30,763
Will you please step away from Edith.
Please? I am asking you nicely.

1614
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:31,964
Please, step away from Edith right now.

1615
01:32:32,164 --> 01:32:33,163
Come on, step away from her.
Please?

1616
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:35,778
You mean, Sydney?

1617
01:32:39,408 --> 01:32:40,679
I told him, I'm sorry.

1618
01:32:42,728 --> 01:32:44,776
I just don't give a fuck anymore.
I don't give a fuck.

1619
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:45,975
I don't fucking care.

1620
01:32:48,889 --> 01:32:49,938
Irving with a gun, right?

1621
01:32:51,178 --> 01:32:52,908
Where Richie has got us into
is worst than jail.

1622
01:32:54,117 --> 01:32:55,790
I told you last night.

1623
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,427
Those scores weren't good.

1624
01:32:57,907 --> 01:32:59,826
And, what. Now, what?
No one is getting...

1625
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:01,937
Ten million for Tallegio.
It's over.

1626
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,828
I don't think so.
- What?

1627
01:33:05,027 --> 01:33:05,817
What do you mean?

1628
01:33:08,087 --> 01:33:10,997
Because, when Tallegio finds out
what happens. You think he's gonna go after me?

1629
01:33:11,976 --> 01:33:13,456
Someone from the bureau.

1630
01:33:14,496 --> 01:33:15,687
He isn't gonna go after the politicians.

1631
01:33:17,196 --> 01:33:18,537
He's gonna kill you.

1632
01:33:20,436 --> 01:33:22,116
And, he is gonna go after your son.

1633
01:33:24,536 --> 01:33:25,615
And, Sydney.

1634
01:33:34,049 --> 01:33:35,256
<i>Stauton Thorson?</i>

1635
01:33:35,457 --> 01:33:37,206
Yeah, you're gonna give me.
The Sherman suite.

1636
01:33:37,406 --> 01:33:41,309
The whole floor.
- That's a no. I said 'no' whacko. Jesus!

1637
01:33:41,695 --> 01:33:44,979
And, you're gonna tell me
the point of that fucking fishing story.

1638
01:33:45,179 --> 01:33:47,343
Not the way your behaving.

1639
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,299
What's the matter with you?
Where are you right now?

1640
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:50,498
What does that make a difference?

1641
01:33:50,795 --> 01:33:52,223
Just tell me, where the fuck you are.

1642
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:54,716
Field Office, at 61st street.

1643
01:33:54,915 --> 01:33:56,034
I'm coming at 61st street,

1644
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:59,201
right now.
- You're gonna do, what?

1645
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,053
To beat...your ass.

1646
01:34:01,253 --> 01:34:02,254
You'll do what?

1647
01:34:10,323 --> 01:34:11,203
You were right.

1648
01:34:13,762 --> 01:34:15,426
We should've gone away.

1649
01:34:16,513 --> 01:34:17,573
I wish now, i'd leave with you.

1650
01:34:18,223 --> 01:34:20,127
We are suppose to do from
the feet up.

1651
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:21,327
Like you always said.

1652
01:34:21,413 --> 01:34:23,502
That's how we were meant to do.
Only you didn't do it like that.

1653
01:34:24,002 --> 01:34:25,492
You didn't do it like that.

1654
01:34:25,812 --> 01:34:28,311
You played it safe. So, there's always
a danger you're gonna end up

1655
01:34:28,312 --> 01:34:30,217
with Rosalyn. And, the dead space.

1656
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:33,897
Floating on some dead spaceship.
With the furnitures and the curtains...

1657
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:37,286
And, I was your lifeline out.
And you were mine.

1658
01:34:37,487 --> 01:34:39,813
And, that was okay. You know?

1659
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,251
I wish, I could get you back.

1660
01:34:55,793 --> 01:34:57,545
But, I can't do it without you.

1661
01:34:57,745 --> 01:35:00,369
You know that.

1662
01:35:03,586 --> 01:35:04,907
Come on.

1663
01:35:06,204 --> 01:35:08,904
Me, You and Danny.
Like we said.

1664
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:12,591
Like, I said.
You never said that, I said that.

1665
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:19,071
We gotta get over,
on all these guys!

1666
01:35:19,271 --> 01:35:21,921
That's what, we need to be thinking
about, right now.

1667
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,058
Fuck's sake.

1668
01:35:27,456 --> 01:35:28,783
That's big.

1669
01:35:28,984 --> 01:35:30,892
That's fucking crazy.

1670
01:35:38,628 --> 01:35:40,035
Whatever it is.

1671
01:35:43,318 --> 01:35:46,228
It gotta be the best,
we've ever done.

1672
01:35:57,507 --> 01:36:01,125
Agent DiMaso called me,
late on the night of 21st.

1673
01:36:01,325 --> 01:36:02,931
I believe that he was intoxicated.

1674
01:36:03,131 --> 01:36:04,377
He threatened me.

1675
01:36:04,716 --> 01:36:06,146
I told him, that this was inappropriate.

1676
01:36:06,997 --> 01:36:10,565
Procedures exist for purposes that
we must respect.

1677
01:36:11,175 --> 01:36:15,108
This is the third such call,
that I received from Agent DiMaso.

1678
01:36:15,308 --> 01:36:16,307
He called me again, on the night of the 5th.

1679
01:36:16,706 --> 01:36:18,285
At two a.m.

1680
01:36:18,655 --> 01:36:19,776
And, he threatened to kill me.

1681
01:36:21,085 --> 01:36:25,137
Subsequently, he demanded that I allow
him to use the Sherman Suite..

1682
01:36:25,338 --> 01:36:26,854
The Plaza hotel, for purposes..

1683
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,935
of bribing member of the Congress.

1684
01:36:32,364 --> 01:36:33,664
I am so sorry!

1685
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:35,815
I'm not finished.

1686
01:36:36,474 --> 01:36:37,745
There's a lot more.

1687
01:36:41,034 --> 01:36:44,025
I have nothing, but the utmost respect
for you..as my mentor --

1688
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:47,483
..as my mentor, as..
-What are you doing?

1689
01:36:48,014 --> 01:36:49,833
I just wanna talk from my heart.
I don't wanna do it on record...

1690
01:36:50,464 --> 01:36:52,523
This is just..I get vulnerable.
- Can I finish my..?

1691
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:56,497
Can I finish my sta..
- Of course, of course.

1692
01:36:56,698 --> 01:36:57,697
That's why we're here.

1693
01:36:57,993 --> 01:36:59,273
I respect you.

1694
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:02,533
I think you do, other things besides
respect me.

1695
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:05,912
Hey, hey..hey!
He, what are you doing?

1696
01:37:05,913 --> 01:37:09,753
What are you doing?

1697
01:37:11,062 --> 01:37:13,561
It's just hard for me to control
my passion. I'm a very passionate person.

1698
01:37:13,562 --> 01:37:15,479
We're from the __.
You understand this.

1699
01:37:15,678 --> 01:37:17,448
He goes ice fishing in teh Mid-west.

1700
01:37:17,742 --> 01:37:19,091
That was told to you
in confidence.

1701
01:37:19,771 --> 01:37:22,844
He's an 'Ice fishing guy',
Look at him.

1702
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:24,821
What are you doing?

1703
01:37:25,662 --> 01:37:28,040
It's not you.
That's not you with a gun. Stop it.

1704
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:30,245
You know, it's me.
It's me!

1705
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:31,837
Don't do something
that you don't know anything about.

1706
01:37:32,037 --> 01:37:34,705
Alright?
- Wait, wait..wait. Do not load that gun.

1707
01:37:34,904 --> 01:37:35,904
You drop that gun...

1708
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:37,105
...and then, i'm gonna hit you.
- Don't..don't!

1709
01:37:37,305 --> 01:37:39,239
Watch this, fucko!

1710
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,659
So...

1711
01:37:46,901 --> 01:37:48,528
You wanna use the Sherman suite,

1712
01:37:48,728 --> 01:37:50,314
the entire floor?
- Yes.

1713
01:37:51,129 --> 01:37:52,430
God!
- Of the Plaza Hotel.

1714
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:55,669
What happend to the mafia? I thought you..
- No, no..no. This is where they intersect!

1715
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:58,168
This is where, the two things intersect.
The two world.

1716
01:37:58,169 --> 01:37:59,975
The politicians and the Mafia.

1717
01:38:00,175 --> 01:38:01,488
Victor Tellegio's people,

1718
01:38:01,687 --> 01:38:02,688
who runs resort international..
- Right, right.

1719
01:38:02,889 --> 01:38:04,551
Victor Tellegio, showed his face?

1720
01:38:04,751 --> 01:38:06,458
Yeah, I sat with him.
I sat with Victor Tellegio.

1721
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:08,226
I hung out with him.

1722
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:10,938
We can get him. We can get
his whole organisation.

1723
01:38:11,138 --> 01:38:12,137
As well, as getting..

1724
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:15,378
any numbers of congressemen..
I mean, that's just the...

1725
01:38:15,828 --> 01:38:17,157
that's just peeling the first layer
of the onion.

1726
01:38:17,668 --> 01:38:18,668
Wow.

1727
01:38:20,197 --> 01:38:21,398
How're you..how are you gonna do that?

1728
01:38:21,947 --> 01:38:24,447
We would get ten million dollars..
- Ten million dollars?

1729
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:26,778
Ten million dollars?!
- That's how we just...

1730
01:38:26,979 --> 01:38:28,519
So, what does he say,
he's gonna do this for us?

1731
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,227
How are you trapping him?
- They're gonna promise to buil casinos...

1732
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:32,426
Handle the skims...

1733
01:38:32,527 --> 01:38:33,729
Do the licensing.

1734
01:38:33,929 --> 01:38:36,015
- You have what?
You have him on tape saying this?

1735
01:38:36,436 --> 01:38:38,289
You have that, right?
No.

1736
01:38:39,057 --> 01:38:41,857
I want you to find a safer way,
to get Victor Tellegio on wiere.

1737
01:38:42,447 --> 01:38:45,453
No ten million dollars, that crazy.
- Thank you.

1738
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:49,417
Right? Even to entrap Tallegio.
It's crazy. But...

1739
01:38:50,536 --> 01:38:53,546
You can have the Shermen suite.
- No, no.

1740
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:56,201
..to go and get me some congressmen.

1741
01:38:56,401 --> 01:38:59,927
Go and get some congressmen,
taking bribes.

1742
01:39:00,127 --> 01:39:01,927
I wanna pinch us some congressmen.

1743
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:03,937
Okay..you come back to me.
I'm proud of you.

1744
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,085
Thank you..

1745
01:39:05,865 --> 01:39:06,994
..and Stauton.

1746
01:39:08,304 --> 01:39:11,118
Good luck keeping your job,
by the way. And, staying out of jail.

1747
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:12,318
And, not being killed by the mob!

1748
01:39:12,518 --> 01:39:14,420
But, othewise, you're doing a great job.

1749
01:39:16,724 --> 01:39:18,707
What's the end of the ice fishing story?
- I'm not telling you.

1750
01:39:18,907 --> 01:39:20,200
I'm gonna call your fucking brother,

1751
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:21,399
to find out the end.
- My brother is dead!

1752
01:39:22,134 --> 01:39:24,826
That's how it ends!
He fell to through the fucking ice!

1753
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,912
NO, that's not how he dies.
He die in a different way,

1754
01:39:27,112 --> 01:39:29,156
many years later!

1755
01:39:35,183 --> 01:39:36,583
Listen, I know it's awkward and I..

1756
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:39,673
I just wanna say, i'm sorry alright?

1757
01:39:40,233 --> 01:39:42,380
But I think, we can still
stick together and uh...

1758
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:43,580
still fullfil on our work in here.
We got the Sherman suite.

1759
01:39:44,143 --> 01:39:46,242
You got the whole floor?
- The whole floor, yeah.

1760
01:39:47,673 --> 01:39:48,862
That's good,
- Yeah, you okay?

1761
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:50,954
Yeah. You?

1762
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:53,733
It's alright,
just got hit a little bit.

1763
01:39:53,934 --> 01:39:55,834
My eye, it's a little blurry.

1764
01:39:57,672 --> 01:40:00,021
You okay?
- Yeah, i'm good.

1765
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:01,221
Listen, I'm sorry.
- I'm sory.

1766
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:03,941
I'm sorry'er.

1767
01:40:08,061 --> 01:40:11,221
We can put camera in here.
Right in here, maybe.

1768
01:40:11,421 --> 01:40:12,422
And, we get it all on film.

1769
01:40:12,622 --> 01:40:14,143
You like it?
- We do.

1770
01:40:14,343 --> 01:40:15,342
You know, give me those flowers.

1771
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:17,464
We put the flower vase.
You can put the camera in there.

1772
01:40:17,665 --> 01:40:20,446
And then, we get a clear shot of the couch.
So, we could put the congressman.

1773
01:40:20,646 --> 01:40:22,035
That's right.
That's the idea.

1774
01:40:22,235 --> 01:40:24,039
And Carmine will go to jail after
he delivers us,

1775
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:25,900
Congressmen, soon to be felons.

1776
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,992
Representative of O'connell's on the phone!

1777
01:40:30,192 --> 01:40:31,978
I gotta take this, you guys.
Everyone out, please.

1778
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:34,272
This is sad.
It's just sad!

1779
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:37,602
Dolly, i gotta take this.
- Sorry, everyone out.

1780
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,399
Congressman, how're you doing?

1781
01:40:40,049 --> 01:40:40,943
It's Carmine.

1782
01:40:41,143 --> 01:40:43,224
Tell me, you're gonna be in Trenton.
This week.

1783
01:40:43,423 --> 01:40:46,493
We have an amazing investment
opportunity, I'd like to discuss with you.

1784
01:40:46,989 --> 01:40:48,579
I'm federal agent Richie DiMaso.

1785
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:51,639
I placed 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase.

1786
01:40:51,839 --> 01:40:53,579
For representative, John O'Connel
with the 9th district.

1787
01:40:54,318 --> 01:40:57,271
Representative O'Connel was contacted
by Carmine Polito.

1788
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,472
To ask, if he could obtain
a rapid citizenship,

1789
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:00,291
through an act of congress..

1790
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:02,957
For one, Sheikh Abdullah--
the investor.

1791
01:41:04,218 --> 01:41:05,287
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>

1792
01:41:05,807 --> 01:41:08,068
Oh, John please.
This brings the state back.

1793
01:41:08,537 --> 01:41:10,017
How long we've known each other?

1794
01:41:10,387 --> 01:41:11,802
You know, what's this gonna do for us?

1795
01:41:12,003 --> 01:41:13,002
This is HUGE for the state
of New Jersey.

1796
01:41:13,928 --> 01:41:16,426
Stabilize our economy,
- Hotels, restaurants.

1797
01:41:16,427 --> 01:41:18,313
Carmine sees this.
It's waiting to happen.

1798
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:19,514
This fucking this is waiting to happen!

1799
01:41:19,714 --> 01:41:21,601
But the goddamn bankers!

1800
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,778
They're keeping money on the sidelines.
How're we suppose to get anything done?

1801
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:25,978
Bankers only put money in the game...

1802
01:41:27,046 --> 01:41:29,096
Where they can reap
insane profits!

1803
01:41:29,937 --> 01:41:31,006
The problem is this, Sir?

1804
01:41:31,337 --> 01:41:33,559
The citizenship..situation.

1805
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,629
We gotta expidite this,
as soon as possible.

1806
01:41:40,765 --> 01:41:43,873
I'll tell you,
You came to the right place.

1807
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:46,686
We can make it happen.

1808
01:41:47,145 --> 01:41:48,394
Hey, this is going to happen.

1809
01:41:48,594 --> 01:41:49,593
Understand, this is real.

1810
01:41:49,795 --> 01:41:50,794
On my family...

1811
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:52,890
On my kids. On my life and my work.

1812
01:41:53,091 --> 01:41:54,899
I know that, Carmine.
You are a good man.

1813
01:41:55,098 --> 01:41:56,098
I'm federal agent Richie DiMaso.

1814
01:41:56,299 --> 01:41:58,474
I placed 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase for one...

1815
01:41:58,675 --> 01:42:01,570
representative, Jerry Sanders
of the third district.

1816
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:02,770
I don't wanna do anything illegal.

1817
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:03,970
Please, Jerry
use it as a campaign donation.

1818
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:07,753
Whatever you wanna do.
- Thank you, that means a lot.

1819
01:42:07,952 --> 01:42:10,602
I'm placing 60 thousand dollars into this..
Briefcase for one,

1820
01:42:10,803 --> 01:42:12,592
Eric Keshoygan of the 4th district.

1821
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:15,092
I'm gonna do what i can.
To help, Carmine.

1822
01:42:15,093 --> 01:42:17,592
A 100 thousand dollars
into this briefcase,

1823
01:42:17,593 --> 01:42:21,219

Atlantic City..

1825
01:42:23,022 --> 01:42:24,905
all the way down the shore.

1826
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:26,818
The Mecca, by the sea.

1827
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:31,086
Carmine, you're beloved by your people.
Your constituency...

1828
01:42:31,286 --> 01:42:32,285
It's not even a constituency.

1829
01:42:32,543 --> 01:42:35,707
It's your family.
That's what you represent, a family.

1830
01:42:35,907 --> 01:42:39,273
One small thing you do for this man,
It's a huge thing we do for,

1831
01:42:39,473 --> 01:42:41,334
the people of New Jersey.
This is what we can...

1832
01:42:42,015 --> 01:42:43,402
Irving, what're you doing?

1833
01:42:43,602 --> 01:42:44,602
Where are you going?

1834
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:46,997
Just gotta see a man about a toilet.

1835
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:50,160
Sorry.

1836
01:42:52,661 --> 01:42:54,872
<i>Trust me, this is the probaby the
biggest opportunity,</i>

1837
01:42:55,073 --> 01:42:56,072
<i>That we could have.
- I will go where ever</i>

1838
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,181
<i>I can in the united states...</i>

1839
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,601
<i>I appreciate this.
- On my family, on my kids..</i>

1840
01:43:02,681 --> 01:43:04,963
<i>This needs to happen.
It's gotta happen.</i>

1841
01:43:05,163 --> 01:43:09,310
<i>You have my word.</i>

1842
01:43:20,763 --> 01:43:22,267
Oh, i wanna save us.
I wanna save us!

1843
01:43:22,468 --> 01:43:24,223
I wanna save Carmine,
It's killing me, it's fucking killing...

1844
01:43:24,424 --> 01:43:27,218
The only way to help Carmine
is to do the Tellegio thing.

1845
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:30,462
It's dangerous. It's dangerous.
We gotta get in there,

1846
01:43:30,662 --> 01:43:33,034
We gotta get a wire in there.
We gotta make him feel safe.

1847
01:43:33,469 --> 01:43:35,368
There's only one thing that
could fuck this up.

1848
01:43:35,567 --> 01:43:36,567
And, that's your wife!

1849
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,758
Yeah.

1850
01:44:18,495 --> 01:44:20,607
I don't like your hausband.
You're no better together.

1851
01:44:20,807 --> 01:44:22,064
He doesn't appreciate you.

1852
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,475
But, It happens.
It happened to my marriage.

1853
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:25,957
That's why I went to Miami.

1854
01:44:27,325 --> 01:44:29,002
And, sometimes you just gotta be tough.

1855
01:44:29,202 --> 01:44:30,202
You gotta stand up.

1856
01:44:30,245 --> 01:44:31,686
You gotta leave, you know.

1857
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:35,614
Sometimes, you've gotta let
something die. To let, something live.

1858
01:44:36,055 --> 01:44:38,789
You're too beautiful, to be unhappy.

1859
01:44:39,765 --> 01:44:42,265
I mean, I don't wanna...

1860
01:44:42,925 --> 01:44:44,700
bad mouth my hausband.
But, just...

1861
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,844
..let me bad mouth my hausband
just for a second.

1862
01:44:47,084 --> 01:44:50,029
He just thinks that he knows everything.
And, he's so full of shit.

1863
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:51,229
He's such a liar!

1864
01:44:51,429 --> 01:44:53,120
He thinks that I'm stupid.
But, i'm not stupid.

1865
01:44:53,324 --> 01:44:54,624
I hear him on the phone, arguing.

1866
01:44:54,934 --> 01:44:58,496
He loves Carmine. But, he hates that
other guy. That curly headed...

1867
01:44:58,695 --> 01:44:59,695
IRS guy or whatever.

1868
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:02,793
Who's cowering around my hausband's
ex-lover at that, red headed whore!

1869
01:45:04,764 --> 01:45:06,287
IRS?
- Anyway, you can see that,

1870
01:45:06,487 --> 01:45:07,487
It drives him crazy.

1871
01:45:07,686 --> 01:45:08,687
You said IRS.

1872
01:45:09,513 --> 01:45:11,155
What IRS guy?
What're you talking about?

1873
01:45:11,355 --> 01:45:12,355
I hear them on the phone.

1874
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:15,089
I think that, he's got Irving
in some sort of bind or something..

1875
01:45:15,472 --> 01:45:16,993
And, he's making him do
all these sorts of stuff.

1876
01:45:17,473 --> 01:45:20,562
And so, Irving and Carmine;
are right now are at the Plaza Hotel,

1877
01:45:21,062 --> 01:45:23,402
Throwing all these money away
at like, congress or..

1878
01:45:23,771 --> 01:45:25,989
whatever. They're giving money
to congress or something.

1879
01:45:26,188 --> 01:45:28,520
I don't really know.
But, I over heard it on the phone.

1880
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:32,842
I hate doing this you.

1881
01:45:34,021 --> 01:45:35,682
I gotta go talk to your hausband.

1882
01:45:36,561 --> 01:45:37,841
My boss, he's already angry.

1883
01:45:38,681 --> 01:45:39,478
You stay here.

1884
01:45:39,677 --> 01:45:40,678
I'm gonna give you some money.
For a taxi home.

1885
01:45:41,911 --> 01:45:43,287
Have some dessert.

1886
01:45:43,486 --> 01:45:44,486
Finish the bottle of perseco.

1887
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,721
I'm sorry.

1888
01:45:53,658 --> 01:45:54,810
You alright?

1889
01:45:55,009 --> 01:45:57,195
I don't like change.

1890
01:46:01,395 --> 01:46:03,753
It's really hard for me.

1891
01:46:06,889 --> 01:46:10,058
Sometimes, i think that
I would die before I change.

1892
01:46:10,257 --> 01:46:11,258
Don't say that.

1893
01:46:17,548 --> 01:46:20,254
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna come with me to Miami.

1894
01:46:20,568 --> 01:46:21,747
Don't hurt him too bad.

1895
01:46:21,948 --> 01:46:24,107
He is still Danny's father.

1896
01:46:40,115 --> 01:46:43,755
<i>You know you did. You know you did
You know you did.</i>

1897
01:46:44,108 --> 01:46:46,606
<i>But if this is ever changin'</i>

1898
01:46:46,607 --> 01:46:49,612
<i> world, In which we live in.</i>

1899
01:46:50,207 --> 01:46:54,774
<i>Makes you give in and cry.</i>

1900
01:46:56,822 --> 01:47:01,146
<i>Say live and let die.</i>

1901
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:03,706
<i>Live and let die.</i>

1902
01:47:06,174 --> 01:47:08,277
<i>Live and let die.</i>

1903
01:47:25,778 --> 01:47:27,169
Life is ridiculous.

1904
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:28,990
And, you know that
I'd never say,

1905
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:31,311
anything bad about your father
in front of you. But,

1906
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:32,510
Your father is a sick
son of a bitch.

1907
01:47:34,467 --> 01:47:36,412
Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?

1908
01:47:36,611 --> 01:47:37,984
Don't repeat that!

1909
01:47:38,774 --> 01:47:39,714
But, yes.

1910
01:47:48,623 --> 01:47:50,032
Rosalyn!

1911
01:47:51,113 --> 01:47:52,173
Rosalyn!

1912
01:47:53,373 --> 01:47:54,753
What?
- This is what's wrong..

1913
01:47:54,953 --> 01:47:56,610
in our relationship.
You know where I was recently?

1914
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:57,810
I was in your boyfriend's
fucking car.

1915
01:47:58,273 --> 01:47:59,463
Alright? I saw your nail polish.

1916
01:48:03,872 --> 01:48:06,772
And, what's this i hear about your curly
haired friend working for the government?

1917
01:48:07,642 --> 01:48:09,517
What? Who said that?

1918
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:10,717
Your fucking wife!

1919
01:48:11,642 --> 01:48:14,052
Rosalyn?
- He put a fucking canvas bag,

1920
01:48:14,581 --> 01:48:16,341
over my head!

1921
01:48:16,541 --> 01:48:17,540
Hey, what the fuck?!

1922
01:48:20,034 --> 01:48:23,250
Are you happy now?
Because, he is trying to kill me?!

1923
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:24,452
What are you talking about?!

1924
01:48:24,651 --> 01:48:26,825
What do you think, you're doing?!
- Get out of here!

1925
01:48:27,025 --> 01:48:30,505
Why are you talking so much?
You're gonna get us all killed!

1926
01:48:30,911 --> 01:48:32,309
Danny.
Come here buddy.

1927
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:34,460
Go draw a picture or something.

1928
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,439
You are a sick son of a bitch
for screaming at me like that,

1929
01:48:37,639 --> 01:48:38,638
in front of Danny.

1930
01:48:40,885 --> 01:48:42,085
I'm a sick son of a bitch?

1931
01:48:42,285 --> 01:48:44,380
You tried to fucking get me killed.
I'm a sick son of a bitch?

1932
01:48:44,581 --> 01:48:46,941
My god!
You're driving me so fucking crazy!

1933
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,858
You're boyfriend,
your fucking boyfriend..

1934
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:52,380
will fucking kill me.
He will kill Danny..

1935
01:48:52,581 --> 01:48:54,868
And, he will kill you.
- Stop talking like that!

1936
01:48:55,068 --> 01:48:57,240
He's a mobster, alright.
That's what you're dealing with.

1937
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:01,718
Stop that! You're fine!
He'd have hurted you...

1938
01:49:01,918 --> 01:49:03,192
How do you think that I feel.

1939
01:49:03,392 --> 01:49:04,391
All day when you leave me alone.

1940
01:49:04,592 --> 01:49:08,783
All day! All i've ever wanted
you to do is love me.

1941
01:49:09,193 --> 01:49:10,685
That's all i've ever wanted.

1942
01:49:10,885 --> 01:49:14,480
That's for us to stay married
and for you to love me.

1943
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,660
And, that's why i'm going to Miami.

1944
01:49:17,594 --> 01:49:20,422
I'm going to Miami, with Pete.
I'm going to Miami, with Pete!!!

1945
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:23,143
I finally find somebody
who loves me!

1946
01:49:23,898 --> 01:49:26,397
Just like you've always wanted.

1947
01:49:26,398 --> 01:49:28,231
Miami..not now!

1948
01:49:28,431 --> 01:49:30,077
Too fucking dangerous!
- He likes me just the way I am!

1949
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:32,324
You're gonna stay normal.
- You told me that you wanted to find a

1950
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:35,939
nice quite man!
- Ah, I wanted.

1951
01:49:36,139 --> 01:49:37,138
Doozy, you've picked.

1952
01:49:37,338 --> 01:49:40,185
Ohh, you have that..

1953
01:49:40,386 --> 01:49:41,385
..the most dangerous guy, yeah.

1954
01:49:41,586 --> 01:49:43,743
What'd you expect, Irving.

1955
01:49:43,942 --> 01:49:45,446
I know everybody through you!

1956
01:49:46,236 --> 01:49:47,326
Why can't you just be
happy for me?

1957
01:49:52,362 --> 01:49:53,911
Why are you taking your
heart pill Irving?

1958
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,110
What's going on?

1959
01:49:56,005 --> 01:49:57,405
Irving, take your pill.

1960
01:49:58,555 --> 01:50:02,895
What kind of trouble are you in, Irving?
What is going on?

1961
01:50:03,446 --> 01:50:04,335
What's happening?

1962
01:50:08,404 --> 01:50:09,474
I got a plan.

1963
01:50:12,064 --> 01:50:13,205
You got a plan?
When did you  get it?

1964
01:50:13,924 --> 01:50:14,834
You know what?

1965
01:50:17,743 --> 01:50:19,284
It really fucking came to me.

1966
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:22,074
When i was inside of that
Canvas bag.

1967
01:50:23,373 --> 01:50:25,961
We got two million coming this week!
- You see?

1968
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,161
You think, this is a fucking
down paying plan?

1969
01:50:29,503 --> 01:50:30,873
Are, we series of Chevrolet?

1970
01:50:31,883 --> 01:50:33,996
You ask Victor.

1971
01:50:34,197 --> 01:50:35,643
If he wants...

1972
01:50:37,133 --> 01:50:38,992
..two million this week.
That's real money.

1973
01:50:41,032 --> 01:50:42,059
Two million?
- Real money.

1974
01:50:42,259 --> 01:50:43,259
This week.
- How?

1975
01:50:44,202 --> 01:50:45,242
Wired in.

1976
01:50:50,893 --> 01:50:52,758
Is it true?
What he said about your wive?

1977
01:50:52,957 --> 01:50:53,957
About Rosalyn?

1978
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:55,158
I can save all of us.

1979
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:56,801
And we can save money.

1980
01:50:57,001 --> 01:50:59,216
That'll take care of you.

1981
01:50:59,415 --> 01:51:00,415
And, Danny.

1982
01:51:00,615 --> 01:51:03,276
Okay? But, you gotta
close your mouth.

1983
01:51:03,601 --> 01:51:04,772
I knew it.

1984
01:51:05,592 --> 01:51:09,136
I have always said, Irving.
That you're very very hard.

1985
01:51:09,337 --> 01:51:10,337
To motivate properly.

1986
01:51:10,537 --> 01:51:11,536
And, I knew..

1987
01:51:11,736 --> 01:51:15,117
that Pete was gonna go over there
and knock some sense into your head.

1988
01:51:15,316 --> 01:51:16,316
I've been reading this book, Irving.

1989
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,510
It's by Wayne Dyer, that's the
"Power of intention".

1990
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,789
And, my intention
in setting Pete over to you..

1991
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,300
Was so that,
you could come up with this plan.

1992
01:51:27,519 --> 01:51:28,420
So..you're welcome.

1993
01:51:34,799 --> 01:51:36,070
Thank you, Rosalyn.

1994
01:51:36,679 --> 01:51:38,736
Thank you for the plan.
- You're welcome.

1995
01:51:38,935 --> 01:51:40,009
I appreciate that.

1996
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,769
So, uh..

1997
01:51:43,769 --> 01:51:45,209
We should be partners on this.

1998
01:51:46,118 --> 01:51:47,848
Yeah, i'm a good partner.
I'm almost better then Edith.

1999
01:51:48,658 --> 01:51:51,389
You ever think about that?
You might've under estimated me?

2000
01:51:52,059 --> 01:51:53,568
So, what is our plan?

2001
01:51:54,438 --> 01:51:55,707
Tell me the plan.

2002
01:51:56,848 --> 01:51:58,048
What are you gonna do?

2003
01:51:59,218 --> 01:52:01,462
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'm not gonna say anything.

2004
01:52:01,663 --> 01:52:03,974
But, what do I do
if Pete calls me. What am I supposed say?

2005
01:52:04,175 --> 01:52:06,364
You gotta stop talking about
any government agencies,

2006
01:52:06,564 --> 01:52:08,989
the IRS and tax conspiracies..
and all of that.

2007
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:10,189
You're gonna say, how you're wrong.

2008
01:52:10,388 --> 01:52:11,390
You were wrong about that.

2009
01:52:11,398 --> 01:52:12,517
I'll tell Pete, that I was wrong.

2010
01:52:13,287 --> 01:52:14,568
But, you know that in real life...

2011
01:52:15,127 --> 01:52:16,879
I was right for saying that stuff.

2012
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:20,026
Because that spurt on the actions
that made you come up with this plan.

2013
01:52:20,227 --> 01:52:21,430
So, i will tell Pete.
- Okay.

2014
01:52:21,631 --> 01:52:24,085
The Power of Intention, Irving.

2015
01:52:24,286 --> 01:52:24,995
The Power of Intention.

2016
01:52:26,176 --> 01:52:27,116
Okay.

2017
01:52:27,497 --> 01:52:28,456
Okay.

2018
01:52:28,925 --> 01:52:30,266
You are right.

2019
01:52:30,846 --> 01:52:31,736
You are right.
- Irv?

2020
01:52:41,525 --> 01:52:42,915
Good job peaches.

2021
01:52:43,315 --> 01:52:44,304
Irving.

2022
01:52:44,995 --> 01:52:46,545
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

2023
01:52:49,294 --> 01:52:50,185
And,

2024
01:52:50,525 --> 01:52:51,795
You need to grow up.

2025
01:52:52,855 --> 01:52:54,424
And, you need to face the facts.

2026
01:52:56,474 --> 01:52:58,609
And, i think that both of us
will be a lot happier,

2027
01:52:58,809 --> 01:52:59,809
if we get a divorce.

2028
01:53:02,395 --> 01:53:03,602
Okay.

2029
01:53:03,803 --> 01:53:04,802
Just think about it.

2030
01:53:06,923 --> 01:53:08,588
These things are never easy.

2031
01:53:11,305 --> 01:53:13,281
Alright.

2032
01:53:17,473 --> 01:53:18,513
Irving?

2033
01:53:20,363 --> 01:53:21,543
Good luck, with your plan.

2034
01:53:24,203 --> 01:53:25,663
<i>Necessity, truly is..</i>

2035
01:53:26,167 --> 01:53:27,242
<i>the mother of invention.</i>

2036
01:53:27,812 --> 01:53:31,030
<i>The FBI was willing to wire
the two million dollars,</i>

2037
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:34,803
<i>If it meant, taking down Tellegio
and his entire organisation. </i>

2038
01:53:44,772 --> 01:53:48,956
Mobster like Tellegio
would never meet at the Plaza Hotel,

2039
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:51,016
Put only at the office of his attorney.

2040
01:53:51,217 --> 01:53:53,164
Alphonse Simone.

2041
01:54:49,646 --> 01:54:51,909
Hi, Alphonse Simone.
- Edith Greensly.

2042
01:54:52,108 --> 01:54:53,109
Alphonse Simone.

2043
01:54:55,058 --> 01:54:56,272
Please, have a seat.

2044
01:54:56,473 --> 01:54:57,472
I appreciate the fact that,

2045
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,055
You all came in person.
But, the trip was really unnecessary.

2046
01:55:00,056 --> 01:55:04,312
Because, this whole thing could've
been done with a simple wire transfer.

2047
01:55:04,513 --> 01:55:05,206
As a matter of fact..

2048
01:55:05,636 --> 01:55:07,316
This is the number on the wire,
right here.

2049
01:55:10,716 --> 01:55:12,046
Where is Mr.Tellegio?

2050
01:55:12,996 --> 01:55:15,436
Mr.Tellegio, was unfortunately
called out of town, on business.

2051
01:55:16,026 --> 01:55:16,926
Oh, that's not good.

2052
01:55:17,685 --> 01:55:20,575
We're willing to come here today.
In person, to Mr.Tellegio.

2053
01:55:20,775 --> 01:55:21,774
As a sign of respect,

2054
01:55:22,275 --> 01:55:25,211
To give two million dollars.
- I can assure you that

2055
01:55:25,411 --> 01:55:27,916
i have power of attorney,
- Excuse me, if you let me finish.

2056
01:55:28,116 --> 01:55:28,934
We are willing,

2057
01:55:29,134 --> 01:55:31,769
to give two million dollars today,
on the temp.

2058
01:55:32,345 --> 01:55:35,929
But, without Mr.Tellegio, here..?
- We can't make that decision.

2059
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:43,164
You don't have the authorisation
to make this kind of choice,

2060
01:55:43,363 --> 01:55:44,363
So, don't be hasty alright?

2061
01:55:44,562 --> 01:55:45,563
I'm not being hasty.

2062
01:55:45,763 --> 01:55:47,972
Let's be smart about this. Alright?

2063
01:55:48,172 --> 01:55:49,172
This is not how we do business.

2064
01:55:49,372 --> 01:55:50,372
I'm sorry.

2065
01:55:56,203 --> 01:55:58,734
I think we should hang in there, alright?

2066
01:55:59,593 --> 01:56:00,602
For what?
The guy is not here.

2067
01:56:02,073 --> 01:56:04,024
That's it.
Sorry, I can't do it!

2068
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:07,113
This is a surprise that...
the Sheikh don't like surprises.

2069
01:56:07,314 --> 01:56:08,313
Don't leave!

2070
01:56:08,442 --> 01:56:11,720
Edith, this is not the way
that decision are made.

2071
01:56:12,143 --> 01:56:14,543
No, I understand but,
maybe we can call the Sheikh.

2072
01:56:14,742 --> 01:56:15,742
Let's call the Sheikh.

2073
01:56:17,999 --> 01:56:19,031
It's not the plan.

2074
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:20,232
It's not it.

2075
01:56:21,982 --> 01:56:23,624
I'll call the Sheikh.
Can i use your phone?

2076
01:56:23,824 --> 01:56:24,824
Please, do.

2077
01:56:26,602 --> 01:56:28,831
But, before I do.
I'd like to go over, SPECIFICALLY

2078
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:31,280
what this money would be used for.

2079
01:56:31,481 --> 01:56:34,435
Okay. What we will do,
is we guarantee.

2080
01:56:34,636 --> 01:56:37,641
All proper licenses and contruction permits.

2081
01:56:37,981 --> 01:56:40,480
For any Hotel Casino,

2082
01:56:40,481 --> 01:56:42,747
That is planned to open before
the end of year.

2083
01:56:42,947 --> 01:56:44,845
And, we'll throw in the customary,

2084
01:56:45,853 --> 01:56:47,189
Previleges of protection.

2085
01:56:47,389 --> 01:56:48,620
What if there's obstacles?

2086
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:51,112
What will you do
- Obstacles...

2087
01:56:51,312 --> 01:56:52,992
We are prepared to overcome
any obstacles.

2088
01:56:53,193 --> 01:56:55,322
But, this is a big enterprise.
- If we've to pay somebody off..

2089
01:56:55,521 --> 01:56:56,522
We'll pay somebody off.

2090
01:56:56,839 --> 01:56:59,338
If we have to lean on somebody,

2091
01:56:59,339 --> 01:57:02,488
We'll intimidate somebody.
We are experienced!

2092
01:57:02,687 --> 01:57:03,689
This is our business.

2093
01:57:03,888 --> 01:57:04,888
That's poweful stuffs.

2094
01:57:05,128 --> 01:57:06,659
Thank you.
- And, I'll tell you something else.

2095
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:08,429
At the end of this.

2096
01:57:08,899 --> 01:57:11,398
We'll teach you, how to skim.
And, how to cut it up.

2097
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,898
And, make some money
on the side. Because..

2098
01:57:13,899 --> 01:57:15,660
WE invented skimming.

2099
01:57:15,861 --> 01:57:16,860
We've been doing it for
thirty years!

2100
01:57:17,528 --> 01:57:19,846
Thank you.
Thank you, for clarifying that.

2101
01:57:20,046 --> 01:57:21,047
Okay.

2102
01:57:21,049 --> 01:57:22,718
I'm very happy.

2103
01:57:25,247 --> 01:57:26,338
I think that,
that will be okay for the Sheikh.

2104
01:57:28,948 --> 01:57:32,152
This is the Sheikh.
- Mr.Tellegio, is not here.

2105
01:57:32,352 --> 01:57:34,228
It's just Mr.Alphose Simone,
his lawyer.

2106
01:57:34,428 --> 01:57:35,607
Are we still okay,
to wire the money?

2107
01:57:36,688 --> 01:57:38,617
Simone can take the wire.
What's the number?

2108
01:57:39,736 --> 01:57:42,407
531..
<font color=#A4DC50>78P..</font>78P..<font color=#A4DC50>76</font>..76.

2109
01:57:45,457 --> 01:57:47,240
The funds have transfered.

2110
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:48,439
<i>The funds have transfered.</i>

2111
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:52,213
The money has been wired.

2112
01:57:54,995 --> 01:57:56,747
I think, we have a deal.

2113
01:57:57,226 --> 01:57:58,556
Pleasure doing business with you.

2114
01:57:59,115 --> 01:58:01,615
Okay, thank you very much,
Mr.Simone.

2115
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:04,114
Well, thank you.
- The Sheikh is very excited.

2116
01:58:04,115 --> 01:58:06,976
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other.
- Oh, I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other.

2117
01:58:07,516 --> 01:58:09,726
I'm looking forward to it.
- So, am I.

2118
01:58:09,926 --> 01:58:10,926
You might get sick of me.

2119
01:58:11,355 --> 01:58:15,985
Like these two.
- I don't think I'll get sick of you.

2120
01:58:17,845 --> 01:58:20,895
Goodbye, nice meeting you.

2121
01:58:34,288 --> 01:58:35,363
It happened!

2122
01:58:36,354 --> 01:58:37,453
Finally!

2123
01:58:38,104 --> 01:58:39,733
Finally, we get someone in the bag.

2124
01:58:44,578 --> 01:58:46,323
Oh, oh..oh!
Wait, wait..wait?

2125
01:58:47,163 --> 01:58:49,822
<i>If we've to pay somebody off..
We'll pay somebody off.</i>

2126
01:58:50,182 --> 01:58:51,523
<i>If we have to lean on somebody,</i>

2127
01:58:52,002 --> 01:58:53,317
<i>... intimidate somebody.</i>

2128
01:58:53,517 --> 01:58:54,516
INTIMIDATE!

2129
01:59:34,184 --> 01:59:35,800
Yeah, but I gotta do it.

2130
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,239
What do you mean, there is no Sheikh?
What does that mean?

2131
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:43,209
There is no Sheikh.

2132
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,416
I wanna face you like a man.
B'cos, I wanna be real about it.

2133
01:59:49,616 --> 01:59:50,616
Alright?
- Who's the man?

2134
01:59:52,919 --> 01:59:53,839
Who is they?

2135
01:59:54,038 --> 01:59:55,039
That he's the fence.

2136
01:59:55,239 --> 01:59:57,622
A fence?
- Yeah.

2137
01:59:58,278 --> 01:59:59,268
Irving...

2138
02:00:02,318 --> 02:00:04,318
look, i'm a good person.

2139
02:00:04,518 --> 02:00:05,517
You are a good person.

2140
02:00:05,998 --> 02:00:08,028
I've been doing this for a long time.
For twenty years!

2141
02:00:10,188 --> 02:00:11,458
Do you think,
I would've taken that money.

2142
02:00:11,907 --> 02:00:12,938
If it wasn't the right
thing to do?

2143
02:00:13,317 --> 02:00:14,447
Now, look..
- Huh?

2144
02:00:14,858 --> 02:00:16,068
You're a good person.

2145
02:00:16,387 --> 02:00:19,157
I know that, but in all honesty...
- You said that was the only way Irv.

2146
02:00:19,937 --> 02:00:22,987
You chased me, you remember?
- They fucking made me do it.

2147
02:00:23,897 --> 02:00:26,975
I was asked to do that or sit in jail.
- You made me go back to the plaza,

2148
02:00:27,175 --> 02:00:28,175
To take that money.
You piece of shit!

2149
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:30,386
I was gone!

2150
02:00:31,007 --> 02:00:34,133
You fucking prick!
You motherfucker!!!

2151
02:00:34,332 --> 02:00:36,701
You fucking chased me,
you piece of shit!

2152
02:00:37,525 --> 02:00:39,196
Carmine?
- I was gone! I left.

2153
02:00:39,756 --> 02:00:42,472
Everything all right.
- Please, Dolly. Just go upstairs.

2154
02:00:42,672 --> 02:00:43,695
Alright..
- Take the kid and go upstairs.

2155
02:00:43,894 --> 02:00:44,894
Please..please just go.
- Of course..

2156
02:00:46,816 --> 02:00:47,908
I'll make this right.

2157
02:00:48,109 --> 02:00:49,109
I came here, because..
I wanna make it right.

2158
02:00:49,506 --> 02:00:50,746
Look at my face.

2159
02:00:51,425 --> 02:00:52,705
You tell me that I'm lying to you.

2160
02:00:54,465 --> 02:00:57,735
When i say that, everything i do,
is for the good of the people,

2161
02:00:57,935 --> 02:00:58,935
Of New Jersey.

2162
02:00:59,304 --> 02:01:01,115
Everything, I do.

2163
02:01:01,764 --> 02:01:03,004
Is for them.

2164
02:01:06,205 --> 02:01:07,454
Am I lying to you?

2165
02:01:07,654 --> 02:01:09,685
I never had a friend like you before.

2166
02:01:11,994 --> 02:01:13,764
I used that money
for that goddamn casino.

2167
02:01:17,034 --> 02:01:18,593
I got some fucking leverage, alright?

2168
02:01:19,374 --> 02:01:20,694
I can help you out.

2169
02:01:21,334 --> 02:01:23,511
This is all shit.
This is all bullshit.

2170
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,713
Look at this thing.

2171
02:01:25,732 --> 02:01:26,852
Look at this.

2172
02:01:28,153 --> 02:01:30,953
Ceremonial fucking knife.
What is this, bullshit. Some toy?

2173
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:37,483
Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you.
- Get out.

2174
02:01:37,682 --> 02:01:38,502
We can help you out.

2175
02:01:40,462 --> 02:01:41,652
Please get out of my house, Irving.

2176
02:01:42,623 --> 02:01:45,615
Will you please leave.
I'm asking you nicely, please leave.

2177
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:48,262
Get out of my house, go!

2178
02:01:49,012 --> 02:01:50,782
Get out of our house!

2179
02:01:51,282 --> 02:01:54,921
Oh, fuck!
I'm sorry...i'm sorry.

2180
02:01:55,611 --> 02:01:59,461
I don't mean for this to happen.

2181
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:03,301
This is what matters to me most.
And, you're crushing that.

2182
02:02:04,021 --> 02:02:05,312
You're gonna take me away from them?

2183
02:02:05,512 --> 02:02:06,512
I didn't wanna have this to
happen ever.

2184
02:02:06,712 --> 02:02:07,711
Fucking son of a bitch!

2185
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:12,634
You son of a bitch!
- I just wanna make it right.

2186
02:02:12,834 --> 02:02:13,834
Just get out of my house.

2187
02:02:14,033 --> 02:02:15,033
Look what you made me do.
Pleae go.

2188
02:02:15,234 --> 02:02:16,233
I'm sorry Carmine.

2189
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:23,949
Get out of here!
Get out!

2190
02:02:25,499 --> 02:02:27,709
No, Carmine...what's happening?

2191
02:02:31,754 --> 02:02:34,811
<i>Oh, My God!
No!</i>

2192
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:38,458
Oh, fuck.
- Irving!

2193
02:02:38,968 --> 02:02:40,360
Irving, are you all right?

2194
02:02:41,917 --> 02:02:43,093
Where're your heart pills?

2195
02:02:43,293 --> 02:02:44,293
Where are your heart pills?

2196
02:02:46,328 --> 02:02:47,198
There you go.

2197
02:02:49,778 --> 02:02:51,228
Okay, come on.

2198
02:03:02,797 --> 02:03:05,647
I gotta lie down.

2199
02:03:06,707 --> 02:03:08,637
Just rest.

2200
02:03:32,025 --> 02:03:33,045
You ready?

2201
02:03:33,245 --> 02:03:36,476
Yeah.

2202
02:03:55,594 --> 02:03:56,764
Please.

2203
02:03:57,455 --> 02:03:58,724
Come and sit down.

2204
02:04:11,143 --> 02:04:12,292
You know where
the two million dollars is?

2205
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:13,973
Two million?

2206
02:04:14,803 --> 02:04:16,680
Yeah.
- With uh, Victor Tellegio,

2207
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:17,880
and Alphonse Simone.

2208
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:19,079
No, actually..
it's not with..

2209
02:04:19,971 --> 02:04:22,038
Victor Tellegio or Alphonse Simone.

2210
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:23,239
He fucking knows about it.

2211
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:24,438
It's gone missing.

2212
02:04:24,652 --> 02:04:25,812
Did you know that?

2213
02:04:26,632 --> 02:04:29,339
I know nothing about that.
Where is it gone?

2214
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:30,653
That's interesting,
you would say that. Because,

2215
02:04:31,182 --> 02:04:33,697
While you're on your way
over here we got an..

2216
02:04:33,897 --> 02:04:34,896
annonymous phone call..

2217
02:04:36,162 --> 02:04:37,512
from someone.

2218
02:04:37,713 --> 02:04:38,713
Who said that,

2219
02:04:39,642 --> 02:04:41,161
in exchange,

2220
02:04:41,661 --> 02:04:43,923
for immunity for the two of you...

2221
02:04:44,123 --> 02:04:45,123
And, reduced sentence
for Carmine Polito.

2222
02:04:47,171 --> 02:04:48,820
We'll get our two million dollars back.

2223
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,321
That's interesting.
That's very interesting.

2224
02:04:53,091 --> 02:04:54,435
I have no idea.

2225
02:04:54,635 --> 02:04:57,129
No, idea why?
- Not, what you're talking about.

2226
02:04:57,329 --> 02:04:59,730
I get it.
I under-estimated you, right?

2227
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:01,790
See, someone has leverage.

2228
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:05,017
Anthony, fuck them.
Fuck them, it's over!

2229
02:05:05,218 --> 02:05:07,418
We got them or wire fraught.
It's over, you're both done!

2230
02:05:07,419 --> 02:05:09,490
I don't think so, i don't think so.
- Oh, you don't think so?

2231
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,519
Richard, you requested the two million.

2232
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:16,530
And, you gave Brenda
the account number.

2233
02:05:16,731 --> 02:05:17,730
We didn't do any of that.

2234
02:05:19,415 --> 02:05:21,069
None of it.

2235
02:05:21,709 --> 02:05:23,308
How do we know that,
You don't have the money?

2236
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:27,891
Am I living in a fucking nightmare, right now?
- I find this a little offensive.

2237
02:05:28,318 --> 02:05:30,022
Really, I find this a little offensive.

2238
02:05:33,319 --> 02:05:35,938
Listen to me,  we're dealing with
a very clever individual.

2239
02:05:36,137 --> 02:05:37,138
Richard.

2240
02:05:37,339 --> 02:05:40,085
Think about it, alright?

2241
02:05:40,519 --> 02:05:41,688
You had some big arrest.

2242
02:05:42,358 --> 02:05:44,983
Yeah, U.S congressmen.
You'll look good.

2243
02:05:45,182 --> 02:05:46,697
You're gonna be all over the news.

2244
02:05:47,818 --> 02:05:49,317
You know,
what doesn't look good?

2245
02:05:50,017 --> 02:05:52,311
Story about gross incompetence.

2246
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,045
I have a warrant for,

2247
02:05:54,246 --> 02:05:56,206
sorry..do i have the wrong office?

2248
02:05:57,467 --> 02:05:58,726
This is 701..?

2249
02:05:59,476 --> 02:06:01,046
Alphonse Simone?
- This is 701.

2250
02:06:02,016 --> 02:06:05,291
My name is Roger Thickwen.
I've had this office for 25 years.

2251
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,491
I'm a divorce attorney.

2252
02:06:11,227 --> 02:06:13,725
You lost 2 million dollars
of taxpayer money?

2253
02:06:13,726 --> 02:06:14,924
Because, you're confused,

2254
02:06:15,124 --> 02:06:18,306
about the location and the identity
of Victor Tellegio's attorney?

2255
02:06:19,266 --> 02:06:23,272
The role of Tellegio's attorney,
Alphonse Simone was played by our friend,

2256
02:06:23,471 --> 02:06:25,849
Ed Malone.
The cold cut king of Long Island.

2257
02:06:26,065 --> 02:06:27,285
Whose party, we were at.

2258
02:06:27,865 --> 02:06:29,294
When Sydney and I first met.

2259
02:06:29,914 --> 02:06:31,265
<i>Alphonse Simone</i>

2260
02:06:32,514 --> 02:06:34,145
People believe what
they wanna believe, Richie.

2261
02:06:34,934 --> 02:06:37,433
No, b'cos you conned me.
That's why. Because,

2262
02:06:37,434 --> 02:06:39,218
fucking conned me.
You did.

2263
02:06:39,418 --> 02:06:42,288
That, that doesn't sound
so good either.

2264
02:06:42,488 --> 02:06:43,854
Right there.
You know what i mean.

2265
02:06:44,053 --> 02:06:45,054
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2266
02:06:45,643 --> 02:06:47,703
But, let's just assume..
You wanna go with that story.

2267
02:06:48,343 --> 02:06:49,444
Really?

2268
02:06:50,184 --> 02:06:51,514
That's the story, you wanna go with?

2269
02:06:52,073 --> 02:06:55,383
Alright? That's what
you want the New York Times to hear.

2270
02:06:56,863 --> 02:06:58,863
That, you got conned..

2271
02:06:59,533 --> 02:07:02,053
By the very con men,

2272
02:07:02,552 --> 02:07:04,033
Who you 'forced'..

2273
02:07:04,623 --> 02:07:06,123
to entrap the members of congress.

2274
02:07:06,763 --> 02:07:07,962
In the first place.

2275
02:07:08,462 --> 02:07:09,796
That's what you wanna go with.

2276
02:07:09,997 --> 02:07:12,647
That doesn't sound so good,
for your whole thing.

2277
02:07:12,847 --> 02:07:13,847
Does it?

2278
02:07:14,402 --> 02:07:15,391
How ironic...

2279
02:07:16,631 --> 02:07:17,692
that the ones who're
working hardest.

2280
02:07:18,132 --> 02:07:20,802
To get, the economy of
New Jersey's going.

2281
02:07:22,122 --> 02:07:23,741
Those are the ones
you round up.

2282
02:07:25,161 --> 02:07:26,706
Why? why..b'cos what.

2283
02:07:26,907 --> 02:07:27,908
They are the easiest
to go after?

2284
02:07:28,701 --> 02:07:30,911
What about the real bullshit artists?

2285
02:07:32,891 --> 02:07:35,382
You didn't even
come close to the big leagues.

2286
02:07:35,582 --> 02:07:37,697
Those big guys.
The money men.

2287
02:07:39,410 --> 02:07:40,990
That's what I was trying
to go after.

2288
02:07:41,690 --> 02:07:44,527
I'm sorry to telling you,
you got none of 'em.

2289
02:07:49,269 --> 02:07:50,941
You know Richard, i think uh..

2290
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:54,737
We may call you as a witness.
But, otherwise you're done.

2291
02:07:54,936 --> 02:07:55,938
I think you better go home.

2292
02:07:57,474 --> 02:07:58,450
Stauton.

2293
02:07:58,650 --> 02:08:00,800
Go on home, Richard.

2294
02:08:15,737 --> 02:08:17,246
<i>We took down some very big guys.</i>

2295
02:08:17,446 --> 02:08:18,167
<i>Among some who..</i>

2296
02:08:18,798 --> 02:08:22,288
<i>They were just doing business as usual.
Helping their community, served their states.</i>

2297
02:08:23,087 --> 02:08:25,958
<i>But, some of them knew.
They have larceny in their blood.</i>

2298
02:08:26,728 --> 02:08:28,127
<i>May never admitted it.</i>

2299
02:08:28,458 --> 02:08:31,268
<i>But, in all..
were Six Congressmen.</i>

2300
02:08:31,727 --> 02:08:32,776
<i>One United States Senator.</i>

2301
02:08:34,337 --> 02:08:37,423
<i>And my friend, Carmine Polito.</i>

2302
02:08:40,676 --> 02:08:41,907
<i>We gave the two million back.</i>

2303
02:08:42,677 --> 02:08:44,247
<i>So, Carmine got a reduced sentence.</i>

2304
02:08:44,796 --> 02:08:46,256
<i>18 months.</i>

2305
02:08:47,076 --> 02:08:49,466
<i>The lost of his friendship...</i>

2306
02:08:50,986 --> 02:08:53,554
<i>..will haunt me for the rest of my life.</i>

2307
02:08:56,536 --> 02:08:58,160
<i>When the story was written,</i>

2308
02:08:58,855 --> 02:09:00,165
<i>Richie DiMaso's name..</i>

2309
02:09:00,576 --> 02:09:02,045
<i>...was never mentioned.</i>

2310
02:09:14,505 --> 02:09:15,755
<i>Syd and I,
we moved in together.</i>

2311
02:09:17,844 --> 02:09:19,094
<i>Rosalyn...</i>

2312
02:09:19,964 --> 02:09:23,109
The car is a little dinked up.
I'm a little stiff..but..

2313
02:09:23,309 --> 02:09:25,809
Whatever, I don't wanna talk
about it.

2314
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:28,725
She will always be interesting.

2315
02:09:30,204 --> 02:09:32,053
You know, my boss
knows you did him a solid.

2316
02:09:32,424 --> 02:09:33,738
Yes, I did.

2317
02:09:33,938 --> 02:09:34,939
We never took any records.

2318
02:09:36,613 --> 02:09:39,084
I was never gona let that happen.

2319
02:09:39,284 --> 02:09:40,563
Irv?

2320
02:09:45,454 --> 02:09:47,622
I'm done with that nail finish.

2321
02:09:48,322 --> 02:09:52,392
By for now.
I'll see ya next weekend.

2322
02:09:59,967 --> 02:10:01,453
<i>Our Conning days.
Were behind us.</i>

2323
02:10:04,381 --> 02:10:06,202
<i>You can fool yourself
for just so long.</i>

2324
02:10:07,331 --> 02:10:10,981
<i>Then, you're next re-invention
better have your damn feet on the ground.</i>

2325
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:17,901
<i>We got a loan from a bank.
And, we're able to go a gellary legitimate.</i>

2326
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:21,671
<i>The art of survival...</i>

2327
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:23,450
<i>..is a story that never ends.</i>

1
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,581
I always knew we
were a fairly odd family.

2
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,641
First there was me.

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,019
Too tall. Too skinny.
Too orange.

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,022
My mum was lovely,
but not like other mums.

5
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,549
There was something solid about her.

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,694
Something rectangular,
busy and unsentimental.

7
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,571
Her fashion icon
was the Queen.

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,909
Dad, well, he was more normal. He always
seemed to have time on his hands.

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,329
After giving up teaching university
students on his 50th birthday,

10
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,708
he was eternally available
for a leisurely chat or

11
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,042
to let me win at table tennis.

12
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,294
Yes.

13
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,255
And then there was Mum's brother,
Uncle Desmond.

14
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:33,384
Always impeccably dressed. He
spent the days just, well,

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,094
being Uncle Desmond.

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,097
He was the most charming and least
clever man you could ever meet.

17
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,018
His mind was on other things,
though we never found out what.

18
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,021
And then, finally there was Catherine.

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,857
Katie. Kit Kat. My sister.

20
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,527
In a household of sensible jackets
and haircuts there was this,

21
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,197
well, what can I call her, nature thing.

22
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,118
With her elfin eyes, her purple
T - shirts and her eternally bare feet,

23
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,704
she was then, and still is to me,

24
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,499
about the most wonderful thing in the world.

25
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,420
All in all, it was a pretty good childhood.
Full of repeated rhythms and patterns.

26
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,214
By the time I was 21, we were still

27
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,633
having tea on the beach every single day.

28
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,552
Skimming stones and eating sandwiches,

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,931
summer and winter,
no matter what the weather.

30
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,896
And every Friday evening, a film,

31
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,774
no matter what the weather.

32
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,946
And then once a year,
the dreaded New Year's Eve party.

33
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,756
Yeah, I might just get one.

34
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,679
You're absolutely gorgeous.

35
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,266
I'm Katie. What am I drinking?

36
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,935
This is very expensive stuff.

37
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,395
Cheers. Cheers.

38
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,744
Come on, it's nearly midnight.

39
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,830
We're all going through.
We're going through.

40
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,916
Look, I've gotta find you a...

41
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,793
God!

42
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,755
Everyone makes little mistakes.
It's fine. Come on.

43
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:41,137
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

44
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,306
Happy New Year!

45
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,516
Happy New Year.

46
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,436
Sorry.

47
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,283
And so I woke up the next morning,

48
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,119
hung-over, ashamed of myself,

49
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,913
and not realising it was the day

50
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,539
that would change my life forever.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,876
Get up, stupid.

52
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,005
Dad wants you.

53
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,716
Hello. Sexy pyjamas.

54
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,890
Tim, come in.

55
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,308
Do

56
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,644
Sit down.

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,689
That's very formal.

58
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,150
Well, um, yeah.

59
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,027
This is an odd moment for me

60
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,237
because I had the same moment with my

61
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,823
father when I'd just
turned 21, and after it,

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,621
my life was never the same, so I
approach it pretty, um, nervously.

63
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,705
Okay.

64
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,249
When you're ready.
It's all very mysterious.

65
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,043
Right.

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,465
Tim, my dear son, the...

67
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,636
The simple fact is the men in this family

68
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,222
have always had the ability to...

69
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,183
This is going to sound strange,

70
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,312
be prepared for strangeness.
Get ready for spooky time,

71
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,357
but there's this family secret.

72
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:21,028
And the secret is that
the men in the family can

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,658
travel in time.

74
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,870
Well, more accurately, travel back in time.

75
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,998
We can't travel into the future.

76
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,874
This is such a weird joke.

77
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,252
It's seriously not a joke.

78
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,758
So you're saying that you
and granddad, and his brothers

79
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,219
could all travel back in time?
Absolutely.

80
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,263
And you still do? Absolutely.

81
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,516
Although it's not as dramatic as it sounds.
It's only in my own life.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,602
I can only go to places where I
actually was and can remember.

83
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,440
I can't kill Hitler or shag
Helen of Troy, unfortunately.

84
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,774
Okay, stop.

85
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,484
Um...

86
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,946
if it's true, which it isn't.
Although it is.

87
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,366
Although it isn't, obviously. But if
it was, which it's not. Which it is.

88
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,452
Which it isn't.
But if it was, how would I...

89
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,704
The "How" is the easy bit, in fact.

90
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
You go into a dark place, big cupboards are

91
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,584
very useful generally.
Toilets, at a pinch.

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,045
Then you clench your fists like this.

93
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,629
Think of the moment you're going to

94
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,256
and you'll find yourself there.

95
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,634
After a bit of a stumble
and a rumble and a tumble.

96
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,136
Wow.

97
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,305
Is as good a reaction as any.

98
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,601
I think I plumped for "fuck!"
but it was the '70s.

99
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,269
No, this is so obviously a joke.

100
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,896
It's not a joke.

101
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,774
Why would I lie to someone I'm

102
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,525
fairly fond of?

103
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,735
Okay.

104
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,570
But, when I come back downstairs

105
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,323
after standing in a cupboard
with my fists clenched,

106
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,658
you're gonna be in so much trouble.

107
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,410
Well, let's see, shall we?

108
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,665
And, Tim, try and do something interesting.

109
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,501
So much trouble.

110
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,586
I mean it. Really.

111
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,930
Right.

112
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,257
Wow!

113
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,524
You all right, Tim?

114
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes. Yeah. Good, ace. Yeah.

115
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,779
Good, come on. it's nearly
midnight and we've got to find...

116
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,072
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

117
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,536
Whoo! Midnight.

118
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,747
10, 9, 8, 7,

119
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:24,628
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

120
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,964
Happy New Year!

121
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,223
Thank you, Tim.

122
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,766
You're welcome, Polly.

123
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,546
Does Mum know?

124
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,667
Not a whistle.

125
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,808
Strange. And what about the whole...
Butterfly effect thing. What can I say?

126
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,097
We don't seem to have
messed up civilisation yet.

127
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:10,499
It's gonna be a complicated year.

128
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,009
It's gonna be a complicated life.

129
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,429
What have you done with it?

130
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,640
For me, it's books, books, books.

131
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,934
I've read everything a man could wish to.

132
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,688
Twice. Dickens three times.
Any first thoughts?

133
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,776
Well, I suppose apart from getting
a slightly better haircut... Yeah.

134
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,324
Money would be the obvious thing.

135
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,695
Very mixed blessing.

136
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,460
Utterly screwed up your grandfather's life.

137
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,199
Left him without love or friends.

138
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,743
I've never bumped into a
genuinely happy rich person.

139
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,912
It would be nice not to have to work.

140
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,747
No, that's a real recipe for disaster.

141
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,316
Look what happened to Uncle Fred.
What happened to Uncle Fred?

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,777
Absolutely sod all.

143
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,070
Wasted his life.

144
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,155
You have to use it for
things that you really think

145
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,074
will make your life the
way you want it to be.

146
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,343
Come on, really think about this.

147
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,427
Well,

148
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,181
to be honest, I suppose, at the moment,

149
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,227
it would be just great if it
could help me get a girlfriend.

150
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,728
Wow.

151
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,190
Massive. Yeah.

152
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,943
The mothership.

153
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,031
For me, it was always gonna be about love.

154
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,951
And that summer I walked
into the eye of the storm.

155
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,289
Her name was Charlotte.
Cousin of Kit Kat's

156
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,874
handsome but nasty boyfriend Jimmy.

157
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,713
And she was staying for two whole months.

158
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,552
Just one. Not both of them.

159
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,805
Tim,

160
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,558
will you do my back?

161
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,018
Absolutely!

162
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,898
Very keen!

163
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,945
Whoa! No. No.

164
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,906
No. No, no. No, no, no.

165
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,576
Is it in my hair? Yes!

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,046
Tim. Will you do my back?

167
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,631
Sure. Just give us a sec.

168
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:17,968
Okay.

169
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,940
Thank you.

170
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,402
Now...

171
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,286
Ooh. Nice.

172
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,288
It's my area.

173
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,169
It was a summer of suntan and torture.

174
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,047
I invited my foolish
friend Jay around for tennis

175
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,383
because I thought he'd make me look good.

176
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,264
I was wrong!

177
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,600
What are you doing? No.

178
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,231
Charlotte just made
both of us look like idiots.

179
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,816
Bad luck, Tim.

180
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,989
How the hell are you meant
to concentrate on your game?

181
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,742
How are you meant to live your life

182
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,994
with this sort of shit going down?

183
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,332
It never got better until suddenly

184
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,918
it was almost too late.

185
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,796
Well, Charlotte, our final lunch.

186
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,172
No!

187
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,801
And it's been really, really
lovely having you all summer.

188
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,969
It has.

189
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,137
Thank you.
Thank you.

190
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,513
It really has.

191
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,931
Hasn't it, Desmond?

192
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,224
Beg your pardon?

193
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,476
Lovely having Charlotte here all summer.

194
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,311
Charlotte? Who's Charlotte?

195
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,689
Come on, darling. Charlotte,
sitting next to you.

196
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,318
Yes, of course. Of course.
Charlotte. Hi.

197
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,529
Lovely to meet you.

198
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,328
Have you enjoyed having
Charlotte here all summer, Tim?

199
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,956
Yeah.

200
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,375
There goes August.

201
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,507
I've introduced him to
most things, haven't I?

202
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,046
You did. You were
much more sophisticated.

203
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,883
In a quiet way, I like to think.

204
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,064
Come in.

205
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,651
Charlotte. Yeah!

206
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,201
As it's your last night,
can I ask you a question?

207
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,828
Yeah. Ask away.

208
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
No, wait.

209
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,918
It's not going to be about love, is it?

210
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,586
Love? What?

211
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,256
Well, it's just that Kit Kat warned me that
if you were to ever mention it, I should be

212
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,550
very firm with you and tell you

213
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,844
you must treat me like your sister

214
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,387
and not be stupid.

215
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,266
Or have I just made a total fool of myself

216
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,993
and you were actually going to ask me for

217
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,686
late night last minute tennis tips?

218
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,356
No, it was the love thing.

219
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,107
Well.

220
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,569
That's very sweet of you.

221
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,698
It's just a shame you
left it till the last night.

222
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,620
You should have tried creeping along
the corridor while we still had time.

223
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,790
Okay, the "last night" was a bad idea?

224
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,795
Very bad idea. it feels like an ever
so slightly insulting afterthought.

225
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,464
"Last night" was never going to work.

226
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,134
All right. Good. I've got it.

227
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,906
Come in.

228
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,243
Tim. Hi. Charlotte.

229
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,329
Hi. Sit down.

230
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,668
I know you've probably suspected this,

231
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,422
but over the last month I've fallen
completely in love with you.

232
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,843
Now obviously this was gonna happen

233
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,097
because you're a goddess with that face

234
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,974
and that hair,

235
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,269
but even if you didn't have a nice face,

236
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,939
and even if you had absolutely no hair

237
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,775
because of some bizarre medical reason,

238
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,154
I'd still adore you,

239
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,697
and I...

240
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,869
I just wondered whether, by any
chance, you might share my feelings.

241
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,204
Wow.

242
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,416
I tell you what.

243
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,044
Why don't we see how the summer goes

244
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,964
and then you ask me again on my last night?

245
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,635
Your last night? Yes.

246
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:14,014
Try me on the last night. See
what happens then, shall we?

247
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,224
It's exciting.

248
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,643
Right.

249
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,439
No, it's a perfect plan. That's
absolutely perfect. Last night.

250
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,982
Last night.

251
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,445
Thanks very much.

252
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,114
Night-night, Timmy.

253
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,415
Big lesson number one,

254
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,710
all the time travel in the world
can't make someone love you.

255
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,836
Bye!

256
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,256
So the love of my life just drove away.

257
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,512
And the very next day
it was my turn to leave.

258
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,267
There you go. Don't
spend it all at once.

259
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,978
Thanks.

260
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,401
Don't call too often, your mother
doesn't like to be disturbed.

261
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,695
Okay. Thanks.

262
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,467
I caught the train to London in
search of a future and a girlfriend.

263
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,389
I was staying in St John's
Wood, near Abbey Road,

264
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,642
with a playwright friend
of my dad's called Harry.

265
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,688
It's always nice to have family connections
when you're a new kid in town.

266
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,371
What the fuck do you want?

267
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,708
I'm James's son.

268
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,001
Who?

269
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,337
James Lake. What about him?

270
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,759
He said you had a room.

271
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
Go in there and wait.

272
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,933
Quietly. I mean it,
don't make a sound.

273
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,436
Or I'll kill you.

274
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,574
I was actually having the first
good idea I've had for a decade

275
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,201
when you rang on the doorbell.

276
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,620
But now it's gone.

277
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,372
You little shit.

278
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,082
How's your dad?

279
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,462
Weird cock, I always thought.
Something weird about him.

280
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,379
Really?

281
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,965
Yeah, I never really liked him, actually.

282
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,511
Your mum still look like Andy Warhol?

283
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,637
What?

284
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,599
That, by the way, is my wife.

285
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,226
Nice.

286
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,792
Yeah, you wouldn't like her at first.

287
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,980
Sarcastic cow.

288
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,275
But eventually you'd realise that

289
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,445
she's the best human being in the world.

290
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,448
Which is why she left me, of course.

291
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,577
Here you go.

292
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,957
Try not to make too much noise,
particularly when having sex.

293
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,625
No chance of that.

294
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,419
Christ, two losers in one house.

295
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,505
That is my daughter.

296
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,802
Have sex with her if you like.
Apparently everyone else has.

297
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,557
It wasn't a hopeful
set-up for romance.

298
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,977
And work didn't help on that score either.

299
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,105
The world of law seems
to be entirely full of men.

300
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,653
Hello. I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you.
A real thrill.

301
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,740
Well, who knows, we might become,
you know, pals, et cetera.

302
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,827
Who the hell are you? Tim Lake.

303
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,079
Well, I hope you're better than this clown.

304
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,248
Come on, Roger.

305
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,875
It's Rory, actually.

306
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,543
I've been here a year and a half.

307
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,212
I'm just saying that to be nice.
It's two years actually.

308
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:20,886
So six lonely months went by
and it was still just me and Harry.

309
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,513
Me lawyer-ing every hour
of the day and night.

310
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,892
And him putting the finishing
touches to his new play.

311
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,521
No matter how many girls
there were in the world,

312
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,774
I always seemed to end up with Rory.

313
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,901
Hello.

314
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,069
Until, out of the blue,

315
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,450
on a dodgy night out with dodgy
Jay, something miraculous happened.

316
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,952
The waiters are,

317
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,038
wait for this, right, they're blind.

318
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,247
You're kidding me?

319
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,876
I'm kidding you not.
No, as bats. As bats!

320
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,961
Very good to have you here, gentlemen.

321
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,963
I hope you enjoy your experience.

322
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,174
Carlo will show you to your table.

323
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,551
Great. Lead on, maestro.

324
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,262
Can I have your right hand
on my right shoulder, please?

325
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,765
And your friend hold on to your shoulder.
Thank you.

326
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,897
Mind the stairs and be prepared because

327
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,399
it's completely dark.

328
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,070
Okay, gentlemen, if you don't mind,

329
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,530
I can sit you here beside
these two young ladies.

330
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,699
No, no.
Sounds absolutely perfect!

331
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,993
God, you sound very perky.

332
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,453
I am. And very handsome.

333
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,206
Someone's there.

334
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,500
Hi. Hi. I'm Mary.

335
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,294
I'm Tim. Mary's my
mother's name, actually.

336
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,005
Does it suit her? Sort of.

337
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,592
Although she's sturdy, so Bernard
might have been a better fit.

338
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,011
Okay.

339
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,098
Something just touched my elbow.

340
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,557
Okay, that wasn't me.

341
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,061
No. Well, that just makes it worse.
If it wasn't you, who was it?

342
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,398
It wasn't me because
I'm touching something else.

343
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,150
Yes, and you'll stop that
right away, thank you.

344
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:04,114
So, girls, be honest, who is more beautiful?

345
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,740
- I am.
- Yeah. She is.

346
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
Excellent!

347
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,660
Actually, I look like Kate Moss.

348
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,328
Really?

349
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,289
No. I sort of
look like a squirrel.

350
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,001
Do you like Kate Moss?

351
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,502
I absolutely love her.

352
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,797
In fact, I almost wore one of
her dresses here tonight. You?

353
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,133
No, no, her clothes look terrible on me.

354
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,013
I cannot believe that it's
your birthday next week as well.

355
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:32,142
Your friend Jay is quite enthusiastic.

356
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,561
I actually hate him.

357
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,603
What's Joanna like?

358
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,481
- She's basically a prostitute.
- Yeah.

359
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,151
I think it's strawberry mousse.
Ooh!

360
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,360
Do you want some?

361
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,778
Um... Okay. I'll try it.

362
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,071
Okay, where's your mouth?

363
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,781
It's...

364
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,034
it's here.

365
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,493
Okay. There?

366
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,454
My God, what was that?

367
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,372
That's my eye.

368
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,375
I think there's a lot of...
I've got quite a lot of

369
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,502
strawberry mousse in my eye now!

370
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm so sorry.

371
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,257
No. Thank you. That's
a new sensation for me.

372
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,388
So, maybe I'll see you outside or...

373
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,390
Yeah. Yeah, great.

374
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,309
Great. Scary.

375
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,686
Yeah, it's a bit scary.

376
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,148
My God, I'm so in there.
What about you?

377
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,984
I don't know, but she sounded wonderful.

378
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,277
Shh!

379
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,197
Joanna? Jay.

380
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,407
Christ, you're a babe.

381
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,159
How do you fancy stretching the night

382
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,869
out a bit?
I can ditch the loser.

383
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,914
We've got to rush, but help me find a
cab and I might give you my number.

384
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:36,998
Of course. Yeah.

385
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,796
Or I might not.
Haven't decided yet. So...

386
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,335
I have. it's not gonna happen.

387
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,614
Hi. Hi.

388
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,284
Where's... She
and Jay just...

389
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,037
She took him to...
I don't know.

390
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,163
Right.

391
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,499
Well, I guess I'd better...

392
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,294
Would it be very wrong if I
asked you for your number?

393
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,297
No.

394
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,676
Just in case I ever had to call you about...

395
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,845
Stuff? -

396
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,596
Okay.

397
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,144
Would you...

398
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,062
it's Mary.

399
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,438
Mary.

400
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,859
Okay.

401
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,653
I thought this phone was old and shit,

402
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,573
but suddenly it's my
most valuable possession.

403
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,409
You really like me?

404
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,663
Even my frock?

405
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,915
I love your frock.

406
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,128
And my hair?
It's not too brown?

407
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,005
I love brown.

408
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,008
My fringe is new.

409
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,302
The fringe is perfect.
Fringe is the best bit.

410
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,511
Mary!

411
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,973
We have to go! I found a cab and his
dodgy friend is about to assault me.

412
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,434
Okay, I'm coming.

413
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,144
Two seconds.

414
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,938
I hope I see you again.

415
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,690
You will.

416
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,568
Okay. Good.

417
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,531
Goodnight.

418
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,528
What's happened?

419
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,864
What have you done, you poor thing?

420
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,076
Nothing.
It's just a flesh wound.

421
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,494
Here. Thank you.

422
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,291
You may remember, my play opened tonight.

423
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,460
My God, yes. How did it go?

424
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,128
Well. it went well.

425
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,049
You could tell in the room a
masterpiece was being unfurled.

426
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,176
Really? Really.

427
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,846
Until, and this is the
crucial plot point, I think,

428
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:43,726
until the lead actor had the most
massive dry in the history of theatre.

429
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,395
No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes.

430
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,439
He didn't just forget his lines.

431
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,108
He forgot his lines to the extent

432
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,610
that no actor has ever forgotten their lines

433
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,113
before in the annals of dramatic art.

434
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:59,033
The reviews won't say
"Major masterpiece gets unveiled",

435
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,787
they'll say,
"Major actor gets Alzheimer's. "

436
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,956
it's a disaster.

437
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,583
Is an understatement.

438
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,047
It's the Titanic of play openings,
but with no survivors.

439
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,050
No women, no children,

440
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,720
not even Kate Winslet.

441
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,847
All dead.

442
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,142
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

443
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,601
What does that mean?

444
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,354
What are you gonna do?
Ring up every critic

445
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,398
in London and offer them a blow job

446
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:35,236
if they ignore the fact that we sat
in total silence for half an hour

447
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:40,450
waiting for a moron to
remember one single line?

448
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,327
Not quite that.

449
00:27:58,969 --> 00:27:59,969
Hello.

450
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,770
Hello, Sir Tom. I'm a friend of Harry's.
How's it going with the lines?

451
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,357
I'm sorry, what do you mean "the lines"?

452
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,776
It's just, you know, in the court scenes,

453
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,570
some of those lines are pretty complex.

454
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,073
And I just thought maybe it
might be worth, you know,

455
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,158
having one last look at the lines

456
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,620
before you go on.
A little refresher.

457
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,123
Fuck off out of here.

458
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:34,003
You arsing lunatic. Get out!
You ginger twerp. Go on!

459
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,880
Patronising piece of...

460
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,395
And now the Defence.

461
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:05,451
I have lived many weary years...

462
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,787
it's brilliant... but never,

463
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,958
in that long catalogue of wasted time,

464
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:17,088
have I ever seen such an atrocious
miscarriage of justice.

465
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:26,639
Do the Prosecution
have anything final to add?

466
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,311
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

467
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:25,239
Do the Prosecution
have anything final to add?

468
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,414
Psst!

469
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,881
Gentlemen...

470
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,259
Gentlemen,

471
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:50,306
I regard today's proceedings
with the utmost gravity.

472
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,183
Nevertheless,

473
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,645
let us be clear of one

474
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,358
simple and salient thing.

475
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,112
It is the life

476
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,657
of a guilty man!

477
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:22,547
One of the actors appeared
to have actually fallen asleep...

478
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,092
Here's the little prick who
walked out halfway through.

479
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,094
You missed the best scene, you little twerp.

480
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Sorry.

481
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,806
What did you think of the set?

482
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,349
I thought it was incredible.

483
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,561
Did you? I didn't. Too brown.

484
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,065
Mary!

485
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,777
No.

486
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,154
She's gone.

487
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,340
Two girls in earlier tonight. One of
them the prettiest girl in the world.

488
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,367
The other one like a
sort of nice prostitute.

489
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,344
Did you get their names?

490
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,265
Yes. They left
a while ago. Let's see.

491
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,768
No, I'm afraid
they were walk-ins

492
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,354
and it appears they paid by cash.

493
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,481
Sorry, sir.

494
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,368
That's okay.
That's fine, it's brilliant.

495
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,820
It's just the end of my life.
Thanks so much.

496
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,052
Cheer up, mate.

497
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,222
Apparently, you're living with
Britain's greatest living playwright.

498
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,058
I don't usually read them, obviously,

499
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,726
but I couldn't resist this one.

500
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:03,898
"Harry Chapman
found guilty of genius. "

501
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,114
I have to go out. Right now.

502
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,574
Why?

503
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,493
She loves Kate Moss.

504
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,955
Thanks for keeping me company, Kittle.

505
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,748
Nothing better to do.

506
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,958
How's Jimmy?

507
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,126
Dumped me.

508
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,252
Not again.

509
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,087
And work? They've sacked me.

510
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,213
Idiots.

511
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,465
Coffee? Please.

512
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:15,428
I've only just noticed this cat
in this picture. See that cat?

513
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,431
I do see that cat.
It's very good.

514
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,975
My God.

515
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,060
My God!

516
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,311
What?

517
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,313
It's her.

518
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,650
It's her!

519
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,236
That's her!

520
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,739
Shh!

521
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,577
You go, girl.

522
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,339
Sorry.

523
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,301
Hi. Hi.

524
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:58,846
How are you?

525
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,682
I'm... I'm fine.

526
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,185
It's so good to see you.

527
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,520
Um... We've never met before.

528
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,815
No, fuck.

529
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,485
No, of course we haven't. No.

530
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,654
Sorry, I think you've mistaken
me for someone else.

531
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,448
No, no, no.

532
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,784
Your name's Mary.

533
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,829
That's distinctly weird.

534
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,831
How do you know that?

535
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,709
Well, you look like a Mary.

536
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,503
In what way?

537
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,879
My mum's called Mary.

538
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,506
I look like your mother?

539
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,175
No. You're much prettier.

540
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,805
It's a nice fringe, by the way.

541
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,348
God, it's new and

542
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,391
probably too short but... No.

543
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,394
Well, gee, thank you and

544
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,897
listen, it was really nice to meet you.

545
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,651
I should probably go because
my friend's waiting for me

546
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,153
and you're a, you're a total stranger.

547
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,822
Total stranger.

548
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,323
Yeah, it's crazy stuff.

549
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,242
Yeah, kind of. Okay.

550
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,743
Bye, Mary. Bye.

551
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:06,997
No.

552
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,249
How did it go?

553
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,500
It was very poor.

554
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,918
Very poor indeed, yeah.

555
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,419
You gotta go again.

556
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,256
You can do it. Take two.

557
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,012
She just always... She
always looks different.

558
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,100
Sorry. it's me again.

559
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,227
Hi. Sorry.

560
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,729
Joanna, this is...

561
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,398
Tim.

562
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,691
Hello. Nice to meet you.

563
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,947
Tim is a total stranger whose
mother's name is Mary.

564
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,783
I just had a weird experience with Mary here

565
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,411
of thinking she was someone else.
But she wasn't.

566
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,748
But I just wondered if I
could walk round with you

567
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,628
for a while because my sister
Kit Kat is about to leave...

568
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,754
Yeah.

569
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,050
Bye... and...

570
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,802
And so,

571
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,972
I'm about to be quite lonely.

572
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,935
Right. Well, I think we
should probably say no.

573
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,147
No, yes. But on the other hand,
he's got a quite nice smile

574
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,316
and sort of, you know, fun hair.

575
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,068
Yeah.

576
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,487
All right.

577
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,992
But you have to promise that you are
not one of the following things.

578
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,785
One, a lunatic.

579
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,995
Yeah. No.

580
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,956
Two, a fringe fetishist.

581
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,293
I'm just Kate Moss's number one male fan.

582
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,630
God. Really?

583
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,089
Yeah. God, yeah.

584
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,509
Do you agree that the magic
of her lies in her history?

585
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,304
That the informality of her early shots

586
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,432
compared to this stuff
so you just always know

587
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,893
that, despite the high
fashion, she's still just

588
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,605
that cheeky normal naked girl on the beach?

589
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,232
Couldn't have put it better myself.

590
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,028
That's absolutely it.
I agree with that profoundly.

591
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,405
Milk?

592
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,531
Yes.

593
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,617
Sugar? No.

594
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,743
Boyfriend?

595
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,953
Yes!

596
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,288
No. No, you don't
have a boyfriend.

597
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,875
Do I not look like I'd have a boyfriend?

598
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,897
Do I look like I'd never
get a boyfriend? No.

599
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:18,583
That's the rudest thing I've ever heard.

600
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,465
I didn't mean it like that.
I just didn't expect...

601
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,718
Is it quite a new boyfriend?

602
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,886
Yes.

603
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,389
There he is. Rupert.

604
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,225
Yes. He's so cute. Rupert?

605
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,685
Hi, guys.

606
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,895
Sorry I'm late, with my dad.

607
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,231
Hi, Rupee.

608
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,525
"Rupee"?

609
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,237
Well, this is Tim and

610
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,239
we don't know him at all.

611
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,534
Hey, I was thinking we could
take in a film after this.

612
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,285
Get some mixed popcorn, share a Coke,

613
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,537
snuggle. Okay.

614
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,913
Okay.

615
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,709
When did you two meet? Exactly?

616
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,253
Well, it was only a week ago, actually.

617
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,881
It's all been a bit of a
whirlwind, hasn't it, poochy face?

618
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm gonna have to teach you what you
can and can't say in front of people.

619
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,845
No "poochy face"? No.

620
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,930
No. Definitely not.

621
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:14,101
Come on, then. More details about
this wonderful first meeting?

622
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,269
Okay, okay.

623
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,563
It was, um, what... Joanna?

624
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,606
June 17th.

625
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,275
And Jo was having a little party.

626
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,279
A living hell from which Rupert,
thank God, rescued me.

627
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,573
And where was this terrible party?

628
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,783
My brothel of a flat.

629
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,089
Which is where, though? That's
the question, isn't it.

630
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:33,258
What are you, a detective?

631
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,773
No, sorry, I've just got
a very visual imagination.

632
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,875
I like to imagine stuff completely.

633
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:43,213
26 Courtfield Gardens,
SW5. Around 8:30.

634
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,966
Dress code, slutty.
Will that do?

635
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,885
Absolutely, yes.
Although I am wondering

636
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,055
when you got there, Rupert.
Early, late?

637
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,641
On time, I think.
True love was calling.

638
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,435
God.

639
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,979
I actually feel a bit
sick now. Just these

640
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,398
muffins, I think.
Never trust a blueberry.

641
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,401
Okay, I'll be back in a tick.

642
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,780
You two are such a lovely couple.

643
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,327
Bit weird.

644
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,620
He's cute.

645
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,746
I like him.

646
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,914
Yeah, me too.

647
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,197
Hello. Do I know you?

648
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,826
No, no, no.
I'm a friend of Mary's.

649
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,955
She has another friend? Gosh,
you amaze me. But hooray.

650
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,790
Ooh. Hotdog?

651
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,583
Took me hours.
Made them myself.

652
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,043
Thanks.

653
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,214
Disgusting.
Totally undercooked.

654
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,674
See you later.

655
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,225
Why don't we go upstairs,
it's a bit quieter?

656
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,908
Hi. Hi.

657
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,076
I'm Tim.

658
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,911
Mary.

659
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,664
That's my mother's name.
Let's not get into that.

660
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,251
Um... I know this is forward but

661
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,422
your face tells me that you're finding
this party to be a living hell.

662
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,967
So, I just wondered if you might come

663
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,387
and have a bite to eat with me instead?

664
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,347
Right now.

665
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,807
I'm sorry?

666
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:01,435
Obviously, I should have
thought this through more.

667
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,103
Let's talk about Kate Moss.

668
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,108
I love Kate Moss.

669
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,944
I always think the key
thing with her is the history,

670
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,574
you know, the informality of her early
shots compared to high fashion stuff

671
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,869
so you always know that underneath
she's still just the same

672
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,456
cheeky normal girl naked on the beach.

673
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,582
The beach.

674
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,793
I agree with you completely.

675
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,130
If we leave now then we can have,
you know, more than one starter.

676
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,054
I love your eyes.

677
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,934
And I love the rest of your face, too.

678
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,904
More than one starter?

679
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,739
10 amazing starters.

680
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,742
After you. Thanks.

681
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,078
Ten minutes is long enough
for any party, I think.

682
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah.

683
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,498
Especially that one.

684
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,166
Evening, all.

685
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,669
God! What a dickhead.

686
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,754
Yeah.

687
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,301
So, what do you do?

688
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,930
I'm a reader at a publisher.

689
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,683
No! You read for a living?

690
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,144
Yes, that's it. I read.

691
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,813
That's so great.

692
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,023
It's like someone asking, "What do you do

693
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,984
"for a living?"
"Well, I breathe.

694
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,195
"I'm a breather,
I get paid for breathing. "

695
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:39,324
How did you get that job? Okay,
smart-ass, what do you do?

696
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,202
I am a lawyer.

697
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,787
Sort of. Sort of.

698
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,539
That's sexy.

699
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,374
Is it?

700
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,875
I mean, I think so.

701
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:54,047
In a suit, in a court, saving
people's lives. Kinda sexy.

702
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,422
I guess it is. Although it's
not as sexy as reading.

703
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,886
Sitting there in an office,
in a little chair reading.

704
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,471
Okay, stop. Ooh!

705
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,223
Just wait right there, mister, because

706
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,892
a lot of books get
submitted to my publisher.

707
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,728
So it's an immense responsibility.

708
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,479
I bet it is.

709
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,565
But when you do normal reading,

710
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,360
is it ruined because it's your job?
You know, like prostitutes?

711
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,612
I always worry that when
they stop being prostitutes

712
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,072
that they can't enjoy sex any more.

713
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,574
You always worry about that?

714
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,784
No, I sometimes worry about it.
Good. Okay.

715
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,779
Because someone who always worried
about that would be a bit of a worry.

716
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,531
When you read a newspaper,
do you think, "Forget this, it's work"?

717
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,633
Have you interviewed a lot of prostitutes?

718
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:32,735
When you read a menu, do you think,

719
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:35,688
"No, I'm not reading this,
unless you pay me hard cash. "

720
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:39,025
How many prostitutes will you need to
talk to before this issue is solved?

721
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,013
Are you planning to head to
Eastern Europe and Thailand?

722
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,947
Um... Would you like
to walk me to my car?

723
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,575
Yes. Why not? Okay.

724
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,744
Sounds like a good idea.

725
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,704
What about you?

726
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,874
Yeah, I have three older brothers.

727
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,542
God. Yeah.

728
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,211
Where are they?

729
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,381
Behind you.

730
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,809
Did you have trouble parking?

731
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,312
Pardon?

732
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,980
It's just such a long way to your car.

733
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,566
Well, my car's actually parked outside

734
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,152
my house.
I got a lift to the party.

735
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,489
Okay.

736
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,410
That's good. That's perfect.

737
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:47,828
Okay.

738
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,626
And here we are.

739
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,670
My God. Yeah.

740
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,132
Car, house. House, car.

741
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,636
It makes perfect sense.

742
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,596
It's very logical.

743
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:28,952
Christ.

744
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,581
Um...

745
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,543
Keys!

746
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,978
I'm gonna go into the bedroom
and put on my new pyjamas.

747
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,354
Right.

748
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,692
And then in a minute you can
come in and take them off.

749
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,403
If you want to.

750
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,081
One minute.

751
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,004
Hi.

752
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,428
God. Are you... Are you okay?
Yeah.

753
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,848
Sorry.

754
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,058
That's okay.

755
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,626
It's a front opener.

756
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,336
It's a what?

757
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,129
It opens from the front.

758
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,424
Yeah, no, yeah, of course.

759
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,134
Thanks. Sure.

760
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,305
Ooh! Well done.

761
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,983
I'm sure it'll be better next time.

762
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,987
I thought it was pretty lovely.

763
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,156
Right, no, it was really lovely.

764
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,161
In fact, can you just give me one minute?

765
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,622
Okay.

766
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,754
Hi.

767
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,675
Dangerous.

768
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,098
You really know your bras.

769
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,058
I like to think so.

770
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,693
Well done. Some people make a
real mess of it the first time.

771
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,278
Amateurs.

772
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,699
Could you give me one second?

773
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,784
Sure.

774
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,203
I couldn't wait.

775
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,458
My goodness.

776
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,718
Best night of my entire life. And now
I've got a suspicion I'm gonna have

777
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,638
the best sleep of my entire life.

778
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,476
So once is enough for my perfect guy?

779
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,979
I'm not sure that's entirely fair.

780
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,987
We're late. No, we're not.

781
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,033
It'll be fine. it's only...
My God.

782
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:07,629
Bye.

783
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,086
Don't worry, you're coming with.

784
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,105
I'm taking you home!

785
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,696
Bye. Bye. Bye.

786
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,532
No!

787
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,830
Okay. I have some bad news.

788
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,624
You're dying? No, not that bad.

789
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,501
I'm dying? No.

790
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:32,172
My parents are in town. They're
visiting and they're coming around.

791
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,299
God. Parents?
American parents?

792
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,010
When? Now.

793
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,137
They told me and I didn't tell you

794
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:42,273
and I thought they'd cancel because
they normally do and they didn't.

795
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:43,908
Now now? Now now.

796
00:51:43,993 --> 00:51:45,594
So you should probably put on some pants.

797
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,897
God. Okay, okay.

798
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,649
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

799
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,193
Do they know I exist?

800
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,489
Yeah. I've mentioned something
like you, but nothing very specific.

801
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:01,367
Yeah, they're quite conservative,
so maybe not those pants.

802
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,538
Okay. Yeah.

803
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,708
God. Okay.

804
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,588
Could you just stall them.
Stall them.

805
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,675
Come on up.

806
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,720
What? I'm sorry, they
don't like waiting.

807
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,555
Okay. Do I live here?

808
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,349
Definitely not.

809
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,476
Are we having sex?

810
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,228
Yeah. But not oral.

811
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,729
I wasn't gonna mention oral.

812
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,607
Okay, good, don't. How did you
think that was gonna come up?

813
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,133
Could you help me with this, please?

814
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,403
I don't know. if it does,
just deny it completely.

815
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,572
Who's gonna bring it up?
Your dad?

816
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,408
"Tim, had any cunnilingus
with my daughter recently?"

817
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:43,785
Well, you never know.

818
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,203
Okay.

819
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,831
Okay. Ready? Yeah.

820
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,084
They're there.
They are, yeah.

821
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:52,919
Yeah, right behind you.
Okay. Right, okay.

822
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,091
Dad! Hello, sweet.

823
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,385
Mom. Hi. Hi, honey.

824
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,929
This is Tim.

825
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,139
Hello, sir. Ma'am.

826
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,601
Should we come back when you
haven't got any company, or...

827
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,021
Well, that would be quite difficult

828
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,440
because Tim actually lives here.

829
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,278
Really? With you?

830
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,282
Yes. Yeah, but no
oral sex, I promise you.

831
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,618
I beg your pardon?

832
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,079
Excuse me.

833
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,126
So, Tim, tell us where are you
from, which part of the country?

834
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,337
He's from Cornwall.
Yeah, it's really pretty.

835
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,133
It's that little bit right at the
end, sort of looks like a shoe.

836
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,260
And you're a lawyer, is that right?

837
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,263
Yep, that's right.
And he never loses.

838
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,646
You don't think he's gonna win, then he
just pulls something out of the bag and,

839
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,934
what do you know, he wins again.

840
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,313
Do you ever answer any
of your own questions?

841
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,106
I...

842
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,859
Yes, he does. Usually he does,

843
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,225
but not today because I'm doing

844
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,960
all the talking because I'm really nervous

845
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,992
and I kinda love him and I just...
I want you to, too.

846
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,660
Honey.

847
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,455
Sorry. Tim. Over to you.

848
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,956
Shoot.

849
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,792
Yeah, I think my dad...

850
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,170
Can I just say one more thing?
Um...

851
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,547
Thank God that's over.

852
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,924
I got given two tickets

853
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,259
for the National Theatre
tomorrow. Do you wanna come?

854
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:27,347
No, so not. I'm just
gonna sleep all day.

855
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,351
I don't see why going to the theatre
should get in the way of that.

856
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,854
Many of the best sleeps of my life have
happened in the Royal Shakespeare Company.

857
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,523
No, you take someone else.

858
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,527
I really like bed and I really hate theatre.

859
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,363
Quite right.

860
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,159
But what kind of sad act is gonna
be free on a Saturday night

861
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,787
with no day's notice?

862
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,039
Bravo.

863
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,211
My God. it's Charlotte. Who?

864
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,546
It was my first love. Where?

865
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,674
There. Under the "exit" sign.

866
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,425
- The old woman?
- No, not the old woman.

867
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,760
The astonishing blonde.

868
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,512
The one with the dark hair?
No, blonde.

869
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,222
Blonde means blonde hair, doesn't it?

870
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:11,933
Off the stage.

871
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,602
Okay, you stay there.
I mean it, stay!

872
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,032
Charlotte.

873
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,077
My God. Tim.

874
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,122
How fabulous to see you.

875
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:38,376
Wow. I... This is
my girlfriend Tina.

876
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,752
No.

877
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,048
That is so brilliant.
Well, hello, Tina.

878
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,758
Why is it brilliant?

879
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,036
Well, you know. There are certain moments
in your life that scar you for life.

880
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:52,064
Charlotte's rejection of me
was one of those moments,

881
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:54,759
but now I know she's
got a "girlfriend", well,

882
00:55:54,843 --> 00:55:57,328
that's just a huge burden
suddenly lifted off my mind.

883
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:00,114
I can be a confident
heterosexual all over again.

884
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,569
Not that kind of girlfriend.

885
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,238
What?

886
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,615
You think I'm gay?

887
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:11,743
No.

888
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,913
No, of course not.
No. it's girl friend.

889
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,915
Yes. No. Wow.

890
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,461
Yeah, friend who is a girl,
which you so clearly are.

891
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,423
I'm just gonna go and get
my boyfriend, who is a boy...

892
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,765
My God. Tim.

893
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,101
How lovely to see you.
Look at you. Wow.

894
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,895
This is my girlfriend Tina.

895
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,315
Hello, Tina.
Although you should be

896
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,150
a little careful with that, by the way.

897
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,320
There are still quite a lot of
us old fashioned types about

898
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,655
who interpret "girlfriend" as meaning "gay".

899
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:53,045
So if you say that Tina's your girlfriend,
people will assume that you're "gay".

900
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,453
I am "gay".

901
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,663
Are you?

902
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,071
Do you have a problem with that?

903
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,710
No, I don't. I love that stuff.

904
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:04,670
I'm just gonna...

905
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,174
Wow.

906
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,511
I've just seen the girl who broke
my heart three summers ago.

907
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,513
Let's go say hello.

908
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,515
No. Best let sleeping dogs lie.
Come on.

909
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,059
Best night of my life.
I always love this area.

910
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,520
It's so bustling and I mean
those pictures, full of colour.

911
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,773
Just makes me so happy when I'm
round here, all the colour... Tim.

912
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,191
Charlotte!

913
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,692
Tim, how lovely to see you.

914
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,319
What a surprise.

915
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,364
Wow. Sorry. This is
my girlfriend, Tina.

916
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,366
She's gay. Shut up.

917
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,700
Hello, Tina.

918
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,035
Look at you!

919
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,995
It just never even occurred to me

920
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,914
you existed outside of Cornwall.

921
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,875
We're about to go and get dinner,

922
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,086
but it would be great to hang out sometime.

923
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,046
Yeah, sure. I'd love that.

924
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,006
Send my love to little Kit Kat.
How is she?

925
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,052
She's okay. She's not finding
London totally easy actually.

926
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,388
Right. Well, Jimmy says
he sees her sometimes.

927
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,098
Really? Since when?

928
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,267
You knew there was always something there.

929
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,060
Sorry, you are?

930
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,228
Very well, thank you.

931
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,436
Well, she means your name.

932
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:04,897
Roger. No, it's not.

933
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,358
No, it's not. it's Rory.

934
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,360
Nice to meet you, Rory. Yeah.

935
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,779
Right. Sorry,
we should get going.

936
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,239
It was really great to see you.

937
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,740
I'll see you soon.
You, too. Yeah.

938
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,242
Bye.

939
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,452
God, she is beautiful.

940
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,583
She's so beautiful, if you had sex
with her, you'd die. You'd just die.

941
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:27,086
You'd open her shirt, see her breasts
and your eyes would explode.

942
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,493
You'd have to have sex with her blind.
And then you'd die.

943
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,133
You notice she didn't give me her number...

944
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:36,137
I told Tina to go have dinner on her own.
Are you hungry?

945
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,764
Yeah. Of course. Great.

946
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,766
Bye, Roger.

947
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,727
Yeah, excellent.

948
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,593
Thanks again for the play. Triumph.
Where do you wanna go?

949
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,232
Well, wherever you like really.

950
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,776
I can't compete.

951
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,331
You know,

952
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,627
I'm starting to think we slightly
wasted that summer holiday.

953
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,172
If we could travel back in time,

954
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,841
maybe I wouldn't have said no.

955
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,761
I'm...

956
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,639
I'm just staying round the corner.

957
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,307
Can you walk me home?

958
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:23,935
Yeah.

959
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,354
Yeah? Yeah, of course, yeah.

960
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,783
Well, here we are.

961
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,998
It's a lot nicer

962
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,583
inside.

963
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,835
I'm sure it is.

964
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,011
So... So...

965
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,180
So...

966
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,350
So,

967
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,102
lovely

968
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,355
to see you, Charlotte.

969
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:13,192
What a night.
Total joy, but I've gotta

970
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,695
get back

971
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,865
because there's something very important
that I have to do. Right now.

972
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,360
Wake up. Wake up. What?

973
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:57,528
Mary.

974
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,656
Would you like to marry me?

975
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:01,949
Shh.

976
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,245
Don't be so selfish,
I'm sleeping. it's bad.

977
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,373
Right.

978
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,168
That went very well.

979
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,926
Wake up.

980
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,094
What?

981
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,681
Wake up. Come and have a chat.

982
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:26,766
Why?

983
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,353
I've got something important to ask you.

984
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,274
Can't it wait till morning?

985
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,234
Not really.

986
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,197
But I'm so comfy.

987
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,367
I was having the loveliest dream.

988
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,744
What is it?

989
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,955
Why is there music on?

990
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,125
It's got something to do
with what I want to ask you.

991
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,629
Wait a minute.

992
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,423
Romantic music.

993
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,302
Guy with important question.

994
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,096
Are you on your knees?

995
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,598
On his knees.

996
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,269
Were you so bored in the play you decided

997
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,147
to ask me to marry you afterwards?

998
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,110
Something like that.

999
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,407
Yeah. Exactly that.

1000
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,118
In fact,

1001
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,997
will you marry me?

1002
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,506
Any thoughts on the answer?

1003
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:45,136
"Yes?", "No?", "Get out of my life,
loser. ", they're all possible.

1004
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,350
I think I'll go for

1005
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,019
"yes. "

1006
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,986
Thank you for asking me.

1007
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:07,158
And thank you for not going for one
of those melodramatic proposals

1008
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,660
with lots of people around.

1009
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,121
I hate other people.

1010
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,831
Me, too.

1011
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,541
Yeah.

1012
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,378
I'm just gonna turn off the radio.

1013
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:22,047
Okay. Good idea.

1014
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,892
Thanks, guys.
Sorry, she's a bit tired.

1015
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,813
But we really appreciate it.
Can you go?

1016
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,240
Wow!

1017
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,576
That's so beautiful.

1018
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,329
I don't think we'll be staying
in the same room, somehow.

1019
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,663
Really?

1020
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,750
If they offer you tea, just say no.

1021
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,919
Hello.

1022
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,420
Mum, this is Mary.

1023
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,880
Mary! Hi.

1024
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,590
Good Lord, you're pretty.

1025
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,342
No, it's just

1026
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,261
I've got a lot of mascara and lipstick on.

1027
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,763
Let's have a look.

1028
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,432
Yes. Good.

1029
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:17,353
It's very bad for a girl to be too pretty.

1030
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:21,607
It stops her developing a sense of humour.
Or a personality.

1031
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,359
Tea?

1032
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,319
I'd love a cup of tea.

1033
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,029
Christ, that's the whole day gone.

1034
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,783
She's a very special guest.
Cup without the crack.

1035
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,159
Skipping stones.

1036
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,954
They've been doing this
since he was about this high.

1037
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,749
And what are your faults?
I mean, little weaknesses.

1038
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,712
I...

1039
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,550
Well, I'm very insecure.

1040
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,093
Sweet.

1041
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:54,098
Okay. I've a very
bad temper sometimes.

1042
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,891
Crucial. How else are you gonna

1043
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,726
get a fella to do what you want?

1044
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,314
And, of course, I have...

1045
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,108
I have a weakness for your son.

1046
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,609
So do I.

1047
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:09,655
But best not to tell him.
Don't want him getting cocky.

1048
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,743
Pow!

1049
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,162
I'm so good
without the ball. Pow!

1050
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:20,416
What do you think of her?

1051
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,126
I like her more than you already.

1052
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,507
Look, I'd forgotten this.
Jimmy Fontana Il Mondo.

1053
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,593
Greatest record ever recorded by an Italian

1054
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,775
who looks like he's got
a dead badger on his head.

1055
01:05:32,814 --> 01:05:33,842
And you've got the album.

1056
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,139
Yes!

1057
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,849
Check out those specs!

1058
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,521
Come on, on with the game!
Right.

1059
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,773
And what an extraordinary game this is.

1060
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,817
For the first time a father and son

1061
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,694
are playing each other in the World Table

1062
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,622
Tennis Final and neither
of them are Chinese.

1063
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,282
Tremendous play from the
old World Champion and his son,

1064
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,035
the first openly ginger
British table tennis player

1065
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,290
but there are signs the
youngster's beginning to crack.

1066
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,748
There are tears in his eyes.
There are not!

1067
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,333
There soon will be!

1068
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Hey.

1069
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,175
Hey!
I didn't know you were here.

1070
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,303
Yeah. I just
popped down for a while.

1071
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,554
Okay.

1072
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,139
What about the job?

1073
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,476
So how long have you been here?

1074
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,353
Couple of weeks.

1075
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,730
Gosh! So, life in London...

1076
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,732
Horrid.

1077
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,900
Okay.

1078
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,153
Is Mary here?

1079
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,404
Yes.

1080
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,073
Where? Downstairs.

1081
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,242
You be gentle.

1082
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,745
Be gentle!

1083
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,376
Careful!

1084
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,547
Yeah, nice to see you, too. I'm
trying to make a good impression...

1085
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,634
Yeah, you make a good impression.

1086
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,260
Right, sorry. Sorry.

1087
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,930
I've got an important announcement to make.

1088
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,765
Exciting.

1089
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,477
We've decided, after a little
bit of thought, to get married.

1090
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,108
That's wonderful news.

1091
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,901
Who are you getting married to?

1092
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,904
To Mary. Over there.

1093
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,031
Thank God for that.

1094
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,243
Jolly embarrassing if it had
been another girl. imagine that.

1095
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,453
We're so pleased.

1096
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,580
No, sorry. Yeah.

1097
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,792
By the way, the wedding will be quite soon

1098
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,712
because we're having a baby, too.

1099
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,470
You're pregnant?

1100
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,763
Yes.

1101
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,473
Who's the father?

1102
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,809
Well, Tim, I hope.

1103
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:48,230
Thank God for that. Jolly awkward
if it had been another fellow.

1104
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,485
We have to decide tonight.

1105
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,320
What? Everything.

1106
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,157
The only thing you've decided about our

1107
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,159
wedding is that I'm coming down the aisle

1108
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,453
to the sound of some Italian weirdo

1109
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,747
singing a song called Il Mondo.

1110
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:05,748
Excellent song.

1111
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,083
To which I've said a definitive "no".

1112
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,835
So here's the deal.

1113
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,505
I will take off one item of clothing
for every decision you make.

1114
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:17,676
Okay. You have my attention,
young lady.

1115
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,303
Right, um,

1116
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,055
where would you like to get married?

1117
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,976
Home. I'd hate anywhere else.

1118
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,102
Okay.

1119
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,646
My God. Good.

1120
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,106
Who should the priest be?

1121
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,691
It'll have to be the local bloke

1122
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,457
with yellow teeth and the massive unibrow.

1123
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,694
Okay.

1124
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,822
That's a lock for Hagrid.

1125
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,325
Um...

1126
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:42,785
Best Man?

1127
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:43,994
Damn.

1128
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,788
Best Man. Now.

1129
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,561
No, this is so hard. It's lose-lose you know
You piss off all the

1130
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,067
ones you don't pick, and you end
up hating the one you do pick

1131
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:53,278
because he makes a bad
speech and ruins the day.

1132
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:54,905
Do you wanna see these puppies or not?

1133
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:56,473
Yes, I do.

1134
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,684
Jay. it's your choice.

1135
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,490
He's my best friend, but he's a moron.

1136
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,970
Yeah, he will mess up everything.

1137
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,388
Rory. Sure?

1138
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:04,848
No, Harry.

1139
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,308
Harry it is. Let's do this.

1140
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,853
Rory. Sorry.

1141
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,396
What? That's such a cheat.

1142
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,024
Okay, fine.

1143
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,526
Honeymoon?

1144
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,653
Bed and breakfast in Scotland.

1145
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,197
I am not taking my pants off for Scotland.

1146
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,825
But it's all we can afford.
Take off your pants.

1147
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,034
I will not.

1148
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,244
Take off your pants!

1149
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,704
I want two weeks in Bali!

1150
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,164
Take off those pants!

1151
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,048
Have you planned a break? No.

1152
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,684
No! Is that you?
It wasn't me.

1153
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,292
It's for you.

1154
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,119
No, I'm caught!
I've got it. I've got it!

1155
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,662
Help me!

1156
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,793
Yes!

1157
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,924
Right, follow me!

1158
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:05,844
My gosh!

1159
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,181
My God!

1160
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:12,976
God!

1161
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,234
It's a joke!

1162
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:25,864
Here.

1163
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,496
Yes, come on.

1164
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,039
This way.

1165
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,889
My God!

1166
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,333
Hello,

1167
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,168
I'm Rory.

1168
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:25,716
When Tim asked me to be
his Best Man, I was terrified.

1169
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,552
So I thought best thing is to find

1170
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,388
a book about speeches.
And here it is.

1171
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,934
And it says think of really funny anecdotes.

1172
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:41,815
And there is a very hilarious
story, actually from work.

1173
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,485
It was quite a complicated
case based on an issue of

1174
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,446
cross-amortisation
of ownership of

1175
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,114
post-divorce
properties and, um...

1176
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,077
Let me just explain the context.
The Defendant...

1177
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,125
When Tim asked me to do his Best Man speech,

1178
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,502
my immediate reaction was,

1179
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,548
"How much are you gonna
pay me, you little shit?

1180
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,923
"I don't write
for free, you know. "

1181
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:10,135
These were the girls
available to him at that time.

1182
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:13,513
"Hello, girls. " And this is how
far he got with each of them.

1183
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,725
Let me explain the code.
5, blow job.

1184
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:23,648
8, full penetrative...
and so a toast

1185
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,734
to the man with the worst haircut

1186
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,819
but the best bride in the room.

1187
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,030
Ladies and gentlemen, Tim and Mary.

1188
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,157
Tim and Mary.

1189
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,034
That's us.

1190
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,953
I wish I'd said "I love you".

1191
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,747
You did, Dad.

1192
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,415
It was implied.

1193
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,628
I'm not sure "implied" is good
enough for a wedding day, are you?

1194
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,922
No, don't do it, it's fine.

1195
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,884
I'm so happy with it as it was.
You really don't have to.

1196
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,303
I'll do what I wanna do, young man.

1197
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,680
Will you excuse me for just one moment?

1198
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,519
Later on I may tell you about

1199
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:05,023
Tim's many failings as a man
and as a table tennis player.

1200
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,149
But,

1201
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,777
important first to say the one

1202
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,281
big thing, I've only loved

1203
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,743
three men in my life.

1204
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,246
My dad was a frosty bugger so that

1205
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,414
only leaves dear Uncle Desmond,

1206
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,712
B.B. King, obviously,
and this young man here.

1207
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,759
I'd only give one piece of
advice to anyone marrying.

1208
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,304
We're all quite similar in the end.

1209
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,058
We all get old and tell the
same tales too many times.

1210
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:43,478
But try and marry someone

1211
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:45,897
kind.

1212
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,984
And this is a kind man

1213
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,403
with a good heart.

1214
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,656
I'm not particularly proud

1215
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:58,410
of many things in my life,
but I am very proud

1216
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,080
to be the father of my son.

1217
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:09,921
I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I
wonder if I could have your autograph.

1218
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,048
No. No.

1219
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:13,913
I'm at a wedding, for God's sake.

1220
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,303
I'm here to celebrate true love not

1221
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,805
scribble my illegible signature on stupid

1222
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,308
bits of paper that you can flog on eBay

1223
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,603
so that at the next wedding you
can wear a less hideous hat.

1224
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,105
I see you've met my Aunt May.

1225
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,984
God. People should
wear name tags.

1226
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,196
You next, Kittle Kattle.

1227
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,449
I don't know, Uncle D.

1228
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,161
Boys aren't very nice.

1229
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,288
Aren't they, darling?

1230
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,665
Not in my experience.

1231
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,793
They're always taking liberties,

1232
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,004
not giving much back in return.

1233
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,384
It's yummy. Yeah?

1234
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,637
I like the way
you say 'yummy. '

1235
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,648
Do you wish we'd picked
another less wet day?

1236
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:10,732
No.

1237
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,693
Not for the world.

1238
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,201
And so it begins.

1239
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,579
Lots and lots of types of days.

1240
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,498
Fun!

1241
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,005
Posy.

1242
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,342
Posy she is.

1243
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:40,178
The most beautiful girl in the world.

1244
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:47,560
You want your daddy.
Yes, I know.

1245
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:51,856
Yeah.

1246
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,282
No one can ever prepare you for

1247
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,530
what happens when you have a child.

1248
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,282
When you see the baby in your arms

1249
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,993
and you know that it's your job now.

1250
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,747
No one can prepare you
for the love and the fear.

1251
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,334
She's lovely.

1252
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,379
You were such an ugly baby.

1253
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,381
More chimpanzee than child.

1254
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,550
I remember the first time I saw you,

1255
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,553
I thanked God we were in
driving distance of London Zoo.

1256
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,264
Come on, hand over the little bugger,

1257
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,849
let's see if she bounces.

1258
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,726
Yeah, she definitely will bounce.

1259
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,019
Look.

1260
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,270
She can do anything.

1261
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,355
Look. Hello.

1262
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,026
Sweetheart.

1263
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,778
No one can prepare you for the love

1264
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,697
people you love can feel for them.

1265
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,326
And nothing can prepare you for

1266
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,370
the indifference of friends
who don't have babies.

1267
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,246
Do you wanna go to Uncle Jay?

1268
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,248
No, thanks, it's fine.
It's great.

1269
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,792
And it's a shock how
quickly you have to move

1270
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,712
to a new place you completely can't afford.

1271
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,756
Look what we found.

1272
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,299
Look who it is!

1273
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:00,967
Honey!

1274
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,218
Sorry.

1275
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,600
Suddenly, time travel
seems almost unnecessary,

1276
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:10,769
because every detail
of life is so delightful.

1277
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,736
What's his name?

1278
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,945
Horace, I think.

1279
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,238
Of course it is.

1280
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,532
Only one important thing
for a godfather, I'm told,

1281
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:26,951
never bring a present
smaller than the child.

1282
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,454
Shut up, you smug bastard.

1283
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,456
Don't worry, I didn't bring anything at all.

1284
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,500
She'll never know.
Hasn't got a brain yet.

1285
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,627
I didn't expect to see you here, Harry.

1286
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,796
Children's party's not exactly your style.

1287
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,132
No, Mary, I was tricked. I was
told there would be free booze.

1288
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,136
I hate kids, as you know.

1289
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,930
Where's Kit Kat, by the way?

1290
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,266
I don't know, she said
she'd be here around 3:00.

1291
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,686
And you know we got purple
cupcakes for her especially.

1292
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,480
Here she is!

1293
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,088
Speak of the devil, that will be her.

1294
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:01,319
We'll wait till Aunty Kit Kat gets here.

1295
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,822
Hey. Jimmy.

1296
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,490
Where's my sister?

1297
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:07,826
Thought she was here.

1298
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:08,993
No, she hasn't arrived.

1299
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,414
That's not good.

1300
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,582
What does that mean?

1301
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:18,211
Um... We had an
argument this morning.

1302
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,588
Over nothing, but she'd been drinking, so...

1303
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:25,051
And then she ran out to
get the car to come here and

1304
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,554
I told her to meet me here so...

1305
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,349
There's a song by Baz
Luhrmann called Sunscreen.

1306
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,685
He says worrying about the future

1307
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,103
is as effective as trying to solve

1308
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,022
an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.

1309
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,775
The real troubles in your life

1310
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,696
will always be things that never
crossed your worried mind.

1311
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,419
What happened?

1312
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,881
We had a fight.

1313
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,382
And,

1314
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,219
maybe I wasn't completely sober.

1315
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,931
How is she? Not good.

1316
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,392
When did she leave you?
From where?

1317
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,769
I want it exact.
Exact time. Exact address.

1318
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:29,115
Here we are. Sorry, sorry.

1319
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,658
Come on.

1320
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,244
God.

1321
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,580
Hi. There she is.

1322
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,916
Does a small baby live here?

1323
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,253
Yes, and she's so excited.
She's downstairs.

1324
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,923
Happy birthday, Posy.

1325
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,677
I'm sorry.
I had to pick up Kit Kat.

1326
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,596
I thought she was gonna drive herself.

1327
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,515
Turns out she couldn't.

1328
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,893
She okay? Later.

1329
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,189
I'm worried about Kit Kat.

1330
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,193
Yeah. I know.

1331
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,863
She was drinking wine
while we were drinking tea.

1332
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,908
And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.

1333
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:15,119
And she spurned the purple cupcakes.

1334
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,248
We have to do something to fix it.

1335
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,417
Yeah.

1336
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,087
But, you know,

1337
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:29,050
if it's gonna be fixed, I think she
probably has to do it herself.

1338
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,469
Maybe.

1339
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,013
Maybe not.

1340
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,228
My darling. What's happened?

1341
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,897
You're the best person in the world.

1342
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,316
You're top equal with
my wife. I don't get it.

1343
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,987
Maybe, just maybe,

1344
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,864
I'm the faller.

1345
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:56,494
Every family has, like, someone who falls,

1346
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,789
who doesn't make the grade, who stumbles,

1347
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,916
who life trips up.

1348
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,544
Maybe I'm our faller.

1349
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,881
No.

1350
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:18,975
Okay. I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

1351
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,352
And you have to promise to keep it.

1352
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,021
We've always kept secrets.

1353
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,522
We have?

1354
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,609
You promise you won't ever, ever, ever,

1355
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,028
ever, ever, ever, ever,

1356
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,323
ever, ever, ever, ever tell?

1357
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:34,616
Yes.

1358
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,749
I can travel in time.

1359
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,129
Why are we standing in the
cupboard under the stairs?

1360
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:51,762
Because we're gonna go back in time and
you're gonna do some things differently.

1361
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,676
I love it when you're funny.

1362
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,054
Grab my hand. Close your eyes.

1363
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:16,491
My God! My God!

1364
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:21,037
My arsing God in a box.

1365
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,001
You're kidding?

1366
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:30,797
I can go anywhere in time and you bring
me back to the worst party of all time.

1367
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,007
'Fraid so. Let's go.

1368
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:36,969
We've got work to do.

1369
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:38,179
What work?

1370
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,307
Making sure you do not meet Jimmy Kincade.

1371
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,850
Quick, in here.

1372
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,354
But he's about to fall in love with me!

1373
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,106
Not this time he isn't.

1374
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,202
Who's the pretty looking girl?
It's Jennifer, isn't it?

1375
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,495
Yeah.

1376
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:03,830
Wild!

1377
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,289
I like your skirt, Jennifer.

1378
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,749
Thank you.

1379
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,335
Right, I get it.

1380
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:13,548
If he hadn't met me, he would have
just had sex with someone else.

1381
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,883
Nip it in the bud?

1382
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,555
Excuse me, Jimmy.

1383
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,558
Sorry. Do I know you?

1384
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,518
Yeah, you do.

1385
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,771
Very well. Sorry.

1386
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,232
And this is what I should
have done right at the start.

1387
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,491
Happy New Year, everybody.
Happy New Year.

1388
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,535
And back to the cupboard.

1389
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,205
Amazing!

1390
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:47,790
What happens now?

1391
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,208
God knows.

1392
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,714
What I'm hoping is that
from this moment on you avoid

1393
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,043
the sleazy bad guys
because they're sleazy and bad.

1394
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,758
When did you get so serious?

1395
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:59,218
Since it occurred to
me that I might lose you.

1396
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,682
Brace yourself, this could be weird.

1397
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,185
Things will have changed.

1398
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:14,901
My God.

1399
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,027
What?

1400
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,236
Jay.

1401
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,155
Jay Jay? Yes.

1402
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:23,201
And he's adorable. My God.

1403
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:25,787
Right,

1404
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:27,914
let's do this.

1405
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,379
Come on, you two.

1406
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:39,091
Mum's just cracked
open a packet of biscuits.

1407
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,016
I've got something in mind for you.

1408
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,421
I know what you're gonna say.

1409
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,960
Have a biscuit and come and help me.

1410
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,773
But leave the rest for Uncle D.

1411
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:58,528
It's just tidying really.

1412
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:00,905
You all right? I missed you.
Yeah.

1413
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,075
Your mum wants me to do
some gardening. Okay.

1414
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,163
It's tidying up, it's all
a bit out of control.

1415
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:11,082
Anything that looks dead, out.

1416
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,085
This is what we're looking for.
Okay? All this.

1417
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,586
Dead stuff. See this.

1418
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,716
They've torn them to shreds, haven't they?

1419
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:35,439
How did everything go?

1420
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:37,316
Immensely satisfactory.

1421
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,237
I'm so happy. I wanna
hear all about it.

1422
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,537
Will you do dinner for us
because there's something

1423
01:26:43,576 --> 01:26:45,412
I have to do before
6:00 or I'll get fired?

1424
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,744
Yeah. I can't think of
anything I'd love to do more.

1425
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,956
Okay, where is the most
fabulous person in the world?

1426
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:56,961
Come to your dad and get mashed
up food shoved into your mouth!

1427
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:05,553
Hello there, little boy.

1428
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,933
You just

1429
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,477
wait there and I'll be back in a minute.

1430
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,742
Dad, can I have a quick word?

1431
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,660
Yeah. Sure.

1432
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,497
I can't go back past the birth again, can I?

1433
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:35,416
No. I should have
mentioned that.

1434
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,044
You're okay till it comes out but the exact

1435
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,671
sperm at the exact moment got you this

1436
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,089
particular baby,

1437
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,925
so if you do anything the tiniest bit

1438
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:45,801
different, you'll have a different child.

1439
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:52,600
So, every day up 'til yesterday
is as it will always be? Lost?

1440
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,811
Just like for everyone else.

1441
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,855
Okay. interesting.

1442
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,317
Tough. I love you, Dad.
I've gotta go.

1443
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,635
No.

1444
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,320
We're not leaving this room until we find

1445
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:33,182
a way of making sure
this never happens again.

1446
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,738
Will you go now?

1447
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:03,421
I have to leave Jimmy, don't I?

1448
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:05,923
For good.

1449
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,261
And I have to stop drinking.

1450
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,099
And stop leaving jobs.

1451
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:21,188
And I have to go out with someone

1452
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,608
nice and boring.

1453
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:28,779
Yay.

1454
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,244
And, you know,
nice isn't necessarily boring.

1455
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,620
Like who?

1456
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:39,248
Matt Damon?

1457
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,958
Okay.

1458
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,544
I'll go out with Matt Damon.

1459
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:46,881
Tell me, have you seen Jay recently?

1460
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:51,469
Your Jay? What, sticky-up hair Jay?
Looks a bit like a muppet Jay?

1461
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:52,595
Yes.

1462
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,390
He just popped into my head.
He's always had a crush on you.

1463
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:58,768
Really? Yeah.

1464
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:01,604
Weird!

1465
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,106
Thinking of asking him to dinner.
Are you free?

1466
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,985
Might be. Might have to
freshen up a bit first.

1467
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,362
Yeah. You look shit.

1468
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:18,412
Joanna.

1469
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:19,955
Thank Christ you're back.

1470
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:21,665
It's been a total nightmare.

1471
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,459
I know. it's all fine anyway.

1472
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,086
Where is she?

1473
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:28,506
It was the single worst night of my life.
Where's Posy?

1474
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:31,675
There she is! Hello!

1475
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:34,512
Hello! Hello.

1476
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,847
Darling, how are you doing?

1477
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,353
Let's have another one.

1478
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:47,191
Screw that. No.

1479
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:52,071
That hurt and I got fat.
Like fat-fat.

1480
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,490
Got a little bit fat, didn't she.

1481
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,784
Tell Mummy you want a sister.

1482
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,996
No. Tell Daddy you're happy
being an only child.

1483
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,126
Fortunately we are young and careless and

1484
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,670
it wasn't long before there were four of us.

1485
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:11,173
And this is incredible. Posy
Lake, only 3 years old,

1486
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,260
is about to break the women's
10 metre Olympic record.

1487
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:18,514
They're gonna do it. And here they
are, they've done it! Fantastic.

1488
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,350
That was brilliant.
You're so good.

1489
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,893
Sleeping right through all that.

1490
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,271
Can you help me?
I'm so nervous.

1491
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,690
What do I wear for dinner
with our bestselling author?

1492
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,359
Let me finish up with the
monsters and I'll come right up.

1493
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,694
Great. Thank you.

1494
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:33,445
Go again.

1495
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:36,490
Okay. How about this?

1496
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,118
That's gorgeous.
Job done. Yeah.

1497
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:42,413
No. Take it seriously. it's...

1498
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,041
I don't know. No, I hate it.

1499
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,085
Yeah. it's boring and

1500
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:51,463
makes me look kind of lumpy.

1501
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,383
No, you're right. it is boring and lumpy.
I hate it.

1502
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,137
Okay. What about this?

1503
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,472
Gorgeous. We did it.

1504
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,184
No, it's too breasty.

1505
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,394
Is it? Okay.

1506
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,520
It's not too breasty.

1507
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:09,732
No. I'm not wearing these heels.
I look like a prostitute.

1508
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,442
Not high heels, then.

1509
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,152
But then we have the short legs problem.

1510
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:15,779
Well, do you want to look
like a prostitute or a dwarf?

1511
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:19,033
Warning. That's a warning.

1512
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:23,746
Yes!

1513
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:24,872
No.

1514
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:29,793
No!

1515
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:32,922
Now that I like.

1516
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:35,674
No, I'm just picking up the dress

1517
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,302
that this goes under.
Such a bad boy.

1518
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:41,805
This one?

1519
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,015
Not bad.

1520
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:44,975
Or this one?

1521
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,603
It's a trick question, isn't it?
Same dress. No!

1522
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,188
No?

1523
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,774
Okay. I don't think
this one's too bad.

1524
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:53,859
Yeah, it's fabulous.

1525
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:55,945
Really? Yeah.

1526
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:58,405
Okay. Great. Good.

1527
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:59,615
Um...

1528
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,784
How about the blue one?

1529
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,577
The blue one? Yeah.

1530
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,872
The first one that you tried
on that was boring and lumpy,

1531
01:33:06,957 --> 01:33:09,124
but that wasn't actually
boring and lumpy, that one?

1532
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,126
Yeah, which do you prefer?

1533
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,170
I don't know. I'm actually
starting to go mad.

1534
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:14,672
I think I like the blue one.

1535
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,215
Okay. Yeah.

1536
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,261
Okay. Okay, let's go
with this one, then?

1537
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:22,221
You look amazing.

1538
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,514
Really? Yes.

1539
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,224
Okay, thanks.

1540
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,434
God.

1541
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:29,645
Where's Posy?

1542
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,772
I left her downstairs.

1543
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:35,567
Not leaving the door open to the
room with the manuscript in it?

1544
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,279
I don't think so.

1545
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,532
Look at me. Look me in

1546
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:45,077
And talk me through this.
Basically my life is over.

1547
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,788
I really need to go out for just
like two minutes, maybe one.

1548
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,581
Don't you dare!

1549
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,211
Don't you dare answer that!
What am I gonna do?

1550
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,792
I think that we should
really answer the phone.

1551
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:57,298
If you answer the goddamn phone,

1552
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:58,882
I will kill you with the phone.

1553
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:02,094
I won't answer the phone,
but I do need to get out.

1554
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,221
No, no getting out,
no getting out. No.

1555
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,848
Okay, right.

1556
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,558
Sorry, Mr McEwan.

1557
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:11,603
We read most of your book but,
you see, the rest of it was

1558
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:14,356
coloured on or shredded.

1559
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:16,692
Yeah.

1560
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:19,778
I had no idea Posy actually knew how to use

1561
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,989
that machine.
In a way that's impressive.

1562
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:26,201
What is it? How can I help you?

1563
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,581
Mary.

1564
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,876
No, everything... Sorry.

1565
01:34:34,753 --> 01:34:36,712
Your son will explain.

1566
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,339
It's your mother.

1567
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,341
Hi, Mum.

1568
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,848
No, no, it's okay. We'll...

1569
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:49,808
We'll come straight down.

1570
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,019
Okay, bye.

1571
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:07,951
Hello, darling.

1572
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,453
Mum. How are you?

1573
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:11,622
Honestly?

1574
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:12,790
Why not?

1575
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:15,876
I am fucking furious.

1576
01:35:16,503 --> 01:35:21,173
I am so uninterested in
a life without your father.

1577
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:24,635
Mary. Come on,
let's make some tea.

1578
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:26,637
How are you?

1579
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:27,888
Yeah, I'm fine.

1580
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,139
Did you eat?

1581
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:30,391
Yes, of course.

1582
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,481
Desmond.

1583
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,733
How are you?

1584
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:41,568
I'm very well, thanks.

1585
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,654
Though a little hot.

1586
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:50,494
Your father, I think, is not so well.

1587
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,579
Cancer.

1588
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:54,832
Yes.

1589
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,793
I'm very unhappy about it, Tim.

1590
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,797
At your wedding he said he loved me.

1591
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:04,299
He does. I know.

1592
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:08,595
That was the best day of my life.

1593
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,517
So this is probably the worst.

1594
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:20,774
Dad.

1595
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,945
For God's sake.

1596
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,322
Not you, too.

1597
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:28,490
What?

1598
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:32,369
Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up blubbing
her eyes out and now you're here.

1599
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,912
What's Mum been saying?

1600
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,164
The truth.

1601
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,331
Yeah, well,

1602
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,168
apart from that?

1603
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,796
It may have been the smoking but I couldn't

1604
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,674
undo that as it was
before you were all born.

1605
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,002
And anyway, your mother definitely
wouldn't have gone out with me

1606
01:36:49,087 --> 01:36:51,338
if I hadn't been such a sexy smoker.

1607
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:58,562
I did get diagnosed as soon as
possible, but it was too late.

1608
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,732
How long have we got?

1609
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:07,070
You know, it, it could be years.

1610
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,533
How long really?

1611
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:15,871
Weeks, I'm afraid.

1612
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:25,881
Have we had this conversation before?

1613
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
Yeah.

1614
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:33,222
What happened?

1615
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,891
I rather let myself down.

1616
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,976
I hugged you.

1617
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,205
Sorry.

1618
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:01,041
I think I just thought
with the time thing...

1619
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:03,794
No, I never said we could fix things.

1620
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,046
I specifically never said that.

1621
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:08,674
Life's a mixed bag, no matter who you are.

1622
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,717
Look at Jesus.
He was the Son of God,

1623
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,803
for God's sake, and look
how that turned out.

1624
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,179
I know, but

1625
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,599
you must see I feel a bit cheated.

1626
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:20,143
Don't. In fact,
feel the opposite.

1627
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,771
The only people who give up work at 50

1628
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,148
are the time travellers with cancer who want

1629
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,568
to play more table tennis with their sons.

1630
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:30,696
Right.

1631
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,491
So that's been the deal?

1632
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:40,497
I'm sorry we had to call.
It's suddenly got very bad.

1633
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:48,781
And I have something
very important to tell you.

1634
01:38:48,819 --> 01:38:51,341
Or, let me check,

1635
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,303
do you want to know the big secret,

1636
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,680
or would you rather find it
out for yourself like I did?

1637
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,849
Christ, there's another secret?

1638
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,853
Less dramatic.
Much more important.

1639
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:06,273
The real mothership.

1640
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:11,361
No, go on. Tell me.

1641
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,655
Let's save some time.

1642
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,539
And so he told me his
secret formula for happiness.

1643
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:26,627
Part one of the two part plan

1644
01:39:26,753 --> 01:39:28,795
was that I should just
get on with ordinary life,

1645
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,882
living it day by day, like anyone else.

1646
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,225
This is our current statement with a
revised paragraph there, highlighted.

1647
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,898
Rupert. Rupert, is that
the best you can do?

1648
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:52,235
No. Absolutely not.
We can change that.

1649
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:53,862
Item number two.

1650
01:40:01,371 --> 01:40:04,081
Good afternoon, sir. Are you
eating in or taking away today?

1651
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,582
Take away, please.

1652
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,042
Yeah? No problem.

1653
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:11,171
Lovely, that's 4.24 then, please, sir.
Thank you kindly.

1654
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:14,257
Lovely. And there's your change, sir.
76 pence change.

1655
01:40:14,384 --> 01:40:16,093
Thanks. Thank you. Hello there.

1656
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:17,791
Are you eating in or taking away?

1657
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:27,062
Do you find the Defendant, John
Welbeck, guilty or not guilty of fraud?

1658
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:28,188
Not guilty.

1659
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:31,736
And that is the verdict of you all? Yes.
Thank you. You may be seated.

1660
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:33,110
Thank God.

1661
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:35,612
Let the Defendant be discharged.

1662
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,281
Be upstanding in court.

1663
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:53,463
Lights out? Yeah.

1664
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:55,632
Tough day.

1665
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,469
But then came part two of Dad's plan.

1666
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,642
He told me to live every day
again almost exactly the same.

1667
01:41:06,436 --> 01:41:08,895
The first time with all the
tensions and worries that

1668
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,773
stop us noticing how sweet the world can be,

1669
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:14,651
but the second time noticing.

1670
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,278
Okay, Dad.

1671
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,488
Let's give it a go.

1672
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,871
What's our statement at the moment?

1673
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:28,874
This is it with the revised...

1674
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:38,675
Robert, this does not pass.
Is this the best you can do?

1675
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,220
I'll leave you two to thrash this out.

1676
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,266
Ooh.

1677
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,854
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.

1678
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,482
Are you eating in or taking away today?
Take away, please.

1679
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:54,775
Would you like a bag?

1680
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:56,151
That's fine.

1681
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:58,868
Lovely. That's 6.23 then, please.
And enjoy the rest of your day.

1682
01:41:58,963 --> 01:42:00,297
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1683
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,073
Hello, there.

1684
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,537
Look around you! What?

1685
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:08,872
Isn't this room beautiful?

1686
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,165
Yeah.

1687
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,042
Come on.

1688
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,169
Not guilty.

1689
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,382
Fantastic!

1690
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:54,543
So not such a bad day after all?

1691
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:57,712
No. it was pretty good really.

1692
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,424
Very good day, actually, as it turns out.

1693
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:04,761
Well, that's a relief,

1694
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:08,765
because if it had been a very bad day,

1695
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:13,228
I thought I might have had to have
had sex with you to make up for it.

1696
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:15,772
Goodnight.

1697
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:23,154
It was a very, very bad day.

1698
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:25,657
It went very, very badly.

1699
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,451
I got fired from my job.

1700
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:31,454
And then I killed a man.

1701
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,296
That is a very bad day.

1702
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,464
It's terrible. Yeah.

1703
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:44,759
Like the worst day ever.

1704
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:46,970
So sorry.

1705
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:55,478
Some days, of course, though,
you only want to go through once.

1706
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:57,480
You okay?

1707
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,868
Right, are we ready for this?

1708
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:55,705
'Course we're not. Hateful day.

1709
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,376
Just give me one minute.

1710
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,733
This is so brilliant.

1711
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:29,322
Dickens is so good on
actual jokes, actual gags.

1712
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,992
Where have you come from?

1713
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:33,910
It's the...

1714
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:35,912
Okay.

1715
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:37,747
Big day.

1716
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:42,043
Thanks for dropping in.
How's Uncle Desmond's suit?

1717
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,004
Immaculate.

1718
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:45,255
Excellent.

1719
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,603
Did I mention I wanted the Nick Cave track?

1720
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,342
It's taken care of.

1721
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:50,885
Thank you.

1722
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,596
Can I just read you this one bit?

1723
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,437
Read away, I've got lots of time.

1724
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:02,981
"I think the Romans must have aggravated

1725
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,775
"one another very much with their noses.

1726
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:09,446
"Perhaps they became the restless
people they were in consequence.

1727
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:12,782
"Anyhow, Mr Wopsle's Roman
nose so aggravated me... "

1728
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:51,005
What do you think about the kids?

1729
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:52,632
What about them?

1730
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:55,885
Not many of them, are there?

1731
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:57,971
What?

1732
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:00,682
Well, I mean two?

1733
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:05,854
It's more than the Chinese are allowed.

1734
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:10,483
I just thought that maybe, you know,

1735
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:13,319
it was time for the insurance baby.

1736
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:14,404
What?

1737
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:15,905
In case one of them is really smart,

1738
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,387
we don't want the other one to
feel stupid their whole life.

1739
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:22,704
And if we had a third one, then
we could have two happy dummies.

1740
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,167
What do you think?

1741
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:34,007
It was the toughest decision of my life.

1742
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:36,926
Saying 'yes' to the future meant

1743
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:39,429
saying 'goodbye'
to my dad. Forever.

1744
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,224
Why don't we wait a bit?

1745
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:47,270
Absolutely.

1746
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:50,106
You're right. Yeah.

1747
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:57,530
How about now?

1748
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,783
Or now?

1749
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,287
Now?

1750
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:12,712
Yeah,

1751
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:15,089
okay.

1752
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:17,634
Really?

1753
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:22,597
Dad always wished there had been more of us.

1754
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,390
So...

1755
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,479
Anyway, we might try and nothing happens.

1756
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,064
Exactly.

1757
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,824
Really could be tonight.

1758
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:44,410
And you cannot believe the detail in which

1759
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:46,412
I know the route to the hospital.

1760
01:49:46,497 --> 01:49:47,830
Yay.

1761
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:53,002
Will you excuse me for a sec?

1762
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,588
Just have to go downstairs.

1763
01:50:12,273 --> 01:50:15,275
And it's 17-20 in
this incredibly tight contest

1764
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,151
being played by the two most physically

1765
01:50:17,278 --> 01:50:19,028
perfect players in the history of the game.

1766
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:22,031
The crowd, enchanted by the
younger player, are seduced

1767
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,867
by memories of the older
player's illustrious past.

1768
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,871
My God, I've won.

1769
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:32,041
I haven't won in years.

1770
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:34,502
You finally got good.

1771
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:38,840
What's my prize? Apart from the
Olympic gold medal, of course.

1772
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:41,092
A kiss will have to do.

1773
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:44,220
A kiss?

1774
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,519
I get you.

1775
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:54,397
This is it, then?

1776
01:50:56,358 --> 01:50:57,734
This is it.

1777
01:50:58,527 --> 01:51:00,737
It's my last bit of extra time.

1778
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:03,656
The baby is completely on the way.

1779
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:26,095
Congratulations.

1780
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:34,604
My son.

1781
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,567
My dad.

1782
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,574
Is there anything at all I can do?

1783
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,785
Is there anything you want to do?

1784
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:53,247
I don't know. There is this

1785
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:56,709
one thing.

1786
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:59,128
A quick little walk.

1787
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:01,130
Totally against the rules, of course,

1788
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:03,132
but if we don't change a thing,

1789
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:06,803
if we're very careful,
it shouldn't do any harm.

1790
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:08,930
It would be nice.

1791
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:42,338
I'm really trying.
I'm really trying.

1792
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:45,466
Get down low.

1793
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,180
Total defeat.

1794
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:02,275
I'm tired.

1795
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:04,694
Thanks, Dad.

1796
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,045
So I'm almost
up-to-date with my story.

1797
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:27,049
As all families do,
we got used to life after death.

1798
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:29,051
And it was still fine.

1799
01:53:29,845 --> 01:53:34,015
And things settled back into their
traditional rhythms season after season,

1800
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:36,893
and are much as they have always been.

1801
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:40,897
And we've got used to
Kit Kat being happy again.

1802
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:44,358
And then we got used to her being a mum.

1803
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:47,403
Albeit not a very good or even safe one.

1804
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,198
And in the end,

1805
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:53,993
I think I've learned the final
lesson from my travels in time.

1806
01:53:54,786 --> 01:53:57,830
And I've even gone one step
further than my father did.

1807
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,468
Okay, I'll do the kids.

1808
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:14,889
No, don't worry. I'll do them.

1809
01:54:15,015 --> 01:54:16,682
Yeah, you do them, you lazy bum.

1810
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,815
The truth is, I now don't
travel back at all.

1811
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:21,854
Not even for the day.

1812
01:54:22,272 --> 01:54:24,857
I just try to live every day as if

1813
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:27,610
I've deliberately come back to this one day

1814
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:31,656
to enjoy it as if it was the full final day

1815
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:34,659
of my extraordinary, ordinary life.

1816
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:06,649
Hello, you're down already. That's great.
Thank you so much for that.

1817
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:08,150
And in we go.

1818
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:12,572
Posy? Posy!

1819
01:55:20,956 --> 01:55:21,956
That's fine.

1820
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:46,272
We're all travelling through time together

1821
01:55:46,565 --> 01:55:48,733
every day of our lives.

1822
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,402
All we can do is do our best

1823
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:54,614
to relish this remarkable ride.

1824
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:39,492
Yes, yes, yes...

1825
01:56:51,797 --> 01:56:53,881
Okay, I'll see you then.

1826
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:55,424
Bye-bye.

1827
01:56:56,093 --> 01:56:57,593
See you later.

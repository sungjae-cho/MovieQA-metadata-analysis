along the horizon taking form,

356
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:03,052
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

357
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,419
You dare to whisper
the word.

358
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,454
Land.

359
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,630
Land.

360
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,890
Life.

361
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,061
Resurrection.

362
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,734
The true adventure.

363
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,568
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

364
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,841
out of the immensity,

365
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,247
into new life.

366
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,418
That,

367
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,649
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

368
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,104
I like
your immensities.

369
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:01,510
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

370
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,039
Such great spaces
make us small.

371
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,917
Do we discover
the New World,
Mr. Raleigh,

372
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,480
or does the New World
discover us?

373
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,391
You speak like
a true explorer.

374
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,897
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

375
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,201
And I like you.

376
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,806
You know, of course,
that when I like a man,
I reward him.

377
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,147
I have heard that.

378
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,117
And what have you
to say about it?

379
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,554
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

380
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,921
Is the mission
not the man?

381
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,927
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

382
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,797
Go on.

383
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,706
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

384
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,677
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

385
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,077

is the heart and soul

Make sure she
and only she reads this.

407

We wait for her order.

408
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,249

My noble jailer.

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,468
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

412
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,804
As always, ma'am,
my concern
is for your safety.

413
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,580
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

414
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,751
Do you think
she prays for me?

415
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,462
Is it true

416
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,965
that I've never known
the pleasure of being
liked for myself?

417

I hope you believe
I like you for yourself,
my lady.

418
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,946
Is anyone ever liked
simply for themselves?
I doubt it.

Are you?

420
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,517
Men like you
because you're pretty,

421
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,017
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

422
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,597
No doubt.

423
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,059
Him, too.

424
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,567
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

425
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,611
You do realize that.

426
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,673
Yes, my lady.

And the other thing,
too, of course.

428

But then,
all men want that.

429

confers no distinction.

what would happen

No.

want to hide

Of course.

We both want to get
back into favor
with the court.

<i>is most unusual this year.</i>

530
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,987
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

531
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:08,150
three days
after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

532
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,661
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

533
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:16,894
which governs
the fortune of all princes
of the female gender.

534
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,060
Princes of the
female gender.

535
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,835
I mean to say,
a prince who is
also a woman.

536
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,344
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

537
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,572
What does it mean?

538
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:36,519
It means the rise
of a great empire, Majesty,
and the fall of another.

539
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,721
Convulsions.

540
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,423
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

541
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,727
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

542
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,860
Astrology is,
as yet, more an art
than a science.

543
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,371
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

544
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,067
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

545
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:02,545
(LAUGHS) He means,
will I be assassinated?

546
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,514
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

547
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:17,793
And the private life
of this prince
of the female gender,

548
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,022
what do the stars
foretell there?

549
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,895
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

550
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,097
Surely the stars
foretell matters
of state, Dr. Dee.

551
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,609
For such a prediction
I must look
in a different chart.

552
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,977
Wonderful.

553
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,316
Such strength.

554
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,485
You will need
all your strength
in the days to come.

555
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,356
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

556
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,600
I have not seen
fear in your face
for such a long time.

557
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,165
Have I reason to fear?

558
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,469
Something has
weakened you.

559
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,306
There are
hard days coming.

560
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,682
But I am no prophet.

561
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,789
I see no more
than the shadows
of ghosts.

562
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,929
CALLEY: Visitor, sir.

563
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,869
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

564
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,103
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

565
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,214
Welcome aboard.

566
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,151
The Queen wishes
to see you.

567
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,224
She asks me
to assure you...

568
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,390
I need
no assurances, Bess.

569
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,395
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

570
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,961
Then you should
say so in person.

571
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,078
This is
my life, Bess.

572
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,451
This is where
I belong.

573
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,524
It seems to be
a lonely life.

574
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,494
Sometimes.
But it's the life
I've chosen.

575
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,991
I understand.

576
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,075
You ask permission to go.

577
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,121
Yes, Majesty.

578
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,646
You plan to return
to your colony

579
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:06,185
for two, maybe three,
four years.

580
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,699
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

581
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,101
That is a long time.

582
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,469
There's nothing
for me here.

583
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,976
At sea,
I know what I'm to do.
I know the risks.

584
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,375
Here...
No. You're wrong.

585
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,882
You're needed here.

586
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,746
As captain of my
personal guard.

587
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,115
Captain of your guard?

588
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,175
Kneel.

589
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,744
Majesty.

590
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,222
I said, kneel.

591
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,556
Sir Walter Raleigh.

592
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,803
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

593
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,339
This is too great an honor.

594
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,812
If it's so great an honor,
why are you staring
at your boots?

595
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,214
You know why.

596
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,514
Now you stare
at the wall.

597
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,923
Am I so hideous
you can't even look
me in the face?

598
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,017
Why do you speak
like a fool

599
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,154
when you are anything
but a fool?

600
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,823
Fool?

601
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,662
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

602
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,798
And you, you...
You come here

603
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,208
as if from another time.
And I've...

604
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,978
You have real adventures.
You go where the maps end.
And I'd...

605
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,846
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

606
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,133
The storm clouds
are gathering.
You are needed here.

607
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,731
You cannot leave England.

608
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,827
(RESTON PRAYING IN LATIN)

609
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,367
"For he that will
save his life
will lose it.

610
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:36,605
<i>"And he that will</i>
<i>lose his life for my sake</i>
<i>shall find it. "</i>

611
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,782
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

612
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,547
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

613
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,240
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

614
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,713
I thought I prayed
in silence.

615
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,010
You did.

616
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,550
(SNIFFLING)

617
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,884
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

618
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,160
The man who was
hanged today...

619
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,757
He was your cousin.

620
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,702
(SIGHS)

621
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,668
Yes.

622
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,708
I'm sorry.

623
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,710
The last time
I saw him,

624
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,486
he needed my help.

625
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,352
I did nothing.

626
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,120
What could
you have done?

627
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,689
I don't know.

628
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,931
Now he's dead.

629
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,870
(CRYING)
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

630
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,136
Believe me, there's nothing
that you could have done
that would have spared him.

631
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,801
I'm so afraid.

632
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,004
We're all human, Bess.

633
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,943
We do what we can.

634
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,593
<i>PAULET: Your laundress</i>
<i>was found to be carrying</i>
<i>letters in her washing.</i>

635
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,594
Not her job, I think.

636
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,902
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

637
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:20,602
Through me.
And you will read them.

638
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,646
With respectful
admiration.

639
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,341
Am I to have
no privacy?

640
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,440
No.

641
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,144
You disappoint me, sir.

642
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,714
The Queen orders
these measures
for your protection.

643
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,222
The Queen?

644
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,350
I am a queen.

645
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,501
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

646
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,570
Why is that, sir?

647
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,747
Can it be that no man
will have her?

648
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,633
Let him
throw you round.

649
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,475
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

650
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,378
MAN: And jump.

651
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,941
When I bend like this,
you take a leap
into the air.

652
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,255
ELIZABETH: The Volta.

653
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,757
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

654
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,491
You see
how fearless Bess is?

655
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,258
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

656
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,389
Do you think
that wrong?

657
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,663
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

658
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,968
To tell you
the truth,

659
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,269
I'm very, very tired
of always being
in control.

660
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,333
Nonsense.

661
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,708
What?

662
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,579
You eat and
drink control.

663
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,346
Is that so?

664
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,420
Bess.

665
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,788
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

666
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,157
He's eager
to show us his skill.

667
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,891
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

668
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:31,160
Come now.

669
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,460
(LAUGHING)

670
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,766
You stand
like this,

671
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,335
with your hands here.

672
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,971
And when she jumps,

673
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,575
on the fifth step,

674
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,317
you lift her.

675
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,253
What could be simpler?

676
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,624
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

677
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,830
I am to be obeyed.

678
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,465
As Your Majesty
wishes.

679
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,004
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

680
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,685
Play.

681
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,150
Six counts.

682
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,485
(MUSIC PLAYING)
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

683
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,660
Leave us.

684
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,462
I want both of them
left alone.

685
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,800
Madam.

686
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,347
I must reply.

687
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,353
"If our forces
are in readiness,

688
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,757
"both within and without
the realm,

689
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:50,664
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work."

690
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,564
I think we have it.

691
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,108
Yes.

692
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,345
Let God's
work begin.

693
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,124
WALSINGHAM:
Where have you been?

694
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,828
I met up
with some old friends.

695
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,201
From Paris, no doubt.

696
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,206
We haven't
seen you for days.

697
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,866
Yes.

698
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,910
Now you're back.

699
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:44,547
Do you know,
I can still remember
the day you were born.

700
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,691
I was 11 years old.

701
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:55,058
And you,
this helpless bundle.

702
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,029
I looked at you
in your crib,

703
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,263
with your little,
wrinkled face,

704
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,668
and I loved you
from the first.

705
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,298

01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,083
Of course, I remember.

884
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,062
I ask that you
forget me.

885
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,657
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

886
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,100
Forget me.
MARGARET: Bess!

887
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,603
We're summoned.
Coming.

888
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:24,814
This Spanish Armada
is at sea with an army
of 10,000 men?

889
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,411
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

890
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,822
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

891
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,727
They plan to cross
the Channel in barges
and sail into the Thames.

892
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,425
They don't have
enough barges yet.
We have a little time.

893
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:43,460
And our forces
defend the mouth of
the Thames at Tilbury with...

894
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:47,565
What? How...
Four thousand men?

895
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,477
Three thousand.
Possibly.

896
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,946
WALSINGHAM:
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

897
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,483
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

898
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,687
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

899
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,985
before they have
the chance to unite.

HOWARD: Your Majesty,

901
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:09,454
this vast Armada
will surely smash through
our naval defenses

902
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,123
and overrun
us on land.

903
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:15,536

for the worst.

to my business.

931
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,822

England will not fall

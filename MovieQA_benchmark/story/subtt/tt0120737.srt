1
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,633
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:40,879
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,558
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,144
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,430
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:53,190
...is lost.

7
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,939
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:14,214
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,299
Three were given to the Elves:

10
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:20,294
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,422
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:28,595
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,308
And nine...

14
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,525
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:37,566
...who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:43,904
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,583
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,912
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:55,337
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:55,758 --> 00:02:00,220
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,470
...to control all others.

22
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:06,632
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:11,066
...and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:15,893
One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,109
One by one...

26
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:23,278
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:26,530
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:31,660
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,506
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,453
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,960
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,212
...could not be undone.

33
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,736
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,326
...when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:51,670
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:29,247
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,292
The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:42,723
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,556
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,260
...are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:53,148
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,966
It betrayed Isildur...

43
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,214
...to his death.

44
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,266
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:35,809
...were lost.

46
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,859
History became legend...

47
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,064
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:44,119
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:48,029
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,501
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,288
...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,192
My precious.

53
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,212
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...

54
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:08,344
...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

55
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:11,514
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,771
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:18,396
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,173
My precious.

59
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:30,372
The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:34,418
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:39,208
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:42,675
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,766
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,764
...whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,265
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:55,269
...its time had now come.

67
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:00,365
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:05,529
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:10,949
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,199
What's this?

71
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,830
A Hobbit.

72
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:16,797
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,751
A ring.

74
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,968
Lost!

75
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:27,050
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,559
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:34,976
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,775
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:46,194
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,655
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:54,628
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
West farthing...

82
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,831
...the Shire...

83
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,884
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,850
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:23,402
There and Back Again:

86
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,742
A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:29,869
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,458
Now...

89
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,169
...where to begin?

90
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:41,503
Ah, yes....

91
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,847
"Concerning...

92
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,556
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:55,190
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

94
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,360
...for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,525
...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

96
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,908
...by the world of the Big Folk.

97
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:09,875
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:13,252
...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

99
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:17,458
...being neither renowned
as great warriors...

100
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:21,836
...nor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:29,225
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,977
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:37,604
...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

104
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:40,147
A rather unfair observation...

105
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:44,031
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,205
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:50,499
But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,783
...is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,663
...and good, tilled earth.

110
00:09:55,882 --> 00:10:01,041
For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

111
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:08,552
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

112
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,015
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

113
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:20,562
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,905
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,626
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,545
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:44,881
Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:53,428
And I must follow if I can

119
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,570
The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:02,231
Down from the door where it began

121
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,407
Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,829
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.

123
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,914
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:24,343
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:38,778
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,360
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,206
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,249
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,868
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,997
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,089
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,965
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,428
And so life in the Shire goes on...

134
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,646
...very much as it has
this past Age...

135
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:19,363
..full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

136
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,363
If it comes at all.

137
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,157
For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

138
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:29,868
...passing from one generation
to the next.

139
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,249
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

140
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,791
...in Bag End.

141
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:42,338
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,470
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,933
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,855
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:58,603
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,993
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,894
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,532
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?

149
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,462
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:55,746
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,967
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,089
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:02,590
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:09,052
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,803
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:17,151
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,028
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,408
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:40,126
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:00,020
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:04,693
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:10,950
So am I.

164
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,193
No, thank you!

165
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,360
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:52,081
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,962
Gandalf?

168
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,091
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!

169
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:06,427
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,176
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,816
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,400
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:23,293
Oh, here we are.

174
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,192
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:33,199
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,463
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:43,090
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,970
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,021
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

180
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,515
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:02,942
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

182
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:06,527
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:10,658
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

184
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,327
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

185
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,379
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,587
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

187
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:29,099
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

188
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,509
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.

189
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:35,479
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,268
I'm not at home!

191
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,854
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:48,150
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.

193
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,320
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

194
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,293
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,460
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:57,172 --> 00:18:00,671
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:05,426
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:09,554
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,011
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,604
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,436
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,106
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,942
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

204
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,284
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:30,200
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

206
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,959
I know.

207
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:39,671
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,716
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:47,587
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:50,130
Little rivers.

211
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:57,312
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:03,942
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:08,609
I feel thin.

214
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,540
Sort of stretched...

215
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:15,120
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:19,831
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:23,252
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:28,675
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:35,433
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the South farthing.

220
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,326
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,378
...this will be a night to remember.

222
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:22,273
Hello, hello.

223
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,573
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

224
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:30,156
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,325
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:39,170
Go on!

227
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,136
So there I was...

228
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:55,395
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:57,597
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

230
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:00,187
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:05,446
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:09,985
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:13,787
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:17,286
...and turned them all to stone!

235
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:23,962
Quickly.

236
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:30,178
Up they go!

237
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:34,261
No, the big one.

238
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,281
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:48,366
Are all these children yours?

240
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,578
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,912
Bilbo?

242
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:58,334
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:58,545 --> 00:21:59,624
Quickly, hide!

244
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,716
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:15,554
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:19,645
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,569
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,064
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

249
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:27,782
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:29,735
I think it was because...

251
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:32,277
...of all my numerous relations...

252
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,081
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

253
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:38,168
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:39,171
No.

255
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,954
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:46,461
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,556
...you'll be all right.

258
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,979
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:58,650
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

260
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,400
This was your idea.

261
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,794
Bilbo.

262
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,708
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:25,295
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:42,393
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

265
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:48,192
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,283
I might've known.

267
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,244
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,410
Speech!

269
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:01,662
Speech!

270
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:09,168
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:12,131
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:14,843
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:16,095
...Hornblowers...

274
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:18,934
...Bolgers...

275
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:20,860
...Bracegirdles...

276
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,690
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

277
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:29,034
Today is my 111th birthday!

278
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:32,373
Happy birthday!

279
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:36,826
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

280
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,959
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,632
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

282
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:48,421
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

283
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,773
I have things to do.

284
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,279
I've put this off far too long.

285
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:17,073
I regret to announce this is the end!

286
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:19,416
I'm going now.

287
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:23,416
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

288
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,000
Goodbye.

289
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:03,376
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

290
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:06,927
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

291
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:12,178
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

292
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:14,550
It was just a bit of fun.

293
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,473
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

294
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,395
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

295
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:26,283
As often as I can spare them.

296
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:29,658
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

297
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,206
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

298
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:37,701
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

299
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:41,748
No. Wait, it's...

300
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:46,962
...here in my pocket.

301
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,802
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

302
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,979
Yet, after all, why not?

303
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:06,402
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.

304
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,983
Is that so hard?

305
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:10,530
Well, no.

306
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:13,663
And yes.

307
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:19,499
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

308
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,456
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

309
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,884
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

310
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,134
It's mine.

311
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:30,227
My own.

312
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:36,175
-My precious.
-Precious?

313
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:39,268
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

314
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,062
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

315
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:45,026
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

316
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:48,071
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!

317
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:52,530
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

318
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:56,410
I am not trying to rob you.

319
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,129
I'm trying to help you.

320
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,935
All your long years,
we've been friends.

321
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,476
Trust me as you once did.

322
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,182
Let it go.

323
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:24,734
You're right, Gandalf.

324
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:29,529
The ring must go to Frodo.

325
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,824
It's late. The road is long.

326
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,531
Yes, it is time.

327
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:44,331
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

328
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:22,079
I've thought up an ending for my book:

329
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:28,712
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

330
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:32,346
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

331
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:34,852
Goodbye, Gandalf.

332
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:40,227
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

333
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:52,278
The road goes ever on and on

334
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,239
Until our next meeting.

335
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:28,185
It's mine. My own.

336
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:31,860
My precious.

337
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,038
Riddles in the dark.

338
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,659
Bilbo!

339
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,417
Bilbo!

340
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:45,001
My precious.

341
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,802
Precious.

342
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,552
He's gone, hasn't he?

343
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,394
He talked for so long about leaving...

344
00:30:57,604 --> 00:31:00,308
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

345
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,688
Gandalf?

346
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,615
Bilbo's ring.

347
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:19,331
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

348
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,630
He's left you Bag End.

349
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,749
Along with all his possessions.

350
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:31,885
The ring is yours now.

351
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,928
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

352
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,389
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

353
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,902
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.

354
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,401
I don't understand.

355
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:52,736
Neither do I.

356
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,286
Keep it secret.

357
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,291
Keep it safe.

358
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,006
Shire!

359
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:38,591
Baggins!

360
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,347
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

361
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,933
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

362
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:40,812
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

363
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,147
"It has come to me.

364
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:49,814
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

365
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:53,449
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

366
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:57,447
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

367
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,158
It is precious to me...

368
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,665
...though I buy it with great pain.

369
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,011
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

370
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:16,055
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

371
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:20,313
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

372
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,910
Shire.

373
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:41,990
Baggins.

374
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:46,549
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

375
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,754
That way.

376
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,927
To heal my heart and drown my woe

377
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,436
Rain may fall and wind may blow

378
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,559
But there still be

379
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,187
Many miles to go

380
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,311
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

381
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,686
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

382
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,738
Better than rain or rippling brook

383
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:13,319
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

384
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,577
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

385
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:23,876
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

386
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:25,756
War is brewing.

387
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,294
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

388
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,085
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

389
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:36,768
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

390
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,931
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

391
00:35:40,147 --> 00:35:41,521
And proud of it.

392
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,972
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Cheers.

393
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,274
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

394
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,783
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

395
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:58,324
-Good night, lads.
-Good night.

396
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:03,004
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

397
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:05,541
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

398
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,301
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

399
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:12,502
Does she?

400
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,175
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.

401
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,409
Is it secret? Is it safe?

402
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:54,429
What are you doing?

403
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,568
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

404
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:10,945
It's quite cool.

405
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,244
What can you see?

406
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:20,404
Can you see anything?

407
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:24,503
Nothing.

408
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:27,165
There's nothing.

409
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,752
Wait.

410
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:36,088
There are markings.

411
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:40,972
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

412
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,764
There are few who can.

413
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:49,143
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

414
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:50,810
Mordor!

415
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,108
In the common tongue, it says:

416
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:56,827
"One Ring to rule them all...

417
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,365
...One Ring to find them...

418
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,789
...One Ring to bring them all...

419
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:05,081
...and in the darkness bind them."

420
00:38:06,716 --> 00:38:08,755
This is the One Ring...

421
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:14,211
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

422
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:18,476
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

423
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:21,800
Bilbo found it.

424
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,188
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.

425
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:28,943
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

426
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:32,524
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

427
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:37,578
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

428
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,196
The Ring has awoken.

429
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,171
It's heard its master's call.

430
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,247
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

431
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,048
No, Frodo.

432
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:59,303
The spirit of Sauron endured.

433
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:04,859
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

434
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,316
Sauron has returned.

435
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,314
His Orcs have multiplied.

436
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:14,531
His fortress at Barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

437
00:39:14,747 --> 00:39:19,537
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

438
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,788
He is seeking it.

439
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:25,867
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

440
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:28,794
For the Ring yearns above all else...

441
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:32,425
...to return to the hand
of its master.

442
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,382
They are one...

443
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,682
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

444
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:38,924
Frodo...

445
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,351
...he must never find it.

446
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:42,594
All right.

447
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:47,235
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

448
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:50,115
No one knows it's here, do they?

449
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:56,982
Do they, Gandalf?

450
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,458
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

451
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:05,707
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

452
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:08,047
But the enemy found him first.

453
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:12,259
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

454
00:40:12,473 --> 00:40:16,934
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

455
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:17,865
Shire!

456
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,105
Baggins!

457
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,107
Shire.

458
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:26,186
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

459
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:30,060
Who goes there?

460
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:33,023
Take it, Gandalf!

461
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,448
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

462
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:37,035
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

463
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:40,581
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

464
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,333
I dare not take it.

465
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,126
Not even to keep it safe.

466
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:50,257
Understand, Frodo...

467
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:54,546
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

468
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:05,684
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

469
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:09,194
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

470
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,697
No, it can't.

471
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,414
What must I do?

472
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:24,620
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?

473
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,087
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

474
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:29,461
Bree.

475
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:32,426
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...

476
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:35,091
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

477
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:39,008
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

478
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,221
I don't have any answers.

479
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:48,270
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

480
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:50,608
He'll know what to do.

481
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:54,077
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

482
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:56,777
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

483
00:41:57,456 --> 00:42:00,739
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

484
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:04,583
I can cut across country
easily enough.

485
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,418
My dear Frodo.

486
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:11,716
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

487
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:14,845
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

488
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:17,382
And yet, after a hundred years...

489
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,641
...they can still surprise you.

490
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,600
Get down.

491
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:38,278
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

492
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:42,959
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

493
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,577
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

494
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,631
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

495
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,956
Nothing important.

496
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:54,589
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

497
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:59,553
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

498
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:01,021
No?

499
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:04,219
Perhaps not.

500
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,899
I've thought of a better use for you.

501
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,656
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

502
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,367
Be careful, both of you.

503
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:20,415
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

504
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:23,584
Birds, beasts.

505
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,165
Is it safe?

506
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:30,217
Never put it on...

507
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:33,795
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

508
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,507
Always remember, Frodo...

509
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:39,181
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

510
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,682
It wants to be found.

511
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:24,477
This is it.

512
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,938
This is what?

513
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:29,351
If I take one more step...

514
00:44:29,863 --> 00:44:33,730
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

515
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:39,447
Come on, Sam.

516
00:44:47,923 --> 00:44:49,750
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

517
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:54,048
-"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
-"Going out your door.

518
00:44:54,263 --> 00:44:58,675
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

519
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:03,058
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. "

520
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:17,911
Sam.

521
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:23,324
Wood-elves.

522
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,593
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

523
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:42,887
To the Grey Havens.

524
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,472
They're leaving Middle-earth.

525
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,897
Never to return.

526
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:52,897
I don't know why...

527
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,988
...it makes me sad.

528
00:45:58,037 --> 00:46:02,698
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

529
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,127
Just shut your eyes...

530
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:08,090
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

531
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:12,212
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

532
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:24,189
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

533
00:46:24,397 --> 00:46:27,269
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

534
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:31,985
Me neither, Sam.

535
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:03,513
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

536
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,354
The hour grows late.

537
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:09,150
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

538
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,771
...seeking my counsel.

539
00:47:11,991 --> 00:47:15,939
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

540
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,440
My old friend.

541
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:19,324
Saruman.

542
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:27,128
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

543
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:30,206
So the Ring of Power has been found.

544
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:33,629
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

545
00:47:33,846 --> 00:47:37,049
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

546
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:42,056
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

547
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:46,936
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

548
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:48,644
Time?

549
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,231
What time do you think we have?

550
00:47:52,654 --> 00:47:56,488
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

551
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:58,909
He cannot yet take physical form...

552
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,826
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

553
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:07,575
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

554
00:48:08,129 --> 00:48:14,085
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

555
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:18,716
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

556
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:24,883
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

557
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:27,649
The Eye of Sauron.

558
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:30,431
He is gathering all evil to him.

559
00:48:30,861 --> 00:48:32,771
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

560
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:35,735
...great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

561
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,449
You know this?

562
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,489
How?

563
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,740
I have seen it.

564
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,370
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

565
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:48,582
Why?

566
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:51,750
Why should we fear to use it?

567
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:58,335
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

568
00:48:58,555 --> 00:49:01,760
We do not know who else
may be watching.

569
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:07,058
The hour is later than you think.

570
00:49:07,273 --> 00:49:09,598
Sauron's forces are already moving.

571
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:14,614
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

572
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,024
The Nine?

573
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,245
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

574
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:22,124
...disguised as riders in black.

575
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:26,281
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.

576
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,126
And kill the one who carries it.

577
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,127
Frodo!

578
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:49,145
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

579
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,691
There are none who can.

580
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,904
Against the power of Mordor...

581
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,740
...there can be no victory.

582
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:05,874
We must join with him, Gandalf.

583
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,495
We must join with Sauron.

584
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:14,843
It would be wise, my friend.

585
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,762
Tell me...

586
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,003
...friend...

587
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:23,560
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

588
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:04,769
I gave you the chance...

589
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,520
...of aiding me willingly...

590
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:12,898
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

591
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,715
Mr. Frodo?

592
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:40,097
Frodo? Frodo!

593
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:44,721
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?

594
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:47,939
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?

595
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:52,642
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

596
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:56,524
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

597
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:00,528
Frodo.

598
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:03,030
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.

599
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:04,624
Get off him.

600
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,584
Come on, Frodo.

601
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,668
What's the meaning of this?

602
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:12,215
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

603
00:52:13,384 --> 00:52:15,508
You get back here!

604
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:17,793
Get out of my field!

605
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,849
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

606
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,976
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

607
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:25,267
And some cabbages.

608
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:28,400
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

609
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,653
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

610
00:52:32,862 --> 00:52:35,021
...he's clearly overreacting.

611
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,735
Run!

612
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:52,753
Oh, that was close.

613
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:56,963
I think I've broken something.

614
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,300
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

615
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,135
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

616
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:06,594
-Short cut to what?
-Mushrooms!

617
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,860
That's mine.

618
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,243
That's nice, Merry.

619
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:23,780
Here's a nice one, Sam.

620
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,537
I think we should get off the road.

621
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,096
Get off the road!

622
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:38,799
Quick!

623
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:52,980
Be quiet!

624
00:54:59,307 --> 00:55:01,464
What was that?

625
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:35,670
Anything?

626
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:37,840
Nothing.

627
00:55:38,556 --> 00:55:40,844
What is going on?

628
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:45,176
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

629
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,015
Frodo?

630
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:49,721
Get down!

631
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:08,876
I have to leave the Shire.

632
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:12,169
Sam and I must get to Bree.

633
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:13,841
Right.

634
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:17,458
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

635
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,099
Run!

636
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,307
This way! Follow me!

637
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:34,934
Run!

638
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:49,995
Get the rope, Sam!

639
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:54,175
Frodo!

640
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:56,296
Run, Frodo!

641
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:57,717
Go!
-Hurry!

642
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,553
Frodo, come on!

643
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:03,516
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

644
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:22,661
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

645
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:38,757
Come on.

646
00:57:49,942 --> 00:57:53,392
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

647
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:59,701
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

648
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:03,861
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

649
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:07,458
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

650
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:11,118
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

651
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:13,831
It's my job to ask questions
after night fall.

652
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:16,886
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

653
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:19,254
Can't be too careful.

654
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:42,449
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

655
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,104
Excuse me.

656
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:11,900
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

657
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:18,197
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

658
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:23,070
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

659
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:26,202
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

660
00:59:27,456 --> 00:59:29,949
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

661
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:33,337
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?

662
00:59:33,757 --> 00:59:35,500
Gandalf.

663
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,009
Oh, yes...

664
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,296
...I remember. Elderly chap.

665
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,594
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

666
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:45,804
Not seen him for six months.

667
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:53,891
What do we do now?

668
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:02,316
Sam...

669
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:04,412
...he'll be here. He'll come.

670
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,244
Get out of my way!

671
01:00:11,629 --> 01:00:13,290
What's that?

672
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:15,998
This, my friend, is a pint.

673
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:17,842
It comes in pints?

674
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,923
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!

675
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:32,102
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

676
01:00:35,654 --> 01:00:37,149
Excuse me.

677
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,951
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

678
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,498
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

679
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:52,288
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

680
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:55,872
Strider.

681
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,780
Baggins.

682
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:17,155
Baggins.

683
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:31,744
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

684
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:35,380
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

685
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,628
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

686
01:01:38,846 --> 01:01:41,089
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

687
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:47,394
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

688
01:02:16,928 --> 01:02:19,383
You cannot hide.

689
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,468
I see you.

690
01:02:27,189 --> 01:02:29,858
There is no life...

691
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:32,225
...in the void.

692
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,938
Only...

693
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:36,355
...death.

694
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:47,246
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

695
01:02:51,879 --> 01:02:52,909
What do you want?

696
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:55,169
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

697
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:58,592
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.

698
01:02:58,887 --> 01:03:01,379
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

699
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,300
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

700
01:03:05,812 --> 01:03:08,431
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

701
01:03:09,605 --> 01:03:10,636
Yes.

702
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:14,772
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

703
01:03:18,784 --> 01:03:21,321
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

704
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:27,075
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

705
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,210
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

706
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,500
They're coming.

707
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,584
What are they?

708
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,884
They were once Men.

709
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,302
Great kings of Men.

710
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:06,975
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

711
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:10,684
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

712
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:14,184
One by one, falling into darkness.

713
01:05:14,402 --> 01:05:16,892
Now they are slaves to his will.

714
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,991
They are the Nazgul.

715
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:23,906
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

716
01:05:24,663 --> 01:05:26,074
At all times they feel...

717
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,198
...the presence of the Ring...

718
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:32,959
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

719
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:45,883
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.

720
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:58,111
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

721
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,157
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

722
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:05,448
-...and feel fouler.
-He's foul enough.

723
01:06:06,038 --> 01:06:08,874
We have no choice but to trust him.

724
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,499
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

725
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:18,167
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.

726
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:21,511
We're going to see the Elves.

727
01:06:43,163 --> 01:06:47,373
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?

728
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,250
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.

729
01:06:50,459 --> 01:06:52,665
What about second breakfast?

730
01:06:56,091 --> 01:06:59,257
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

731
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:04,676
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

732
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:09,054
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.

733
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,153
Pippin!

734
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:36,122
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

735
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,171
Who is she?

736
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:20,459
This woman you sing of.

737
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:26,261
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

738
01:08:26,475 --> 01:08:31,637
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

739
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:35,606
What happened to her?

740
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:40,312
She died.

741
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,697
Get some sleep, Frodo.

742
01:08:56,965 --> 01:09:01,044
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

743
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:05,674
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

744
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:14,808
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

745
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:24,869
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

746
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,237
We have work to do.

747
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:14,495
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

748
01:10:14,838 --> 01:10:16,711
Rip them all down.

749
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:47,035
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sul.

750
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,369
We shall rest here tonight.

751
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:06,505
These are for you.
Keep them close.

752
01:11:06,724 --> 01:11:09,217
I'm going to have a look around.

753
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,472
Stay here.

754
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,184
My tomato's burst.

755
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,312
Could I have some bacon?

756
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,488
Want a tomato, Sam?

757
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:26,533
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

758
01:11:26,746 --> 01:11:29,419
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!

759
01:11:29,627 --> 01:11:33,622
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

760
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:42,848
Go!

761
01:12:37,317 --> 01:12:38,728
Back, you devils!

762
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:03,440
Frodo!

763
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:09,403
Oh, Sam.

764
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:47,440
Strider!

765
01:14:50,206 --> 01:14:55,711
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

766
01:14:57,171 --> 01:15:02,083
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

767
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:07,714
Hurry!

768
01:15:07,934 --> 01:15:11,884
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

769
01:15:12,105 --> 01:15:13,978
Hold on, Frodo.

770
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:16,557
Gandalf!

771
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:57,641
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

772
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:02,691
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

773
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:07,320
Is he going to die?

774
01:18:07,537 --> 01:18:12,413
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

775
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:21,373
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

776
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:23,053
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.

777
01:18:23,262 --> 01:18:24,294
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

778
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:27,715
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

779
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:46,236
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

780
01:19:11,102 --> 01:19:12,134
Frodo.

781
01:19:14,106 --> 01:19:17,225
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

782
01:19:19,652 --> 01:19:21,480
Hear my voice...

783
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,863
Come back to the light.

784
01:19:28,953 --> 01:19:30,826
Who is she?

785
01:19:31,455 --> 01:19:33,245
Frodo.

786
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:37,040
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.

787
01:19:39,338 --> 01:19:41,497
He's not going to last.

788
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:44,385
We must get him to my father.

789
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:47,964
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

790
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:54,305
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

791
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:57,806
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

792
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,684
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

793
01:20:00,527 --> 01:20:01,902
The Road is too dangerous.

794
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,275
What are they saying?

795
01:20:03,572 --> 01:20:05,611
lf I can get across the river...

796
01:20:05,824 --> 01:20:08,399
...the power of my people
will protect him.

797
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:10,989
I do not fear them.

798
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:22,257
Arwen...

799
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:25,671
...ride hard. Don't look back.

800
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:35,052
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

801
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:32,431
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

802
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:35,934
If you want him, come and claim him.

803
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:30,669
No. No!

804
01:23:35,628 --> 01:23:37,869
Frodo, no.

805
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:40,377
Frodo, don't give in.

806
01:23:40,591 --> 01:23:42,582
Not now.

807
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:56,010
What grace is given me...

808
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:58,515
...let it pass to him.

809
01:23:58,732 --> 01:24:00,890
Let him be spared.

810
01:24:01,527 --> 01:24:03,566
Save him.

811
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,163
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

812
01:24:21,592 --> 01:24:28,092
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

813
01:24:30,058 --> 01:24:33,806
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.

814
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,558
And you're lucky to be here too.

815
01:24:39,234 --> 01:24:43,231
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

816
01:24:43,447 --> 01:24:47,572
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

817
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:57,700
What happened, Gandalf?

818
01:24:58,629 --> 01:25:04,049
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.

819
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:10,510
I was delayed.

820
01:25:11,394 --> 01:25:15,603
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

821
01:25:19,816 --> 01:25:24,444
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

822
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:27,485
Embrace the power of the Ring...

823
01:25:28,075 --> 01:25:30,613
...or embrace your own destruction!

824
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:36,782
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

825
01:25:37,002 --> 01:25:41,001
Only one who can bend it to his will.

826
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:45,798
And he does not share power.

827
01:26:00,151 --> 01:26:03,484
So you have chosen death.

828
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:17,367
Gandalf? What is it?

829
01:26:18,337 --> 01:26:20,127
Nothing, Frodo.

830
01:26:20,796 --> 01:26:22,706
Frodo!

831
01:26:24,092 --> 01:26:26,464
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

832
01:26:26,678 --> 01:26:29,430
Sam has hardly left your side.

833
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,798
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

834
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:37,308
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

835
01:26:38,815 --> 01:26:42,397
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

836
01:27:30,493 --> 01:27:33,744
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

837
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:35,664
Bilbo.

838
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,420
"There and Back Again:

839
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:45,420
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

840
01:27:48,516 --> 01:27:52,050
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

841
01:27:52,394 --> 01:27:56,176
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

842
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,928
...visit Lake-town...

843
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:02,565
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

844
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:07,898
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

845
01:28:20,047 --> 01:28:21,791
I miss the Shire.

846
01:28:22,217 --> 01:28:27,375
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

847
01:28:27,637 --> 01:28:31,255
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

848
01:28:34,187 --> 01:28:37,804
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

849
01:28:43,029 --> 01:28:46,232
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

850
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:49,649
My dear boy.

851
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:57,739
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?

852
01:28:58,543 --> 01:29:00,334
No harm in being prepared.

853
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,081
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.

854
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:06,170
-More than anything.
-I did.

855
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,295
It's just....

856
01:29:09,098 --> 01:29:11,671
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

857
01:29:11,892 --> 01:29:15,556
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

858
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:19,057
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

859
01:29:19,275 --> 01:29:20,982
Off home.

860
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:27,149
You are right, Sam.

861
01:29:29,327 --> 01:29:32,077
We did what we set out to do.

862
01:29:32,662 --> 01:29:35,199
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

863
01:29:39,336 --> 01:29:41,660
I am ready to go home.

864
01:29:42,423 --> 01:29:44,463
His strength returns.

865
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:50,381
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

866
01:29:50,973 --> 01:29:53,465
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

867
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:57,386
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

868
01:29:57,606 --> 01:30:00,974
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

869
01:30:01,191 --> 01:30:06,609
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

870
01:30:06,821 --> 01:30:11,485
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

871
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:14,455
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

872
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:17,866
Our list of allies grows thin.

873
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:21,412
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

874
01:30:21,628 --> 01:30:25,248
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

875
01:30:25,468 --> 01:30:27,925
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

876
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:32,800
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

877
01:30:33,017 --> 01:30:35,389
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

878
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:39,890
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

879
01:30:40,106 --> 01:30:44,484
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

880
01:30:48,283 --> 01:30:49,397
Gandalf...

881
01:30:50,743 --> 01:30:53,281
...the Ring cannot stay here.

882
01:31:12,809 --> 01:31:16,059
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

883
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,975
They must decide now how to end it.

884
01:31:20,065 --> 01:31:23,600
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

885
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,862
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

886
01:31:28,074 --> 01:31:33,152
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

887
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,624
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

888
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,666
Men?

889
01:31:40,543 --> 01:31:43,746
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

890
01:31:43,964 --> 01:31:48,377
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

891
01:31:48,761 --> 01:31:52,214
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

892
01:31:52,432 --> 01:31:54,056
I was there, Gandalf.

893
01:31:54,725 --> 01:31:57,562
I was there 3000 years ago...

894
01:32:04,363 --> 01:32:06,770
...when Isildur took the Ring.

895
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:10,855
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

896
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:15,986
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

897
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:21,201
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

898
01:32:21,419 --> 01:32:24,953
...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

899
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:27,746
Cast it into the fire!

900
01:32:32,893 --> 01:32:36,725
-Destroy it!
-No.

901
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,222
Isildur!

902
01:32:40,692 --> 01:32:45,399
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

903
01:32:49,535 --> 01:32:53,782
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

904
01:32:54,707 --> 01:32:58,324
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

905
01:32:58,542 --> 01:33:03,370
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

906
01:33:03,591 --> 01:33:06,925
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

907
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,426
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

908
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,762
He has chosen exile.

909
01:33:45,799 --> 01:33:47,791
You are no Elf.

910
01:33:48,009 --> 01:33:50,086
Men of the South are welcome here.

911
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:54,262
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

912
01:33:55,726 --> 01:33:58,513
Then we are here on common purpose...

913
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:00,349
...friend.

914
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,496
The shards of Narsil.

915
01:34:22,002 --> 01:34:26,463
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

916
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:31,585
It's still sharp.

917
01:34:40,524 --> 01:34:43,560
But no more than a broken heirloom.

918
01:35:10,388 --> 01:35:13,425
Why do you fear the past?

919
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:19,680
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

920
01:35:19,895 --> 01:35:23,311
You are not bound to his fate.

921
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:27,811
The same blood flows in my veins.

922
01:35:30,868 --> 01:35:33,405
The same weakness.

923
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:38,875
Your time will come.

924
01:35:39,084 --> 01:35:43,499
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

925
01:35:46,718 --> 01:35:49,125
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

926
01:35:50,137 --> 01:35:53,718
Not over you... not over me.

927
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:08,313
Do you remember when we first met?

928
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:16,413
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

929
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,448
Long years have passed.

930
01:36:21,169 --> 01:36:24,537
You did not have the cares you carry now.

931
01:36:26,006 --> 01:36:28,047
Do you remember what I told you?

932
01:36:34,016 --> 01:36:36,720
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

933
01:36:38,769 --> 01:36:43,728
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

934
01:36:44,818 --> 01:36:46,778
And to that I hold.

935
01:36:46,989 --> 01:36:50,607
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

936
01:36:50,826 --> 01:36:54,656
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

937
01:37:03,462 --> 01:37:06,914
I choose a mortal life.

938
01:37:08,259 --> 01:37:12,506
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

939
01:37:15,724 --> 01:37:18,264
...like my heart.

940
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:37,743
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

941
01:37:37,957 --> 01:37:41,905
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

942
01:37:42,543 --> 01:37:47,421
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

943
01:37:47,635 --> 01:37:51,171
You will unite, or you will fall.

944
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:55,636
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

945
01:37:57,519 --> 01:38:01,017
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

946
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:16,787
So it is true.

947
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:36,342
In a dream...

948
01:38:37,977 --> 01:38:41,180
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

949
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,187
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

950
01:38:43,982 --> 01:38:45,772
A voice was crying:

951
01:38:46,028 --> 01:38:48,945
"Your doom is near at hand.

952
01:38:49,948 --> 01:38:52,700
Isildur's Bane is found."

953
01:38:56,749 --> 01:38:58,539
Isildur's Bane.

954
01:38:59,126 --> 01:39:00,405
Boromir!

955
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:27,568
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

956
01:39:27,772 --> 01:39:31,471
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

957
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:33,612
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

958
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:35,241
...may yet be heard...

959
01:39:35,451 --> 01:39:38,370
...in every corner of the West!

960
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:41,288
The Ring is altogether evil.

961
01:39:41,587 --> 01:39:43,128
It is a gift.

962
01:39:43,713 --> 01:39:45,789
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

963
01:39:46,383 --> 01:39:48,505
Why not use this Ring?

964
01:39:48,718 --> 01:39:51,472
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

965
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:56,011
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

966
01:39:56,269 --> 01:39:58,511
...are your lands kept safe.

967
01:40:00,273 --> 01:40:04,648
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

968
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,607
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

969
01:40:09,196 --> 01:40:13,277
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

970
01:40:13,493 --> 01:40:17,028
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

971
01:40:17,331 --> 01:40:19,324
This is no mere Ranger.

972
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:23,957
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

973
01:40:24,462 --> 01:40:27,381
You owe him your allegiance.

974
01:40:31,471 --> 01:40:33,380
Aragorn.

975
01:40:35,181 --> 01:40:37,967
This is Isildur's heir?

976
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:43,064
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

977
01:40:45,192 --> 01:40:46,650
Sit down, Legolas.

978
01:40:49,946 --> 01:40:52,782
Gondor has no king.

979
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,367
Gondor needs no king.

980
01:41:03,045 --> 01:41:06,709
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

981
01:41:07,716 --> 01:41:11,214
You have only one choice.

982
01:41:11,426 --> 01:41:13,752
The Ring must be destroyed.

983
01:41:19,019 --> 01:41:21,592
What are we waiting for?

984
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:36,736
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Gloin...

985
01:41:36,953 --> 01:41:41,163
...by any craft that we here possess.

986
01:41:41,706 --> 01:41:45,836
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

987
01:41:46,049 --> 01:41:49,879
Only there can it be unmade.

988
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:53,542
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

989
01:41:53,763 --> 01:41:58,722
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

990
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:02,722
One of you...

991
01:42:03,233 --> 01:42:05,392
...must do this.

992
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:12,021
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

993
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:16,567
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

994
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:21,541
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

995
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,998
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

996
01:42:26,757 --> 01:42:28,797
It is a barren wasteland...

997
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,591
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

998
01:42:32,804 --> 01:42:36,638
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

999
01:42:36,852 --> 01:42:41,144
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1000
01:42:41,354 --> 01:42:45,814
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1001
01:42:46,025 --> 01:42:48,599
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1002
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:53,482
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1003
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:58,944
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1004
01:43:00,959 --> 01:43:03,449
Never trust an Elf!

1005
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:10,467
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1006
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:13,674
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1007
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:34,690
I will take it.

1008
01:43:36,661 --> 01:43:39,201
I will take it.

1009
01:43:45,002 --> 01:43:48,085
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1010
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:57,427
Though...

1011
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,353
...I do not know the way.

1012
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:08,693
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1013
01:44:08,904 --> 01:44:12,273
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1014
01:44:13,408 --> 01:44:16,443
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1015
01:44:17,203 --> 01:44:18,531
...I will.

1016
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:24,078
You have my sword.

1017
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,956
And you have my bow.

1018
01:44:28,549 --> 01:44:31,040
And my axe.

1019
01:44:38,059 --> 01:44:41,062
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1020
01:44:43,066 --> 01:44:46,730
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1021
01:44:47,195 --> 01:44:49,648
...then Gondor will see it done.

1022
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:56,986
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

1023
01:44:57,204 --> 01:45:02,079
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1024
01:45:02,667 --> 01:45:04,577
We're coming too!

1025
01:45:06,589 --> 01:45:09,376
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1026
01:45:09,591 --> 01:45:12,961
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1027
01:45:13,304 --> 01:45:14,587
...mission.

1028
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,266
Quest.

1029
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:17,758
Thing.

1030
01:45:19,645 --> 01:45:22,348
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1031
01:45:23,897 --> 01:45:25,805
Nine companions.

1032
01:45:27,609 --> 01:45:29,439
So be it.

1033
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:32,817
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1034
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:35,277
Great!

1035
01:45:35,535 --> 01:45:37,776
Where are we going?

1036
01:46:12,922 --> 01:46:15,462
She wanted to protect her child...

1037
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:21,087
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

1038
01:46:23,267 --> 01:46:26,767
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1039
01:46:27,231 --> 01:46:28,939
That you'd never escape your fate.

1040
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:33,101
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1041
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:37,442
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1042
01:46:38,491 --> 01:46:40,902
I do not want that power.

1043
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:43,825
I have never wanted it.

1044
01:46:45,124 --> 01:46:47,697
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1045
01:46:52,258 --> 01:46:54,583
My old sword! Sting.

1046
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:55,964
Here, take it. Take it.

1047
01:47:01,474 --> 01:47:05,343
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1048
01:47:06,062 --> 01:47:10,227
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1049
01:47:10,443 --> 01:47:15,022
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1050
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,696
Here's a pretty thing.

1051
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:19,399
Mithril.

1052
01:47:20,203 --> 01:47:24,580
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1053
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:28,040
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1054
01:47:36,096 --> 01:47:38,134
My old ring.

1055
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:43,306
I should very much like...

1056
01:47:43,519 --> 01:47:47,564
...to hold it again, one last time.

1057
01:48:04,918 --> 01:48:08,583
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1058
01:48:08,923 --> 01:48:13,001
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1059
01:48:17,515 --> 01:48:20,598
I'm sorry for everything.

1060
01:48:35,407 --> 01:48:39,785
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1061
01:48:41,122 --> 01:48:43,744
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1062
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:47,080
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1063
01:48:50,508 --> 01:48:53,047
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1064
01:48:53,512 --> 01:48:57,425
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1065
01:48:57,974 --> 01:49:00,596
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1066
01:49:03,646 --> 01:49:07,777
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1067
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,660
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1068
01:49:29,214 --> 01:49:31,044
Left.

1069
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:55,090
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1070
01:50:55,307 --> 01:50:59,057
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1071
01:50:59,269 --> 01:51:02,803
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1072
01:51:03,022 --> 01:51:06,854
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1073
01:51:08,655 --> 01:51:09,687
Move your feet.

1074
01:51:09,906 --> 01:51:11,234
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

1075
01:51:11,449 --> 01:51:12,861
Faster!

1076
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:17,984
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1077
01:51:18,205 --> 01:51:20,960
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1078
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:24,544
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1079
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:29,039
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1080
01:51:29,258 --> 01:51:34,600
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1081
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,021
Sorry!

1082
01:51:45,735 --> 01:51:47,228
Get him!

1083
01:51:48,696 --> 01:51:51,152
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1084
01:51:51,699 --> 01:51:54,071
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1085
01:51:57,833 --> 01:51:59,458
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1086
01:51:59,919 --> 01:52:02,539
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1087
01:52:02,753 --> 01:52:05,458
It's moving fast.

1088
01:52:05,714 --> 01:52:07,873
Against the wind.

1089
01:52:08,635 --> 01:52:10,757
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

1090
01:52:10,971 --> 01:52:13,722
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

1091
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:48,843
Spies of Saruman.

1092
01:52:49,636 --> 01:52:52,887
The passage south is being watched.

1093
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:57,351
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1094
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:11,699
Frodo!

1095
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,968
Boromir.

1096
01:53:33,183 --> 01:53:37,395
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1097
01:53:37,606 --> 01:53:40,724
...over so small a thing.

1098
01:53:43,944 --> 01:53:45,901
Such a little thing.

1099
01:53:46,113 --> 01:53:47,573
Boromir!

1100
01:53:48,199 --> 01:53:50,868
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1101
01:54:00,713 --> 01:54:02,752
As you wish.

1102
01:54:03,466 --> 01:54:05,505
I care not.

1103
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,590
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1104
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:50,382
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1105
01:54:51,683 --> 01:54:54,637
If the mountain defeats you...

1106
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:59,312
...will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1107
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:14,581
There is a fell voice on the air.

1108
01:55:15,667 --> 01:55:17,162
It's Saruman!

1109
01:55:26,095 --> 01:55:30,757
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1110
01:55:30,975 --> 01:55:31,975
No!

1111
01:56:39,256 --> 01:56:41,083
We must get off the mountain!

1112
01:56:41,551 --> 01:56:45,879
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1113
01:56:46,096 --> 01:56:49,464
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1114
01:56:49,682 --> 01:56:53,384
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1115
01:56:53,604 --> 01:56:56,438
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1116
01:56:58,276 --> 01:57:02,108
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1117
01:57:02,781 --> 01:57:07,822
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1118
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:13,496
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dum:

1119
01:57:14,792 --> 01:57:18,292
Shadow and flame.

1120
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:24,385
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1121
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:31,181
We cannot stay here!

1122
01:57:31,394 --> 01:57:34,146
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1123
01:57:34,355 --> 01:57:36,015
Frodo?

1124
01:57:39,068 --> 01:57:41,941
We will go through the mines.

1125
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,649
So be it.

1126
01:57:51,249 --> 01:57:55,117
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1127
01:57:58,674 --> 01:58:00,880
How is your shoulder?

1128
01:58:01,093 --> 01:58:04,343
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

1129
01:58:05,933 --> 01:58:08,423
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1130
01:58:08,894 --> 01:58:11,811
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1131
01:58:12,273 --> 01:58:16,104
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1132
01:58:16,317 --> 01:58:18,892
And, I fear, from within.

1133
01:58:21,531 --> 01:58:25,659
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

1134
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:28,704
Trust your own strengths.

1135
01:58:28,914 --> 01:58:31,452
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

1136
01:58:31,667 --> 01:58:33,707
...for good or for evil.

1137
01:58:33,922 --> 01:58:36,209
Some are greater than I am.

1138
01:58:36,757 --> 01:58:40,375
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1139
01:58:41,804 --> 01:58:43,131
The walls...

1140
01:58:43,847 --> 01:58:45,923
...of Moria.

1141
01:58:51,646 --> 01:58:54,648
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1142
01:58:54,859 --> 01:58:59,319
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1143
01:58:59,656 --> 01:59:02,111
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1144
01:59:10,124 --> 01:59:13,458
Well, let's see.

1145
01:59:13,712 --> 01:59:15,086
Ithildin.

1146
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:19,084
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1147
01:59:33,149 --> 01:59:37,228
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1148
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:42,446
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

1149
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:47,405
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1150
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:12,304
Nothing's happening.

1151
02:00:19,323 --> 02:00:23,570
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1152
02:00:23,827 --> 02:00:26,615
...Men and Orcs.

1153
02:00:26,914 --> 02:00:28,112
What are you going to do, then?

1154
02:00:28,374 --> 02:00:30,580
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1155
02:00:30,836 --> 02:00:32,794
And if that does not shatter them...

1156
02:00:33,005 --> 02:00:35,673
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1157
02:00:35,882 --> 02:00:39,334
...I will try to find the opening words.

1158
02:00:52,190 --> 02:00:54,729
Mines are no place for a pony.

1159
02:00:55,027 --> 02:00:59,108
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

1160
02:01:00,284 --> 02:01:03,070
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1161
02:01:03,619 --> 02:01:07,155
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1162
02:01:13,963 --> 02:01:16,536
Do not disturb the water.

1163
02:01:16,759 --> 02:01:18,633
Oh, it's useless.

1164
02:01:31,315 --> 02:01:33,473
It's a riddle.

1165
02:01:36,237 --> 02:01:39,356
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1166
02:01:39,742 --> 02:01:42,657
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1167
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:45,362
Mellon.

1168
02:02:03,432 --> 02:02:08,308
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1169
02:02:08,772 --> 02:02:14,479
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1170
02:02:15,989 --> 02:02:19,073
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1171
02:02:19,409 --> 02:02:21,817
And they call it a mine.

1172
02:02:22,037 --> 02:02:23,993
A mine!

1173
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:28,373
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1174
02:02:34,508 --> 02:02:36,087
No...

1175
02:02:37,345 --> 02:02:38,095
No!

1176
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:43,184
Goblins.

1177
02:02:47,105 --> 02:02:51,400
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1178
02:02:52,444 --> 02:02:55,018
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1179
02:02:57,824 --> 02:03:00,198
-Frodo!
-Help!

1180
02:03:00,413 --> 02:03:01,988
Strider!

1181
02:03:02,204 --> 02:03:04,957
-Help!
-Get off him!

1182
02:03:05,167 --> 02:03:06,198
Aragorn!

1183
02:03:16,637 --> 02:03:17,668
Frodo!

1184
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,030
Into the mines!

1185
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:48,454
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

1186
02:03:52,758 --> 02:03:54,500
Run!

1187
02:04:11,403 --> 02:04:14,987
We now have but one choice.

1188
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:20,074
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1189
02:04:20,328 --> 02:04:22,285
Be on your guard.

1190
02:04:22,496 --> 02:04:25,914
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1191
02:04:26,128 --> 02:04:29,663
...in the deep places of the world.

1192
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:41,555
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1193
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:45,600
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1194
02:05:31,405 --> 02:05:35,069
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1195
02:05:35,284 --> 02:05:37,657
...or jewels...

1196
02:05:37,871 --> 02:05:40,907
...but mithril.

1197
02:05:59,268 --> 02:06:04,144
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1198
02:06:04,398 --> 02:06:08,313
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

1199
02:06:08,527 --> 02:06:10,400
I never told him...

1200
02:06:10,612 --> 02:06:15,571
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1201
02:06:27,924 --> 02:06:29,631
Pippin.

1202
02:06:49,989 --> 02:06:52,943
I have no memory of this place.

1203
02:06:54,993 --> 02:06:56,404
-Are we lost?
-No.

1204
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:59,157
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

1205
02:06:59,372 --> 02:07:00,832
-Merry?
-What?

1206
02:07:01,041 --> 02:07:02,950
I'm hungry.

1207
02:07:14,306 --> 02:07:18,766
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

1208
02:07:18,977 --> 02:07:23,106
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

1209
02:07:23,316 --> 02:07:27,477
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
-Escaped...

1210
02:07:28,196 --> 02:07:29,821
...or was set loose.

1211
02:07:30,366 --> 02:07:33,983
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1212
02:07:36,621 --> 02:07:39,373
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1213
02:07:39,583 --> 02:07:45,253
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1214
02:07:45,463 --> 02:07:50,290
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1215
02:07:50,509 --> 02:07:56,466
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1216
02:07:57,436 --> 02:08:00,223
Before it drove him mad.

1217
02:08:00,481 --> 02:08:03,351
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1218
02:08:03,567 --> 02:08:04,765
Pity?

1219
02:08:05,819 --> 02:08:08,773
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1220
02:08:09,656 --> 02:08:14,863
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1221
02:08:16,329 --> 02:08:18,785
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1222
02:08:21,212 --> 02:08:25,159
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1223
02:08:25,382 --> 02:08:28,301
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1224
02:08:28,886 --> 02:08:34,803
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1225
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,470
...before this is over.

1226
02:08:39,978 --> 02:08:43,813
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1227
02:08:50,492 --> 02:08:53,826
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1228
02:08:55,247 --> 02:08:57,286
I wish none of this had happened.

1229
02:08:57,499 --> 02:09:02,539
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1230
02:09:03,336 --> 02:09:08,842
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1231
02:09:10,346 --> 02:09:14,344
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1232
02:09:15,285 --> 02:09:17,181
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1233
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:21,657
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1234
02:09:22,341 --> 02:09:24,250
And that is an encouraging thought.

1235
02:09:30,242 --> 02:09:31,642
It's that way.

1236
02:09:32,369 --> 02:09:34,659
-He's remembered.
-No.

1237
02:09:34,872 --> 02:09:38,656
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1238
02:09:38,877 --> 02:09:44,083
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1239
02:09:58,897 --> 02:10:03,060
Let me risk a little more light.

1240
02:10:07,698 --> 02:10:08,418
Behold...

1241
02:10:10,201 --> 02:10:15,442
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1242
02:10:17,918 --> 02:10:21,335
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1243
02:10:46,282 --> 02:10:47,990
Gimli!

1244
02:10:55,416 --> 02:10:57,039
No!

1245
02:10:59,628 --> 02:11:00,588
Oh, no.

1246
02:11:04,633 --> 02:11:05,877
No.

1247
02:11:13,184 --> 02:11:15,176
"Here lies Balin...

1248
02:11:15,645 --> 02:11:17,638
...son of Fundin...

1249
02:11:17,939 --> 02:11:20,560
...Lord of Moria."

1250
02:11:21,651 --> 02:11:23,310
He is dead, then.

1251
02:11:25,029 --> 02:11:26,737
It's as I feared.

1252
02:11:44,968 --> 02:11:47,886
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1253
02:11:48,095 --> 02:11:52,803
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1254
02:11:53,895 --> 02:11:56,466
We have barred the gates...

1255
02:11:57,148 --> 02:11:59,604
...but cannot hold them for long.

1256
02:11:59,817 --> 02:12:02,653
The ground shakes.

1257
02:12:03,072 --> 02:12:04,649
Drums...

1258
02:12:05,033 --> 02:12:08,401
...drums in the deep.

1259
02:12:11,955 --> 02:12:13,995
We cannot get out.

1260
02:12:16,002 --> 02:12:19,833
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1261
02:12:21,508 --> 02:12:24,082
We cannot get out.

1262
02:12:27,097 --> 02:12:29,005
They are coming."

1263
02:13:12,062 --> 02:13:13,888
Fool of a Took!

1264
02:13:14,272 --> 02:13:18,054
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity!

1265
02:13:44,095 --> 02:13:45,802
Frodo!

1266
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:49,559
Orcs!

1267
02:13:56,565 --> 02:13:58,559
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1268
02:14:05,785 --> 02:14:07,611
They have a cave-troll.

1269
02:14:23,427 --> 02:14:24,592
Let them come!

1270
02:14:25,097 --> 02:14:28,632
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1271
02:16:47,539 --> 02:16:50,291
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1272
02:16:55,007 --> 02:16:56,750
Frodo!

1273
02:17:30,293 --> 02:17:32,168
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1274
02:17:33,171 --> 02:17:35,045
Frodo!

1275
02:18:20,222 --> 02:18:22,094
Frodo!

1276
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:23,609
Oh, no!

1277
02:19:32,007 --> 02:19:33,915
He's alive.

1278
02:19:36,386 --> 02:19:39,339
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1279
02:19:39,555 --> 02:19:41,761
You should be dead.

1280
02:19:41,974 --> 02:19:44,468
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1281
02:19:44,688 --> 02:19:49,431
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1282
02:19:55,323 --> 02:19:56,353
Mithril.

1283
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,780
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1284
02:20:07,795 --> 02:20:09,705
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

1285
02:20:24,769 --> 02:20:26,430
This way!

1286
02:21:36,807 --> 02:21:39,806
What is this new devilry?

1287
02:21:55,867 --> 02:21:58,655
A Balrog.

1288
02:21:58,997 --> 02:22:02,115
A demon of the ancient world.

1289
02:22:04,336 --> 02:22:06,742
This foe is beyond any of you.

1290
02:22:07,921 --> 02:22:09,501
Run!

1291
02:22:16,848 --> 02:22:18,342
Quickly!

1292
02:22:34,953 --> 02:22:36,232
Gandalf.

1293
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:38,447
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1294
02:22:39,873 --> 02:22:42,364
The bridge is near.

1295
02:22:44,418 --> 02:22:48,548
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1296
02:23:17,662 --> 02:23:19,406
Gandalf!

1297
02:23:37,683 --> 02:23:38,930
Merry! Pippin!

1298
02:23:50,032 --> 02:23:51,572
Sam!

1299
02:23:54,285 --> 02:23:57,535
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1300
02:24:00,584 --> 02:24:01,995
Not the beard!

1301
02:24:15,225 --> 02:24:17,132
Steady.

1302
02:24:19,227 --> 02:24:20,887
Hold on!

1303
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:43,158
Hang on!

1304
02:24:53,932 --> 02:24:55,674
Lean forward!

1305
02:24:58,685 --> 02:24:59,717
Steady.

1306
02:25:01,023 --> 02:25:02,184
Come on!

1307
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:03,149
Now!

1308
02:25:21,085 --> 02:25:22,912
Over the bridge!

1309
02:25:23,128 --> 02:25:24,705
Fly!

1310
02:26:09,303 --> 02:26:11,343
You cannot pass!

1311
02:26:11,556 --> 02:26:13,134
Gandalf!

1312
02:26:17,396 --> 02:26:22,271
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1313
02:26:23,278 --> 02:26:27,062
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

1314
02:26:37,041 --> 02:26:39,000
Go back to the Shadow.

1315
02:26:46,844 --> 02:26:51,305
You shall not pass!

1316
02:27:18,461 --> 02:27:22,327
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

1317
02:27:30,015 --> 02:27:32,470
Fly, you fools!

1318
02:27:36,605 --> 02:27:37,605
No!

1319
02:27:44,905 --> 02:27:47,062
Aragorn!

1320
02:28:44,384 --> 02:28:47,172
Legolas, get them up.

1321
02:28:51,267 --> 02:28:53,141
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1322
02:28:53,353 --> 02:28:56,971
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1323
02:28:57,189 --> 02:29:00,523
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

1324
02:29:01,444 --> 02:29:04,729
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1325
02:29:06,243 --> 02:29:08,448
On your feet, Sam.

1326
02:29:08,786 --> 02:29:10,280
Frodo?

1327
02:29:12,332 --> 02:29:14,039
Frodo!

1328
02:30:06,556 --> 02:30:09,093
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1329
02:30:09,850 --> 02:30:13,977
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1330
02:30:14,188 --> 02:30:16,726
An Elf-witch...

1331
02:30:17,273 --> 02:30:20,147
...of terrible power.

1332
02:30:20,695 --> 02:30:22,902
All who look upon her...

1333
02:30:23,115 --> 02:30:24,907
...fall under her spell.

1334
02:30:25,117 --> 02:30:26,397
Frodo!

1335
02:30:28,661 --> 02:30:30,703
And are never seen again.

1336
02:30:30,915 --> 02:30:35,409
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1337
02:30:35,626 --> 02:30:39,326
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1338
02:30:39,548 --> 02:30:41,292
Mr. Frodo?

1339
02:30:46,598 --> 02:30:52,186
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1340
02:30:52,397 --> 02:30:56,939
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1341
02:31:04,617 --> 02:31:09,197
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1342
02:31:14,337 --> 02:31:16,329
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1343
02:31:17,256 --> 02:31:19,926
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1344
02:31:22,721 --> 02:31:24,428
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1345
02:31:25,056 --> 02:31:26,468
you are known to us.

1346
02:31:27,351 --> 02:31:29,592
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1347
02:31:29,811 --> 02:31:31,683
Speak words we can all understand!

1348
02:31:31,896 --> 02:31:36,475
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1349
02:31:36,735 --> 02:31:39,273
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1350
02:31:46,119 --> 02:31:48,077
That was not so courteous.

1351
02:31:54,629 --> 02:31:58,676
You bring great evil with you.

1352
02:32:00,427 --> 02:32:02,633
You can go no further.

1353
02:32:40,052 --> 02:32:42,673
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1354
02:32:43,805 --> 02:32:45,717
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1355
02:32:47,227 --> 02:32:50,561
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1356
02:32:51,398 --> 02:32:54,517
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1357
02:32:57,361 --> 02:32:59,401
You will follow me.

1358
02:33:11,127 --> 02:33:13,086
Caras Galadhon.

1359
02:33:13,714 --> 02:33:16,630
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1360
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:22,512
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1361
02:34:41,639 --> 02:34:44,723
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1362
02:34:45,392 --> 02:34:50,554
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1363
02:34:52,316 --> 02:34:56,729
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1364
02:34:56,988 --> 02:34:58,780
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1365
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:02,077
For I much desire to speak with him.

1366
02:35:02,287 --> 02:35:05,073
I can no longer see him from afar.

1367
02:35:05,957 --> 02:35:11,118
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1368
02:35:11,379 --> 02:35:13,835
He has fallen into Shadow.

1369
02:35:18,511 --> 02:35:23,006
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1370
02:35:24,686 --> 02:35:28,386
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1371
02:35:29,106 --> 02:35:32,476
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1372
02:35:34,613 --> 02:35:37,863
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1373
02:35:38,492 --> 02:35:41,778
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1374
02:35:46,542 --> 02:35:50,837
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dum fill your heart...

1375
02:35:51,047 --> 02:35:53,373
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1376
02:35:54,384 --> 02:35:57,917
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1377
02:35:59,388 --> 02:36:02,013
...and in all lands...

1378
02:36:02,226 --> 02:36:05,725
...love is now mingled with grief.

1379
02:36:18,367 --> 02:36:21,072
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1380
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:24,622
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1381
02:36:27,585 --> 02:36:30,836
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1382
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:34,132
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1383
02:36:34,885 --> 02:36:37,721
...to the ruin of all.

1384
02:36:42,060 --> 02:36:47,894
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1385
02:36:49,441 --> 02:36:54,189
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1386
02:36:54,615 --> 02:36:58,280
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1387
02:37:00,538 --> 02:37:02,661
Tonight, you will sleep...

1388
02:37:02,956 --> 02:37:06,373
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1389
02:37:07,837 --> 02:37:09,628
...one who has seen the Eye!

1390
02:37:24,272 --> 02:37:26,844
A lament for Gandalf.

1391
02:37:34,114 --> 02:37:35,656
What do they say about him?

1392
02:37:35,908 --> 02:37:38,528
I have not the heart to tell you.

1393
02:37:41,414 --> 02:37:43,658
For me, the grief is still too near.

1394
02:37:46,628 --> 02:37:49,415
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1395
02:37:49,631 --> 02:37:52,667
There should be a verse about them.

1396
02:37:56,221 --> 02:37:58,215
The finest rockets ever seen

1397
02:37:59,349 --> 02:38:02,184
They burst in stars of blue and green

1398
02:38:03,104 --> 02:38:08,312
Or after thunder, silver showers

1399
02:38:09,026 --> 02:38:11,778
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1400
02:38:11,988 --> 02:38:15,902
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1401
02:38:26,586 --> 02:38:27,546
Take some rest.

1402
02:38:29,467 --> 02:38:32,135
These borders are well-protected.

1403
02:38:32,344 --> 02:38:34,881
I will find no rest here.

1404
02:38:37,724 --> 02:38:40,725
I heard her voice inside my head.

1405
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:44,678
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1406
02:38:44,897 --> 02:38:50,353
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1407
02:38:51,739 --> 02:38:54,574
But I cannot see it.

1408
02:38:55,909 --> 02:38:58,401
It is long since we had any hope.

1409
02:39:08,589 --> 02:39:10,711
My father is a noble man.

1410
02:39:11,509 --> 02:39:13,716
But his rule is failing...

1411
02:39:16,847 --> 02:39:19,472
...and our people lose faith.

1412
02:39:20,896 --> 02:39:24,394
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1413
02:39:24,608 --> 02:39:28,141
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1414
02:39:30,989 --> 02:39:33,989
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1415
02:39:34,616 --> 02:39:36,610
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1416
02:39:36,827 --> 02:39:40,659
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1417
02:39:41,333 --> 02:39:44,833
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1418
02:39:47,715 --> 02:39:49,672
Have you ever been called home...

1419
02:39:49,883 --> 02:39:53,797
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1420
02:39:54,430 --> 02:39:57,681
I have seen the White City...

1421
02:39:58,016 --> 02:39:59,511
...long ago.

1422
02:40:00,478 --> 02:40:05,435
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1423
02:40:06,402 --> 02:40:09,318
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1424
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:13,114
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1425
02:41:20,315 --> 02:41:22,804
Will you look into the mirror?

1426
02:41:23,025 --> 02:41:24,567
What will I see?

1427
02:41:27,528 --> 02:41:29,854
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1428
02:41:30,782 --> 02:41:32,609
For the mirror...

1429
02:41:32,826 --> 02:41:35,365
...shows many things.

1430
02:41:38,374 --> 02:41:40,747
Things that were...

1431
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:43,532
...things that are...

1432
02:41:44,298 --> 02:41:46,257
...and some things...

1433
02:41:49,845 --> 02:41:53,177
...that have not yet come to pass.

1434
02:43:15,727 --> 02:43:18,561
I know what it is you saw.

1435
02:43:21,066 --> 02:43:23,559
For it is also in my mind.

1436
02:43:25,362 --> 02:43:29,407
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1437
02:43:31,786 --> 02:43:36,663
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1438
02:43:37,293 --> 02:43:40,578
He will try to take the Ring.

1439
02:43:40,795 --> 02:43:42,788
You know of whom I speak.

1440
02:43:43,798 --> 02:43:48,460
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1441
02:43:49,972 --> 02:43:52,427
If you ask it of me...

1442
02:43:52,809 --> 02:43:55,892
...I will give you the One Ring.

1443
02:43:56,937 --> 02:43:59,098
You offer it to me freely?

1444
02:44:03,695 --> 02:44:07,609
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1445
02:44:13,998 --> 02:44:17,282
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1446
02:44:17,751 --> 02:44:21,534
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1447
02:44:22,172 --> 02:44:25,209
Treacherous as the sea!

1448
02:44:25,718 --> 02:44:30,629
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1449
02:44:31,098 --> 02:44:33,470
All shall love me...

1450
02:44:33,683 --> 02:44:36,521
...and despair.

1451
02:44:50,620 --> 02:44:54,949
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1452
02:44:55,208 --> 02:44:57,664
...and go into the West...

1453
02:44:57,878 --> 02:45:02,340
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1454
02:45:05,971 --> 02:45:10,098
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1455
02:45:11,016 --> 02:45:12,513
...is to be alone.

1456
02:45:15,855 --> 02:45:18,606
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1457
02:45:18,816 --> 02:45:20,394
And I am its keeper.

1458
02:45:23,612 --> 02:45:27,233
This task was appointed to you.

1459
02:45:28,285 --> 02:45:31,156
And if you do not find a way...

1460
02:45:32,373 --> 02:45:34,366
...no one will.

1461
02:45:34,751 --> 02:45:37,917
Then I know what I must do.

1462
02:45:38,588 --> 02:45:39,785
It's just...

1463
02:45:43,051 --> 02:45:45,291
...I'm afraid to do it.

1464
02:45:48,806 --> 02:45:53,933
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1465
02:45:59,277 --> 02:46:05,031
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1466
02:46:05,784 --> 02:46:09,115
They were Elves once.

1467
02:46:10,288 --> 02:46:13,622
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1468
02:46:13,834 --> 02:46:17,000
...tortured and mutilated.

1469
02:46:17,339 --> 02:46:22,628
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1470
02:46:22,927 --> 02:46:24,754
And now...

1471
02:46:26,223 --> 02:46:28,096
...perfected.

1472
02:46:28,809 --> 02:46:31,975
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1473
02:46:33,937 --> 02:46:36,225
...whom do you serve?

1474
02:46:36,439 --> 02:46:38,933
Saruman!

1475
02:46:59,797 --> 02:47:03,215
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1476
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:06,347
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1477
02:47:06,557 --> 02:47:09,510
You will taste Man-flesh!

1478
02:47:14,564 --> 02:47:18,230
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1479
02:47:18,444 --> 02:47:22,654
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1480
02:47:24,449 --> 02:47:25,730
Kill the others.

1481
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:50,385
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1482
02:47:51,523 --> 02:47:55,305
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1483
02:48:02,532 --> 02:48:04,158
Lembas.

1484
02:48:04,368 --> 02:48:05,992
Elvish waybread.

1485
02:48:08,497 --> 02:48:11,497
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1486
02:48:17,967 --> 02:48:19,876
How many did you eat?

1487
02:48:20,094 --> 02:48:21,754
Four.

1488
02:48:27,557 --> 02:48:30,132
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1489
02:48:30,353 --> 02:48:34,432
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1490
02:48:34,648 --> 02:48:37,139
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1491
02:48:37,361 --> 02:48:41,146
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1492
02:48:41,366 --> 02:48:46,443
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1493
02:48:55,129 --> 02:48:57,701
You are being tracked.

1494
02:48:59,133 --> 02:49:03,758
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1495
02:49:21,073 --> 02:49:25,817
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1496
02:49:26,037 --> 02:49:29,538
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1497
02:49:34,921 --> 02:49:37,330
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1498
02:49:37,550 --> 02:49:41,500
They have already seen service in war.

1499
02:49:41,722 --> 02:49:43,963
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1500
02:49:44,183 --> 02:49:47,468
You will find your courage.

1501
02:49:49,354 --> 02:49:51,311
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1502
02:49:51,523 --> 02:49:54,015
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1503
02:49:54,235 --> 02:49:56,358
Thank you, my lady.

1504
02:49:58,198 --> 02:50:01,531
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1505
02:50:07,957 --> 02:50:10,958
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1506
02:50:11,169 --> 02:50:11,889
Nothing.

1507
02:50:13,923 --> 02:50:17,255
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1508
02:50:17,883 --> 02:50:23,092
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1509
02:50:30,147 --> 02:50:31,690
Actually...

1510
02:50:31,899 --> 02:50:33,523
There was one thing.

1511
02:50:34,361 --> 02:50:36,982
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1512
02:50:37,197 --> 02:50:39,983
Stupid to ask.

1513
02:50:42,536 --> 02:50:44,613
I have nothing greater to give...

1514
02:50:44,831 --> 02:50:48,412
...than the gift you already bear.

1515
02:50:49,669 --> 02:50:50,699
For her love,

1516
02:50:52,004 --> 02:50:57,344
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1517
02:50:58,137 --> 02:51:01,422
I would have her leave these shores,

1518
02:51:02,974 --> 02:51:05,891
and be with her people.

1519
02:51:07,897 --> 02:51:13,602
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1520
02:51:13,902 --> 02:51:16,938
That choice is yet before her.

1521
02:51:17,696 --> 02:51:20,568
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1522
02:51:20,910 --> 02:51:26,698
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1523
02:51:26,916 --> 02:51:31,246
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1524
02:51:38,512 --> 02:51:39,791
Farewell.

1525
02:51:43,683 --> 02:51:47,052
There is much you have yet to do.

1526
02:51:53,569 --> 02:51:54,814
We shall not meet again...

1527
02:51:55,028 --> 02:51:56,405
Elessar.

1528
02:51:58,825 --> 02:52:01,992
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1529
02:52:02,203 --> 02:52:05,620
I give you the light of Earendil...

1530
02:52:06,375 --> 02:52:08,700
...our most beloved star.

1531
02:52:17,845 --> 02:52:22,259
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1532
02:52:22,476 --> 02:52:26,603
...when all other lights go out.

1533
02:52:35,573 --> 02:52:38,739
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1534
02:52:39,368 --> 02:52:43,660
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1535
02:52:44,414 --> 02:52:47,749
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1536
02:52:48,003 --> 02:52:49,912
What was her gift?

1537
02:52:50,130 --> 02:52:55,040
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1538
02:52:55,845 --> 02:52:58,715
She gave me three.

1539
02:54:40,914 --> 02:54:44,330
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1540
02:54:48,089 --> 02:54:51,173
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1541
02:54:51,426 --> 02:54:54,593
But he's too clever a waterman.

1542
02:54:55,431 --> 02:54:58,680
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1543
02:54:58,892 --> 02:55:01,099
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1544
02:55:01,312 --> 02:55:03,350
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1545
02:55:03,562 --> 02:55:06,600
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

1546
02:55:06,817 --> 02:55:09,935
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1547
02:55:10,862 --> 02:55:13,865
-Mr. Frodo...
-I'm all right.

1548
02:55:14,117 --> 02:55:15,279
But you're not.

1549
02:55:15,575 --> 02:55:18,031
I'm here to help you.

1550
02:55:18,246 --> 02:55:19,954
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1551
02:55:25,921 --> 02:55:28,673
You can't help me, Sam.

1552
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:32,543
Not this time.

1553
02:55:35,429 --> 02:55:37,554
Get some sleep.

1554
02:55:43,772 --> 02:55:45,980
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1555
02:55:46,526 --> 02:55:49,277
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1556
02:55:49,946 --> 02:55:52,188
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1557
02:55:52,449 --> 02:55:55,319
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1558
02:55:55,785 --> 02:55:57,777
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1559
02:55:59,662 --> 02:56:02,451
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1560
02:56:02,668 --> 02:56:05,622
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1561
02:56:05,838 --> 02:56:09,172
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1562
02:56:09,383 --> 02:56:11,589
But you will not see that.

1563
02:56:11,926 --> 02:56:13,338
You are afraid!

1564
02:56:13,597 --> 02:56:16,169
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1565
02:56:16,432 --> 02:56:19,883
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1566
02:56:22,312 --> 02:56:26,690
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1567
02:56:38,539 --> 02:56:39,867
Frodo.

1568
02:56:41,751 --> 02:56:43,245
The Argonath.

1569
02:56:46,714 --> 02:56:50,416
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1570
02:56:51,179 --> 02:56:53,088
My kin.

1571
02:58:12,139 --> 02:58:14,345
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1572
02:58:14,556 --> 02:58:17,131
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1573
02:58:17,352 --> 02:58:20,802
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1574
02:58:21,147 --> 02:58:24,931
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1575
02:58:25,152 --> 02:58:28,403
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1576
02:58:28,615 --> 02:58:31,699
And after that, it gets even better.

1577
02:58:32,118 --> 02:58:36,994
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1578
02:58:37,206 --> 02:58:38,617
That is our road.

1579
02:58:40,167 --> 02:58:43,334
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1580
02:58:43,546 --> 02:58:45,289
Recover my...

1581
02:58:48,301 --> 02:58:50,257
-We should leave now.
-No.

1582
02:58:50,470 --> 02:58:54,884
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1583
02:58:55,101 --> 02:58:58,552
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1584
02:58:58,771 --> 02:59:02,770
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1585
02:59:03,276 --> 02:59:07,489
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1586
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:14,406
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1587
02:59:14,912 --> 02:59:16,621
Where's Frodo?

1588
02:59:42,277 --> 02:59:44,185
None of us should wander alone.

1589
02:59:45,571 --> 02:59:47,695
You, least of all.

1590
02:59:47,908 --> 02:59:50,362
So much depends on you.

1591
02:59:51,409 --> 02:59:52,129
Frodo?

1592
03:00:00,463 --> 03:00:03,035
I know why you seek solitude.

1593
03:00:03,757 --> 03:00:07,175
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1594
03:00:07,972 --> 03:00:11,054
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1595
03:00:12,682 --> 03:00:15,353
There are other ways, Frodo.

1596
03:00:15,562 --> 03:00:19,393
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1597
03:00:19,607 --> 03:00:23,392
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1598
03:00:23,613 --> 03:00:26,696
Warning? Against what?

1599
03:00:26,907 --> 03:00:29,029
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1600
03:00:29,243 --> 03:00:32,862
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1601
03:00:33,081 --> 03:00:36,865
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1602
03:00:38,627 --> 03:00:41,959
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1603
03:00:43,549 --> 03:00:45,589
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1604
03:00:46,844 --> 03:00:50,509
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1605
03:00:52,308 --> 03:00:55,644
What chance do you think you have?

1606
03:00:55,855 --> 03:01:00,517
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1607
03:01:00,735 --> 03:01:04,434
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1608
03:01:06,573 --> 03:01:08,649
You fool!

1609
03:01:08,868 --> 03:01:12,817
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1610
03:01:13,038 --> 03:01:15,826
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1611
03:01:16,041 --> 03:01:17,286
-Give it to me!
-No!

1612
03:01:17,502 --> 03:01:19,328
-Give it to me!
-No.

1613
03:01:26,970 --> 03:01:29,011
I see your mind.

1614
03:01:29,222 --> 03:01:32,178
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1615
03:01:32,393 --> 03:01:34,267
You will betray us!

1616
03:01:34,478 --> 03:01:37,682
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1617
03:01:38,106 --> 03:01:41,771
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1618
03:01:48,827 --> 03:01:50,368
Frodo?

1619
03:01:54,665 --> 03:01:56,242
Frodo.

1620
03:02:00,172 --> 03:02:02,211
What have I done?

1621
03:02:02,425 --> 03:02:04,131
Please, Frodo.

1622
03:02:04,342 --> 03:02:07,012
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1623
03:02:55,604 --> 03:02:57,016
Frodo?

1624
03:02:58,276 --> 03:03:01,360
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1625
03:03:01,570 --> 03:03:03,361
Stay away!

1626
03:03:03,780 --> 03:03:05,359
Frodo!

1627
03:03:07,618 --> 03:03:11,452
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1628
03:03:21,133 --> 03:03:23,625
Would you destroy it?

1629
03:03:28,598 --> 03:03:30,556
Aragorn.

1630
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:36,306
Aragorn.

1631
03:03:38,109 --> 03:03:39,983
Elessar.

1632
03:03:47,621 --> 03:03:50,991
I would have gone with you to the end.

1633
03:03:51,667 --> 03:03:54,501
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1634
03:03:57,839 --> 03:03:59,003
I know.

1635
03:04:01,468 --> 03:04:06,925
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1636
03:04:10,685 --> 03:04:12,395
Go, Frodo!

1637
03:04:15,399 --> 03:04:16,894
Run!

1638
03:04:17,152 --> 03:04:18,813
Run!

1639
03:04:43,388 --> 03:04:45,047
Mr. Frodo!

1640
03:04:54,316 --> 03:04:56,107
Find the halfling!

1641
03:04:57,736 --> 03:05:00,274
Find the halfling!

1642
03:05:03,744 --> 03:05:05,403
Elendil!

1643
03:05:11,918 --> 03:05:13,460
Aragorn, go!

1644
03:05:35,192 --> 03:05:36,473
Frodo!

1645
03:05:37,070 --> 03:05:38,694
Hide here. Quick!

1646
03:05:39,323 --> 03:05:40,781
Come on!

1647
03:05:43,243 --> 03:05:45,282
What's he doing?

1648
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:51,491
He's leaving.

1649
03:05:56,298 --> 03:05:59,215
-No!
-Pippin!

1650
03:06:04,139 --> 03:06:06,464
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1651
03:06:07,017 --> 03:06:10,137
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1652
03:06:10,521 --> 03:06:12,146
-Over here!
-This way!

1653
03:06:22,993 --> 03:06:25,317
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1654
03:07:20,679 --> 03:07:23,764
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1655
03:08:06,854 --> 03:08:07,968
Run!

1656
03:11:39,580 --> 03:11:41,203
No.

1657
03:11:45,128 --> 03:11:48,165
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

1658
03:11:48,423 --> 03:11:50,461
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1659
03:11:52,343 --> 03:11:53,802
I let Frodo go.

1660
03:11:54,469 --> 03:11:57,092
Then you did what I could not.

1661
03:11:58,098 --> 03:12:01,385
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1662
03:12:01,937 --> 03:12:06,183
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1663
03:12:06,399 --> 03:12:08,688
I did not see it.

1664
03:12:08,903 --> 03:12:12,406
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1665
03:12:13,267 --> 03:12:14,836
You fought bravely.

1666
03:12:15,669 --> 03:12:17,720
You have kept your honor.

1667
03:12:18,662 --> 03:12:20,537
Leave it.

1668
03:12:20,874 --> 03:12:22,950
It is over.

1669
03:12:24,169 --> 03:12:29,375
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1670
03:12:29,841 --> 03:12:32,841
...and my city to ruin.

1671
03:12:36,891 --> 03:12:39,596
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1672
03:12:39,811 --> 03:12:43,807
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1673
03:12:44,814 --> 03:12:47,307
...nor our people fail.

1674
03:12:48,278 --> 03:12:49,653
Our people.

1675
03:12:53,491 --> 03:12:55,567
Our people.

1676
03:13:17,351 --> 03:13:20,351
I would have followed you, my brother.

1677
03:13:21,897 --> 03:13:23,891
My captain.

1678
03:13:26,527 --> 03:13:28,436
My king.

1679
03:13:48,091 --> 03:13:50,334
Be at peace...

1680
03:13:50,719 --> 03:13:52,712
...son of Gondor.

1681
03:14:09,198 --> 03:14:12,532
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1682
03:14:13,035 --> 03:14:16,036
But he will not return.

1683
03:14:39,271 --> 03:14:39,991
Frodo!

1684
03:15:00,711 --> 03:15:03,996
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1685
03:15:05,257 --> 03:15:08,257
I wish none of this had happened.

1686
03:15:11,220 --> 03:15:13,973
So do all who live
to see such times...

1687
03:15:14,184 --> 03:15:17,635
...but that is not for them to decide.

1688
03:15:17,854 --> 03:15:20,475
All you have to decide...

1689
03:15:20,690 --> 03:15:25,436
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1690
03:15:54,266 --> 03:15:56,343
Frodo, no!

1691
03:15:56,894 --> 03:15:58,174
Frodo!

1692
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:01,650
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1693
03:16:05,196 --> 03:16:07,153
Go back, Sam!

1694
03:16:07,656 --> 03:16:11,239
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1695
03:16:11,451 --> 03:16:14,287
And I'm coming with you!

1696
03:16:14,789 --> 03:16:17,196
You can't swim!

1697
03:16:21,003 --> 03:16:22,711
Sam!

1698
03:16:28,304 --> 03:16:29,632
Sam!

1699
03:17:10,556 --> 03:17:13,260
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1700
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:17,932
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1701
03:17:19,066 --> 03:17:21,687
And I don't mean to.

1702
03:17:21,943 --> 03:17:24,101
I don't mean to.

1703
03:17:25,780 --> 03:17:26,781
Sam.

1704
03:17:42,507 --> 03:17:44,167
Come on.

1705
03:18:12,622 --> 03:18:17,167
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1706
03:18:32,059 --> 03:18:37,055
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1707
03:18:40,485 --> 03:18:45,362
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1708
03:18:57,212 --> 03:19:00,378
Not if we hold true to each other.

1709
03:19:01,758 --> 03:19:06,219
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1710
03:19:07,221 --> 03:19:12,464
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1711
03:19:13,772 --> 03:19:15,763
We travel light.

1712
03:19:15,981 --> 03:19:17,892
Let us hunt some Orc.

1713
03:19:20,864 --> 03:19:21,614
Yes!

1714
03:19:41,886 --> 03:19:43,344
Mordor.

1715
03:19:43,971 --> 03:19:47,339
I hope the others find a safer road.

1716
03:19:48,266 --> 03:19:50,839
Strider will look after them.

1717
03:19:51,768 --> 03:19:55,138
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1718
03:19:55,482 --> 03:19:57,889
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1719
03:19:58,110 --> 03:19:59,687
We may.

1720
03:20:01,738 --> 03:20:02,816
Sam...

1721
03:20:06,411 --> 03:20:09,031
...I'm glad you are with me.

1
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,030
Look down, look down

2
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,271
Don't look them in the eye

3
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,670
Look down, look down

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,911
You're here until you die

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,514
No God above

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,878
And hell alone below

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,477
Look down, look down

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,950
There's 20 years to go

9
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,952
I've done no wrong

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,753
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,755
Look down, look down

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
Sweet Jesus doesn't care

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,838
I know she'll wait

14
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,912
I know that she'll be true

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,471
Look down, look down

16
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,075
They've all forgotten you

17
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,513
When I get free

18
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,592
You won't see me
Here for dust!

19
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,795
Huh!

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,516
Look down, look down

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,353
You'll always be a slave

22
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,593
Look down, look down

23
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,595
You're standing
in your grave

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,032
Retrieve the flag.

25
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,157
Now, Prisoner 24601

26
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,757
Your time is up
And your parole's begun

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,671
You know what that means?

28
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,752
Yes. It means I'm free

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,678
No. Follow to the letter
Your itinerary

30
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,433
This badge of shame
You'll show it till you die

31
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,909
It warns you're
a dangerous man

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,958
I stole a loaf of bread

33
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,558
My sister's child
was close to death

34
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,755
And we were starving

35
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,074
You will starve again

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,197
Unless you learn
the meaning of the law

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,910
I know the meaning
of those 19 years

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,357
A slave of the law!

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,838
Five years for what you did

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,195
The rest because
you tried to run

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,154
Yes, 24601

42
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,277
My name is Jean Valjean!

43
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,477
And I'm Javert!

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,676
Do not forget my name

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,830
Do not forget me

46
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,797
Look down, look down

47
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,156
You'll always be a slave

48
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,312
Look down, look down

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,552
You're standing
in your grave

50
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,193
Freedom at last
How strange the taste

51
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,429
Never forget the years,
the waste

52
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,759
Nor forgive them
for what they've done

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,513
They are the guilty
Everyone

54
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,993
The day begins
And now let's see

55
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,393
What this new world
Will do for me

56
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,673
Can I help?
A day's work?

57
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,749
Papers.

58
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,275
No work here.

59
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,276
Valjean,
as a dangerous man,
you will be on parole forever.

60
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,918
Failure to report
means immediate arrest.

61
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,759
Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.

62
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,633
Follow him.

63
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,671
Let me
see your papers.

64
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,359
Monsieur?
Papers.

65
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,311
I'll sleep in the stable.
Please, I'm hungry.

66
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,753
Get out.

67
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,429
Hey!

68
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,358
Come in,
sir, for you are weary

69
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,397
And the night is cold
out here

70
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,952
Though our lives
are very humble

71
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,552
What we have
We have to share

72
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,556
There is wine
here to revive you

73
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,949
There is bread
to make you strong

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,550
There's a bed to
rest till morning

75
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,352
Rest from pain
And rest from wrong

76
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,153
Bless the food we eat today.

77
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,716
Bless our dear sister
and our honored guest.

78
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,875
Get in there!
Put him down!

79
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,229
Stay there!

80
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,439
Monsignor.

81
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,549
We have your silver.

82
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,276
We caught this man
red-handed.

83
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,157
He had the nerve to
say you gave him this.

84
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,518
That is right

85
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,069
But, my friend,
you left so early

86
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,310
Surely something
slipped your mind

87
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,875
You forgot I gave these also

88
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,359
Would you leave
the best behind?

89
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,274
Messieurs, release him

90
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,710
This man has spoken true

91
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,792
I commend you for your duty

92
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,873
Now God's blessing go with you

93
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,108
But remember this, my brother

94
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,669
See in this some higher plan

95
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,918
You must use
this precious silver

96
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,198
To become an honest man

97
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,999
By the witness of the martyrs

98
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,029
By the passion and the blood

99
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,549
God has raised
you out of darkness

100
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,032
I have saved your soul for

101
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,830
God

102
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,152
What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?

103
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,596
Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run

104
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,990
Have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late

105
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,958
That nothing remains
but the cry of my hate?

106
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,873
The cries in the dark
that nobody hears

107
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,432
Here where I stand at
the turning of the years

108
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,239
If there's another way to go

109
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,675
I missed it 20 long years ago

110
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,228
My life was a war
that could never be won

111
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,709
They gave me a number
and they murdered Valjean

112
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,513
When they chained me
and left me for dead

113
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,194
Just for stealing
a mouthful of bread

114
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,475
Yet why did I allow this man

115
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,837
To touch my soul
and teach me love?

116
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,195
He treated me like any other

117
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,796
He gave me his trust
He called me brother

118
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,752
My life he claims
for God above

119
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,997
Can such things be?

120
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,274
For I had come
to hate the world

121
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,952
This world that
always hated me!

122
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,679
Take an eye for an eye!

123
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,753
Turn your heart into stone!

124
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,628
This is all I have lived for!

125
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,671
This is all I have known!

126
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,872
One word from him
and I'd be back

127
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,554
Beneath the lash,
upon the rack

128
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,630
Instead he offers me
my freedom!

129
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,038
I feel my shame inside me
like a knife

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,993
He told me that I have a soul

131
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,750
How does he know?

132
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,310
What spirit comes
to move my life?

133
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,992
Is there another way to go?

134
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,114
I am reaching but I fall

135
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,275
And the night is closing in

136
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,878
As I stare into the void

137
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,318
To the whirlpool of my sin

138
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,316
I'll escape now
from that world

139
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,709
From the world of Jean Valjean

140
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,512
Jean Valjean is nothing now!

141
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,597
Another story must begin!

142
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,595
At the end of the day
you're another day older

143
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,919
And that's all you can say
for the life of the poor

144
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,671
It's a struggle! It's a war!

145
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,716
And there's nothing
that anyone's giving

146
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,360
One more day standing about
What is it for?

147
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,872
One day less to be living

148
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,919
At the end of the day
you're another day colder

149
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,874
And the shirt on your back
doesn't keep out the chill

150
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,833
And the righteous hurry past
They don 't hear
the little ones crying

151
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,151
And the plague
is coming on fast
Ready to kill

152
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,679
One day nearer to dying!

153
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
At the end of the day
there's another day dawning

154
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,840
And the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise

155
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,717
Like the waves
crash on the sand

156
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,751
Like a storm
that'll break any second

157
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,753
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning
still to be reckoned

158
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,516
And there's
gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day!

159
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,794
At the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing

160
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,038
Sitting flat on your bum
doesn't buy any bread

161
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,551
There are children
back at home

162
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,557
And the children
have got to be fed

163
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,233
And you're lucky
to be in a job

164
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,998
And in a bed

165
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,031
And we're counting
our blessings

166
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,352
Have you seen
how the foreman
is fuming today

167
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,233
With his terrible breath
and his wandering hands?

168
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,351
It's because little Fantine
won 't give him his way

169
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,078
Take a look at his trousers
You'll see where he stands!

170
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,958
And the boss, he never
knows that the foreman
is always on heat

171
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,952
If Fantine doesn't look out,
watch how she goes

172
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,191
She'll be
out on the street

173
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,154
At the end of the day
it's another day over

174
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,198
With enough in your pocket
to last for a week

175
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,673
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on working as
long as you're able

176
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,514
Keep on working till you drop
Or it's back to
the crumbs off the table

177
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,594
Well,
you've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!

178
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,916
And what have we here,
little innocent sister?

179
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,914
Come on, Fantine,
let's have all the news

180
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,358
"Dear Fantine,
you must send us more money

181
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,398
"Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose"

182
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,510
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business

183
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,153
With a husband at home
and a bit on the side

184
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,678
Is there anyone here
who can swear before God

185
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,830
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

186
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,751
Stop making trouble.
I'm not making trouble.

187
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,114
Foreman!

188
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,599
What are you doing?

189
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,236
Come on, stop that!
Monsieur Madeleine is here!

190
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,679
What is
this fighting all about?
Someone tear these two apart!

191
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,716
This is a factory,
not a circus

192
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,152
Now, come on, ladies,
settle down

193
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,399
I am the mayor of this town

194
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,710
I run a business of repute

195
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,150
Deal with this, Foreman.
Be as patient as you can.

196
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,035
Yes,
Monsieur Madeleine.

197
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,670
Now, someone say
how this began.

198
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,512
At the end of the day
she's the one who began it!

199
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,113
There's a kid
that she's hiding
in some little town

200
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,077
There's a man
she has to pay

201
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,151
You can guess how
she picks up the extra

202
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,840
You can bet she's
earning her keep
sleeping around!

203
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,990
And the boss
wouldn 't like it

204
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,158
Yes, it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter

205
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,512
And her father
abandoned us,
leaving us flat

206
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,671
Now she lives
with an innkeeper
man and his wife

207
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,030
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?

208
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,594
At the end of the day
she'll be nothing but trouble

209
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,638
And there's trouble for all
when there's trouble for one

210
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,157
While we're earning
our daily bread

211
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,157
She's the one with
her hands in the butter

212
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,915
You must send the slut away
or we're all going
to end in the gutter

213
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,950
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!

214
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,996
I might have known
the bitch could bite

215
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,151
I might have known
the cat had claws

216
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,755
I might have guessed
your little secret

217
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,631
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine
who keeps herself
so pure and clean

218
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,555
You'd be the cause,
I had no doubt
of any trouble hereabout

219
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,596
You play a virgin
in the light

220
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,597
But need no urging
in the night

221
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,472
She's been
laughing at you while
she's having her men!

222
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,471
She'll be nothing
but trouble again and again!

223
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,275
You must sack her today!
Sack the girl today!

224
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,677
Right, my girl
On your way

225
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,992
Monsieur le Mayor!
Monsieur le Mayor!

226
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,115
Monsieur le Mayor!

227
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,758
Monsieur le Mayor!
Monsieur le Mayor!

228
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,912
Please!
Please, monsieur!

229
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,151
I have a child!
Monsieur!

230
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,594
Please! Please.

231
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,116
Welcome, Inspector.

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,431
Monsieur le Mayor.

233
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
Please
know me as Javert

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,036
I'm here at your command

235
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,034
With honor due to each
And justice in our hand

236
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,317
No man's beyond our reach

237
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,628
Let all beware

238
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,830
Welcome, sir
Come guard our laws

239
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,436
I'm sure we're here
In common cause

240
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,591
You've done the city proud

241
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,228
You're praised
by those on high

242
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,550
Your success
has earned a force

243
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,234
The best that Paris
can supply

244
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,718
Your people thrive

245
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,031
The dignity of toil
To stay alive

246
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,636
It seems to me
we may have met

247
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,675
Your face is not a face
I would forget

248
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,952
Monsieur Madeleine!
Pardon.

249
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,678
Monsieur le Mayor!

250
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,318
Monsieur le Mayor!

251
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,152
The weight,
it's crushing him!

252
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,559
Stay still, stay still.

253
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,795
Hold, hold, hold!
Hold that steady.

254
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,192
Hold it steady!

255
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,038
That's it. That's it.

256
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,029
Can this be true?
I don't believe what I see

257
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,238
A man your age
To be as strong as you are

258
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,278
A memory stirs

259
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,954
You make me think of a man

260
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,596
From years ago

261
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,678
A man who broke his parole

262
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,117
He disappeared

263
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,999
Say what you must
Don't leave it there

264
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,629
Forgive me, sir
I would not dare

265
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,599
How much for this?
It's my daughter's.

266
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,313
I'll give you
four francs for that.

267
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,708
Four? It's worth 10!

268
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,269
No.

269
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,954
I smell women
Smell 'em in the air

270
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,111
Think I'll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there

271
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,189
Five?

272
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,113
Lovely lady
I'll love you till I'm broke

273
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,238
Seven months at sea
and now I'm hungry for a poke!

274
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,591
Even stokers
need a little stoke!

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,479
Lovely ladies
Waiting for a bite!

276
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,473
Waiting for the customers
Who only come at night

277
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,473
Lovely ladies
Ready for the call

278
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,791
Standing up or lying down
Or any way at all

279
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,037
Bargain prices
up against the wall!

280
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,357
What pretty hair!

281
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,512
What pretty locks
you've got there!

282
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,476
What luck you've got
It's worth a centime,
my dear!

283
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,476
I'll take the lot!

284
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,194
Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!

285
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,671
Let's make a price

286
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,513
I'll give you
all of 10 francs

287
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,838
Just think of that

288
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,392
It pays a debt

289
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,676
Just think of that

290
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,679
What can I do?
It pays a debt

291
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,389
Ten francs may
save my poor Cosette

292
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,839
Lovely ladies
Waiting in the dark

293
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,673
Ready for a thick one
Or a quick one in the park

294
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,917
Long time, short time
Any time, my dear!

295
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,958
Costs a little extra
If you want to take all year

296
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,031
Quick and cheap
is underneath the pier

297
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,713
Go and see them.

298
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,357
Come over here

299
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,154
It's 20 francs for a tooth

300
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,391
Come here, my dear

301
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,949
I'll pay you well
for your youth

302
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,756
The pain won't last
You'll still be able to bite

303
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,389
Just the back ones.

304
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,393
I do it fast
I know my business all right

305
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,276
It's worth a go

306
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,472
You'll pay me first
what I am due

307
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,074
You'll get twice
if I take two

308
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,678
Give me the dirt
Who's that bit over there?

309
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,400
A bit of skirt
She's the one sold her hair

310
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,753
She's got a kid
Sends her all that she can

311
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,480
I might have known
There is always some man

312
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,837
Lovely lady,
come along and join us!

313
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,991
Lovely lady!

314
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,711
Come on, dearie,
why all the fuss?

315
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,590
You're no grander
than the rest of us

316
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,515
Life has dropped you
at the bottom of the heap

317
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,954
Join your sisters

318
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,634
Make money in your sleep

319
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,116
That's right, dearie
Show him what you've got

320
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,828
That's right, dearie
Let him have the lot

321
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,473
Old men, young men
Take 'em as they come!

322
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,552
Harbor rats and alley cats
and every kind of scum

323
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,678
Poor men, rich men,
leaders of the land

324
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,877
See them with
their trousers off
They're never quite as grand!

325
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,271
All it takes is
money in your hand

326
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,392
Lovely ladies
Going for a song

327
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,192
Got a lot of callers
But they never stay for long

328
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,154
Come on, Captain
You can wear your shoes

329
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,790
Don't it make a change
to have a girl
who can't refuse?

330
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,716
Easy money
Lying on a bed

331
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,675
Just as well they never see
The hate that's in your head

332
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:50,031
Don't they know
they're making love
to one already dead?

333
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,712
There was a time
when men were kind

334
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,113
When their voices were soft

335
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,913
And their words inviting

336
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,633
There was a time
when love was blind

337
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,798
And the world was a song

338
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,756
And the song was exciting

339
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,754
There was a time

340
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,431
Then it all went wrong

341
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,990
I dreamed a dream
in time gone by

342
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,634
When hope was high
And life worth living

343
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:37,077
I dreamed that
love would never die

344
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,629
I dreamed that God
would be forgiving

345
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:52,478
Then I was young and unafraid

346
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,793
And dreams were made
and used and wasted

347
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,438
There was no ransom to be paid

348
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,998
No song unsung,
no wine untasted

349
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,509
But the tigers come at night

350
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,548
With their voices
soft as thunder

351
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,870
As they tear your hope apart

352
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,877
As they turn
your dream to shame

353
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,189
He slept a summer by my side

354
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,030
He filled my days
with endless wonder

355
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,908
He took my childhood
in his stride

356
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,359
But he was gone
when autumn came

357
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,234
And still I dream
he'll come to me

358
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,554
That we will live
the years together

359
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,356
But there are dreams
that cannot be

360
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,753
And there are storms
we cannot weather

361
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,396
I had a dream my life would be

362
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,958
So different from
this hell I'm living

363
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:15,071
So different now
from what it seemed!

364
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,553
Now

365
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,478
Life has killed the dream

366
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,917
I dreamed

367
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,878
Have you anywhere to go?
No? You need to get warm.

368
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,433
What do you have for me?

369
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,349
Here's
our youngest, sir.

370
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,873
I don't want you

371
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,032
You've got some nerve,
you little slut.
You've got some gall.

372
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,069
Ow!

373
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,271
By Christ,
you'll pay for
what you've done

374
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,079
I guarantee
I'll make you suffer

375
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,593
I beg you,
don't report me, sir

376
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,119
I'll do whatever
you may want

377
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,519
Make your excuse to the police

378
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,470
Tell me quickly
what's the story

379
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,710
Who saw what
and why and where?

380
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,873
Let him give
a full description
Let him answer to Javert

381
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,799
Javert, would you believe it?
I was lost here in the dark

382
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,159
When this
prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark

383
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,756
She will answer
for her actions
If you make a full report

384
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,552
You may rest assured, monsieur
She will answer to the court

385
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,314
There's a child
who sorely needs me

386
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,312
Please, monsieur,
she's but that high

387
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,518
Holy God, is there no mercy?

388
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,032
If I go to jail she'll die

389
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,154
I have heard
such protestations
every day for 20 years

390
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,515
Let's have
no more explanations

391
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,034
Save your breath,
save your tears

392
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,954
Honest work, just reward

393
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,669
That's the way
to please the Lord

394
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,513
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman 's tale

395
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,272
Monsieur le Mayor!

396
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,719
You've done your duty,
let her be

397
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,518
She needs a doctor,
not a jail

398
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,158
Monsieur le Mayor!

399
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,151
Can this be?

400
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,478
Where will she end

401
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,550
This child without a friend?

402
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,788
I've seen your face before

403
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,472
Show me some way to help you

404
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,512
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?

405
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,149
Monsieur,
don't mock me now, I pray

406
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,749
It's hard enough
I've lost my pride

407
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,633
You let your foreman
send me away

408
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,272
Yes, you were there
And turned aside

409
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,355
I never did no wrong

410
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,238
Is it true what I've done...

411
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,158
My daughter's close to dying

412
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,276
... to an innocent soul?

413
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,358
If there's a God above...

414
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,193
Had I only known then

415
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,831
...he'd let me die instead

416
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,355
In His name
my task has just begun

417
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,989
I will take her
to the hospital.

418
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,354
Monsieur le Mayor.

419
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,039
Where is your child?

420
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,151
With an innkeeper
in Montfermeil.

421
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,316
I will send for her
immediately.

422
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,873
I will see it done!

423
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,389
Rest.

424
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,871
From Paris, monsieur.

425
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,673
Monsieur le Mayor,
I have a crime to declare!

426
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,556
I have disgraced
The uniform that I wear

427
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,758
I've done you wrong
Let no forgiveness be shown

428
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,759
I've been as hard
On every rogue I have known

429
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,988
I mistook you for a convict
I have made a false report

430
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,512
Now I learn
they caught the culprit
He's about to face the court

431
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,679
And of course
he now denies it
You'd expect that of a con

432
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,789
But he couldn't run forever
No, not even Jean Valjean

433
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,678
You say this man denies it all

434
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,309
And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance?

435
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,038
You say this man
is going to trial

436
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,634
And that he's
sure to be returned
to serve his sentence?

437
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,471
He will pay, and so must I

438
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,192
Press charges against me, sir

439
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,393
You have only
done your duty

440
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,313
It's a minor sin
at most

441
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,154
All of us have
made misjudgments

442
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,914
You'll return, sir,
to your post

443
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,836
They think that man is me
Without a second glance

444
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,471
This stranger they have found
This man could be my chance

445
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,589
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?

446
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,356
When I have come so far
and struggled for so long?

447
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,438
If I speak, I am condemned

448
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,833
If I stay silent,
I am damned!

449
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,309
I am the master of
hundreds of workers

450
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,516
They all look to me

451
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,514
Can I abandon them?
How would they live
if I am not free?

452
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,875
If I speak, they are condemned

453
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,355
If I stay silent

454
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,876
I am damned

455
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,870
Who am I?

456
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,554
Can I condemn
this man to slavery?

457
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,719
Pretend I do not
feel his agony?

458
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,196
This innocent
who bears my face

459
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,436
Who goes to judgment
in my place

460
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,629
Who am I?

461
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,073
Can I conceal
myself forevermore?

462
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,590
Pretend I'm not
the man I was before?

463
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,074
And must my name until I die
be no more than an alibi?

464
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,595
Must I lie?

465
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,070
How can I ever
face my fellow men?

466
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,635
How can I ever
face myself again?

467
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,630
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago

468
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,758
He gave me hope
when hope was gone

469
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,873
He gave me
strength to journey on!

470
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,554
Who am I?

471
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,876
Who am I?

472
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,075
I'm Jean Valjean

473
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,719
Monsieur le Mayor!

474
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,913
And so,
Your Honor, you see it's true

475
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,200
This man bears
no more guilt than you!

476
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,749
Who am I?

477
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,589
24601!

478
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,955
Monsieur le Mayor,
you are not well.

479
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,109
You must come with me.

480
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,793
If you don't believe me,
ask Inspector Javert.

481
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,399
You'll find me
at the hospital.

482
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,830
Cosette,
it's turned so cold

483
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,797
Cosette,
it's past your bedtime

484
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,552
You've played the day away

485
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,717
And soon it will be night

486
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,194
Come to me

487
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,678
Cosette, the light is fading

488
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,716
Don't you see

489
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,318
The evening star appearing?

490
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,350
Come to me

491
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,195
And rest against my shoulder

492
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,479
How fast the minutes fly away
and every minute colder

493
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,675
Dear Fantine,
Cosette will be here soon

494
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,838
Dear Fantine,
she will be by your side

495
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,555
Come, Cosette

496
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,034
My child, where did you go?

497
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,078
Be at peace

498
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,955
Be at peace evermore

499
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,388
My Cosette

500
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,109
Shall live in my protection

501
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,712
Take her now

502
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,556
Your child will
want for nothing

503
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:39,158
Good monsieur,
you come from God in heaven

504
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,472
Tell Cosette I love her

505
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,757
And I'll see her when I wake

506
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,196
Valjean, at last
We see each other plain

507
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,674
"Monsieur le Mayor"
You'll wear a different chain

508
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,678
Before you say
another word, Javert

509
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,996
Before you chain me up
like a slave again

510
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,038
Listen to me!
There is something I must do

511
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,560
This woman leaves
behind a suffering child

512
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,553
There is none but me
who can intercede

513
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,236
In mercy's name,
three days are all I need

514
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,600
Then I'll return,
I pledge my word

515
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,795
Then I'll return

516
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,393
You must think me mad

517
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,632
I've hunted you
across the years

518
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,435
Men like you
can never change

519
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,873
A man such as you!

520
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,039
Believe of me what you will

521
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,559
Men like you
can never change

522
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,948
There is a duty
I'm sworn to do

523
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,308
Men like me
can never change

524
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,072
You know nothing of my life

525
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,832
No, 24601!

526
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,035
All I did was steal some bread

527
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,195
My duty is to the law

528
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,475
You know nothing
of the world

529
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,789
You have no rights

530
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,313
You would sooner
see me dead

531
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,753
Come with me, 24601!

532
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,353
But not before
I see this justice done!

533
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,674
Now the wheel
has turned around

534
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,479
Jean Valjean
means nothing now

535
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,914
Dare you talk to me
of crime

536
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,399
I am warning you, Javert

537
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,595
And the price
you had to pay

538
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,829
I'm the stronger man by far!

539
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,228
Every man is born in sin

540
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,554
There is power in me yet!

541
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,119
Every man
must choose his way

542
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,593
My race is not yet run!

543
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,194
You know nothing of Javert!

544
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,999
I was born inside a jail!

545
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,720
I was born
with scum like you!

546
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,992
I am from the gutter, too!

547
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,436
There is a castle on a cloud

548
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,276
I like to go there in my sleep

549
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,911
Aren't any floors
for me to sweep

550
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,392
Not in my castle on a cloud

551
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,759
There is a lady all in white

552
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,469
Holds me and sings a lullaby

553
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,071
She's nice to see
and she's soft to touch

554
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,872
She says,
"Cosette,
I love you very much"

555
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,875
I know a place
where no one's lost

556
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,556
I know a place
where no one cries

557
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,510
Crying at all is not allowed

558
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,993
Not in my castle on a cloud

559
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,599
Now look who's here!

560
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,429
The little madam herself

561
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,194
Pretending once again
she's been so awfully good

562
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,276
Better not let me
catch you slacking!
Better not catch my eye!

563
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,349
Ten rotten francs
your mother sends me
What is that going to buy?

564
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,719
Now take that pail
My little mademoiselle

565
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,189
And go and draw
some water from the well

566
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,190
We should never
have taken you in
in the first place

567
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,759
How stupid
the things that we do!

568
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,717
Like mother, like daughter,
the scum of the street

569
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,509
Mama!

570
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,034
Eponine, come, my dear
Eponine, let me see you

571
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,555
You look very well in
that little blue hat

572
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,749
Oh.

573
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,156
There's some little girls
who know how to behave

574
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,755
And they know what to wear
And I'm saying
thank heaven for that!

575
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,548
Still there, Cosette?
Your tears will
do you no good!

576
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,072
I told you, fetch some water
from the well in the wood

577
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,631
Please do not
send me out alone

578
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,152
Not in the darkness on my own

579
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,437
Now shut your face or
I'll forget to be nice!

580
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,477
You heard me ask for something
And I never ask twice

581
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,591
Wakey-wakey, we're opening.

582
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,548
I love you.
I love you so much.

583
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,269
My band of soaks

584
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,718
My den of dissolutes

585
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,433
My dirty jokes

586
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,629
Ugh!

587
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,276
My always pissed as newts

588
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,472
My sons of whores

589
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,119
No, no, no.
Not tonight.

590
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,317
Spend their lives in my inn

591
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,278
Wakey-wakey.
Good boy, good boy,
good boy.

592
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,513
Homing pigeons homing in

593
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,559
They fly through my doors

594
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,719
And they crawl out
on all fours

595
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,029
Daddy, here.

596
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,713
Thank you, darling.

597
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,438
Such a gentleman.

598
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,910
Welcome, monsieur,
sit yourself down

599
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,390
And meet the best
innkeeper in town

600
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,317
As for the rest
All of them crooks

601
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,075
Rooking the guests
And cooking the books

602
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,798
Seldom do you see

603
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,353
Honest men like me

604
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,709
A gent of good intent
who's content to be

605
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,439
Master of the house
Doling out the charm

606
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,279
Ready with a handshake
and an open palm

607
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,159
Tells a saucy tale
Makes a little stir

608
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,834
Customers appreciate
a bon viveur

609
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,993
Glad to do a friend a favor

610
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,515
Doesn 't cost me to be nice

611
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,032
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has
got a little price

612
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,719
Master of the house
Keeper of the zoo

613
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,633
Ready to relieve them
of a sou or two

614
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,553
Watering the wine
Making up the weight

615
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,553
Picking up their knick-knacks
When they can 't see straight

616
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,078
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend

617
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,835
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won 't I bleed 'em
in the end!

618
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,233
Master of the house!
Quick to catch your eye

619
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,994
Never wants a passerby
to pass him by!

620
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,913
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

621
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,913
Comforter, philosopher
and lifelong mate

622
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,435
Everybody's boon companion

623
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,399
Everybody's chaperone

624
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,348
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I
skin you to the bone!

625
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,753
Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief

626
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,832
Mix it in a mincer
And pretend it's beef

627
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,235
Kidney of a horse
Liver of a cat

628
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,471
Filling up the sausages
with this and that

629
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,393
Residents are
more than welcome

630
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,120
Bridal suite is occupied

631
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,637
Reasonable charges
Plus some little
extras on the side

632
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,199
Oh, Santa!

633
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,954
Charge 'em for the lice
Extra for the mice

634
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,395
Two percent for
looking in the mirror twice

635
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,632
Hand it over!
Here a little slice,
there a little cut

636
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,633
Three percent for sleeping
with the windows shut

637
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,473
When it comes
to fixing prices

638
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,393
There are a lot
of tricks I knows

639
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,154
How it all increases
All those bits and pieces

640
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,390
Jesus!
It's amazing how it grows

641
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,115
Sorry, love.
I must get
something done about that.

642
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,477
I used to dream
that I would meet a prince

643
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,671
But, God almighty

644
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,955
Have you seen
what's happened since?

645
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,997
What? What?

646
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,678
"Master of the house"
isn't worth my spit!

647
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,877
Comforter, philosopher
and lifelong shit!

648
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,876
Cunning little brain

649
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,868
Regular Voltaire

650
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,437
Thinks he's quite a lover
but there's not much there

651
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,476
What a cruel trick of nature

652
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,997
Landed me with such a louse

653
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,354
God knows how I've lasted
living with this
bastard in the house

654
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,229
Master of the house!

655
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,719
Master and a half!

656
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,313
Comforter, philosopher

657
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,589
Don't make me laugh

658
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,195
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

659
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,553
Hypocrite and
toady and inebriate!

660
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,790
Everybody
bless the landlord!

661
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,239
Everybody
bless his spouse!

662
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,879
Everybody raise a glass!

663
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,356
Raise it up
the master's arse!

664
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,870
Everybody raise a glass
to the master of the house

665
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,115
I love you, too.

666
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,355
Everybody
bless the landlord

667
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,600
Hush now
Do not be afraid of me

668
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,638
Don't hide
Show me where you live

669
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,794
Tell me, my child,
what is your name?

670
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,351
I'm called Cosette

671
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,954
Mademoiselle.
Can I help you
with your bucket?

672
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,955
Whoa!

673
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,713
I found her
wandering in the wood

674
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,839
This little child,
I found her
trembling in the shadows

675
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,672
And I am here
to help Cosette

676
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,991
I will settle any debt
you may think proper

677
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,716
I will pay what I must pay

678
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,358
To take Cosette away

679
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,039
I love you.

680
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,348
This is a duty I must heed

681
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,910
And there is
a promise I have made

682
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,437
For I was blind
to one in need

683
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,038
I did not see
what stood before me

684
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,591
Now your mother is with God

685
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,911
Her suffering is over

686
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,753
And I speak here
with her voice

687
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,150
And I stand here in her place

688
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,431
Come on.

689
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,632
And from this day,
and evermore

690
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,075
Let me take
your coat, monsieur

691
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,277
Cosette shall live
in my protection

692
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,476
You are very welcome here

693
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,200
I will not forget my vow

694
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,395
Take a drink

695
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,078
Take a chair

696
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,671
Cosette shall
have a father now

697
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,559
What to do?
What to say?

698
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,633
Shall you carry
our treasure away?

699
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,515
What a gem!
What a pearl!

700
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,871
Beyond rubies is
our little girl

701
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,435
How can we
talk of debt?

702
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,873
Let's not haggle
for darling Colette

703
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,075
Cosette.
Cosette

704
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,672
Dear Fantine,
gone to rest

705
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,229
Have we done for her
child what is best?

706
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,469
I think so.

707
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,474
Shared our bread,
shared each bone

708
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,598
Treated her like
she's one of our own

709
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,988
Yes, our own.

710
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,394
Like our own,
monsieur!

711
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,709
The cost adds up.

712
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,434
Your feelings do
you credit, sir

713
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,120
And I will ease
the parting blow

714
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,432
Let us not talk of bargains
and bones and greed

715
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,353
Now may I say we are agreed?

716
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,199
That would
quite fit the bill

717
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,955
If she hadn't
so often been ill

718
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,715
Little dear, cost us dear

719
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,156
Medicines are expensive,
monsieur

720
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,790
Not that we begrudged a sou

721
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,599
It's no more than
we Christians must do

722
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,473
Than we Christians may do

723
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,995
No more words!
Here's your price

724
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,072
Fifteen hundred
for your sacrifice

725
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,510
Come, Cosette,
say goodbye

726
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,235
Let us seek out
some friendlier sky

727
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,270
Thank you, both, for Cosette

728
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,268
It won 't take you
too long to forget

729
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,352
Farewell, Courgette!

730
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,192
It's "Cosette."
Cosette.

731
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,430
And, open.

732
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,389
It's for you.

733
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,999
Where I go, you will be

734
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,831
Will you be
like a papa to me?

735
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,677
Yes, Cosette
This is true

736
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,876
I'll be father
and mother to you

737
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,553
Not bad.
Not enough!

738
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,156
There's a copper at the door
What the devil have you done?

739
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,709
Where's the child Cosette?

740
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,110
She's gone with a gent

741
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,668
Didn't tell us
where they went

742
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,149
Didn't leave
his home address

743
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,389
You're a bloody fool
Look at what we got

744
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,358
Should've struck the iron
Struck it while it's hot!

745
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,512
Next time round, I promise
I'm gonna get the lot

746
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,669
Okay?

747
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,877
Suddenly you're here

748
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,474
Suddenly it starts

749
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,915
Can two anxious hearts
beat as one?

750
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,680
Yesterday I was alone

751
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,276
Today you are beside me

752
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,113
Something still unclear

753
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,638
Something not yet here
has begun

754
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,831
Suddenly the world
seems a different place

755
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,598
Somehow full of grace
Full of light

756
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,788
How was I to know
that so much hope

757
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,633
Was held inside me?

758
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,479
What is passed is gone

759
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,158
Now we journey on
through the night

760
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,833
How was I to know at last
That happiness
can come so fast?

761
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,753
Trusting me the way you do

762
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,832
I'm so afraid of failing you

763
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,677
Just a child who cannot know
That danger follows where I go

764
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,638
There are shadows everywhere

765
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,157
And memories I cannot share

766
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,828
Nevermore alone

767
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,513
Nevermore apart

768
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,958
You have warmed my heart
like the sun

769
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:14,871
You have brought
the gift of life
And love so long denied me

770
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,158
Suddenly I see

771
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,476
What I could not see

772
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,958
Something suddenly

773
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,672
Has begun

774
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,876
Halt!
Let's see your papers.

775
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,312
Where are you traveling?

776
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,112
Cosette. Cosette.

777
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,878
Give me the doll.

778
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,148
Come.

779
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,994
Valjean!

780
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,714
Come, Cosette.
Come quickly!

781
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,879
Come on.

782
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,553
24601!

783
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,754
Cosette. I've got you.
Come, come.

784
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,835
Valjean!

785
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,188
Who's there?

786
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,992
Please, monsieur.

787
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,355
I need your help.

788
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,476
Please, please.

789
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,509
Monsieur le Mayor?

790
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,795
Who are you?

791
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,359
Fauchelevent.

792
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,759
I fell under my cart.

793
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,359
You saved my life, monsieur.

794
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,078
Fauchelevent.

795
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,994
We need a place of sanctuary,
this child and I.

796
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,037
We need to disappear.

797
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,159
We'll give thanks
for what is granted

798
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,990
What the sisters may ordain

799
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,513
Come.

800
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,673
Here we pray
for new beginnings

801
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:32,037
Here our lives
can start again

802
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:56,790
There,
out in the darkness

803
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,635
A fugitive running

804
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,236
Fallen from God

805
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,674
Fallen from grace

806
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,991
God be my witness

807
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,351
I never shall yield

808
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,557
Till we come face to face

809
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,914
Till we come face to face

810
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,355
He knows his way in the dark

811
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,993
Mine is the way of the Lord

812
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,709
Those who follow
the path of the righteous

813
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,714
Shall have their reward

814
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,589
And if they fall
as Lucifer fell

815
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,675
The flames! The sword!

816
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,477
Stars in your multitudes

817
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,952
Scarce to be counted

818
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,996
Filling the darkness

819
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,709
With order and light

820
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,230
You are the sentinels

821
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,039
Silent and sure

822
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,920
Keeping watch in the night

823
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,310
Keeping watch in the night

824
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,996
You know your place in the sky

825
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,038
You hold your course
and your aim

826
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,193
And each in your season
returns and returns

827
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,075
And is always the same

828
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,114
And if you fall
as Lucifer fell

829
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,592
You fall in flames!

830
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,117
And so it must be,
for so it is written

831
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,352
On the doorway to paradise

832
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,876
That those who falter
and those who fall

833
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,953
Must pay the price

834
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,951
Lord, let me find him

835
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,192
That I may see him

836
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,029
Safe behind bars!

837
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,639
I will never rest till then!

838
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,314
This I swear

839
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,476
This I swear by the stars!

840
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,512
Come on, boys!

841
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,155
Come on.

842
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,956
Look down and see
the beggars at your feet!

843
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:24,036
Look down and show
some mercy if you can

844
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:30,116
Look down and see
the sweepings of the street!

845
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:36,276
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man!

846
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,795
How do you do?
My name's Gavroche

847
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,919
These are my people,
here's my patch

848
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,680
Not much to look at,
nothing posh

849
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,559
Nothing that
you'd call up to scratch

850
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,314
This is my school,
my high society

851
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,199
Here in
the slums of Saint Michel

852
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,715
We live on
crumbs of humble piety

853
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,593
Tough on the teeth,
but what the hell

854
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,513
Think you're poor?
Think you're free?

855
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,314
Follow me! Follow me!

856
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,759
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

857
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,277
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man

858
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,674
Wait, Gavroche!

859
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,513
There was a time
we killed the king

860
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,592
We tried to change
the world too fast

861
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,228
Now we have got another king

862
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,073
He is no better than the last

863
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,834
This is the land
that fought for liberty

864
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,600
Now when we fight,
we fight for bread!

865
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,479
Here is
the thing about equality

866
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,359
Everyone's equal
when they're dead

867
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,114
Take your place!
Take your chance!

868
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,953
Vive la France!
Vive la France!

869
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,399
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

870
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,436
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man

871
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,549
When's this gonna end?

872
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,874
When we gonna live?

873
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,189
Something's gotta happen now

874
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,469
Something's gotta give

875
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,279
It'll come,
it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come

876
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,908
Where are
the leaders of the land?

877
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,680
Where is the king
who runs this show?

878
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,354
Only one man,
General Lamarque

879
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,398
Speaks for
the people here below!

880
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,710
Lamarque is ill
and fading fast

881
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,639
Won't last a week out,
so they say

882
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,513
With all the anger
in the land

883
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,029
How long before
the Judgment Day?

884
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,556
Before we cut
the fat ones down to size?

885
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,709
Death to the king!

886
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,869
Liberty for France!

887
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,909
Before the barricades arise?

888
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,149
Death to the king!

889
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,195
Tell your friends.
We come tomorrow.

890
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,880
We meet here at
General Lamarque's house.
Bring your friends.

891
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,559
Vive General Lamarque!

892
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,033
Marius!
Grandfather!

893
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,274
Have you any idea
of the shame you
bring on our family?

894
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,591
An utter disgrace.

895
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,795
Marius.

896
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,475
Vive General Lamarque!
Vive General Lamarque!

897
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,274
Vive la France!
Vive la France!

898
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,994
Vive la France!
Vive la France!

899
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,520
Hey there, monsieur,
what's new with you?

900
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,793
Plotting to
overthrow the state?

901
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,312
You still
pretending to be poor

902
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,994
Come on,
I know your grandpa's rich

903
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,470
Won't take a franc
that I've not earned

904
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,634
All of those bridges
have been burned

905
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,234
I like the way
you talk, monsieur!

906
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,551
I like the way
you always tease

907
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,356
Little he knows

908
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,832
Little he sees

909
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,397
Here, take this.

910
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,553
Eponine!

911
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,875
Everyone here,
you know your place

912
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,032
Brujon, Babet, Claquesous

913
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,350
You, Montparnasse,
watch for the law

914
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,829
With Eponine, take care

915
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,231
You turn on the tears
No mistakes, my dears

916
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,874
Please, monsieur,
come this way

917
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,715
Here's a child
that ain 't eaten today

918
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,873
Save a life, spare a sou

919
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,432
God rewards all
the good that you do

920
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,835
Wait a bit!
Know that face!

921
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,872
Ain't the world
a remarkable place!

922
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,230
Men like me don 't forget

923
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,358
You're the bastard
that borrowed Colette!

924
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,714
Cosette.
Whatever.

925
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,917
What is this?
Are you mad?

926
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,116
No, monsieur,
you don't know what you say!

927
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,872
You know me! I know you!

928
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,393
And you'll pay
what we're due

929
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,788
And you'd better dig deep

930
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,712
'Cause she doesn't
come cheap

931
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,274
Brujon.

932
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,589
It's the police! Disappear!

933
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,591
Run for it! It's Javert!

934
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,432
- Cosette!
-  Papa.

935
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,753
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air

936
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,593
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert!

937
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,116
Monsieur,
these streets are not safe
But let these vermin beware

938
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,112
We'll see that
justice is done

939
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,114
Look upon
this fine collection

940
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,919
Crawled from
underneath a stone

941
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,275
This swarm of
worms and maggots

942
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,468
Could have picked you
to the bone

943
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,108
I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade

944
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,989
And on your witness, monsieur,
I'll see him suitably paid

945
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,794
But where's
the gentleman gone?

946
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,030
And why on Earth
would he run?

947
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,351
You will have
a job to find him

948
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,637
He's not all he seems to be

949
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,276
And that girl
he trails behind him

950
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,110
Is the child
he stole from me

951
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,633
Yeah, and me.

952
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,989
Yeah, both of us.

953
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,154
Could it be
he's that old jailbird
That the tide now washes in?

954
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,996
Heard my name
and started running
All the omens point to him

955
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,674
In the absence of a victim

956
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,357
Dear Inspector, may I go?

957
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,397
And remember

958
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,991
When you've nicked him

959
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:07,188
It was me what told you so

960
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,918
Let the old man
keep on running

961
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,358
I will run him off his feet!

962
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,909
Everyone, about your business
Clear this garbage
off the street

963
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,031
Cosette! Now I remember

964
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,232
Cosette! How can it be?

965
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,433
We were children together

966
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,390
Look what's become of me

967
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,310
Eponine! Who was that girl?

968
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,392
That bourgeois
two-a-penny thing

969
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,471
Eponine, find her for me!

970
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,239
What will you give me?

971
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,913
Anything!

972
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,870
Got you all excited now
But God knows
what you see in her

973
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,031
Aren't you all delighted now?

974
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,990
No,
I don't want your money, sir

975
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,559
Eponine, do this for me

976
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,075
Discover where she lives

977
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,913
But careful how you go
Don't let your father know

978
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,673
Eponine! I'm lost
until she's found

979
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,518
You see? I told you so

980
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,234
There's lots of things
I know

981
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,432
'Ponine

982
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:50,551
She knows her way around

983
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,629
The time is near

984
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,639
So near it's stirring
the blood in their veins

985
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,712
And yet beware!

986
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,156
Don't let the wine
go to your brains

987
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,154
We need a sign to
rally the people

988
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,833
To call them to arms

989
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,072
And to bring them in line!

990
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,915
Marius, wake up!
What's wrong today?

991
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,479
You look as if
you've seen a ghost

992
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,838
Some wine, and
say what's going on

993
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,277
A ghost, you say?
A ghost maybe

994
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,358
She was just
like a ghost to me

995
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,159
One minute there,
then she was gone

996
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,992
I am agog!
I am aghast!

997
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,760
Is Marius in love
at last?

998
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,596
I've never heard
him "Ooh" and "Aah"

999
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,839
You talk of
battles to be won

1000
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,474
And here he comes
like Don Juan

1001
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,192
It is better
than an opera!

1002
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,638
It is time for us all
to decide who we are

1003
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,556
Do we fight for the right
to a night at the opera now?

1004
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,390
Have you asked of yourself
What's the price
you might pay?

1005
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,234
Is this simply a game
for a rich young boy to play?

1006
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,714
The colors of the world
are changing day by day

1007
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:38,554
Red, the blood of angry men!

1008
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,838
Black, the dark of ages past!

1009
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,879
Red, a world about to dawn!

1010
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,236
Black,
the night that ends at last!

1011
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,674
Had you seen her today
you might know how it feels

1012
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:04,073
To be struck to the bone
in a moment of
breathless delight!

1013
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,353
Had you been there today
you might also have known

1014
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,434
How your world may be changed
in just one burst of light

1015
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,319
And what was right seems wrong

1016
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,553
And what was wrong seems right

1017
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,675
Red!

1018
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,400
I feel my soul on fire!

1019
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,755
Black!

1020
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,434
My world if she's not there!

1021
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,795
Red!

1022
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,599
The color of desire!

1023
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,749
Black!

1024
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,316
The color of despair!

1025
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,757
Marius,
you're no longer a child

1026
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,751
I do not doubt
you mean it well

1027
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,309
But now
there is a higher call

1028
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,708
I know.

1029
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,189
Who cares about
your lonely soul?

1030
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,794
We strive
towards a larger goal

1031
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,192
Our little lives
don 't count at all!

1032
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,679
Red!

1033
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,593
The blood of angry men!

1034
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,709
Black!

1035
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,400
The dark of ages past!

1036
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,949
Red!

1037
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,714
A world about to dawn!

1038
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,229
Black!

1039
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:16,112
The night that ends at last!

1040
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,315
Listen, everybody!

1041
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,556
General Lamarque
is dead.

1042
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:28,110
Lamarque,
his death is
the hour of fate

1043
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,799
The people's man

1044
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,676
His death is
the sign we await!

1045
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,479
On his funeral day
they will honor his name

1046
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,279
With the light of
rebellion ablaze in their eyes

1047
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,632
From their candles of grief
we will kindle our flame

1048
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,957
On the tomb of Lamarque
shall our barricade rise!

1049
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,997
The time is here!

1050
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,993
Let us welcome it gladly
with courage and cheer!

1051
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,833
Let us take to the streets
with no doubt in our hearts

1052
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,474
But a jubilant shout!

1053
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,632
They will come one and all!

1054
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:09,319
They will come
when we call!

1055
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,272
Did you find her?

1056
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,877
How strange

1057
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,919
This feeling that
my life's begun at last

1058
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,355
This change

1059
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,956
Can people really
fall in love so fast?

1060
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,957
What's the matter
with you, Cosette?

1061
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,556
Have you been
too much on your own?

1062
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,234
So many things unclear

1063
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,752
So many things unknown

1064
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,914
In my life

1065
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,509
There are so many
questions and answers

1066
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,273
That somehow seem wrong

1067
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,599
In my life

1068
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,149
There are times when
I catch in the silence

1069
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,437
The sigh of a faraway song

1070
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,830
And it sings

1071
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,232
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach

1072
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,632
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me

1073
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,476
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?

1074
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,952
Does he see what I see?
Does he feel what I feel?

1075
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,676
In my life

1076
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,998
I'm no longer alone

1077
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,470
Now the love in
my life is so near

1078
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,634
Find me now

1079
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,031
Find me here

1080
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,311
Dear Cosette

1081
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,040
You're such a lonely child

1082
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,716
How pensive,
how sad you seem to me

1083
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,511
Believe me,
were it within my power

1084
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,872
I'd fill each passing hour

1085
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,830
How quiet it must be,
I can see

1086
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,039
With only me for company

1087
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,668
There's so little I know
that I'm longing to know

1088
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,673
Of the man that you were
in a time long ago

1089
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,789
Please, Cosette.

1090
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,634
There's so little you say
of the life you have known

1091
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,349
Why you keep to yourself
Why you're always alone

1092
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,557
So dark
So dark and deep

1093
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,351
The secrets that you keep

1094
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,871
In my life

1095
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,715
Please forgive what I say
You are loving
and gentle and good

1096
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,556
But Papa, dear Papa

1097
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,474
In your eyes I am
still like that child
who was lost in a wood

1098
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,878
No more words

1099
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,796
No more words
It's a time that is dead

1100
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,436
There are words

1101
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,070
That are better unheard
Better unsaid

1102
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,550
In my life

1103
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,396
I'm no longer a child
and I yearn for
the truth that you know

1104
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,074
Of the years, years ago

1105
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,230
You will learn

1106
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,234
Truth is given by God
to us all in our time

1107
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,793
In our turn

1108
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,592
In my life

1109
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,470
She has burst like
the music of angels
The light of the sun

1110
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,115
And my life seems to stop
as if something is over

1111
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,669
And something
has scarcely begun!

1112
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,475
Eponine, you're the friend
who has brought me here

1113
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,791
Thanks to you
I'm at one with the gods

1114
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,269
And heaven is near!

1115
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,274
And I soar through
a world that is new
That is free

1116
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,469
Every word that he says
is a dagger in me

1117
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,149
In my life

1118
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,955
There's been no one
like him anywhere

1119
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,556
Anywhere, where he is

1120
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,834
If he asked, I'd be his

1121
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,796
In my life

1122
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,834
There is someone
who touches my life

1123
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,311
Waiting near

1124
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,073
Waiting here

1125
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,510
A heart full of love

1126
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:02,671
A heart full of song

1127
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,035
I'm doing everything
all wrong

1128
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:10,591
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name

1129
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,030
Dear mademoiselle

1130
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,790
Won't you say?

1131
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,269
Will you tell?

1132
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,070
A heart full of love

1133
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,797
No fear, no regret

1134
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,633
My name is Marius Pontmercy

1135
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,235
And mine's Cosette

1136
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,837
Cosette,
I don't know what to say

1137
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,194
Then make no sound

1138
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,316
I am lost

1139
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,599
I am found

1140
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,150
A heart full of love

1141
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,515
He was never mine to lose

1142
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,752
A heart full of you

1143
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,632
A single look
and then I knew

1144
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,518
Why regret
what could not be?

1145
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,989
I knew it, too

1146
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,948
These are words
he'll never say

1147
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,669
Not to me

1148
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,796
From today

1149
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,396
Not to me
Not for me

1150
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,515
Every day

1151
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,590
His heart full of love

1152
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,076
For it isn 't a dream

1153
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,596
He will never feel this way

1154
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,070
Not a dream after all

1155
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,279
Cosette?

1156
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,829
Cosette,
what are you doing?

1157
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,875
I told you to stay inside.

1158
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,870
Who is this hussy?

1159
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,713
It's your brat Eponine!
Don't you know your own kid?

1160
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,633
Why's she hanging
about here?

1161
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,519
Eponine, get on home
You're not needed in this

1162
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,990
We're enough here
without you

1163
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,670
I know this house,
I tell you

1164
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,038
There's nothing here for you

1165
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,749
Just the old man and the girl

1166
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,196
They live ordinary lives

1167
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,510
Don 't interfere
You've got some gall

1168
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,796
Take care, young miss
You've got a lot to say

1169
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,190
I'm gonna scream!
I'm gonna warn them here!

1170
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,437
One little scream
and you'll regret it
for a year!

1171
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,548
My God, Cosette!

1172
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,233
You wait, my girl!
You'll rue this night!

1173
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,197
I'll make you scream!

1174
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,679
You'll scream all right!

1175
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,193
Police!

1176
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,671
Must be Javert

1177
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,235
He's found my cover at last

1178
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,753
I've got to get Cosette away

1179
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,115
We'll go to our apartment
at Rue de l'Homme Arm,
it's safer there.

1180
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,191
Then I'll arrange
our passage to England.
No.

1181
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,112
Hurry, Cosette!
Prepare to leave
Say no more

1182
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,759
Tonight we'll away

1183
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,751
Please, Papa, we can't!
Hurry, Cosette!

1184
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,275
It's time to
close another door
and live another day!

1185
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,708
Get dressed,
we're leaving. Now!

1186
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,154
Please, no!

1187
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,032
On my own

1188
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,637
Pretending he's beside me

1189
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,952
All alone

1190
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,272
I walk with him till morning

1191
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,549
Without him

1192
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,508
I feel his arms around me

1193
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:24,276
And when I lose my way
I close my eyes

1194
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,279
And he has found me

1195
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,430
In the rain

1196
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,469
The pavement
shines like silver

1197
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,630
All the lights

1198
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,475
Are misty in the river

1199
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:53,674
In the darkness the trees
are full of starlight

1200
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:59,312
And all I see is him and me
forever and forever

1201
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,390
And I know

1202
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,190
It's only in my mind

1203
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,273
That I'm talking to myself

1204
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,229
And not to him

1205
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:25,317
And although
I know that he is blind

1206
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,915
Still I say

1207
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,113
There's a way for us

1208
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,231
I love him

1209
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,188
But when the night is over

1210
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,349
He is gone,
the river's just a river

1211
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,275
Without him
the world around me changes

1212
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,193
The trees are bare
and everywhere

1213
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,158
the streets are
full of strangers

1214
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,675
I love him

1215
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,356
But every day I'm learning

1216
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:12,471
All my life
I've only been pretending

1217
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:18,280
Without me,
his world will go on turning

1218
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,193
A world that's
full of happiness

1219
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:27,833
That I have never known

1220
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,396
I love him

1221
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,952
I love him

1222
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,757
I love him

1223
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:58,071
But only on my own

1224
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,593
One day more

1225
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,116
Another day,
another destiny

1226
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,636
This never-ending
road to Calvary

1227
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,669
These men who seem
to know my crime will
surely come a second time

1228
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,829
One day more

1229
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,469
I did not live until today

1230
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,477
How can I live
when we are parted?

1231
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,634
One day more

1232
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,476
Tomorrow
you'll be worlds away

1233
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:52,110
And yet with you
my world has started

1234
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,597
One more day all on my own

1235
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,633
Will we ever meet again?

1236
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,957
One more day
with him not caring

1237
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,192
I was born
to be with you

1238
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,158
What a life
I might have known

1239
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,676
And I swear
I will be true

1240
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:21,117
But he never saw me there

1241
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,239
One more day
before the storm

1242
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,233
Do I follow
where she goes?

1243
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,994
At the barricades
of freedom!

1244
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,833
Shall I join
my brothers there?

1245
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,679
When our ranks
begin to form

1246
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,189
Do I stay and do I dare?

1247
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,916
Will you take
your place with me?

1248
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,469
The time is now!

1249
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:49,673
The day is here!

1250
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,034
One day more!

1251
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:56,593
One day more to revolution
We will nip it in the bud

1252
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,955
We'll be ready
for these schoolboys

1253
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,996
They will wet themselves
with blood!

1254
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,229
One day more!

1255
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,549
Watch 'em run amuck

1256
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,869
Catch 'em as they fall

1257
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,759
Never know your luck
when there's a free-for-all

1258
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,194
Here's a little dip

1259
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,548
There a little touch

1260
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,314
Most of them are goners
So they won 't miss much!

1261
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,153
One day
to a new beginning

1262
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,153
Raise the flag
of freedom high!

1263
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,599
Every man will be a king!

1264
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,559
There's a new world
for the winning!

1265
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,149
There's a new world to be won

1266
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,471
Do you hear the people sing?

1267
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,915
My place is here!

1268
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,595
I fight with you!

1269
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,358
One day more!

1270
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,914
We will join
these people's heroes

1271
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,439
We will follow
where they go

1272
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,788
One more day all on my own

1273
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,838
We will learn
their little secrets

1274
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,194
We will know
the things they know

1275
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,469
One day more!

1276
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,993
Tomorrow
you'll be worlds away

1277
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,473
One more day
to revolution

1278
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,834
What a life
I might have known

1279
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,995
We will nip it
in the bud

1280
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,308
And yet with you
my world has started

1281
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,714
We'll be ready
for these schoolboys

1282
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,319
Tomorrow
will be far away

1283
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,998
Tomorrow
is the judgment day

1284
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,878
Tomorrow we'll discover

1285
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,670
What our God in heaven
has in store

1286
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,308
One more dawn!

1287
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,072
One more day!

1288
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:25,157
One day more!

1289
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,478
Do you hear the people sing

1290
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,792
Singing the song of angry men?

1291
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:03,475
It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again

1292
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,757
When the beating of your heart

1293
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,037
Echoes
the beating of the drums

1294
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:15,598
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!

1295
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,518
Will you join in our crusade?

1296
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,355
Who will be strong
and stand with me?

1297
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,516
Beyond the barricade
Is there a world
you long to see?

1298
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,198
Then join in the fight

1299
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,069
That will give you
the right to be free!

1300
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,677
Do you hear the people sing

1301
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,479
Singing the song of angry men?

1302
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:47,476
It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again!

1303
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:53,073
When the beating of
your heart echoes
the beating of the drums

1304
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:59,750
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!

1305
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,119
Will you give all you can give

1306
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,118
So that our banner
may advance?

1307
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,034
Some will fall
and some will live

1308
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,909
Will you stand up
and take your chance?

1309
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:18,240
The blood of the martyrs
will water
the meadows of France!

1310
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,239
Do you hear the people sing

1311
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,233
Singing the song of angry men?

1312
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:30,072
It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again!

1313
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:36,116
When the beating of
your heart echoes
the beating of the drums

1314
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:42,719
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!

1315
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,911
Halt!

1316
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,113
Draw!

1317
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,919
She's an innocent woman!

1318
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,308
Murderer!

1319
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,989
Come here, you!

1320
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,433
Charge!

1321
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,949
Push them to the right.

1322
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,472
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, monsieur.

1323
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,989
To the barricades!

1324
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,278
Vive la France!

1325
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,519
Get to the barricade!

1326
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,914
Come on!

1327
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,999
Get down! Get down!

1328
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,078
Go, go, go!

1329
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,273
Get off your arse!
It's begun!

1330
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,118
The barricade!

1331
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,997
Sorry, madame. Thank you.
What are you doing?

1332
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,598
We need as much furniture
as you can throw down!

1333
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,671
Throw everything you have!

1334
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,474
Below!

1335
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,199
Watch yourself,
watch yourself.

1336
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,314
Go on, boys!

1337
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:20,955
No!

1338
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,795
Thank you, madame.

1339
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,869
I need a volunteer!

1340
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,999
Someone who can
find out their plan
and when they will attack.

1341
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,638
I can find out the truth

1342
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,470
I know their ways

1343
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,474
Fought their wars
Served my time

1344
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,789
In the days
Of my youth

1345
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,390
See? The people unite!

1346
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,278
I pray you're right

1347
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,631
Dogs will bark

1348
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,392
Fleas will bite!

1349
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,671
They will do what is right

1350
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:06,068
Red,
the blood of angry men!

1351
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,074
Black,
the dark of ages past!

1352
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:14,074
Red, a world about to dawn!

1353
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:20,998
Black,
the night that ends at last!

1354
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,753
He's back!

1355
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,595
Listen, my friends
I have done as I said

1356
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,433
I have been to their lines
I have counted each man

1357
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,433
I will tell what I can

1358
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,269
Better beware
They have armies to spare

1359
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,714
And our danger is real

1360
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,077
We will need all our cunning
to bring them to heel

1361
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,639
Have faith!

1362
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,635
If you know what
their movements are
we'll spoil their game

1363
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,268
There are ways that
a people can fight

1364
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:55,632
We shall overcome
their power!

1365
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,478
I have overheard their plans

1366
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,949
There will be
no attack tonight

1367
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,116
They intend to starve you out

1368
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,748
Before they
start a proper fight

1369
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,030
Concentrate their force

1370
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,316
Hit us when it's light

1371
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,708
Liar!

1372
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,673
Good evening, dear Inspector
Lovely evening, my dear!

1373
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,395
I know this man, my friends
His name's Inspector Javert!

1374
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,473
So don 't believe
a word he says because
none of it's true

1375
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:29,150
This only goes to show
what little people can do

1376
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,239
Bravo, little Gavroche
You're the top of the class

1377
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,193
So what are we going to do
with this snake in the grass?

1378
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,079
Take this man and throw him
in the tavern in there

1379
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,152
The people will
decide your fate,
Inspector Javert

1380
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,432
Shoot me now
or shoot me later

1381
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,795
Every schoolboy
to his sport!

1382
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,269
Death to each
and every traitor!

1383
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,709
I renounce
your people's court!

1384
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,389
We keep looking forward!

1385
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,074
To your positions.

1386
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,275
Move!

1387
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,550
Now, hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

1388
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,039
Front rank, kneel!

1389
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,269
Save your gunpowder.

1390
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,634
Take aim!

1391
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,355
Get down.

1392
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,674
Who's there?

1393
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,958
French Revolution!

1394
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,669
Fire!

1395
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,114
They're coming!

1396
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,599
They're coming
over the barricades!

1397
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,113
Get back!

1398
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,754
Marius! No!

1399
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,352
Marius!
What are you doing?

1400
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,429
Get down!

1401
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,919
Marius, watch out!

1402
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,115
Get down!

1403
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,794
No!

1404
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,479
Fall back!

1405
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,791
Fall back,
or I blow the barricade!

1406
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,279
Blow it up and
take yourself with it!

1407
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,314
Christ!

1408
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,111
And myself with it.

1409
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,311
Back! Back!

1410
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,395
Man the barricade!

1411
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,549
What were you thinking,
Marius?

1412
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,629
You could have
gotten us all killed!

1413
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,039
Marius,
you saved us all.

1414
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,479
My life is not
yours to risk!

1415
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,232
Eponine.
What are you doing?

1416
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,833
I kept it from you.

1417
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,992
It's from Cosette.

1418
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,036
The rain's
going to ruin the powder.

1419
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:08,435
I'm sorry.

1420
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,952
What have you done?

1421
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,714
'Ponine.

1422
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:27,831
Don't you fret,
Monsieur Marius

1423
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:34,231
I don't feel any pain

1424
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:39,671
A little fall of rain

1425
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:44,354
Can hardly hurt me now

1426
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,713
You're here

1427
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,715
That's all I need to know

1428
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:00,192
And you will keep me safe

1429
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:04,194
And you will keep me close

1430
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:11,639
And rain will
make the flowers grow

1431
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:17,713
But you will live, 'Ponine
Dear God above!

1432
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,597
If I could close your wounds
with words of love

1433
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,312
Just hold me now,
and let it be

1434
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,111
Shelter me, comfort me

1435
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,840
Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine

1436
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,554
So don't you fret,
Monsieur Marius

1437
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,469
You won 't feel any pain
I don 't feel any pain

1438
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,593
A little fall of rain
A little fall of rain

1439
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,594
Can hardly hurt you now
Can hardly hurt me now

1440
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,431
I'm here

1441
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,390
That's all I need to know

1442
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,719
And I will stay with you
And you will keep me safe

1443
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,675
Till you are sleeping
And you will keep me close

1444
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,429
And rain

1445
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:21,072
Will make the flowers

1446
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,839
Grow

1447
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,835
Gavroche, will you
do something for me?

1448
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,673
Anything. Without you,
I'd have bitten the dust.

1449
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,679
Letter from the barricade.

1450
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,114
From the barricade?

1451
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,714
I'll take it.

1452
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,197
Something for me,
something for you.
Who needs charity?

1453
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,035
Boy.

1454
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,398
You stay away from there,
you understand?

1455
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,672
"Dearest Cosette,
you have entered my soul

1456
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,552
"And soon you will be gone

1457
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,272
"Can it be only
a day since we met
and the world was reborn?

1458
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:44,713
"If I should fall
in the battle to come
let this be my goodbye

1459
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,950
"Now that I know
that you love...

1460
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,959
"You love me as well
It is harder to die

1461
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:59,033
"I pray that God
will bring me home
to be with you

1462
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,038
"Pray for your Marius

1463
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:05,516
"He prays for you"

1464
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,434
Oh, God.

1465
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,077
This is the day
that most I feared

1466
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,153
Now a young man has appeared
to change my life

1467
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,155
This Marius will take away
the treasure of my
autumn days to be his wife

1468
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,558
But he could die tonight

1469
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,759
I must find this boy

1470
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,471
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1471
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,518
I come here
as a volunteer.

1472
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,638
You see...

1473
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,430
You see that
prisoner over there?

1474
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,039
A volunteer like you!

1475
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,792
A spy who calls
himself Javert!

1476
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,757
He's going to get it, too!

1477
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,354
Get in there.
Get inside.

1478
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,317
Don't kill him.
I know him.

1479
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,035
Enemy marksman!

1480
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,633
On the roof!
On the roof!

1481
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,109
On the roof!

1482
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,077
Where are they?
Where are they?

1483
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,349
We'll take the left.

1484
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,469
We'll
take the right.

1485
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,914
Eyes forward!

1486
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,475
Eyes to the roofs,
eyes to the roofs.

1487
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,789
Thank you, monsieur.

1488
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,790
Give me
no thanks, monsieur
There's something you can do

1489
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,831
If it is in my power

1490
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:38,479
Give me the spy Javert!
Let me take care of him

1491
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,953
Do what you have to do
The man belongs to you

1492
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,230
No. Enjolras.

1493
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,154
We meet again

1494
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,915
You've hungered for
this all your life

1495
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,511
Take your revenge

1496
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,312
How right you
should kill with a knife

1497
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,312
Get out of here

1498
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,709
Don't understand

1499
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,394
Clear out of here

1500
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:46,319
Once a thief, forever a thief

1501
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:50,235
What you want,
you always steal

1502
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,119
You would trade
your life for mine

1503
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,552
Yes, Valjean, you want a deal

1504
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,234
Shoot me now for all I care!

1505
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:05,032
If you let me go, beware!
You'll still answer to Javert!

1506
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,789
You are wrong and
always have been wrong

1507
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:19,118
I'm a man
no worse than any man

1508
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,276
And you are free and
there are no conditions

1509
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,591
No bargains or petitions

1510
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:32,633
There's nothing
that I blame you for

1511
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,514
You've done your duty,
nothing more

1512
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,789
If I come
out of this alive...

1513
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,509
You will find me at
Rue de l'Homme Arm, number 5

1514
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,434
No doubt our paths
will cross again.

1515
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,552
Courfeyrac,
you take the watch

1516
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,995
They may attack
before it's light

1517
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,149
Everybody, keep the faith

1518
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:35,756
For certain as
our banner flies
We are not alone

1519
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,436
The people too must rise

1520
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,714
Marius.

1521
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,749
Rest.

1522
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,953
Drink with me

1523
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,635
To days gone by!

1524
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:05,031
To the life
that used to be

1525
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,270
At the shrine of friendship
never say die

1526
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:15,999
Let the wine of friendship
never run dry

1527
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:23,111
Here's to you
and here's to me!

1528
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:31,032
Do I care if I should die
now she goes across the sea?

1529
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:36,553
Life without Cosette
means nothing at all

1530
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,316
Would you weep, Cosette,
if I were to fall?

1531
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:46,472
Would you weep, Cosette

1532
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,750
For me?

1533
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:12,272
God on high

1534
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:17,594
Hear my prayer

1535
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:24,752
In my need

1536
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,960
You have always been there

1537
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,312
He is young

1538
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:44,873
He's afraid

1539
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:50,389
Let him rest

1540
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,031
Heaven blessed

1541
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:07,118
Bring him home

1542
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,948
Bring him home

1543
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,276
He's like the son
I might have known

1544
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,157
If God had granted me a son

1545
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:28,955
The summers die
One by one

1546
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:34,148
How soon they fly
On and on

1547
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:38,755
And I am old

1548
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,675
And will be gone

1549
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:53,271
Bring him peace

1550
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,709
Bring him joy

1551
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:04,678
He is young

1552
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,518
He is only a boy

1553
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,558
You can take

1554
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,555
You can give

1555
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:28,714
Let him be

1556
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:34,034
Let him live

1557
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:39,149
If I die

1558
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:44,394
Let me die

1559
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:51,471
Let him live

1560
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:58,473
Bring him home

1561
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:04,957
Bring him home

1562
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:12,270
Bring him

1563
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:19,357
Home!

1564
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,634
Enjolras, the rain has
damaged the gunpowder.

1565
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:36,914
We're low on ammunition.

1566
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,399
We're the only
barricade left.

1567
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,314
What?

1568
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,399
We're the only ones left.

1569
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,479
The people
have not stirred

1570
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,595
We are abandoned by those
who still live in fear

1571
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,637
Let us not waste lives

1572
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,150
Let all who wish to

1573
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,070
Go from here

1574
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,760
Do you hear
the people sing

1575
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,958
Singing the song of angry men?

1576
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:19,638
It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again

1577
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:25,831
When the beating
of your heart echoes
the beating of the drums

1578
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,199
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!

1579
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,673
Enjolras,
we need more ammunition.

1580
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,354
I'm going into the colonnade.
There are dead bodies there,
dry ammunition.

1581
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,509
The gunpowder
is wet through.

1582
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,875
Let's round it up.
Let's get everything out here.

1583
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,710
Little people know
when little people fight

1584
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,829
We may look easy pickings

1585
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,632
Gavroche.

1586
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,318
But we've got some bite!

1587
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,879
Come here.

1588
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,790
So never kick a dog
because he's just a pup

1589
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,635
Gavroche!

1590
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,670
We'll fight like 20 armies
and we won't give up

1591
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,272
Gavroche! Gavroche,
what are you doing?

1592
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,271
Someone pull him back!

1593
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,953
You dirty bastard!

1594
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:22,030
So you'd better
run for cover

1595
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,189
When the pup...

1596
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:26,275
Grows...

1597
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,753
You at the barricades,
listen to this!

1598
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:54,152
The people of Paris
sleep in their beds!

1599
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,993
You have no chance

1600
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:59,511
No chance at all

1601
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,594
Why throw your lives away?

1602
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,595
Let us die facing our foes

1603
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:16,549
Make them bleed while we can

1604
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,638
Make them pay through the nose

1605
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,472
Make them pay for every man

1606
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:25,634
Let others rise
to take our place

1607
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,909
Until the Earth is free!

1608
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,793
Cannons!

1609
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,632
Quick as you can! Come on!

1610
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,233
Look lively!

1611
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,709
Far right first.

1612
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,034
Wait for it!

1613
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,559
Fire!

1614
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,834
Marius.

1615
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,109
They're bringing
in replacements.

1616
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,269
Second cannon!

1617
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,748
Fire!

1618
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:55,915
Fire!

1619
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,309
Take aim!

1620
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,589
Fire!

1621
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:00,669
Take cover, boy!

1622
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,032
There's more men!
There's more men, Enjolras!

1623
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,274
Cannons ready!

1624
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,429
Fire!

1625
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,113
Cannons ready!

1626
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,950
And fire!

1627
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,793
Advance!

1628
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,759
Watch out!

1629
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,909
Please!

1630
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,394
Open the door!

1631
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,559
Please!

1632
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,710
We need the door!
We need to barricade
the door!

1633
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,232
Marius! Marius!

1634
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,554
Take positions!

1635
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,234
Steady, lads!

1636
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,349
-  Go!
-  They're coming!

1637
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,239
Thank you!

1638
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:46,750
Long live the revolution!

1639
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,553
Here's a pretty ring.

1640
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:54,069
Oh.

1641
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,549
Hello.

1642
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,758
You're alive! I saved you!

1643
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:02,393
You!

1644
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,751
How do I get out of here?
It's that way!

1645
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,751
All the way down
and to the left!

1646
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:58,113
It's you, Javert
I knew you
wouldn't wait too long

1647
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,949
The faithful servant
at his post once more

1648
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,671
This man's done no wrong
He needs a doctor's care

1649
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:09,714
I warned you
I would not give in!
I won 't be swayed!

1650
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,150
Another hour yet
Then I'm yours

1651
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,313
All our debts are paid

1652
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,078
The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice!

1653
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,834
Come, time is running short!

1654
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,276
Look down, Javert

1655
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:31,910
He's standing in his grave!

1656
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,076
One more step
and you die.

1657
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,235
Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?

1658
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,079
To have me caught in a trap
and choose to let me go free?

1659
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:27,078
It was his hour at last
to put a seal on my fate

1660
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,794
Wipe out the past
and wash me
clean off the slate

1661
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:32,428
All it would take was
a flick of his knife

1662
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:36,559
Vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life!

1663
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,755
Damned if I live in
the debt of a thief!

1664
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:43,269
Damned if I yield at
the end of the chase!

1665
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,874
I am the law and
the law is not mocked!

1666
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,076
I'll spit his pity
right back in his face!

1667
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:50,754
There is nothing on Earth
that we share!

1668
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:54,071
It is either
Valjean or Javert!

1669
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:03,233
And my thoughts fly apart

1670
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,518
Can this man be believed?

1671
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,917
Shall his sins be forgiven?

1672
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,836
Shall his crimes be reprieved?

1673
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,511
And must I now begin to doubt

1674
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,515
Who never doubted
all these years?

1675
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:36,554
My heart is stone
and still it trembles

1676
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:42,431
The world I have known
is lost in shadow

1677
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:47,435
Is he from heaven
or from hell?

1678
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:51,309
And does he know

1679
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:55,473
That granting me my life today

1680
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:07,314
This man has
killed me even so?

1681
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:17,311
I am reaching but I fall

1682
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,631
And the stars
are black and cold

1683
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:29,839
As I stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold

1684
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,992
I'll escape now
from that world

1685
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:35,919
From the world of Jean Valjean

1686
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:39,271
There is nowhere I can turn

1687
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:45,549
There is no way to go on

1688
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:19,036
Did you see them
going off to fight?

1689
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:23,519
Children of the barricade
who didn 't last the night

1690
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:28,870
Did you see them
lying where they died?

1691
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:33,795
Someone used to cradle them
and kiss them when they cried

1692
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:38,875
Did you see them
lying side by side?

1693
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:51,749
There's a grief
that can't be spoken

1694
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,151
There's a pain goes on and on

1695
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,754
Empty chairs at empty tables

1696
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,830
Now my friends
are dead and gone

1697
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,112
Here they talked of revolution

1698
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,635
Here it was they lit the flame

1699
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,555
Here they sang about tomorrow

1700
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:38,478
And tomorrow never came

1701
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:46,189
From the table in the corner

1702
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:52,080
They could see a world reborn

1703
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,711
And they rose
with voices ringing

1704
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:01,874
And I can hear them now

1705
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:06,996
The very words
that they have sung

1706
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:12,988
Became their last communion

1707
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:19,996
On this lonely barricade

1708
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,719
At dawn

1709
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:31,276
Oh, my friends,
my friends, forgive me

1710
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:37,070
That I live and you are gone

1711
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:40,789
There's a grief
that can 't be spoken

1712
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:47,275
There's a pain goes on and on

1713
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,632
Phantom faces at the windows

1714
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:56,510
Phantom shadows on the floor

1715
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:00,116
Empty chairs at empty tables

1716
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:06,236
Where my friends
will meet no more

1717
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:10,712
Oh, my friends, my friends

1718
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:14,596
Don 't ask me

1719
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:19,515
What your sacrifice was for

1720
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:24,478
Empty chairs at empty tables

1721
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:32,069
Where my friends will sing

1722
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:38,276
No more

1723
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,798
Every day you walk
with stronger step

1724
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,748
You walk with longer step
The worst is over

1725
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:11,036
Don 't think about it,
Marius!

1726
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:13,270
With all the years
ahead of us!

1727
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:15,550
I will never go away

1728
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:19,838
And we will be
together every day

1729
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,399
Every day

1730
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:28,271
We'll remember that night

1731
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:31,318
And the vow that we made

1732
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,357
A heart full of love

1733
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,194
She was never mine to keep

1734
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,278
A night full of you

1735
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:45,437
She is youthful, she is free

1736
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,391
The words are old
but always true

1737
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,991
Cosette, Cosette!

1738
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,513
Love is
the garden of the young

1739
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:53,033
I saw you waiting
and I knew

1740
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:54,997
Thank God you are here

1741
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,872
Waiting for you

1742
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,029
Let it be

1743
02:14:58,160 --> 02:14:59,195
At your feet

1744
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,152
Thank God you are home

1745
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,112
Let it be

1746
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,630
A heart full of love

1747
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,150
And it wasn't a dream

1748
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:15,076
This I give you this day

1749
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,636
Not a dream after all

1750
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:28,557
Monsieur, this is a day
I never can forget

1751
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:33,633
Is gratitude enough
for giving me Cosette?

1752
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:38,472
Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass

1753
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,916
But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call

1754
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:46,073
A father to us both
A father to us all

1755
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:48,316
Not another word, my son

1756
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:54,713
There's something now
that must be done

1757
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,595
There lived a man
whose name was Jean Valjean

1758
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,839
He stole some bread to
save his sister's son

1759
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:20,076
For 19 winters
he served his time

1760
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,274
In sweat
he washed away his crime

1761
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,432
Years ago

1762
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,437
He broke parole and
lived a life apart

1763
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,993
How could he tell Cosette
and break her heart?

1764
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,149
Marius...

1765
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,111
It's for Cosette
this must be faced

1766
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,919
If he is caught,
she is disgraced

1767
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,152
The time has come
to journey on

1768
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:55,075
And from this day
he must be gone

1769
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,316
Who am I?

1770
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,557
Who am I?

1771
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:09,391
You're Jean Valjean

1772
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,996
Monsieur, you cannot leave

1773
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:17,075
Whatever I tell
my beloved Cosette
She will never believe

1774
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:21,473
Tell her
I've gone on a journey
A long way away

1775
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:25,553
Tell her my heart was
too full for farewells

1776
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:27,790
It is better this way

1777
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:30,599
Promise me, monsieur
Cosette will never know

1778
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,995
What I have spoken
Why I must go

1779
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:39,075
For the sake of Cosette

1780
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,479
It must be so

1781
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,552
Thank you, Marius.

1782
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:04,079
Where's he gone
without a word?

1783
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:06,879
That wouldn't be
his way to go

1784
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,951
Why so sudden,
why so strange?

1785
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,192
Oh, did he say
how long he'll be gone?

1786
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:18,356
All he asked for me to say
is he's on a journey far away

1787
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,558
He can't leave us now

1788
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:24,074
How he breaks my heart

1789
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:30,190
And we will never be apart

1790
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,032
I promise you.

1791
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:18,394
The Baron and
Baroness du Thnard.

1792
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,638
Go away, Thenardier!

1793
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,756
Do you think
I don't know who you are?

1794
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,350
He's not fooled
Told you so

1795
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:33,478
Show monsieur
what you've come here to show

1796
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:36,279
Tell the boy what you know

1797
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:40,679
Pity to disturb you
at a feast like this

1798
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:44,630
But 500 francs
surely wouldn't come amiss

1799
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,234
In God's name,
say what you have to say

1800
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:49,710
He speaks
You pay!

1801
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:54,511
What I saw, clear as light

1802
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:58,309
Jean Valjean in
the sewers one night

1803
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,359
Had this corpse on his back

1804
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,830
Some boy he had killed
in a vicious attack

1805
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:09,395
I was there, never fear

1806
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:13,792
I even found me
this fine souvenir

1807
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:17,198
I know this
This is mine

1808
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,071
This is surely
some heavenly sign

1809
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,837
Then it's true
Then I'm right

1810
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:29,677
Jean Valjean was
my savior that night

1811
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:34,748
Jean Valjean, the old con

1812
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,071
You pay up
or I'll say where he's gone

1813
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:39,554
Where is he?

1814
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:45,749
Where is he?

1815
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:47,034
The convent!

1816
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,752
Cosette, come with me.
Come with me.

1817
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,239
Watch the buggers dance
Watch 'em till they drop!

1818
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,960
Keep your wits about you
and you'll stand on top!

1819
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,913
Masters of the land
Always get our share

1820
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,469
Clear away the barricades
and we're still there

1821
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:05,439
We know where
the wind is blowing

1822
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,511
Money is the stuff we smell

1823
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,514
And when we're rich
as Croesus

1824
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,716
Jesus! Won't
we see you all in hell!

1825
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:17,999
How dare you!

1826
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:32,349
Alone I wait in the shadows

1827
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,912
I count the hours
until I sleep

1828
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:43,437
I dreamed a dream
Cosette stood by

1829
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,236
It made her weep
to know I die

1830
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,555
Alone at the end of the day

1831
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,189
Upon this wedding night
I pray

1832
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:09,119
Take these children, my Lord,
to Thy embrace

1833
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:17,317
And show them grace

1834
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:26,751
God on high

1835
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,718
Hear my prayer

1836
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:40,030
Take me now

1837
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,670
To Thy care

1838
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:53,478
Where You are

1839
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:58,630
Let me be

1840
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:05,997
Take me now

1841
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,157
Take me there

1842
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:18,549
Bring me home

1843
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,479
Bring me home

1844
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,990
Monsieur,
I bless your name

1845
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,230
I am ready, Fantine

1846
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,278
Monsieur,
lay down your burden

1847
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:43,915
At the end of my days

1848
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,916
You raised my child in love

1849
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,433
She's the best of my life

1850
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:55,510
And you will be with God

1851
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,715
Oh!

1852
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:01,152
Oh...

1853
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,233
Fantine.

1854
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:08,278
Papa, Papa,
I do not understand

1855
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:11,477
Are you all right?
Why did you go away?

1856
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:17,472
Cosette, my child!
Am I forgiven now?

1857
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,074
Thank God, thank God
I've lived to see this day!

1858
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:24,119
It's you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool

1859
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:28,956
It's you who must
forgive a thankless man

1860
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:33,235
It's thanks to you
that I am living

1861
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:37,269
And again I lay down
my life at your feet

1862
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:41,030
Cosette,
your father is a saint

1863
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:47,357
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade

1864
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:50,155
Carried like a babe

1865
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:56,390
And brought me home to you

1866
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:10,237
Now you are here

1867
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:17,553
Again beside me

1868
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:25,319
Now I can die in peace

1869
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:31,230
For now my life is blessed

1870
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:37,872
You will live, Papa
You're going to live

1871
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:42,591
It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye

1872
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:49,990
Yes, Cosette,
forbid me now to die!

1873
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:53,471
I'll obey

1874
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:58,509
I will try

1875
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,434
On this page

1876
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,673
I write my last confession

1877
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:16,876
Read it well
when I at last am sleeping

1878
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,236
It's the story

1879
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,988
Of one who turned from hating

1880
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:31,031
A man who only learned to love

1881
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:33,870
When you were in his keeping

1882
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,792
I know it, Papa.

1883
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,197
Come with me

1884
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:44,035
Where chains
will never bind you

1885
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,634
I am ready, Fantine.

1886
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:53,797
All your grief
At last, at last behind you

1887
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:58,597
Lord in heaven

1888
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:03,515
Look down on him in mercy

1889
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:06,512
Forgive me all my trespasses

1890
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:09,910
And take me to Your glory

1891
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:15,991
Take my hand

1892
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:21,916
I'll lead you to salvation

1893
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,072
Take my love

1894
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:29,830
For love is everlasting

1895
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:34,432
And remember

1896
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:39,157
The truth that once was spoken

1897
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,792
To love another person

1898
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:49,479
Is to see the face of God

1899
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:57,154
Do you hear
the people sing lost in
the valley of the night?

1900
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:03,674
It is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light

1901
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,712
For the wretched of the Earth

1902
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,792
There is a flame
that never dies

1903
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:15,830
Even the darkest night
will end and
the sun will rise

1904
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,072
We will live again in freedom

1905
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:22,590
In the garden of the Lord

1906
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:28,471
We will walk
behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword

1907
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:34,239
The chain will be broken
and all men will
have their reward!

1908
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:37,358
Will you join
in our crusade?

1909
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:40,353
Who will be strong
and stand with me?

1910
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:43,432
Somewhere beyond
the barricade

1911
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:46,279
Is there a world
you long to see?

1912
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:49,352
Do you hear the people sing?

1913
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:52,393
Say, do you hear
the distant drums?

1914
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:58,510
It is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes!

1915
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:01,353
Will you join
in our crusade?

1916
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:03,829
Who will be strong
and stand with me?

1917
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,992
Somewhere beyond
the barricade

1918
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:10,117
Is there a world
you long to see?

1919
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:13,113
Do you hear the people sing?

1920
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:16,312
Say, do you hear
the distant drums?

1921
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:22,635
It is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes!

1922
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:38,037
Tomorrow comes!

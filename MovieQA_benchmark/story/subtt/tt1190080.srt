00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,396

00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:36,866


3
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:39,337


4
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,843
MEGA DENG COOPER MINE, INDIA

5
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:39,479
Watch out, watch out!

6
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,021
Welcome my friend!

7
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,444
- Great to see you!
- Glad you made it

8
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:49,926
This can't be Ajit.

9
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,490
He's a little man
already. Unbelievable.

10
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,935
I hope you're
hungry, Adrian.

11
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,111
I'm famished. How
are you, Aparna?

12
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,752
I made that fish
curry you love.

13
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,352
I can't wait.

14
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:01,528
She gets more beautiful
every time I see her,

15
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:02,323
Why is that?

16
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:03,453
Strange, isn't it?

17
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,052
But her fish curry
is still awful.

18
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,949
You were mysterious
on the phone.

19
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,393
Why didn't you attend
the conference?

20
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,031
I will show you, Adrian, sir.

21
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,161
Satnam. Stop sir-ing me.

22
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,371
How deep do we need to go?

23
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,147
11.000 feet.

24
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,790
Searched all over India
for this dig.

25
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,996
Used to be the deepest
copper mine in the world.

26
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:37,052
Remember my brother Gurdeep?
He's a student now.

27
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,825
Namaste, Dr Helmsley, sir.

28
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,881
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

29
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,421
Just don't pour too much, okay?

30
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,487
How do you work
in this heat?

31
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,932
You've come on a good
day, my friend.

32
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,144
Sometimes it can
be 120° F.

33
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:57,140
I want you to meet
Dr Lokesh?

34
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,646
Fellow of Quantum Physics
at the University in Chennai

35
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,282
- Namaste
- Dr Helmsley

36
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,486
So, what are we
looking at?

37
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,670
These neutrinos are
acting normally. No mass,

38
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,787
no electrical charge.
They pass through

39
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,480
ordinary matter
almost undisturbed.

40
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,727
Your message said
the count doubled

41
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,771
after the last
solar eruptions.

42
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,406
That was last week.

43
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,664
But this happened
two days ago.

44
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,625
The biggest solar eruptions
in human history.

45
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,682
Causing the highest
neutrino count

46
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:32,836
we've ever recorded.

47
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,359
My God.

48
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,429
That's not what
worries me, Adrian.

49
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,725
For the first time ever

50
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,741
the neutrinos are causing
a physical reaction

51
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,578
That's impossible.

52
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:55,118
Ah!

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,288
That feels very good!

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,550
Please, follow me.

55
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:05,947
You wont believe this.

56
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,080
This water tank goes
down another 6000 feet.

57
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:14,911
It looks like the neutrinos
coming from the sun

58
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,831
have mutated into a new
kind of nuclear particle.

59
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,262
They're heating up
the Earth's core.

60
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,268
And suddenly act
like microwaves.

61
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,492
Ladies and gentlemen.
As promised:

62
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,433
No speech!

63
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,747
Just a "thank you".

64
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,492
Because tonight, with your
extraordinary generosity,

65
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,802
we have raised
1.7 million dollars.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,718
It's okay.

67
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,999
- I work for the White House.
- I don't care who you are, sir

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,677
This is a black tie event.

69
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,189
Scotty!

70
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:10,550
Hey, Adrian, I thought
you were in India

71
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:11,451
What's going on?

72
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,103
- I need your jacket
- What?

73
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,076
I gotta speak
to Anheuser

74
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,475
- I don't wanna give...
- Give me your damn jacket!

75
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:17,002
Take it, please.

76
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,709
Easy! That's a
600 dollar jacket.

77
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,978
Mr Anheuser?

78
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:29,939
Mr Anheuser?

79
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,435
I need to talk to you.

80
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:36,617
Do I know you?

81
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,430
Sorry sir, my name is
Dr Adrian Helmsley

82
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,838
I'm a deputy geologist
at the Office of

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,942
Science and Technology Policy

84
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,538
Excuse me, fellows.

85
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,370
You know that this
is a fund-raiser,

86
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,648
not a frat party, right?

87
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,216
It's extremely
important, sir.

88
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,956
It always is. Here is
what I want you to do:

89
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,790
Make an appointment
or even better,

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,399
Have your boss bring it up at
the quarterly science briefing

91
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,709
There's a good plan.

92
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,007
I just traveled 20 straight
hours to get here, sir.

93
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,074
I haven't slept in two days.
You need to read this, sir.

94
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:05,764
You need to read it now!

95
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:14,173
Let me guess.
National geology crisis?

96
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:16,637
Excuse me.

97
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,079
Who do you
report to?

98
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,567
Lico Vasos

99
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,098
Not anymore.

100
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:42,577
Al, bring the car around.

101
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,494
You may wish you
took a shower.

102
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,117
You're about to meet
the president.

103
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:48,553
What's going on?

104
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,675
Get that to the office.

105
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,322
G8 SUMMIT, BRITISH COLUMBIA

106
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:20,639
Good morning.

107
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,319
I would like to
meet privately

108
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,119
with my fellow
heads of state.

109
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,332
Mr <name> wishes to have
his interpreters present.

110
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,487
Mr President,
I can assure you

111
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,880
Your English is more
than sufficient

112
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,060
for what I have to say.

113
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,709
Mr President.

114
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,555
Six months ago, I was
made aware of a

115
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:08,798
situation so devastating
that at first

116
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,869
I refused to believe it.

117
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,968
However,

118
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,518
through the concerted efforts

119
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,120
of our brightest scientists,

120
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:21,797
we have confirmed its validity.

121
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:29,213
The world
as we know it

122
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,480
will soon come
to an end.

123
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,850
CHO MING VALLEY, TIBET

124
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,229
This dam project will create
many new jobs.

125
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:48,411
The Party and Country will
assist in your re-location.

126
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,221
Grandma, give me
your hand.

127
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,591
But where are
they taking us?

128
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,062
It'll be alright.

129
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:00,903
Brother!

130
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,796
Grandma, I will send you money.

131
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,038
Who can write?

132
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,667
Who can read?

133
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,783
Who can weld?

134
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,018
EMPIRE GRAND HOTEL, LONDON

135
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:47,980
Has His Highness
had an opportunity

136
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:50,071
to study the dossier?

137
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:58,548
You must understand
I have a big family, Mr...

138
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,092
Isaacs.

139
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:03,441
One billion dollars is
a lot of money.

140
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,562
I'm afraid the amount
is in Euros,

141
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,219
Your Highness.

142
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:13,642
MUSÉE DU LOUVRE, PARIS

143
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:27,278
I put a lot of faith into
your organization.

144
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,097
It's a perfect
replica, Roland.

145
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,604
There are too many
fanatics out there

146
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,003
that could damage her.

147
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,788
Just think about
the beautiful

148
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,649
Buddha statues they
blew up in Afghanistan.

149
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,870
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections

150
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,982
from the British Museum
and Hermitage.

151
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,431
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away.

152
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:01,812
Hidden, in some bunker
in Switzerland.

153
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:05,087
Perfectly safe, Roland.

154
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,580
Only infrared analysis can
reveal the difference.

155
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,490
But it's still a fake.

156
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:29,051
<i>This mass suicide was actually
discovered by a documentary crew</i>

157
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,424
<i>here in the ancient
Mayan city of Takal</i>

158
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,448
<i>Now the victims,
and we've seen many,</i>

159
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,751
<i>are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiche calender,</i>

160
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,933
<i>which predicts the
end of time to occur</i>

161
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,447
<i>on the 21st December
of this year,</i>

162
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,804
<i>due to the suns
destructive forces.</i>

163
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:43,643
<i>Thank you, Mark.</i>

164
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:46,682
<i>Strangely enough, scientific
records do support the fact</i>

165
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:49,182
<i>that we are heading for
the biggest solar climax</i>

166
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,178
<i>in recorded history.</i>

167
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,099
MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA

168
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,947
<i>Many people believe
that the Mayan Calender</i>

169
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>predicts that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...</i>

170
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,542
I'm a dead man.

171
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:20,082
Hey, Kate, I'm practically
on the freeway right now.

172
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:23,572
Yes, I'm rolling towards
you as we speak.

173
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:27,073
Would you relax?
I'll be there any second.

174
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,969
You know it's a vacation and not
a doctors appointment, right?

175
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,585
It's supposed to be fun.

176
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,647
You remember fun,
don't you Kate?

177
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:35,568
Do you remember
where you were

178
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,886
when it stopped
being fun for you?

179
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,034
Got it.

180
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,754
Bug spray?

181
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,782
Oh yeah, cause it's mosquito
season in Yellowstone.

182
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:53,673
I got a whole bunch. I gotta go,
I'm in a bad reception area.

183
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,546
Woah, man. Would you
look at that?

184
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,279
Sick

185
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,347
Merrill, I told you.

186
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:15,284
We have to move back
to Wisconsin.

187
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:18,921
<i>These little mini-quakes are
really getting on my nerves, Randy.</i>

188
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,448
<i>Come on, a little surface crack, you're
not gonna be inconvenienced by that</i>

189
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,807
<i>Surface cracks, I've got a
plastic surgeon for that</i>

190
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:27,144
<i>No kidding. Thank God for
those shake-proof coffee mugs.</i>

191
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:29,059
<i>They show the true nature
of us Californians.</i>

192
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,874
<i>We'll not bow to these little
inconvenient things like surface quakes.</i>

193
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,738
<i>Do you have a funny mini-quake
story and want to share it?</i>

194
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:35,698
<i>Call Lisa & Randy at 555...</i>

195
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,792
- Hi daddy!
- Hi baby

196
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,076
- How are you sweety?
- Good

197
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:52,067
Jackson, what is this?
- Please don't call me that.

198
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,663
I'm your dad.

199
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,313
Taking them camping
in a limo?

200
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:01,065
Okay, great. What happened
to your temp job?

201
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,720
Better hours, more
time to write.

202
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,317
What about sleeping, have you
been doing that lately?

203
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:08,304
I've said it a
thousand times.

204
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,969
No lipo on Fridays.
It's too messy.

205
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,134
Hold on.

206
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,388
- Morning Jackson.
- Hi

207
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,240
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

208
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,642
Have a nice trip. Remember,
watch out for the bears.

209
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:20,740
- Bye, Gordon
- Love you, Honey.

210
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,595
Bye

211
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,586
Okay, so...
- You tell him.

212
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:25,958
Tell me what?

213
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,721
She needs to put these on every
night before she goes to sleep.

214
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:29,924
Still?

215
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,040
Yes. Your 7 year old daughter
still wets her bed.

216
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,918
Maybe that's something
you should know.

217
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:35,889
- Love you
- Love you, Mom.

218
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,245
- Hey
- You okay?

219
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,161
They really were looking forward
to spending some time with you

220
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:43,793
I know.

221
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,753
So don't be on your
computer all the time.

222
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:46,869
Got it.

223
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,399
Love you!

224
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:59,145
- So this time we'll hit Japan.
- So?

225
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,243
Now you can visit
your boy, Will.

226
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,587
Afternoon, ladies!

227
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,600
Are you even
listening to me?

228
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,697
Unfortunately I am, Harry.

229
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,698
I heard from Audrey you're
a grandpa now.

230
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,903
Would you mind keeping your
nose out of my family?

231
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:15,105
You're cramping my style, baby.
There we are.

232
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:18,317
So he married a Japanese girl,
how's that the end of the world?

233
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,463
Come on Tony, you should
at least go see him.

234
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,510
- You see your boy?
- Not as much as I'd like

235
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,881
DC is a long way, but
at least we talk

236
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,551
About what?

237
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,750
Life.
And how short it is.

238
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:55,530
What the hell was that?

239
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:04,091
- Hello?
- Laura?

240
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,739
<i>Laura, can you hear me?</i>

241
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,273
Roland, is that you?

242
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:09,807
<i>Laura, they lied to us.</i>

243
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:11,947
I've arranged a press
conference for tomorrow.

244
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:14,288
I will tell everyone the truth
about what is going on.

245
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,932
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

246
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,025
The art you collected

247
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,006
is not in the Alps.

248
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:21,461
<i>Those tunnels are empty.</i>

249
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:22,808
<i>I have proof!</i>

250
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,163
Laura, can you hear me?

251
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,256
I'm losing you, Roland.

252
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:30,880
Laura, can you hear me?

253
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,334
YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL PARK

254
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,092
- I liked that song.
- We lost it.

255
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:05,336
<i>...the west coast with
all those surface cracks,</i>

256
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:08,887
<i>I told myself: Charlie,
get your stupid ass</i>

257
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,080
<i>to Yellowstone.</i>

258
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,692
<i>I don't want to miss all the
fun when it finally goes.</i>

259
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>Let me tell you, there's been
government people flying</i>

260
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,325
<i>in and out all morning and
trust me, they do not look happy.</i>

261
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,829
Always remember, folks...
- It's weird.

262
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,996
Can you believe
he said that?

263
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,086
What are the odds?

264
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,503
We're not seeing the soil
liquefaction we'd expect

265
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,306
or any evidence of
fracture propagation

266
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,476
within the tectonic plates.

267
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,413
- English, doctor.
- The seismic activity

268
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,452
on the west coast is
not caused by tect...

269
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,957
regular earth quakes.
And these surface cracks

270
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,017
have nothing to do
with shifting fault lines.

271
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,117
Are you suggesting this
could be the beginning

272
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,528
of the Joline operation?
- Dr Helmsley is flying to

273
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,508
Yellowstone to collect
more data, sir.

274
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:53,720
We've been following the schedule
you established, Mr Helmsley.

275
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,922
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

276
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:58,941
Now you're telling me we
have to throw it out?

277
00:17:58,942 --> 00:17:59,902
Yes, sir.

278
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,710
I was wrong.

279
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,023
Do you know how
many times I've heard

280
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,023
those words
in this office?

281
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:12,630
Zero.

282
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:15,288
Did you see this?

283
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,557
I'm sorry Mr President.
She insisted.

284
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:19,306
It's all over the news.

285
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:25,332
<i>We are learning more about
this deadly car explosion,</i>

286
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,554
<i>The director of the French
National Museum</i>

287
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>was scheduled to hold
a press conference at</i>

288
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,791
<i>the Louvre this morning.</i>

289
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,751
<i>Coincidentally, his death took
place in the same Paris tunnel</i>

290
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:37,910
<i>where Princess Diana
died in 1997.</i>

291
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:41,080
<i>We are continuing to
follow this story...</i>

292
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:45,907
Laura, I don't believe
you've met Dr Helmsley.

293
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,099
I just talked to him Dad,
and he told me...

294
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:49,936
the organization I
work for is a sham.

295
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:51,663
Why would he say that?

296
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:58,351
You look just like your mother
when you get upset.

297
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:02,058
- Did I ever tell you that?
- Every time I get upset.

298
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,433
Daddy, a man was killed.

299
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:09,682
Honey. Please sit down.

300
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,150
Only a dozen people
in this administration

301
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:22,973
know what I'm
about to tell you.

302
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,421
Dad, what's going on?

303
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,973
An unprecedented
international endeavor

304
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:32,934
is under way.

305
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:38,311
At this point 46 nations
are invested in this thing.

306
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,188
Laura's a smart girl.
She'll understand.

307
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,020
That thing in Paris.

308
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,965
We're not involved in
any of that, are we?

309
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,824
"We"?
Who the hell is "we"?

310
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:47,325
What are you
talking about?

311
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:49,960
What we need to do is
focus on this time line.

312
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,497
So when do we let
the country know?

313
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:54,375
What do you mean?
- The people, sir.

314
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,335
They need to know.

315
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,731
Well of course
they do. Listen.

316
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,127
Your job is to figure out when
this is all gonna fall apart.

317
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:06,523
My job is to figure out how to
retain some type of government

318
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:07,981
after it falls apart.

319
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:09,853
Until then we don't have
time for anything

320
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,896
except those jobs. Okay?

321
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,553
Call me when you have
any news from Yellowstone.

322
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,355
- Cute girl, huh?
- Sir?

323
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:21,133
The First Daughter,
I saw you looking at her.

324
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,298
- I wasn't looking at her
- Better move fast kid

325
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,356
The end is near.

326
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,598
Your chopper's ready.

327
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,118
They're waiting
on the south lawn.

328
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:37,526
- Daddy, where are we going?
- This special place I know

329
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,185
Actually, it's a place
where your mom and I

330
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,294
used to hang out a lot.

331
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,628
I don't want to know
where you and mom had sex.

332
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,913
I'm not ready
for that, Jackson.

333
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,817
Stop calling me that,
it's creeping me out.

334
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,387
What's wrong with "Dad"?

335
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,493
Daddy, look at this.

336
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,021
That wasn't here before.

337
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,904
What did I do?

338
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,988
Go get your hat.

339
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,180
Can't you see the signs?

340
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,708
There used to be
a lake here.

341
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,963
Doesn't look much
of a lake to me.

342
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:18,356
I know. The whole
damn thing's gone.

343
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,290
Come on, let's
check it out.

344
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,680
Great.

345
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:46,748
Subjects have now
entered hot zone.

346
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,693
What is that?

347
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,991
It's the U.S. Army.

348
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,980
All manner of
government vehicle

349
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:17,005
are converging
on subjects.

350
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:18,613
You're in a
restricted area, sir.

351
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:20,220
We need you and your
family to come with us.

352
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,727
Right. Okay, we're gonna
go with these guys.

353
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:24,934
That'll be fun, huh?

354
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:31,746
This is wild.
This is really wild.

355
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,286
This is unbelievable.
2700° C at 40.000 feet?

356
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,494
I know, it sounds
completely implausible.

357
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:51,894
Nonetheless, we're noticing
an increase of almost 0.5%

358
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:54,001
- Per day?
- No.

359
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:54,817
Per hour.

360
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:58,296
Dr Helmsley, we arrested
some tourists in the hot zone.

361
00:22:58,297 --> 00:22:59,318
I'll take care of it.

362
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,685
Let's get Satnam on the
communications link.

363
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,172
Cross reference the data.

364
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:07,969
It's a national park, there's
not supposed to be fences.

365
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,198
What's going on here?

366
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,221
We're geologists.

367
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,119
You usually go digging
with machine guns?

368
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,365
Major, I'll take care
of this, thank you.

369
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,695
So what happened
to the lake?

370
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,635
Well that's what we're
trying to find out.

371
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:22,362
We think the entire area
has become unstable.

372
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:24,847
I think you should take
your kids and leave, Mr...

373
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,092
Curtis.

374
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,061
You're not by any chance
the Jackson Curtis who

375
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,961
wrote "Farewell Atlantis"?

376
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:35,330
The very same.

377
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,121
It's actually dedicated
to my mom.

378
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:44,838
I read a couple of your
short stories in college.

379
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,663
Your father is a
very talented man

380
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:48,257
Listen up.

381
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:49,890
It's amazing.
I'm reading your book.

382
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:51,917
I'm around day 300,
the shuttle has just

383
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,144
lost communication
with Earth.

384
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,050
You're one of the lucky
few who bought it.

385
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,390
- I didn't buy it.
- No?

386
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,328
My dad gave
it to me.

387
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:02,662
Let me ask
you something.

388
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:04,798
Do you think those people
would behave so selflessly

389
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,101
knowing that their own
lives were at stake?

390
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,935
I hope so.

391
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:12,144
The critics said I was naive,
an unabashed optimist,

392
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:13,788
but what do
they know, right?

393
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,169
It was a great pleasure
meeting you.

394
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,880
Mayor, could you escort
these good people

395
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,887
to the camp
grounds, please.

396
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:21,847
This is yours.

397
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,282
- Thank you
- Yes, sir.

398
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:25,297
- Take care.
- Okay

399
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,324
He was very nice.

400
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,587
You're just saying that
cause you like my book.

401
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:35,336
Looks like that boy
of yours is gonna be

402
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,653
smarter than any of us.

403
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:42,759
What's wrong?

404
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,723
I sent Satnam the
temperature readings.

405
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:47,944
My colleagues in Argentina
and Ontario have

406
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,769
almost identical data.

407
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:52,058
It's so hot here we've
had to seal off the mine.

408
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,126
Did you double check
the numbers?

409
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:54,749
I triple checked,
my friend.

410
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,163
I wish we were
wrong, but

411
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,124
we're not.

412
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:02,413
The Earth's crust is
destabilizing.

413
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:07,723
It's too early.

414
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,387
Adrian. You have to
begin the evacuation.

415
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,817
My God.

416
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:18,310
All our scientific advances,
our fancy machines,

417
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:21,275
the Mayans saw this coming
thousands of years ago.

418
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,357
I thought we'd
have more time.

419
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,123
Okay.

420
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,488
Okay, I want you to
pack up your family.

421
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:46,083
I'm gonna arrange
an airlift from Delhi.

422
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,028
Thank you my friend.

423
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,919
And good luck.

424
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,802
Ajit.

425
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,778
We are going
on a big ship.

426
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,501
Wait. Wait, wait.

427
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:16,984
Sorry. One question.

428
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:22,549
What did the government
guys say to you?

429
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:27,625
They don't like us going
over their fences and

430
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:31,008
that the whole area
back there is unstable.

431
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:31,929
"Unstable"?

432
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,233
They said "unstable"?

433
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,682
That's funny.

434
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:39,644
Let's go.

435
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:45,548
"Unstable".

436
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,963
It's not just
Yellowstone, sir.

437
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:54,625
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity

438
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,464
in hot zones across
the globe.

439
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,979
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Adrian?

440
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,845
Once we give these orders,
there's no going back.

441
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:05,897
I'm afraid there's
no longer any doubt.

442
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:07,711
We have to save
what we can.

443
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,171
And we have
to move now!

444
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:42,664
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

445
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:44,736
I'm gonna get that
spray tomorrow.

446
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:47,472
They just like you because
your blood's so sweet.

447
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,935
Dad, you said you wouldn't
work on your book.

448
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,825
What?

449
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,875
I'm not, I'm doing
something else.

450
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:59,096
Okay.

451
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:03,829
Did you really need
all these hats?

452
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,153
Where are
your pull-ups?

453
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:06,682
I have them on.

454
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:14,884
Who gave you this?
Mommy?

455
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,704
No, Gordon gave it to me
for my birthday.

456
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,344
A cell phone is something
we got to talk about

457
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:21,305
As a family.

458
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,721
What family?

459
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:30,896
It hurts my feelings when
you say stuff like that.

460
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,078
Go away.

461
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:42,844
Adults get hurt feelings too.

462
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:00,807
No way.

463
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:02,003
<i>...tell the truth.</i>

464
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,031
<i>Thank you, Bill.
What is your question?</i>

465
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:06,734
<i>I wanted to know, where
is all this gonna start?</i>

466
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,961
<i>Well, something like this could
only originate in Hollywood.</i>

467
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:12,440
<i>They have the earth cracking
under their asses already.</i>

468
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,137
<i>Our family believes in the
gospel of the lord Jesus.</i>

469
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:16,453
<i>We have nothing
to fear, Charlie.</i>

470
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,509
Good for you, Bill.
Thanks for calling.

471
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:21,635
This is Charlie Frost
reporting live from

472
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:25,070
Yellowstone National Park,
soon to become the worlds

473
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:29,005
largest active volcano.

474
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,094
I'll be right back, folks.

475
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,356
Do you mind
if I join you?

476
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,605
I wanted to ask
you something.

477
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:40,388
I only got a minute.
Pickle?

478
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,875
I was listening to the broadcast
and I was wondering

479
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:47,424
what exactly is it that's
gonna start in Hollywood?

480
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:51,352
It's the Apocalypse.
End of days.

481
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:54,895
The Judgment Day. The end
of the world, my friend.

482
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:57,653
Christians call it The Rapture,
but the Mayans

483
00:29:57,654 --> 00:29:59,596
knew about it, the Hopis,

484
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:04,263
The I Ching, the Bible.

485
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,039
- Beer?
- Yeah.

486
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,772
So look, I gotta eat.

487
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,452
Why don't you
download my blog?

488
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:15,980
It's free. Of course, we do
appreciate donations.

489
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,584
<i>In ancient times, the Mayan
people were the first</i>

490
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,990
<i>civilization to discover
that this planet had</i>

491
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:24,042
<i>an expiration date.
According to their calender,</i>

492
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,671
<i>in the year 2012 a
cataclysmic event will unfold,</i>

493
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,532
<i>caused by an alignment
of the planets in our solar system</i>

494
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,701
<i>that only happens
every 640.000 years.</i>

495
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,328
<i>Oh, not again.</i>

496
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:40,482
Neat, huh? I did all
the animation myself.

497
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,023
<i>Just imagine the earth
as an orange</i>

498
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,159
You lure them in
with humor.

499
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,499
Then you make
them think.

500
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,802
<i>Our sun will begin to emit such
extreme amounts of radiation,</i>

501
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:54,166
<i>Screw you bastards.</i>

502
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,499
<i>That the core of the earth
will melt at the inside</i>

503
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,460
<i>part of the orange.</i>

504
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,625
<i>Leaving the crust of our
planet free to shift.</i>

505
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:04,019
<i>In 1958 Professor Charles
Hapgood named it:</i>

506
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:04,989
<i>"Earth Crust Displacement"</i>

507
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:08,593
<i>Albert Einstein
did support it.</i>

508
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,241
<i>People will get it all, the
forces of Mother Nature</i>

509
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:14,094
<i>will be so devastating
It will bring an end to</i>

510
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:18,651
<i>this world on winter
Solstice 12-21-12.</i>

511
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,686
<i>Always remember, folks.
You heard it first from</i>

512
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:22,837
<i>Charlie Frost.</i>

513
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:26,486
You'd have to keep a thing
like this under wraps.

514
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:27,996
Just think about it.

515
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:30,884
First, the stock market would go.

516
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:33,153
Then the economy: Boom!

517
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,372
The dollar: Boom!

518
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:36,557
And then pandemonium
in the street.

519
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,342
War, genocide.
Boom Boom Boom!

520
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:43,592
Bullshit. Nobody could keep
that big a secret, Charlie.

521
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,484
Somebody would blow
the whistle

522
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:48,330
An every once in a while,
some poor sucker tries.

523
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,825
Like these guys.
Boom! Boom!

524
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:54,660
Every one of these
guys: Dead! Dead! Dead!

525
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:59,569
Woah, that's
Professor Meyers.

526
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:01,710
He ran the Atlantis
Shuttle Program.

527
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,606
Did you know him?

528
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,638
- Yeah, he helped me out
with research on my book.

529
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,667
Well, that must have been
before his accident.

530
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,416
- Meyers is dead?
- Yeah, two months ago.

531
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:14,787
He was one of my
most avid listeners.

532
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:16,119
He had it all figured out.

533
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,737
Everything the government
was doing, where, why.

534
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,585
He even sent me a map.

535
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:26,480
A map for what, Charlie?
What's the map for?

536
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,624
They're building
space ships, man.

537
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:47,104
Shit, man, I have to go.
I gotta get back to Earth.

538
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:49,805
- Do you have a beer?
- This is my last.

539
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:52,866
- Alright, I really enjoyed
most of this.

540
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:55,695
Thank you so much.

541
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,542
- Guess what, they're
selling seats!

542
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:58,542
- Put me down for three.

543
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,983
- No! Guys like you and me
don't have any chance.

544
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:03,640
You'd have to be Bill Gates
or Rupert Murdoch

545
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,693
or some Russian
billionaire.

546
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,564
Keep it down, my kids
are sleeping.

547
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:13,097
Get them out of Yellowstone.
It's gonna get ugly here.

548
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,705
Why don't we
make a baby?

549
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,054
We're not making a baby
at the supermarket.

550
00:33:23,954 --> 00:33:27,018
Hands off the
merchandise.

551
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:30,198
Honey, woman give me
thousands of dollars

552
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,567
to handle their boobs.
You get it for free.

553
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,119
You always act strange
after he shows up.

554
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,506
I'm not acting strange,
I'm looking for macaroni.

555
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,020
So why did you stick with
him so long anyways?

556
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:02,470
Can we just give
it a rest, please?

557
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:05,950
- He's the father of my children.
- Oh, come on, Kate

558
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,108
You gave up med school so
you could have Noah.

559
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,240
You practically raised him
and Lilly by yourself

560
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:12,380
while he sat glued to a
laptop writing that junk.

561
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,922
It's not junk!
He's published.

562
00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:16,514
Oh, published.
Right, I forgot.

563
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:19,574
422 copies.

564
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:35,672
- Did you see that?
- See what?

565
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,766
Kate, listen, we have to
keep working at this.

566
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,228
Our relationship.

567
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,972
I don't know, Honey, I feel
like there's something

568
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,460
pulling us apart.

569
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:53,809
Grab the pole!
Kate, don't let go!

570
00:34:56,965 --> 00:34:59,489
Do you have anything
for mosquito bites?

571
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,411
Before or after?

572
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:04,903
- I'll get before and after.
- Stop scratching or you're

573
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,409
gonna get it all infected.

574
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:09,282
<i>...and I had to make a quick
stop at the grocery store...</i>

575
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:10,503
It's Mrs Birnbaum

576
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,657
She's my teacher.
She's on TV!

577
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,309
<i>...market which was open
for business at the time</i>

578
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:19,336
<i>but fortunately there are no
fatalities or injuries reported.</i>

579
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:22,411
<i>It really is a miracle
that no one got hurt.</i>

580
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,130
Hello? Hi mom.

581
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:27,811
Did you see what happened
to our supermarket?

582
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,202
She wants us to
come home.

583
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:33,463
Is this even possible?

584
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,652
We worked every
option through the night.

585
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,054
The good news: consensus
is that 4 of the Arks

586
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,793
will be operational in time.

587
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,606
- Only 4? You call
that good news?

588
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,838
- We can save over
400.000 people.

589
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,972
To me, sir, that's nothing
short of a miracle.

590
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:48,351
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now.

591
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:52,056
Thomas. We don't
have a choice.

592
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:55,255
You have got to
convince them.

593
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:01,735
According to the
latest information...

594
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:04,360
- Please continue, Adrian.
- Thank you, sir.

595
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:06,583
The temperature of the
subterranean crust,

596
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:10,637
that is the cement that holds
our landmass in place,

597
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:13,842
Is increasing at a rapid rate
much faster than anticipated.

598
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:16,869
As a result we've observed
extreme polar instability

599
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,577
The magnetic fields
have decreased

600
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:21,353
by more than 80%
in the last 48 hours.

601
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:25,010
<i>How much time do we
have, Dr Helmsley?</i>

602
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,168
Two, maybe three days,
if we're lucky.

603
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:32,782
<i>How can you speak about
luck in such a situation?</i>

604
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:36,648
Apologies, Mr Prime Minister.

605
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,563
I meant no disrespect.

606
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:41,721
I'm afraid the
longer we wait,

607
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,114
the more luck
plays its part.

608
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,849
My friends.

609
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,045
I recommend we
evacuate immediately.

610
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:59,280
If any of you
have objections

611
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,126
Please speak now.

00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:30,742
I feared you would
not come.

619
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:33,047
He needs to concentrate
now. Mr Karpov.

620
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:37,063
You shut up while I talk
to my boy, understand?

621
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:41,184
- Yes, Mr Karpov.
- Good. That is good.

622
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:43,411
Zultan, listen to me.

623
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:46,996
We are fighters,
we never go down.

624
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:50,922
No matter how
hard they hit us.

625
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:57,057
Kill the bastard.

626
00:37:58,248 --> 00:38:03,998

00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:40,230
Yuri!

Okay guys.
Almost home.

Rise and shine.

636
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,362
Alright, you're free.

637
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:19,442

638
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,393
Hi, sweetheart.

640
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:30,833
Hey, buddy boy.

641
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:32,498
Had a good time?

642
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,699
God, I missed you.

643
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,856
- Who wants pancakes?
- Me!

644
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:44,996
Thanks for bringing
them home early.

645
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:45,956
Yeah.

646
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:48,719
Pancakes?

647
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:52,086
Late for work.

648
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:05,324
- Yes, hello?
- Curtis, where are you?

649
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:08,458
- Just back from vacation, sir.
- Good. That is good.

650
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,519
I will send a jet to pick
up Alec and Oleg.

651
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:14,032
Yuri bear. Tell him to bring
the rain coat for Caesar.

652
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:15,476
It's in the Range Rover.

653
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,860
- Curtis?
- Yeah

654
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,722
Get my boys as
fast as you can.

655
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:20,719
I'm hurling towards
you as we speak, sir.

656
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,489
Good. That is good.

657
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:39,826
- Curtis, you're late.
- Good morning to you too.

658
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,891
Be careful with our stuff.

659
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,777
Don't get your dirt
on it. Idiot.

660
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:57,797
Took you a while,
Mr. Curtis.

661
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,447
What's your problem?
Be more careful.

662
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:05,824
He did that
on purpose.

663
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:08,561
Have a safe trip,
you little bastards.

664
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:10,090
Now you're
laughing, Curtis.

665
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,722
But we have tickets
to go on a big ship.

666
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:16,144
We will leave,
and you will die.

- Is this your plane?
- Yeah

00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:53,255
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah

675
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:54,195
I want to rent it, okay?

676
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,135
I'll give anything you want.

00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,655
Here, take this very
expensive watch.

678
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,001
My neighbor gave it
to me when he

679
00:41:58,036 --> 00:41:59,346

be somebody.

Hey. Stop what you're doing.
- Jackson?

00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,664
Listen to me. I've rented
a plane, pack up the kids,

687
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,927
I'm gonna be there
in 5 minutes.

We're gonna have
a regular Saturday.

to remember?

Kate, California
is going down.

693
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,592
- Pack up the kids now!
- They just got back.

God, you sound like
a crazy person.

695

The governor just said
we're fine now.

696
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:39,726
The guy's an actor, he's
reading a script!

697
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,052
When they tell you
not to panic

698
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,954
That's when you run!

699
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:47,007
Will you call me back
when you calm down?

700
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,769
Mommy, why are you
acting so crazy?

701
00:42:52,222 --> 00:42:53,889
Finish your pancakes,
Al Capone.

702
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:58,278
<i>...it seems to me that
the worst is over.</i>

703
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:15,173
Hold Mommy's hands!

704
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,572
Let's go!
- I think it's safer under here!

705
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:25,744
Get in the fucking car!

706
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,434
Come on, kids!

707
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:40,922
Get in. Get in.

708
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:41,884
My hats!

709
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,594
Buckle up!

710
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,574
Sorry.

711
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:14,217
Jackson. Hurry up!
Look behind you!

712
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:16,947
Oh God.

713
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,010
Get out of the way!
- Move it!

714
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,275
Hold on, dear.

715
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,235
Come on,
you old bags!

716
00:44:57,617 --> 00:44:59,148
We gotta get to Santa
Monica Airport.

717
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,342
Take the freeway. It'll
be half the time.

718
00:45:04,393 --> 00:45:05,393
Yeah, right.

719
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,900
We gotta get to the other
side of the freeway.

720
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:44,449
Dad, look!

721
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,586
They've just been upgraded
to a 10.9 by Harvard.

722
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:03,347
What does CalTech
have to say?

723
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,525
The city of Pasadena
was wiped out.

724
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,090
Just a few
minutes ago.

725
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:09,467
This is coming in live
from Coachella Valley

726
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,286
near Joshua Tree.
That huge canyon,

727
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:12,527
It wasn't there
this morning.

728
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:17,351
100 miles further North,
same thing.

729
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,655
The San Andreas Fault
is shifting.

730
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:20,617
Yes.

731
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:23,208
And all major sister
faults in the bay area.

732
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,282
The whole Pacific Plate
is destabilizing.

733
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:36,744
Come on!

734
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:39,239
- Who's that?
- Our pilot.

735
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,543
Dead pilot!

736
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:43,271
Gordon!
You can fly!

737
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,472
I've only had a couple
of lessons in a

738
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,148
single engine
plane only.

739
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,840
- You're the guy!
- No, I'm not the guy!

740
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,036
Trust me!
You're the guy.

741
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:52,148
I'm not being
modest about this!

742
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:53,414
Come on, kids.

743
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,806
Gordon's gonna
get us out of here.

744
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:57,128
That plane has
multiple engines.

745
00:46:58,155 --> 00:46:59,498
Jackson!

746
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:16,003
- T's and P's
- TNP?

747
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:17,541
- What?
- Temperatures and Pressures

748
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,925
- Let's go!
- My preflight check

749
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:20,230
Let him concentrate,
Jackson.

750
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:22,054
He has no experience.

751
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,302
Thank you.

752
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,661
Gordon! Go!

753
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:27,623
Go go go!

754
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,998
We're not there yet.

755
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,208
- Punch it!
- We need 85 knots.

756
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,989
- 80 is good!
- Let's do it.

757
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,338
Okay, we're up.

758
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,217
Lilly, go sit with
your brother.

759
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:07,744
How did you know
this would happen?

760
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:10,719
It's not just California.

761
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,451
The whole damn world
is going to shit.

762
00:49:13,695 --> 00:49:16,382
I met this crazy guy
in Yellowstone

763
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:18,302
But he's been right about
everything so far

764
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,585
He said the government
is building these ships,

765
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:21,673
space ships,
I don't know what,

766
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,295
but something...
- Space ships?

767
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:25,119
Yeah. Places where
we could be safe.

768
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,998
He knows where they
are. He's got a map.

769
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,550
- Jackson...
- Kate, trust me on this.

770
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:34,623
Guys. Look.

771
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:05,523
<i>But it ain't the end
of the world, Buddy.</i>

772
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:08,402
<i>It's only the end
of this song.</i>

773
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:12,144
<i>It's been a gas, been a
flip, been a hell of a trip,</i>

774
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:16,753
<i>But it ain't the end
of the world.</i>

775
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,536
Oh yeah!

776
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:22,512
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You got fans, Tony.

777
00:50:24,528 --> 00:50:26,425
There's a call for you, Harry.
Want me to take a message?

778
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,367
No, thats alright.

779
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:34,608
Yeah, hello?

780
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,007
- Dad?
- Adrian!

781
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,367
Remember I told you
about that dam in China?

782
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:44,302
- Yeah.
- It's happening, Dad.

783
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,777
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew I told you.

784
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:59,278
Nobody's gonna
shoot you, son.

785
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,239
They need you.

786
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,117
The President has
ordered us to

787
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,846
clear out the
White House.

788
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:06,985
About time somebody
cleaned up that mess.

789
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:11,574
Where are you, Dad?

790
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,849
What is the course of
The Genesis right now?

791
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:17,481
It's all good, Adrian.

792
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:20,268
Don't you be worrying
about your old man.

793
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,427
You have more important
things to do now.

794
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,146
You know...

795
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,219
Your mom and I...

796
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:33,259
We had one hell of
a great life, son.

797
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:38,181
And the best
part about that...

798
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:42,842
We had one hell of
a great kid, too.

799
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:51,237
This Genesis is a pretty
big ship, son.

800
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:55,557
Don't you write your
old man off just yet.

801
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,382
Besides...

802
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,202
You know I couldn't
leave Tony alone.

803
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,653
That old fool can't keep
decent time by himself.

804
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:09,199
I love you, Dad.

805
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:18,782
I love you too, son.
God knows I do.

806
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:34,233
Herb. I want a double.

807
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:37,217
- Harry...
- I need a double.

808
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:43,378
Thank you, son.

809
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,512
After 25 year on
the wagon.

810
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:50,405
Are you out
of your mind?

811
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:07,123
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

812
00:53:07,123 --> 00:53:08,588
That's against
regulation!

813
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,134
Anything?

814
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,507
Yeah, there's fuel.
Fill her up, I'm gonna

815
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:17,492
gonna go find Charlie.

816
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,302
Daddy, wait, I wanna
come with you!

817
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:20,838
No Lil! No!

818
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,222
It's alright, I'll take her.
Just fill it up

819
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:23,179
I'll be right back.

820
00:53:23,184 --> 00:53:24,398
Jackson, hurry please!

821
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,865
<i>I'm standing here at
the highest point</i>

822
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:29,666
<i>of what is the rim
of the worlds</i>

823
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:34,110
<i>largest super volcano,
Mount Big Horn.</i>

824
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:36,534
Charlie!

825
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:40,952
<i>I can only hope</i>

826
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:43,735
<i>that all of you have
made your peace</i>

827
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:44,983
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

828
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:46,791
- Let's go back, Daddy.
- No no no

829
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,936
We gotta find Charlie,
cause he's got a map.

830
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:51,081
It's like a secret map.
Like in pirate movies.

831
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:52,403
We gotta work
as a team, okay?

832
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:54,326
- Okay
- Okay, come on.

833
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,492
Call Mom. Tell her we're
gonna be 5 minutes late.

834
00:54:01,956 --> 00:54:04,355
- Noah.
- I need to talk to Mom.

835
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,572
- It's Lilly.
- Sweety, where are you?

836
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:09,295
- Hi Mommy
- Let me speak to Daddy

837
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:12,202
He cant talk right now.
He's driving really fast.

838
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:16,713
- Ouch!
- Lilly?

839
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:18,536
Who is that? Who's
speaking in the car?

840
00:54:18,538 --> 00:54:19,911
He's not in the car,
he's on a mountain

841
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:21,353
waiting for fireworks.

842
00:54:21,786 --> 00:54:23,291
Fireworks?
What fireworks?

843
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,112
Daddy, over there.

844
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:28,806
Good job, Lilly.

845
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,164
Let me talk
to mom now.

846
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:35,768
- Hey! We got him.
- Bring back my child!

847
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,378
You stay here.

848
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,773
I will go talk to
the pirate, okay?

849
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,106
Charlie!

850
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,759
Charlie!

851
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,445
What are you doing?
I thought you were toast.

852
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:00,184
No no no! Where are
the space ships?

853
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:02,271
No way you can
make it there.

854
00:55:02,288 --> 00:55:03,768
We have a plane.
You can come with us.

855
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:05,606
But we gotta leave
right now!

856
00:55:13,489 --> 00:55:16,365
Fly birdies!

857
00:55:18,498 --> 00:55:19,681
Is this your kid?

858
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:22,652
Where's the
god damn map?

859
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:25,954
Where's the map?

860
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,393
- It's in the camper.
- Where in the camper?

861
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,559
Map section. On the
conspiracy shelf.

862
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:33,519
Dewey Decimal System.

863
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:36,954
Between Roswell...

864
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,217
and Marilyn Monroe?

865
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:49,813
It's starting.

866
00:55:57,681 --> 00:55:59,793
You sure you don't
wanna come with me?

867
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:03,655
So beautiful,
I'm gonna stay.

868
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:05,753
Good luck.

869
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,510
This marks

870
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:15,177
The last day of the
United States of America

871
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:20,626
Final hour of all mankind.
As we will be visible from

872
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:24,481
the Milky Way as a tiny
little puff of smoke.

873
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:29,268
I'm watching the Earth
crumble before my eyes.

874
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:32,387
The giant ash cloud

875
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:35,251
created by this
super volcano

876
00:56:35,253 --> 00:56:38,123
will first envelop Vegas,

877
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:39,880
and then St. Louis

878
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:41,710
and then Chicago,

879
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:44,099
and then at long last,

880
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:48,509
Washington D.C. will
have its lights go out.

881
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,259
That guy is crazy,
right Daddy?

882
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,614
Don't think so.

883
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,934
This is ridiculous.

884
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:57,583
It's been over
half an hour.

885
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,929
- The guy is a nut job.
- Stop it.

886
00:57:00,141 --> 00:57:01,849
Noah, give me
the phone again.

887
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:25,831
Daddy. What was that?

888
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,409
Nothing. Nothing.

889
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:31,768
I have goosebumps,
people!

890
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:55,648
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, people.

891
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:58,623
I wish you could be
here with me!

892
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:00,735
Oh, baby!

893
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:04,288
Bring it on!

894
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:06,594
Always remember folks:

895
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:11,679
You heard it first
from Charlie!

896
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,041
Daddy, it's following us!

897
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,108
Get down on the
ground and hold on.

898
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,940
Don't look back.
Just look at me.

899
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,195
- Do I look scared?
- Uhum.

900
00:58:38,186 --> 00:58:40,960
Hold on baby.
Hold on tight.

901
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:48,947
Daddy, we're on fire!

902
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:59,492
There they are!

903
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,925
It's them.
It's them!

904
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,744
Mommy!

905
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:15,289
Shit.

906
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:24,068
Hang on baby.
Hang on

907
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:40,148
Mommy.

908
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,559
- Lil, grab my hand.
- Come on, Noah.

909
00:59:48,574 --> 00:59:49,710
Lilly, you okay?

910
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:57,239
Everybody on? Ready?
- Jackson!

911
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:01,773
Where is he?
What's he doing?

912
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:06,237
No!

913
01:00:14,635 --> 01:00:17,849
- Daddy!
- No!

914
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,119
Hey. We have to go.

915
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:24,463
No, we're not
going anywhere!

916
01:00:24,463 --> 01:00:25,670
Kids, buckle up.
We're leaving.

917
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:28,610
He's my dad.
We're gonna wait!

918
01:00:32,947 --> 01:00:34,402
No!

919
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,829
Daddy!

920
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:44,278
Wait! Wait. Roland,
I see something.

921
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:51,135
It's Daddy!

922
01:00:53,896 --> 01:00:55,570
Slow down!

923
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,242
Jackson, come on!

924
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:01,528
Grab!

925
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:04,076
We're running out
of runway.

926
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,036
For God's sakes, Kate,
pull him up.

927
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,829
Reach for my hand!

928
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:11,242
- Come on!
- Daddy!

929
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,327
Right. Here we go!

930
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,516
Faster. Faster.

931
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,309
Hang on

932
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:45,760
- Go faster!
- I'm trying!

933
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:05,702
Okay. We're good.
We're good.

934
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:11,646
So. Now that you
got your map,

935
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,193
where are we going?

936
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,701
CHINA

937
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:26,461
We're gonna need
a bigger plane.

938
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:34,931
You just said that, Mom.
You just said that.

939
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,992
You don't remember that
you just said that?

940
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,994
That's okay.

941
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:44,492
Listen, Mom. I'll call you
next week, same time.

942
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:49,543
Okay? Take care now.
Take care of yourself.

943
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,246
Sir. I think you
need to see this.

944
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:03,643
I thought they'd give
you an extra ticket, Sir.

945
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:04,603
They did.

946
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:09,081
But my mother is almost 89.
She's in a wheelchair.

947
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,626
And she is easily confused.
And I am confident

948
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,275
that she'll want to
meet her maker

949
01:03:13,275 --> 01:03:16,291
- on her own terms. Okay?
- Yes, sir.

950
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,541
- Who are you bringing?
- Nobody.

951
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:21,867
My ex-wife said she never
wanted to see me again.

952
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:22,990
So be it.

953
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:25,110
We could bring people
that contribute.

954
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,929
<i>...has been damaged by a
series of major earthquakes.</i>

955
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:32,382
<i>The death toll is expected to be
well over 2 million people.</i>

956
01:03:32,413 --> 01:03:35,635
<i>The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.</i>

957
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:41,088
<i>Two 8.5 tremors have left the people
in the street fighting for resources.</i>

958
01:03:41,123 --> 01:03:45,237
<i>In the last hour we received this
video from Globo News, Brazil.</i>

959
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,405
<i>What's happening? My God!</i>

960
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:51,757
<i>The statue of Christ is collapsing!</i>

961
01:03:51,782 --> 01:03:53,918
<i>Fear and chaos have spread
throughout the globe.</i>

962
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:57,625
<i>As in London, where the 30th
Olympic Games has been suspended.</i>

963
01:03:57,653 --> 01:04:00,056
<i>Hundreds of thousands are marching
towards 10 Downing Street</i>

964
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:03,458
<i>demanding a lift of the information
blackout proposed by the Prime Minister.</i>

965
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:05,891
Thousands of calls to the switchboard.
We had to shut it down.

966
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,512
<i>We're receiving reports
from all across the globe.</i>

967
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:12,916
<i>Millions of distraught masses are
gathering in public places everywhere,</i>

968
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:14,393
<i>converging in
desperate prayer.</i>

969
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,664
<i>Preachers of many faiths
have taken their message of</i>

970
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:20,150
<i>the end of the world to
the streets all over the U.S.</i>

971
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,427
<i>Repent.
There is still time.</i>

972
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,574
Kind of gaulling when
you realize the nutbags

973
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,648
with the cardboard signs
had it right the whole time.

974
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:29,007
All these people
out there, sir.

975
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,545
Shouldn't we be issuing
warnings now?

976
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:32,769
Only when the boarding
process is complete.

977
01:04:32,771 --> 01:04:33,583
That's the plan.

978
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:36,300
British Columbia
2010, remember?

979
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,751
Sir, those plans were
drawn up 2 years ago.

980
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:44,262
Okay, everybody out.
Come on, get out.

981
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:46,380
Wasn't it also decided that
people have the right to

982
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,487
fight for their lives,
best way they can?

983
01:04:48,487 --> 01:04:50,927
After we get everyone
on board, Adrian.

984
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,713
I think that's wrong.

985
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,208
Want to tell everyone
they're doomed?

986
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:57,728
There'd be anarchy.

987
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,072
You want to jeopardize the
departure of the president?

988
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:05,530
Our mission is to assure the
continuity of our species.

989
01:05:05,576 --> 01:05:08,789
My question:
Can I count on you?

990
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:10,998
Can I?

991
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,228
What?

992
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:14,217
The Yellowstone Caldera
has erupted, sir.

993
01:05:14,217 --> 01:05:17,849
The ash cloud will reach
Washington in 7 hours.

994
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:20,871
We've got to get away.

995
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:22,505
Where is the
president, Sally?

996
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:24,237
Said he wanted to spend
some time alone.

997
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,057
- I think he's at the chapel.
- He's going to church now?

998
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:32,568
He's praying, sir. Which is
not such a bad idea.

999
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:36,391
Mr. President. I need
to get you on

1000
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,980
Air Force One
immediately.

1001
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,784
Give me a moment
with Adrian.

1002
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:43,996
No disrespect sir, we
do not have time.

1003
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:47,329
Make time.

1004
01:05:57,309 --> 01:06:00,411
Did you ever meet
my wife: Dorothy?

1005
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:04,235
No sir, I never had
that honor.

1006
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:08,079
She was in and out
towards the end

1007
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:10,235
The night before she
passed on, she took

1008
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:12,083
my hand and told me:

1009
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:16,454
"I think you should
have a lottery"

1010
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:21,373
"Everyone should have
a chance to go"

1011
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,512
Maybe that's what we
should have done.

1012
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:32,302
I'll be the last president of
the United States of America.

1013
01:06:32,346 --> 01:06:35,222
Do you know how
that feels, son?

1014
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,327
No one could have saved
the country, sir.

1015
01:06:39,577 --> 01:06:44,559
And I think, I think people
have a right to know.

1016
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:48,255
Don't worry, I'll
take care of that.

1017
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:51,737
Go on now.

1018
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,235
Not without you, sir.

1019
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:58,144
Get on that plane, son.

1020
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:01,527
It's a brave new world
you head into

1021
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:07,123
And a young scientist will
be worth 20 old politicians.

1022
01:07:24,215 --> 01:07:26,516
We should go to my parents
house in the Rockies.

1023
01:07:26,516 --> 01:07:29,382
This isn't one of your crazy
stories, now. Right, Jackson?

1024
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:30,657
How the hell are we going
to make it to China?

1025
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:31,692
Hey, Gordon.

1026
01:07:31,693 --> 01:07:33,876
Without Jackson we wouldn't
have made it out of California.

1027
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:36,266
Noah, please.

1028
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,351
Be careful with
the landing gear!

1029
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:47,503
Easy gringo, I know
what I'm doing.

1030
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:48,474
<i>Attention!</i>

1031
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:50,483
<i>The National Guard
has informed us that an</i>

1032
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:52,581
<i>extremely hazardous
ash cloud is headed for</i>

1033
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:53,637
<i>the city of Las Vegas.</i>

1034
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,347
Where are you going?

1035
01:07:57,427 --> 01:07:58,849
Move! You can't
stay here.

1036
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:01,320
- I have a plane here.
- It's not safe.

1037
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:15,112
So you got positive
confirmation on this?

1038
01:08:15,418 --> 01:08:18,336
Thank you,
I understand.

1039
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:30,344
The President
is not coming.

1040
01:08:34,052 --> 01:08:39,809
So, the Captain won't
abandon his sinking ship.

1041
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:43,422
That's his choice,
and a noble one.

1042
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:45,242
I have also
just learned

1043
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:47,398
that the Vice
President's chopper

1044
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,823
went down in the ash
cloud outside Pittsburgh.

1045
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:54,895
Fortunately, we have
protocols to follow.

1046
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,284
What about the Speaker
of the House?

1047
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:57,902
In this chaos, I have
no idea. Where is he?

1048
01:08:57,903 --> 01:08:59,488
He's the Commander
in Chief now, sir.

1049
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:03,096
This is one flight he
shouldn't be late for.

1050
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,399
Tell the Captain
we're taking off.

1051
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,212
Sir, you don't have
the authority.

1052
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,399
Who got the authority?
You? You got the authority?

1053
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,268
You couldn't even keep
your damn mouth shut.

1054
01:09:10,269 --> 01:09:12,713
You betrayed top secret
information.

1055
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:13,884
What the hell are
you talking about?

1056
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:15,429
You told your father
everything,

1057
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,889
put this entire
plan in jeopardy,

1058
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,362
Good thing for you
the old man could

1059
01:09:18,396 --> 01:09:19,835
keep his mouth shut
better than you.

1060
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,367
Don't look so shocked.

1061
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:22,844
We had to monitor
everybody who knew,

1062
01:09:22,845 --> 01:09:24,654
How do you think we kept
it a secret for so long?

1063
01:09:24,655 --> 01:09:27,257
So you just killed anybody
who tried to talk?

1064
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,836
Anybody who tried to talk
was not just an enemy

1065
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,757
of the state. They were
an enemy of humanity.

1066
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,987
The director of the Louvre
was an enemy of humanity?

1067
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:36,664
After he called a press
conference he was.

1068
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:39,150
Jesus, what did
you think?

1069
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:40,323
We're all just gonna
get on board,

1070
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:42,337
hold hands and
sing Kumbaya?

1071
01:09:43,197 --> 01:09:46,351
Sit down and
buckle up.

1072
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:57,104
Excuse me, is my father
in the Command Center?

1073
01:09:57,127 --> 01:10:00,125
President is on
the line, Dr Wilson.

1074
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:03,134
Thank you.

1075
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,667
Where are you?

1076
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,016
You never would've gotten
on that plane if I told you.

1077
01:10:15,422 --> 01:10:17,466
But you said that
you'd be here

1078
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,019
Darling, listen to me.

1079
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:21,798
Do you understand how
much strength it gives me

1080
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,345
knowing that you
will survive?

1081
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:28,443
The only thing left
to do now,

1082
01:10:28,463 --> 01:10:31,612
is tell the truth
to people.

1083
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:36,234
At least if they know,

1084
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:40,073
families can say
goodbye to each other.

1085
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:44,274
A mother can comfort
her children.

1086
01:10:45,322 --> 01:10:49,157
And a father...

1087
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:52,655
can ask his daughter
for forgiveness.

1088
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,856
Whenever you're ready,
Mr President.

1089
01:11:10,702 --> 01:11:13,469
My fellow Americans

1090
01:11:13,698 --> 01:11:17,340
This will be the last
time I address you.

1091
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:22,984
As you know, catastrophe
has struck our nation.

1092
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:26,266
Has struck the world.

1093
01:11:26,268 --> 01:11:28,436
I wish I could tell you

1094
01:11:28,438 --> 01:11:31,679
we could prevent
the coming destruction.

1095
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:33,492
We cannot.

1096
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,376
Today, none of us
are strangers.

1097
01:11:37,618 --> 01:11:40,849
Today, we are
one family,

1098
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:44,179
stepping into the
darkness together.

1099
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:47,243
We are a nation of
many religions,

1100
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:51,135
but I believe these
words reflect the spirit

1101
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,412
of all our faiths:

1102
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:56,488
"The lord is my
Shepard. I shall... "

1103
01:11:58,306 --> 01:12:01,640
People! Get away from
the doors and windows.

1104
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:04,282
What are we gonna do?
You tell me.

1105
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:07,125
- Dr Silberman?
- Tamara!

1106
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:09,342
What are you
doing here?

1107
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:10,610
She's a patient,
Honey.

1108
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:14,078
Excuse me, I have a
private plane out there.

1109
01:12:14,078 --> 01:12:17,195
Karpov! Yuri!

1110
01:12:17,197 --> 01:12:19,349
You knew. This whole
time you knew.

1111
01:12:19,384 --> 01:12:21,822
You've got a way out of here,
right? You got a plane?

1112
01:12:21,845 --> 01:12:24,350
My family, take us
with you. Please!

1113
01:12:24,368 --> 01:12:26,637
Boss, boss.

1114
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,408
I found us a plane.
An Antonov.

1115
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:29,667
They were just
about to take off,

1116
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:31,146
but the tower
didn't let them.

1117
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:34,287
Can you still fly
that thing?

1118
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:37,426
Sure, Boss, but
I need co-pilot.

1119
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:40,256
Gordon's a pilot.

1120
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:42,070
No, I'm not.

1121
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:44,740
Yes he is. Great pilot.
Let's go.

1122
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:47,429
Good. Let's go!

1123
01:12:47,454 --> 01:12:51,506
Jackson, stop
saying I'm a pilot.

1124
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,640
You can't go out there.
Come back!

1125
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:01,194
Move back, people!

1126
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:09,162
Wow, that's
a big plane.

1127
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:12,085
It's Russian.

1128
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,144
Let's move everybody.
Come on!

1129
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,457
- Gordon, where are you?
- Let's go!

1130
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,663
Up here, Gordon.
Hurry up!

1131
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:27,395
Oh my God.

1132
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:37,831
- Woah, look at these.
- Las Vegas auto show.

1133
01:13:37,841 --> 01:13:40,953
We had VIP tickets
for this.

1134
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:42,279
That's fantastic, let's go.

1135
01:13:42,307 --> 01:13:44,134
Check the main bus
for hydraulics,

1136
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,287
I'll balance the tanks.

1137
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:47,387
What?

1138
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:50,046
Okay, okay.
I'm trying.

1139
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:54,126
Tower to Antonov, what
the hell are you doing?

1140
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:55,086
Shut down immediately.

1141
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:03,898
- Caesar, shh.

1142
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:05,480
When I say "go"

1143
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:07,377
we push all this down
at once, okay?

1144
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:08,938
- Okay.
- Go!

1145
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:12,987
Antonov, abort take-off.
You do not have clearance.

1146
01:14:13,024 --> 01:14:16,570
I repeat, you
must abort.

1147
01:14:21,532 --> 01:14:22,676
What the hell
was that?

1148
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:25,067
I don't know, but
it's not good.

1149
01:14:27,185 --> 01:14:30,319
- Push!
- Pushing! Come on!

1150
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:35,840
We're going down!

1151
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,331
It must be the...
Take over.

1152
01:14:46,364 --> 01:14:49,177
What do you mean,
take over?

1153
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:52,863
- Sasha!
- Relax.

1154
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,514
Now!

1155
01:14:58,948 --> 01:14:59,807
Jesus.

1156
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,421
- Oh God
- I think I got it

1157
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:07,315
- Sasha, now!
- Take a deep breath.

1158
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:09,301
Pull!

1159
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:37,332
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1160
01:15:37,472 --> 01:15:41,164
I think so.

1161
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:51,998
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We're on our way to China.

1162
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:57,324
Good. Very good.

1163
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:06,868
Do not believe in
something simply

1164
01:16:06,868 --> 01:16:09,891
because you have
heard it, Nima.

1165
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:13,604
But great Lama.
Tenzin is my brother.

1166
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,090
He works inside
the big tunnel,

1167
01:16:15,091 --> 01:16:16,931
where the ships
are built.

1168
01:16:19,328 --> 01:16:22,154
But what is there
in your wisdom,

1169
01:16:22,154 --> 01:16:24,479
great Lama,
if Tenzin is right?

1170
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,686
What if our world is
indeed coming to and end?

1171
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:39,854
It is full, great Rinpoche.

1172
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,413
Like this cup,

1173
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:52,213
you are full of opinions and
speculations.

1174
01:16:52,577 --> 01:16:54,560
To see the light
of wisdom,

1175
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:58,771
You first must
empty your cup.

1176
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:16,000
Be careful with
the clutch...

1177
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,668
It tends to slip.

1178
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,304
Grandpa, Nima is here!

1179
01:17:39,337 --> 01:17:41,092
Grandma, I got a message
from Tenzin...

1180
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:43,097
He want us to meet
him in Cho Ming

1181
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:44,057
at the work camp.

1182
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:48,043
He says he can get us onto
the ships he's working on.

1183
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:49,865
What are you
talking about?

1184
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:52,345
Tenzin works
on the dam.

1185
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:56,221
Grandma...

1186
01:17:56,867 --> 01:18:00,166
...the dam is a ship.
The government lied to us.

1187
01:18:00,863 --> 01:18:02,722
There will be a big flood!

1188
01:18:03,372 --> 01:18:04,993
We must pack up
right away.

1189
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:07,926
Nima? Who gave
you a truck?

1190
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:11,774
We took a trip on the
Liam Song ferry once

1191
01:18:11,898 --> 01:18:14,521
Grandpa threw up
the whole way.

1192
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:17,345
Let's eat first.

1193
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:25,481
Hey, look, the new Bentley!
Our father had one on order.

1194
01:18:25,903 --> 01:18:27,814
He was supposed to
get it next year.

1195
01:18:27,814 --> 01:18:30,640
But then he canceled it.
Because of the ships.

1196
01:18:31,314 --> 01:18:33,359
How many cars does
your family have?

1197
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:36,376
My mom's boyfriend
has a Porsche.

1198
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:39,530
Our parents are
divorced too.

1199
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,282
Found a hat.

1200
01:18:43,573 --> 01:18:45,596
She has a thing
for hats.

1201
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:47,873
I was just like
that at her age.

1202
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,157
They made me
feel safe.

1203
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:54,069
So, how did you meet
Dr Silberman?

1204
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:57,399
As you can see not the
same way you did.

1205
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:02,560
My boyfriend asked me
to get them done

1206
01:19:02,702 --> 01:19:04,528
But he's not
your husband?

1207
01:19:04,899 --> 01:19:06,492
We are not married.

1208
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,623
And probably
never will be.

1209
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,625
For the boys.

1210
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,827
They seem to like
each other.

1211
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:27,931
Yeah, I guess.

1212
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:32,128
Tell me, Mr Karpov,
how much did you pay?

1213
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:36,600
One billion Euro.
Per seat.

1214
01:19:37,984 --> 01:19:40,582
That's disgusting
- Oh yeah?

1215
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:45,356
You know, Curtis, I wasn't
always a businessman.

1216
01:19:45,466 --> 01:19:47,650
I am a boxer.

1217
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,662
Was my only playing
when I was boy

1218
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:52,645
back in Murmansk.
And my coach,

1219
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,451
his name was also Yuri.
He always said:

1220
01:19:57,485 --> 01:20:00,935
"If someone wants
to beat you...

1221
01:20:00,935 --> 01:20:03,707
...he has to
kill you first"

1222
01:20:06,681 --> 01:20:09,649
That's very nice.

1223
01:20:10,114 --> 01:20:12,704
But tell me, what
would you have done

1224
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:15,592
if you were rich
like me?

1225
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:18,728
Look, they are
wonderful children.

1226
01:20:20,122 --> 01:20:23,313
OK guys. The plan is
to refill in Hawaii,

1227
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:25,460
so sit down and
buckle up.

1228
01:20:25,461 --> 01:20:28,588
Gordon and I
will do the rest.

1229
01:20:29,932 --> 01:20:31,557
Oh God.

1230
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,773
Go get the guys.

1231
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:42,353
Guys, there's a...
You might wanna...

1232
01:20:58,052 --> 01:21:02,600
- What is that?
- The state of Hawaii

1233
01:21:03,023 --> 01:21:06,983
Not good. That is
not good.

1234
01:21:11,594 --> 01:21:13,378
How much fuel do
we have left?

1235
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,514
Not enough.

1236
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:16,734
We have to make a
water landing

1237
01:21:16,734 --> 01:21:18,631
Somewhere in
South China sea.

1238
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,773
Great, at least we won't
need a landing gear.

1239
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:24,802
- What about it?
- We lost it all, in Vegas.

1240
01:21:34,871 --> 01:21:36,923
Dr Wilson,
may I come in?

1241
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,850
I'm not very good
company, I'm afraid.

1242
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:43,823
- Doctor...
- Please, call me Adrian.

1243
01:21:49,157 --> 01:21:51,585
All those people
we left behind.

1244
01:21:51,952 --> 01:21:54,649
They don't stand
a chance, do they?

1245
01:21:55,797 --> 01:21:58,661
I believe that nature
will choose for itself,

1246
01:21:58,662 --> 01:22:01,746
from itself, what
will survive.

1247
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:06,228
Just like you, preserving
those great artworks.

1248
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:08,899
Our culture is our
soul, and that's not

1249
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,387
dying tonight.

1250
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:14,576
Come on, I contributed
to this cover up.

1251
01:22:14,577 --> 01:22:17,853
The Da Vinci, Picasso,
they're in.

1252
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:21,036
But if you're some nobody
you don't stand a chance.

1253
01:22:21,711 --> 01:22:24,041
It's not necessarily true.

1254
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:28,548
Did you ever hear of a writer
called Jackson Curtis?

1255
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,652
Wrote a book,
"Farewell Atlantis".

1256
01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:32,993
What do you think the
chances are of an

1257
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:35,938
unknown writer who
barely sold 500 copies

1258
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:38,063
making it aboard
this plane?

1259
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,564
- I don't understand
- I mean call it chance

1260
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:44,222
or faith or nature,
doesn't matter

1261
01:22:44,224 --> 01:22:48,121
This book is part of our
legacy now. Why?

1262
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,997
Because I'm reading it.

1263
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:56,746
Dr Helmsley, please report
to the situation room.

1264
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:10,109
Who is it?

1265
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,983
<i>- Hello, I'm sorry.
Who is this?</i>

1266
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,252
This is Yoko Delgado.

1267
01:23:15,253 --> 01:23:17,903
Do you want to
speak to my daddy?

1268
01:23:20,326 --> 01:23:21,729
Yes, please.

1269
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,198
<i>Who should I
say is calling?</i>

1270
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:32,467
- Tell him, its his father.
- You're my grandpa?

1271
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,012
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1272
01:23:37,061 --> 01:23:40,274
Daddy, grandpa
is on the phone.

1273
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:42,454
Mr President, Sir.

1274
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:52,497
- What's the matter, sweety?
- She can't find her daddy.

1275
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:58,992
Why don't you two get
comfy on that couch?

1276
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,498
I'll find your daddy.

1277
01:25:09,587 --> 01:25:11,435
Who can help me with
missing persons?

1278
01:25:11,435 --> 01:25:14,730
Sorry, man, I'm really
busy right now.

1279
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:18,358
I mean of course, sir.
Sorry, Mr President.

1280
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:21,359
- Don't worry about it, you're
doing a great job, son.

1281
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:46,828
What's happening?

1282
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:48,376
The Capitol has
been hit by a 9.4

1283
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:49,871
Lost communication with
the White House, sir.

1284
01:25:49,872 --> 01:25:52,730
- Where is it centered?
- North Chesapeake Bay.

1285
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,600
Mr Anheuser, Russian
president on the line, sir.

1286
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,050
Excuse me.

1287
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:03,900
We just entered
Chinese air space.

1288
01:26:05,438 --> 01:26:07,435
That's affirmative,
Mr President.

1289
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:10,604
Until communication
is restored,

1290
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:12,216
I suppose I am
in command.

1291
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:14,261
It appears that all
other heads of state

1292
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:16,358
are en route, with the
exception of the

1293
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:17,319
Italian Prime Minister,

1294
01:26:18,456 --> 01:26:20,983
Who has also
decided to

1295
01:26:21,018 --> 01:26:24,239
stay behind and
trust in prayer.

1296
01:27:26,728 --> 01:27:29,493
Earths crust has begun
to shift, Dr Helmsley!

1297
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,743
- By what degree?
- 1.2°. Still moving.

1298
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:34,095
So, what happens next?

1299
01:27:34,095 --> 01:27:36,661
The movement of our land
masses comes to a halt.

1300
01:27:36,694 --> 01:27:38,115
Let's see a simulation.

1301
01:27:39,448 --> 01:27:41,360
Expect the formation
of gigantic tsunamis.

1302
01:27:41,362 --> 01:27:44,590
Proportional to the magnitude
of corresponding quakes.

1303
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:51,175
Pull up the Japanese
sea border.

1304
01:27:51,176 --> 01:27:52,136
Yes, sir.

1305
01:27:53,248 --> 01:27:55,606
My dad's on a cruise
ship out there.

1306
01:27:56,782 --> 01:27:59,207
But I guess you already
knew that.

1307
01:28:00,137 --> 01:28:02,054
Sir, we've recorded
two underwater quakes

1308
01:28:02,055 --> 01:28:04,412
at 7.9 and 8.2.

1309
01:28:20,786 --> 01:28:23,162
From what we have just
learned, Tokyo seems to

1310
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:25,541
have taken the full
force of the earthquake.

1311
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,649
At this point unconfirmed
reports indicate that

1312
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:30,631
large areas of land
are under water.

1313
01:28:30,632 --> 01:28:32,055
Please stay tuned
for further...

1314
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,372
Tony

1315
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:46,180
I called.

1316
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:50,856
I was too late.

1317
01:28:54,676 --> 01:28:58,257
Maybe they got
out of town.

1318
01:28:58,259 --> 01:28:59,649
You never know.

1319
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:26,317
I'm coming home,
Dorothy.

1320
01:30:51,832 --> 01:30:53,217
Anything?

1321
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:56,141
Nothing but static.

1322
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:57,869
Not even an
emergency signal.

1323
01:31:09,793 --> 01:31:12,828
Can't think about what's
going on down there

1324
01:31:19,858 --> 01:31:21,797
Remember that old Beetle
we used to camp in?

1325
01:31:21,798 --> 01:31:23,430
But you'd never
get the roof up.

1326
01:31:24,614 --> 01:31:28,029
We definitely
traded up.

1327
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:32,350
Tried to find our old
spot at Yellowstone.

1328
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:35,032
When I went camping
with the kids, but...

1329
01:31:35,033 --> 01:31:36,885
I couldn't find it.

1330
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:48,969
Do you think
people change?

1331
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,940
By people, do
you mean me?

1332
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:51,609
Yes.

1333
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:54,448
Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

1334
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:58,096
I seem to eat a lot
more cereal now.

1335
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,020
You always had
tunnel vision.

1336
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:07,997
You could just block
everything out and write.

1337
01:32:11,389 --> 01:32:13,484
You blocked us out.

1338
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,456
Do you love him?

1339
01:32:26,177 --> 01:32:28,063
I love him enough.

1340
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,668
All global ground communication
is ceased, sir.

1341
01:32:46,368 --> 01:32:51,136
The only signals our
satellites are picking up

1342
01:32:51,755 --> 01:32:54,297
Well there's a piece
of good news.

1343
01:32:54,298 --> 01:32:55,546
Any updates, Doctor?

1344
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:59,078
We expect the tsunamis to reach
land fall on every continent.

1345
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:00,881
The Cho Ming area will
be impacted in

1346
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:02,609
approximately 6 hours.

1347
01:33:03,475 --> 01:33:05,935
It looks like the crust
have shifted by almost

1348
01:33:05,936 --> 01:33:08,177
23 degrees to
the southwest.

1349
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:11,319
The data also shows
the Earth's poles

1350
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,451
have reversed their
magnetic fields.

1351
01:33:13,452 --> 01:33:15,418
These are their
new positions.

1352
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:20,894
You're telling me that
the North Pole

1353
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:23,100
is now somewhere
in Wisconsin?

1354
01:33:23,101 --> 01:33:25,907
Actually, thats the
South Pole now.

1355
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:36,181
Engine failure.
2 of 6 are down.

1356
01:33:36,182 --> 01:33:37,792
You must get ready.

1357
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:42,315
- How long do we have?
- 18 minutes. Maybe.

1358
01:33:44,011 --> 01:33:45,585
Better wake
up the kids.

1359
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:46,859
Da.

1360
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,324
Why do you
hate Gordon?

1361
01:34:30,854 --> 01:34:34,221
Hey. Come on.

1362
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:39,247
What are you talking about?
I don't hate him.

1363
01:34:39,546 --> 01:34:41,073
You don't like him either

1364
01:34:41,159 --> 01:34:44,146
That's because I don't
know him well, maybe.

1365
01:34:44,289 --> 01:34:45,568
But I do.

1366
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:47,787
He's really nice once
you get to know him.

1367
01:34:47,822 --> 01:34:49,444
You should talk
to him more often.

1368
01:34:49,445 --> 01:34:52,099
You guys would get
along really well.

1369
01:34:55,179 --> 01:34:57,007
You like him a lot, huh?

1370
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,561
I'll do my best.
I promise. OK?

1371
01:35:09,865 --> 01:35:13,248
I'm really proud of you.
Really proud of you.

1372
01:35:14,703 --> 01:35:16,551
Is it time?

1373
01:35:18,275 --> 01:35:20,323
Yeah

1374
01:35:22,645 --> 01:35:23,975
Dad, what's wrong?

1375
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,119
Sasha's gotta land.
It's gonna be a little bumpy.

1376
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:28,368
Maybe a little wet.

1377
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:30,377
Daddy?

1378
01:35:36,182 --> 01:35:38,287
Hold her steady.

1379
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:58,229
Daddy, I'm not a
really good swimmer.

1380
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,600
Hey, that's alright. It's
what you got this for.

1381
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:03,164
It's like being in
a swimming pool.

1382
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:06,791
Only it's got more cool stuff.
It's got a whistle, a light.

1383
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:09,710
I thought we were
going to China.

1384
01:36:10,485 --> 01:36:12,506
No, we gotta
land here.

1385
01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:16,694
So that's what
we're gonna do.

1386
01:36:16,695 --> 01:36:17,997
We're just gonna
all stay together.

1387
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:19,497
No we're not,
we're gonna die!

1388
01:36:19,498 --> 01:36:21,537
No, we're not.

1389
01:36:21,664 --> 01:36:23,055
Promise?

1390
01:36:23,173 --> 01:36:24,909
I promise you, we'll
all stay together,

1391
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:27,065
no matter what happens.

1392
01:36:41,266 --> 01:36:43,827
Jackson, Yuri.

1393
01:36:45,872 --> 01:36:47,287
I think you better
come up here

1394
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,904
I'm gonna go check
this out.

1395
01:36:50,045 --> 01:36:51,020
- Dad, dad!
- I'll be right back

1396
01:36:51,896 --> 01:36:54,702
We gotta buckle
up. Let's go.

1397
01:36:55,912 --> 01:36:58,086
Don't ask me how
that happened

1398
01:36:58,877 --> 01:36:59,957
There is no more
ocean, and we're

1399
01:36:59,957 --> 01:37:01,898
pretty close to where
we wanted to go.

1400
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:03,957
It's like the whole world
shifted by 1000 miles.

1401
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:06,671
1578 to be exact.

1402
01:37:06,672 --> 01:37:08,926
It's called "Earth Crust
Displacement Theory"

1403
01:37:08,927 --> 01:37:10,873
Professor Hapgood 1958.

1404
01:37:12,442 --> 01:37:13,655
Way to go, Charlie.

1405
01:37:16,771 --> 01:37:17,689
What was that?

1406
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,659
We just lost our
last two engines.

1407
01:37:39,537 --> 01:37:41,091
I'll shoot for that glacier.

1408
01:37:41,126 --> 01:37:42,380
It's going to
get rocky.

1409
01:37:42,413 --> 01:37:44,296
Listen, it's gonna
sound crazy,

1410
01:37:44,297 --> 01:37:46,396
but here's what
you have to do.

1411
01:37:50,358 --> 01:37:53,591
Get up! Follow me!

1412
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:55,717
Yuri, what are you doing?

1413
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:58,274
We are taking the Bentley!

1414
01:37:59,283 --> 01:38:01,726
Not yet!
Not yet.

1415
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,905
Almost there.

1416
01:38:05,884 --> 01:38:07,033
Get in the car.

1417
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,925
Okay, go now!
Pull!

1418
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:25,650
No no no no no

1419
01:38:30,136 --> 01:38:31,255
Go, Jackson.

1420
01:38:31,256 --> 01:38:33,060
We gotta wait
for Sasha and Gordon.

1421
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,913
Go! Make sure
everybody gets

1422
01:38:35,914 --> 01:38:37,923
off the plane before
I touch down.

1423
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:39,082
What about you?

1424
01:38:39,117 --> 01:38:42,953
I'll be fine. I have to
touch this plane down.

1425
01:38:44,011 --> 01:38:46,631
What are you
waiting for? Go!

1426
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:03,726
There he is.
I see him!

1427
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:05,533
Come on lets go.

1428
01:39:05,533 --> 01:39:07,101
- Where is Sasha?
- He said he's fine

1429
01:39:07,103 --> 01:39:09,509
We should get out of here
before he touches down.

1430
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:10,814
Don't go!

1431
01:39:11,989 --> 01:39:13,694
Go Jackson, go.

1432
01:39:15,453 --> 01:39:16,542
It wont start.

1433
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:20,551
Shut up everybody!

1434
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:23,712
Engine

1435
01:39:23,712 --> 01:39:25,648
Start

1436
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,395
Voice control.
Sold me on it.

1437
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:31,716
Welcome, to the People's
Republic of China.

1438
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:33,650
- Good to be here.
- Say hi, kids.

1439
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:34,796
Hi

1440
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:37,916
- What color are your passes?
- What?

1441
01:41:37,949 --> 01:41:40,034
What color are your
boarding passes?

1442
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:44,189
I have green cards.

1443
01:41:44,769 --> 01:41:47,502
- For my boys and me.
- What?

1444
01:41:50,664 --> 01:41:52,560
Yuri? Yuri!

1445
01:41:53,396 --> 01:41:56,385
Yuri. It's a mistake.
A joke, eh?

1446
01:41:57,087 --> 01:42:02,181
What? You think I didn't know
about you and Sasha?

1447
01:42:02,215 --> 01:42:06,780
May God bless that poor
bastard's soul.

1448
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:15,167
I'm sorry guys.
Good luck.

1449
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:17,341
Come on, boys.

1450
01:42:18,743 --> 01:42:21,192
Maybe with money
we could bribe them.

1451
01:42:21,225 --> 01:42:22,993
You got a billion Euros?

1452
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:31,690
Dr Wilson. I'm Captain Michaels,
Skipper of the American ship.

1453
01:42:31,725 --> 01:42:34,145
Please accept my sincere
condolences for your father.

1454
01:42:34,145 --> 01:42:35,489
Thank you, Captain.

1455
01:42:36,983 --> 01:42:40,145
Anheuser. Your party
is the last to arrive.

1456
01:42:44,074 --> 01:42:46,337
There's been reports of
severe damage, Captain.

1457
01:42:46,338 --> 01:42:48,430
What's the status of
Ark number 3?

1458
01:42:48,431 --> 01:42:50,404
We haven't done a
complete assessment yet.

1459
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:52,610
Looks like we lost it.

1460
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:04,707
No toothbrush.
Only books.

1461
01:43:04,742 --> 01:43:08,216
When I was a kid my dad
was on the road a lot.

1462
01:43:09,204 --> 01:43:13,315
He'd always leave me
a box full of books.

1463
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:17,216
I'd get an ice cream cone
for every book I read so...

1464
01:43:17,216 --> 01:43:19,000
I was a fat kid.

1465
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,653
I find that very hard
to believe.

1466
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:26,524
No, its true, my high school
carrier was 2000 books

1467
01:43:26,524 --> 01:43:28,177
Zero girlfriends.

1468
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:32,463
I didn't even kiss a boy
until I was in college.

1469
01:43:32,465 --> 01:43:35,067
They were all too
scared of my dad.

1470
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,085
Leave it to the Chinese.

1471
01:44:22,716 --> 01:44:24,118
I didn't think
it was possible.

1472
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:26,002
Not in the
time we had.

1473
01:44:26,453 --> 01:44:28,364
That's Ark number 3, sir.

1474
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:30,568
The roof collapsed
during the shifting

1475
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:31,528
of the Earth's crust.

1476
01:44:33,015 --> 01:44:34,113
Jesus Christ.

1477
01:44:44,025 --> 01:44:45,333
Hey, what's going on here?

1478
01:44:45,368 --> 01:44:47,863
I have a green card for
my boys and me.

1479
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:50,122
I want to speak to
your supervisor.

1480
01:44:50,123 --> 01:44:51,805
I am the supervisor.

1481
01:44:51,806 --> 01:44:53,193
Get back with the
other green cards,

1482
01:44:53,194 --> 01:44:54,845
or I'll have
you detained.

1483
01:44:56,936 --> 01:44:58,894
What he said about you
and Sasha, is it true?

1484
01:44:58,895 --> 01:45:03,006
Sasha was worth a hundred
times a man like Yuri.

1485
01:45:03,006 --> 01:45:04,944
I should have listened
to you, Dr. Silberman.

1486
01:45:04,945 --> 01:45:07,786
I actually liked the way
I looked before that

1487
01:45:07,787 --> 01:45:10,199
monster talked
me into it.

1488
01:45:10,201 --> 01:45:12,403
Did you know he asked
me for a discount?

1489
01:45:12,404 --> 01:45:14,344
He payed in installments.

1490
01:45:14,345 --> 01:45:15,765
Cheap bastard.

1491
01:45:16,444 --> 01:45:17,666
You hear that?

1492
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,734
Over there!

1493
01:45:25,113 --> 01:45:27,250
Stop!

1494
01:45:33,146 --> 01:45:36,440
Stop!

1495
01:46:07,565 --> 01:46:09,029
How were all these
people chosen?

1496
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:10,346
Same way your Arc was.

1497
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:11,412
By experts from all
over the world.

1498
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,252
We had geneticists
determine the perfect

1499
01:46:13,252 --> 01:46:14,877
gene pool we need
to repopulate.

1500
01:46:14,877 --> 01:46:16,565
These people were chosen
by geneticists?

1501
01:46:16,567 --> 01:46:18,518
<i>All green card holders</i>

1502
01:46:18,519 --> 01:46:20,261
<i>Please proceed to
hangar D-4</i>

1503
01:46:20,261 --> 01:46:22,197
Looks to me like their check
books got them on board.

1504
01:46:22,231 --> 01:46:24,131
That's right, Dr Wilson.
Without billions of dollars

1505
01:46:24,167 --> 01:46:26,270
from the private sector
this entire operation

1506
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:27,231
would've been
impossible.

1507
01:46:27,488 --> 01:46:28,693
We sold tickets?

1508
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:30,630
What about all
these workers?

1509
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,685
They all get passes?

1510
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:35,628
What? Life isn't fair?

1511
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,659
Is that it?

1512
01:46:37,081 --> 01:46:38,498
If you want to
donate your passes,

1513
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,802
to a couple of Chinese
workers, be my guest.

1514
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:43,828
Captain, I want a
pre-launch briefing.

1515
01:46:43,829 --> 01:46:45,672
All international
teams present.

1516
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:21,162
What the hell?

1517
01:47:24,235 --> 01:47:27,118
What is this? They could've
fit 10 people in here.

1518
01:47:33,921 --> 01:47:35,243
Satnam, where are you?

1519
01:47:35,792 --> 01:47:38,394
- On the Nampan Plateau.
- What?

1520
01:47:40,252 --> 01:47:42,613
There's a tidal wave
coming from the east.

1521
01:47:42,613 --> 01:47:43,765
It's gigantic.

1522
01:47:44,132 --> 01:47:45,676
<i>Satnam, what
happened?</i>

1523
01:47:45,676 --> 01:47:47,470
We never got
picked up, Adrian.

1524
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:49,658
The airlift
never came.

1525
01:47:51,448 --> 01:47:52,859
Goodbye, my friend.

1526
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:56,557
Satnam

1527
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:23,938
- Where are we set up?
- Over there.

1528
01:48:28,554 --> 01:48:31,242
Give me the satellite
images from Napam, India.

1529
01:48:31,654 --> 01:48:32,306
What's happening?

1530
01:48:33,478 --> 01:48:36,078
Satnam was talking
about another wave,

1531
01:48:36,078 --> 01:48:37,613
coming from the east.

1532
01:48:41,059 --> 01:48:42,324
- Holy mother of God.

1533
01:48:42,326 --> 01:48:44,595
So the flooding
will hit earlier?

1534
01:48:44,596 --> 01:48:46,302
The second wave
is closer?

1535
01:48:46,304 --> 01:48:47,381
Plug in the new data.

1536
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:50,707
Satnam didn't
get picked up.

1537
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:51,667
What?

1538
01:48:51,886 --> 01:48:54,412
A lot of people didn't get
picked up in this chaos.

1539
01:48:54,722 --> 01:48:56,730
This is not a conspiracy,
Helmsley.

1540
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:58,045
Your predictions haven't
exactly panned out,

1541
01:48:58,046 --> 01:48:59,603
have they, Doctor?

1542
01:48:59,604 --> 01:49:01,837
It's ready.

1543
01:49:03,421 --> 01:49:05,640
Oh God, its 1500
meters high.

1544
01:49:06,716 --> 01:49:08,113
When will it
get here?

1545
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:09,728
Talk to me, Hemsley,
when will it hit?

1546
01:49:09,729 --> 01:49:11,886
Adjust the countdown.

1547
01:49:27,069 --> 01:49:30,256
28 minutes, 10 seconds
to impact.

1548
01:49:30,256 --> 01:49:31,034
My God.

1549
01:49:31,436 --> 01:49:33,235
Captain.

1550
01:49:33,237 --> 01:49:35,082
I need to speak to the
other heads of state.

1551
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:36,493
- Right away. Taylor?
- Aye, Captain

1552
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:39,930
Standing by. Ark 6, stand by.
Ark 7, stand by.

1553
01:49:39,965 --> 01:49:42,603
This is Carl Anheuser
acting CIC on 4,

1554
01:49:42,604 --> 01:49:43,208
Yes sir

1555
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:45,282
Requesting emergency
conference T-99.

1556
01:50:05,296 --> 01:50:06,996
He thinks the world of
you, you know that?

1557
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,421
He's a great little man.

1558
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:13,244
Yeah

1559
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,118
I always wanted to have
a family of my own.

1560
01:50:27,063 --> 01:50:28,725
You're a lucky
man, Jackson.

1561
01:50:30,088 --> 01:50:31,393
Don't ever forget it.

1562
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:35,273
CHO MING UTILITY GATE

1563
01:50:47,101 --> 01:50:48,149
Who are they?

1564
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:50,282
We found them alongside
of the road.

1565
01:50:50,283 --> 01:50:52,234
Send them back!

1566
01:50:57,801 --> 01:50:59,479
I am a follower

1567
01:51:00,226 --> 01:51:02,203
of our great
Lama Rinpoche.

1568
01:51:02,902 --> 01:51:04,311
You know I cannot do that.

1569
01:51:05,757 --> 01:51:07,255
You don't have to
take all of us.

1570
01:51:07,256 --> 01:51:08,344
Please just take
my children.

1571
01:51:08,345 --> 01:51:09,592
I'm begging you.

1572
01:51:09,988 --> 01:51:11,547
Why should
I do that?

1573
01:51:11,548 --> 01:51:15,453
Same reason you
sent for your family.

1574
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:18,363
Please just the children,
you don't have to take us.

1575
01:51:18,363 --> 01:51:19,323
Please!

1576
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,154
Please. Oh my God.

1577
01:51:27,707 --> 01:51:31,390
Please. I don't know if you can
understand what I'm saying.

1578
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:33,966
As a mother,
I'm begging you.

1579
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:35,408
Please take them.

1580
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:37,646
Please.

1581
01:51:40,033 --> 01:51:43,239
We are all children
of the Earth.

1582
01:51:44,029 --> 01:51:47,359
My plan will not work
for so many, Grandma.

1583
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:51,139
We will take them all.

1584
01:52:05,675 --> 01:52:09,725
Attention.
All construction workers.

1585
01:52:12,318 --> 01:52:14,188
They're opening
the mountain.

1586
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:17,371
They are leaving
without us.

1587
01:52:18,485 --> 01:52:20,211
Get back. What did
I tell you!

1588
01:52:20,212 --> 01:52:24,056
They are leaving
you behind too.

1589
01:52:24,057 --> 01:52:25,328
<i>Please be patient</i>

1590
01:52:36,996 --> 01:52:39,233
Follow me.

1591
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:46,728
We have to hurry!

1592
01:52:46,729 --> 01:52:47,997
They are leaving!

1593
01:52:50,648 --> 01:52:52,994
Initiating security
procedures.

1594
01:52:58,167 --> 01:53:00,743
Excuse me. Where can I
find Adrian Helmsley?

1595
01:53:00,744 --> 01:53:02,082
He's on the bridge.
This way.

1596
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:07,335
Tenzin wait!

1597
01:53:08,667 --> 01:53:10,608
Grandma, we're
almost there.

1598
01:53:10,801 --> 01:53:12,740
Green lights on
pressure, Mr Anton?

1599
01:53:12,742 --> 01:53:14,506
Green lights across
the board, Captain.

1600
01:53:26,144 --> 01:53:27,340
Why do they
have anchors?

1601
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,382
Because they're not
space ships. They're Arcs.

1602
01:53:30,845 --> 01:53:31,949
Let's go.

1603
01:53:43,891 --> 01:53:45,248
Mr President.

1604
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:47,213
You've got to see this.

1605
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:18,823
Stop.

1606
01:54:26,817 --> 01:54:28,310
Engage the support
mechanisms.

1607
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:30,905
Aye-aye, Captain.
Engaging supports.

1608
01:54:30,907 --> 01:54:32,130
Just exactly how long
are these things

1609
01:54:32,131 --> 01:54:33,655
expected to hold us
in place, Captain?

1610
01:54:33,657 --> 01:54:34,519
They're just meant
to withstand the

1611
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,351
first impact of the
waves, Mr Anheuser.

1612
01:54:53,895 --> 01:54:56,739
Down there Oleg,
you go first.

1613
01:55:01,789 --> 01:55:02,985
Caesar!

1614
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:26,185
Good boy.
Come to Mommy.

1615
01:55:26,186 --> 01:55:27,239
Caesar!

1616
01:55:27,974 --> 01:55:30,025
Mommy, where's Tamara?

1617
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:33,936
Daddy look!

1618
01:55:36,667 --> 01:55:38,350
Tamara!

1619
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:16,780
Oh my god, what's
happening out there?

1620
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:20,628
Anheuser convinced the other
heads of state to launch.

1621
01:56:23,845 --> 01:56:25,420
Mr. Anheuser

1622
01:56:27,069 --> 01:56:29,011
We have to stop
this madness.

1623
01:56:29,798 --> 01:56:31,722
Make sure the other
bridges can see me.

1624
01:56:32,515 --> 01:56:33,091
What do you think
you're doing?

1625
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:34,457
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

1626
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:39,029
Ladies and Gentleman,
this is Dr. Adrian Helmsley

1627
01:56:39,032 --> 01:56:42,110
Chief science adviser to
the late President Wilson.

1628
01:56:42,212 --> 01:56:44,871
Could you please turn up
the volume, Mr Hoffman.

1629
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:46,069
I know we've all
been forced to make

1630
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:49,274
difficult decisions to save
our human civilization.

1631
01:56:49,274 --> 01:56:51,967
But to be human means
to care for each other

1632
01:56:52,002 --> 01:56:53,972
and civilization means
to work together

1633
01:56:53,974 --> 01:56:55,908
to create a better life.

1634
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:58,261
If that's true, then
there's nothing human

1635
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:01,234
and nothing civilized about
what we're doing here.

1636
01:57:01,235 --> 01:57:03,728
Dr. Helmsley's passion
is admirable,

1637
01:57:03,862 --> 01:57:06,453
But I remind you that
we have very limited

1638
01:57:06,454 --> 01:57:08,158
resources and extremely
limited time.

1639
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:09,854
Ask yourselves, can
we really stand by

1640
01:57:09,855 --> 01:57:12,957
and watch these
people die?

1641
01:57:13,345 --> 01:57:15,362
I read a quote
two days ago.

1642
01:57:15,465 --> 01:57:17,698
The author is probably
dead by now. But he said:

1643
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:20,073
"The moment we stop
fighting for each other"

1644
01:57:20,078 --> 01:57:23,378
"Thats the moment that
we lose our humanity"

1645
01:57:23,465 --> 01:57:24,654
And in order to save
the human race,

1646
01:57:24,655 --> 01:57:27,162
we have and obligation
to stick to this plan

1647
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:30,288
which every nation on this
flotilla signed up for.

1648
01:57:30,289 --> 01:57:32,649
They're in God's
hands now.

1649
01:57:34,432 --> 01:57:36,842
Officer, you turn that off.

1650
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:38,958
That is an order,
sailor. Turn it off!

1651
01:57:38,993 --> 01:57:40,673
Don't you dare touch
that button, young man!

1652
01:57:40,675 --> 01:57:43,488
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1653
01:57:43,815 --> 01:57:44,734
Look at the clock!

1654
01:57:44,913 --> 01:57:47,372
We have barely
15 minutes left!

1655
01:57:47,646 --> 01:57:48,394
Do you want to be
responsible for the

1656
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:49,966
extinction of the
human race?

1657
01:57:49,966 --> 01:57:51,367
Can you handle
that, Adrian?

1658
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:54,167
There's a young astrophysicist
from India who's the

1659
01:57:54,168 --> 01:57:55,345
reason we are all here.

1660
01:57:55,345 --> 01:57:56,993
Oh, for God's sake.

1661
01:57:57,145 --> 01:57:59,583
He's the one who
discovered it all.

1662
01:57:59,585 --> 01:58:03,164
He connected all the dots,
we all owe him our lives.

1663
01:58:03,268 --> 01:58:04,556
I just learned that
he was killed with

1664
01:58:04,557 --> 01:58:08,480
his family in a Tsunami
in eastern India.

1665
01:58:09,987 --> 01:58:12,177
He was my friend.

1666
01:58:12,775 --> 01:58:15,009
And he died in vain.

1667
01:58:15,341 --> 01:58:18,372
Everybody out there
has died in vain.

1668
01:58:18,515 --> 01:58:22,385
If we start our future
with an act of cruelty,

1669
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:28,932
what will you tell
your children?

1670
01:58:31,273 --> 01:58:35,180
If my father were here,
he would open the gates

1671
01:58:41,644 --> 01:58:44,162
The people of Russia
along with...

1672
01:58:45,175 --> 01:58:46,435
China

1673
01:58:48,212 --> 01:58:49,948
and Japan

1674
01:58:49,948 --> 01:58:50,908
Agree

1675
01:58:52,247 --> 01:58:54,488
To open the gates!

1676
01:58:55,884 --> 01:59:00,112
The United Kingdom, Spain,
France and Germany,

1677
01:59:00,115 --> 01:59:02,453
and I believe I may
also speak for the

1678
01:59:02,454 --> 01:59:04,381
Italian Prime Minister:

1679
01:59:04,645 --> 01:59:08,305
We vote to let these
people come in.

1680
01:59:13,095 --> 01:59:15,248
Captain Michaels.

1681
01:59:16,225 --> 01:59:18,800
Please

1682
01:59:21,055 --> 01:59:22,613
This is your Captain.

1683
01:59:22,613 --> 01:59:26,072
In a few moments,
we will open the gates.

1684
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:35,615
Phew, it stinks.

1685
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:55,689
They are opening
the gate. Come down!

1686
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:57,551
Noah. Move it!

1687
01:59:58,074 --> 02:00:00,717
Noah! Noah!

1688
02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:13,012
Mom, something happened.

1689
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:22,828
Come on, God damn it!
Give me your hand!

1690
02:00:22,829 --> 02:00:26,658
- Reach for it!
- Help me!

1691
02:00:29,009 --> 02:00:31,018
Gordon!

1692
02:00:32,856 --> 02:00:34,503
Stop!

1693
02:00:39,095 --> 02:00:40,578
Climb!

1694
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,190
What's wrong
with the gate?

1695
02:01:14,511 --> 02:01:15,550
Looks like it didn't
run the full cycle.

1696
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:16,511
We're checking it out.

1697
02:01:18,135 --> 02:01:21,091
Order, please!

1698
02:01:25,326 --> 02:01:28,269
<i>4 minutes to impact</i>

1699
02:02:11,863 --> 02:02:14,881
We're all loaded, Captain.
Then let's lock it up. Now!

1700
02:02:24,426 --> 02:02:27,673
Oleg! Grab
my hand!

1701
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:45,344
No, no, no

1702
02:02:56,759 --> 02:02:58,087
HYDRAULIC MALFUNCTION

1703
02:02:58,283 --> 02:02:59,863
Something's jamming the
hydraulics, Captain.

1704
02:03:00,003 --> 02:03:01,115
Well then get it out
for Christ sake.

1705
02:03:01,117 --> 02:03:02,462
I can't fire up the
engines until we

1706
02:03:02,463 --> 02:03:03,900
get a good seal
on that gate.

1707
02:03:04,757 --> 02:03:07,099
Captain, we have a breach
in the zoological bay.

1708
02:03:07,243 --> 02:03:09,268
Can you zoom in?
- Yeah.

1709
02:03:13,293 --> 02:03:14,237
I know those kids.

1710
02:03:14,238 --> 02:03:16,679
What is happening?
What's going on?

1711
02:03:16,908 --> 02:03:18,672
Where did they
come from?

1712
02:03:20,461 --> 02:03:22,400
There. Through the
hydraulic chamber.

1713
02:03:22,529 --> 02:03:23,783
Captain, I think we
found the problem!

1714
02:03:23,784 --> 02:03:26,270
- Who are these people?
- No, wait!

1715
02:03:26,676 --> 02:03:27,466
He's injured.

1716
02:03:27,832 --> 02:03:31,403
Something must've
gone wrong.

1717
02:03:31,438 --> 02:03:34,244
Are you kidding me? Of course
something went wrong!

1718
02:03:34,256 --> 02:03:36,060
Congratulations to
the both of you.

1719
02:03:36,125 --> 02:03:37,295
Might have gotten us
all killed, but as long

1720
02:03:37,296 --> 02:03:39,461
as your conscience is
clean, right Helmsley?

1721
02:03:39,462 --> 02:03:41,430
Captain, get an emergency
team down there,

1722
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:43,113
I'll meet them at the
hydraulics chamber.

1723
02:03:43,114 --> 02:03:44,983
You know your way
around here? Lets go!

1724
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:47,354
<i>1 minute to impact.</i>

1725
02:04:00,344 --> 02:04:01,083
Captain?

1726
02:04:01,552 --> 02:04:03,480
Cho Ming airfield
has been hit.

1727
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,694
Put me on emergency
comm, Mr Taylor.

1728
02:04:08,154 --> 02:04:10,278
This is the Captain speaking

1729
02:04:10,338 --> 02:04:13,010
We expect to be impacted
by water shortly.

1730
02:04:13,202 --> 02:04:17,951
We need to
go this way.

1731
02:04:35,003 --> 02:04:38,136
All stations prepare
for impact.

1732
02:05:21,885 --> 02:05:24,296
Pressure just climbed
80 Pascal.

1733
02:05:24,298 --> 02:05:27,024
Surface compression of
valve sensors, Captain.

1734
02:05:27,025 --> 02:05:29,377
Track Dr Helmsley.

1735
02:05:34,012 --> 02:05:36,818
Out of the way!
Excuse me.

1736
02:05:37,511 --> 02:05:39,734
Tenzin. Almost there.

1737
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:42,046
Nima. What happened?

1738
02:05:44,042 --> 02:05:44,944
Tamara!

1739
02:05:44,944 --> 02:05:47,286
Will you take
the kids please?

1740
02:05:47,604 --> 02:05:48,707
Which way?

1741
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:52,930
We can't get there!
Water is entering the stern.

1742
02:05:52,963 --> 02:05:55,094
The rear of this ship is
flooded and will seal up

1743
02:05:55,113 --> 02:05:56,667
one compartment
at a time.

1744
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,457
Where's Gordon?

1745
02:05:59,721 --> 02:06:00,734
No?

1746
02:06:02,675 --> 02:06:04,828
We gotta go back!

1747
02:06:04,829 --> 02:06:06,462
We have to go back!

1748
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,078
Mommy!

1749
02:06:12,018 --> 02:06:13,427
Help!
Mommy!

1750
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:18,371
Run!

1751
02:06:21,948 --> 02:06:25,509
Go over, Lilly!

1752
02:06:26,323 --> 02:06:28,662
Caesar!
Lilly, take him!

1753
02:06:30,757 --> 02:06:32,824
Mommy!

1754
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:41,780
Is there another way to
the hydraulics chamber?

1755
02:06:41,997 --> 02:06:42,914
Where does this ladder go?

1756
02:06:42,949 --> 02:06:45,931
- To the zoological pens
- Okay, let's go!

1757
02:06:51,565 --> 02:06:54,954
Professor?
It's Air Force One.

1758
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,163
The mid-ship anchor
support is hit.

1759
02:07:13,243 --> 02:07:14,243
Can you stabilize it?

1760
02:07:14,244 --> 02:07:16,012
The bow anchor
is giving in.

1761
02:07:34,661 --> 02:07:36,650
Captain, the turbines
aren't responding.

1762
02:07:36,652 --> 02:07:39,564
So override it.
Hit the override.

1763
02:07:39,597 --> 02:07:41,332
We cant start the engine
until we close that gate.

1764
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,356
Help me!
Help!

1765
02:08:06,418 --> 02:08:10,261
Momma!

1766
02:08:10,295 --> 02:08:12,050
- Are you OK?
- My mommy is in there.

1767
02:08:12,051 --> 02:08:13,011
Please help her!

1768
02:08:13,011 --> 02:08:13,836
We'll get to your
mommy, sweetheart.

1769
02:08:13,837 --> 02:08:15,548
They're doing everything
they can, okay?

1770
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:16,667
Can we talk to her?

1771
02:08:16,702 --> 02:08:18,667
I'm gonna try
to connect us.

1772
02:08:18,701 --> 02:08:20,216
We have to stop
the bleeding!

1773
02:08:20,217 --> 02:08:21,369
How about my belt?

1774
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,407
- Here Mom!
- Mr. Curtis? Jackson?

1775
02:08:25,694 --> 02:08:27,586
Help! Hey!

1776
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:29,926
It's Adrian Helmsley,
we met at Yellowstone.

1777
02:08:29,958 --> 02:08:32,443
Thats great. Open
the God damn door!

1778
02:08:32,475 --> 02:08:34,230
Your daughter
is with me!

1779
02:08:34,265 --> 02:08:37,356
- Lilly?
- Where's Noah?

1780
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:39,146
I'm right here, Lil!

1781
02:08:39,148 --> 02:08:41,037
<i>Impact warning</i>

1782
02:08:41,072 --> 02:08:44,601

45° East.</i>

1783
02:08:44,603 --> 02:08:48,270
<i>Target elevation
29.035 feet.</i>

1784
02:08:48,271 --> 02:08:51,409
29.000 feet? What the
hell is at 29.000 feet?

1785
02:08:51,444 --> 02:08:53,173
We're headed straight
for the north face

1786
02:08:53,175 --> 02:08:55,679
of Mount Everest,
Mr. Anheuser.

1787
02:08:55,712 --> 02:08:57,756
And if we can't
start our engines,

1788
02:08:57,757 --> 02:08:59,729
we will not survive
the impact.

1789
02:09:09,488 --> 02:09:12,565
Jackson, you're sealed off!
We can't get to you!

1790
02:09:12,567 --> 02:09:14,414
There's something
blocking the hydraulics

1791
02:09:14,416 --> 02:09:16,992
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it

1792
02:09:18,029 --> 02:09:20,372
Dr Helmsley,
look at this.

1793
02:09:20,975 --> 02:09:23,100
It's completely submerged
down there and there's

1794
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,698
no way for them
to get any air.

1795
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:25,877
Theres no other way!

1796
02:09:25,878 --> 02:09:28,168
But it's a suicide
mission, sir!

1797
02:09:35,104 --> 02:09:37,551
I know where it is,
I'll give it a try.

1798
02:09:43,733 --> 02:09:46,219
Dad, wait, I wanna
go with you!

1799
02:09:46,283 --> 02:09:48,836
- Dad, I wanna help you!
- No, no, no.

1800
02:09:48,837 --> 02:09:50,869
- You are helping me.
- Dad, please!

1801
02:09:50,903 --> 02:09:53,284
Remember when Lilly
was born and you wanted

1802
02:09:53,286 --> 02:09:55,359
to be introduced
as her big brother?

1803
02:09:55,514 --> 02:09:56,895
Well, she's scared now.

1804
02:09:56,896 --> 02:09:58,756
She needs you
more than ever.

1805
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:01,938
If you're safe, I know that
she's safe. Do you understand?

1806
02:10:08,171 --> 02:10:10,181
You can help me out
the next time.

1807
02:10:12,957 --> 02:10:14,877
We caused this thing,
it was us.

1808
02:10:14,878 --> 02:10:16,662
I gotta go
check it out.

1809
02:10:45,662 --> 02:10:47,412
Can you hear me?

1810
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:52,363
No

1811
02:11:18,141 --> 02:11:19,208
Press down!

1812
02:11:19,242 --> 02:11:21,011
Press down with
your hand!

1813
02:11:28,899 --> 02:11:31,260
Don't stop.
Keep pressing!

1814
02:11:47,291 --> 02:11:50,664
No!

1815
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:57,117
<i>Distance to impact:
1.850 meters</i>

1816
02:11:59,389 --> 02:12:00,511
There he is!

1817
02:12:02,024 --> 02:12:03,649
- Captain!
- We have a visual!

1818
02:12:03,684 --> 02:12:05,274
I think we found
the problem.

1819
02:12:05,274 --> 02:12:07,273
Show us the
hydraulics chamber

1820
02:12:23,845 --> 02:12:25,809
God dammit! I told you
to stay up there!

1821
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,115
I just wanted to help.

1822
02:12:27,117 --> 02:12:30,328
Alright. Hold the light.

1823
02:12:30,328 --> 02:12:33,033
We're right under
the air pocket, okay?

1824
02:12:33,034 --> 02:12:34,775
How did you know
I needed help?

1825
02:12:39,506 --> 02:12:42,965
Grandpa, Grandma...
I'm sorry.

1826
02:12:42,998 --> 02:12:44,064
I could not save us

1827
02:12:44,435 --> 02:12:47,748
He has gone back in.
He will fix it.

1828
02:12:48,055 --> 02:12:50,668
There's no way.

1829
02:12:51,217 --> 02:12:53,594
Don't lose faith, brother.

1830
02:13:20,252 --> 02:13:21,868
Dad!

1831
02:13:29,003 --> 02:13:30,181
We're gonna die!

1832
02:13:51,524 --> 02:13:54,516
Great job! You light the way
and I'll go for the cable.

1833
02:13:55,676 --> 02:13:58,438
<i>Distance to impact:

Underwater ridge ahead!

1835
02:13:59,636 --> 02:14:01,015
We're going to run
aground, Captain!

1836
02:14:30,114 --> 02:14:31,837
Sir, the gate is sealed!

1837
02:14:31,838 --> 02:14:33,003
That's affirmative, Captain!

1838
02:14:33,005 --> 02:14:36,908
- Anton, start the engines.
- Aye-aye Captain. Full reverse.

1839
02:14:44,336 --> 02:14:46,470
Captain! We're not
gonna make it!

1840
02:14:46,471 --> 02:14:49,500

Hard to port!

1845

We did it! We did it!

1846
02:15:50,938 --> 02:15:53,288
- Where's Dad?
- He was right behind me

1847
02:15:54,676 --> 02:15:56,788
Any word from the
hydraulic chamber?

1848
02:15:56,789 --> 02:15:57,597
Where is he?

1849
02:15:57,599 --> 02:15:59,280
I thought you said he
was right behind you.

1850
02:15:59,282 --> 02:15:59,952
He was!

1851
02:15:59,953 --> 02:16:01,805
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes.</i>

1852
02:16:01,805 --> 02:16:03,608
He was right there!

1853
02:16:11,391 --> 02:16:14,706
Dad. Dad!

1854
02:16:14,707 --> 02:16:17,335
Come on, Jackson.
Come on.

1855
02:16:20,908 --> 02:16:23,551
<i>Please, please.</i>

1856
02:16:25,399 --> 02:16:28,038
Please, please.

1857
02:16:44,524 --> 02:16:45,822
He did it!

1858
02:16:46,088 --> 02:16:47,386
He did it!

1859
02:17:30,217 --> 02:17:37,286
DAY 27 MONTH 01 YEAR 0001

1860
02:17:43,561 --> 02:17:46,413
Shuttle Atlantis.
Our last day.

1861
02:17:46,414 --> 02:17:49,809
All we can hear is the sound
of our own breathing.

1862
02:17:49,810 --> 02:17:51,851
That reminds us we are still

1863
02:17:51,886 --> 02:17:55,112
sharing our memories,
hopes and ideas.

1864
02:17:55,113 --> 02:17:58,524
And isn't it funny?
Just this morning we worked it out

1865
02:17:58,525 --> 02:18:01,859
Somehow or another,
we all have relatives

1866
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:03,479
in Wisconsin.

1867
02:18:05,818 --> 02:18:07,183
The end.

1868
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:17,879
It's good.

1869
02:18:18,707 --> 02:18:20,325
I thought you
would like it.

1870
02:18:22,201 --> 02:18:27,701
Tell me Dr Wilson:
Apart from books and art.

1871
02:18:27,702 --> 02:18:28,872
Do you think there's
anything else

1872
02:18:28,873 --> 02:18:29,834
we might possibly share?

1873
02:18:31,221 --> 02:18:33,185
In the future?

1874
02:18:34,067 --> 02:18:37,496
Are you asking me out
on a date, Dr. Helmsley?

1875
02:18:38,272 --> 02:18:41,031
You know my diary
is pretty full.

1876
02:18:42,503 --> 02:18:44,048
Actually...

1877
02:18:46,421 --> 02:18:48,120
Yes, I was.

1878
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:54,877
<i>Dr. Helmsley to
the bridge, please.</i>

1879
02:18:54,878 --> 02:18:57,121
<i>Dr. Helmsley
to the bridge.</i>

1880
02:18:59,248 --> 02:19:00,649
Come here.

1881
02:19:06,835 --> 02:19:09,236
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
this is captain Michaels speaking.</i>

1882
02:19:09,237 --> 02:19:13,163
<i>In a few minutes I will give
orders to unseal the decks.</i>

1883
02:19:14,333 --> 02:19:17,505
<i>At 23:45 last night,
our sister Arks</i>

1884
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:20,915
<i>number 6 and 7
have joined our course.</i>

1885
02:19:21,595 --> 02:19:23,273
<i>For the first time
on our journey,</i>

1886
02:19:23,274 --> 02:19:24,235
we will have clear skies.

1887
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:28,358
<i>As you know our
passenger count</i>

1888
02:19:28,359 --> 02:19:29,318
<i>is way over capacity.</i>

1889
02:19:29,945 --> 02:19:32,471
<i>So please, be careful
when you step out</i>

1890
02:19:32,472 --> 02:19:35,697
<i>and of course...
enjoy the fresh air.</i>

1891
02:19:38,372 --> 02:19:39,770
Can I hold him?

1892
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,858
Sure, he can be your
dog too if you like.

1893
02:19:42,859 --> 02:19:44,093
Thanks.

1894
02:19:47,811 --> 02:19:49,260
Where have you
been all my life?

1895
02:19:49,261 --> 02:19:50,701
Gift shop.

1896
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:47,838
Oh, Adrian. Excellent.

1897
02:20:47,873 --> 02:20:50,938
I called because we just got
our first satellite feet.

1898
02:20:50,939 --> 02:20:53,368
The equalization of the
oceanic... seabeds

1899
02:20:53,369 --> 02:20:55,916
has not turned out to be
as extreme as we expected.

1900
02:20:55,917 --> 02:20:57,754
The waters are receding.

1901
02:20:57,755 --> 02:20:58,805
Much faster
than we thought.

1902
02:20:58,806 --> 02:21:00,662
Thank God. And...

1903
02:21:00,663 --> 02:21:02,913
This is hard to believe,
but the Himalayas

1904
02:21:02,914 --> 02:21:04,813
are no longer the
roof of the world.

1905
02:21:04,814 --> 02:21:06,688
It's now the
Drakensberg mountains

1906
02:21:06,689 --> 02:21:08,000
of KwaZulu, Nepal.

1907
02:21:08,001 --> 02:21:10,352
The entire African
continent has just risen

1908
02:21:10,352 --> 02:21:12,891
7.000 feet, and unlikely
they are even flooded.

1909
02:21:12,893 --> 02:21:15,596
That's why they call it
The Cape of Good Hope.

1910
02:21:15,597 --> 02:21:17,386
We've already set
course for it.

1911
02:21:24,343 --> 02:21:26,686
Daddy, when will
we go back home?

1912
02:21:26,688 --> 02:21:28,103
Well, we talked
about that.

1913
02:21:28,138 --> 02:21:29,520
We're gonna
find a new home

1914
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:30,479
out here somewhere.

1915
02:21:30,921 --> 02:21:32,111
Right?

1916
02:21:32,111 --> 02:21:34,861
Wherever we're all
together. That's home.

1917
02:21:34,861 --> 02:21:37,280
Right? You are scared?

1918
02:21:37,281 --> 02:21:38,595
I am not.

1919
02:21:40,516 --> 02:21:42,340
No more pull-ups.

1920
02:21:45,004 --> 02:21:46,448
Nice.

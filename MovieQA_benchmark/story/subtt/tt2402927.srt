00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000


2
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
Not much going on for a Friday.

3
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,139
It's early yet.

4
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,020
Make it a double would you.

5
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,280
Sure.

6
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,376
And buy one for yourself.
I gotta make a call.

7
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,479
Thank's pal.

8
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,120
Therese?
Is that you?

9
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,719
What do you know!

10
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,689
I'm saying to myself,
I know that girl.

11
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,189
Jack.

12
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,759
It's great to see you, therese.

13
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,860
It's been, months.

14
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,599
Months.

15
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,300
Jack, this is Carol aird.

16
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,719
Pleased to meet you.

17
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,400
Likewise.

18
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,319
Hey, Ted gray's meeting me here

19
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,159
Phil and a bunch of us
are going down to Phil's party.

20
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,175
You're going aren't you?

21
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,719
Yes. I just planned to get there a little...

22
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,855
You two go ahead.

23
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,216
You coming along?

24
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
No,

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,079
I should make a few calls before dinner,
anyway.

26
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,650
I should really run.

27
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,949
You sure?

28
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,949
Of course.

29
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,295
Then it would be great to catch a ride.

30
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah, sure.

31
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,500
You two have a wonderful night.

32
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,906
Nice meeting you, Jack.

33
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,800
Nice meeting you.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,540
Alright, well let me go make
sure the loaf is on his way.

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,279
Back in a flash.

36
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,269
I like your scribbles.

37
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,779
Yeah, I've been busy!

38
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,379
I don't know how you do it.

39
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
What?

40
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,399
You look a million bucks
first thing in the morning.

41
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,680
I'll be down in a minute.

42
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,279
So, I got the schedules.
In the mail.

43
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,319
You listening to me?

44
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,319
I'm listening!
You got the schedules.

45
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,399
Two sailings to France in June,
one in July.

46
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,000
Wow.

47
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,000
Whaddya think?

48
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,639
I think...

49
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,536
It's too cold I can't think straight.

50
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Alright let's get you warmed up.

51
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,415
Compliments in the
season from the management.

52
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,415
Compliments of the
season from the management.

53
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,240
Season's greetings
from the management.

54
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,776
Esther anyway she's just

55
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,279
going crazy with no girls
in the family but Esther-

56
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,240
how is Esther?

57
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,216
She'll pull through.

58
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,216
Compliments of the
season from the management.

59
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,639
Compliments of the
season from the management.

60
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,920
I gotta open the floor.

61
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
See you later

62
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,879
miss belivet.
You're needed upstairs

63
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
make it snappy.

64
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,316
Frankenberg good morning,
happy

65
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,399
holidays and welcome,
shoppers, to frankenberg's.

66
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,066
Be sure to take advantage of our

67
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,915
congratulations ike and mamie
inaugural early bird special

68
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,480
ike mamie in our beds and bedding
department on the second floor.

69
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,375
And on your way
there, you won't want to miss our brand new general

70
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,240
electric television and stereophonic display on
the first floor, just past the haberdashery.

71
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,080
Miss, miss,
where's the ladies room, honey?

72
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,620
If you go back to the
elevator, make a right, you can't miss it.

73
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Thanks you

74
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,519
I wonder if you might
help me find this doll for my daughter.

75
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Bright Betsy bright Betsy.
Oh she cries. And wets herself.

76
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,809
But I'm afraid
we're out of stock.

77
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,980
I've left it too long.

78
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,456
We have plenty
of other dolls. All kinds, umm…

79
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
right. What was
your favorite doll when you were four?

80
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,629
Me? I never...
Not many, to be honest.

81
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,240
Sorry. No
smoking on the sales floor.

82
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,975
Oh, of all the -
forgive me. Shopping makes me nervous.

83
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,159
That's okay.
Working here makes me nervous.

84
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,480
You're very kind.

85
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,039
Here she is.

86
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,840
She looks like you.
Around the eyes.

87
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,840
You think so?

88
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,490
So what did you
want when you were this age?

89
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,460
A train set.

90
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,929
Really? Do you
know much about train sets?

91
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,549
I do actually. And
there's a new model, just in last week.

92
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,196
Hand-built and hand-painted

93
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,975
cars, it's a limited
edition of five thousand,

94
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,879
you may have seen it.
Over by the elevators.

95
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,546
I would show you more of

96
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,100
it, but... I'm sort of confined.
To this desk.

97
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,360
Do you ship?

98
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,750
Special delivery. Or
courier. You'll have it in two, three days.

99
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
We'll even
assemble it for you.

100
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,779
Well. That's...
That. Sold.

101
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,995
Shall I pay now?

102
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,559
Oh yes, of course.

103
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,500
I need your account
details. And your shipping address.

104
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,159
Of course.

105
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
I love Christmas.

106
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,380
Wrapping gifts, all that. And then，

107
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:19,250
you somehow wind up overcooking
the turkey anyway.

108
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,789
Done.

109
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,480
Where'd you learn so much about train sets?

110
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,080
I... read.
Too much, probably.

111
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,399
It's refreshing.

112
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you

113
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,639
merry Christmas.

114
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,600
Merry Christmas.

115
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,210
I like your hat.

116
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,429
Move over. Nobody
else can see the screen.

117
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,299
Nobody else is watching.

118
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,399
I'm watching.

119
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,669
I've seen it six times.

120
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,730
Right now I'm charting the correlation

121
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,909
between what the characters
say and how they really feel.

122
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,440
My kid brother,
the movie jerk.

123
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,559
I'm strictly a beer man.
Everything else makes me want to vomit.

124
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,635
Wine makes me feel naughty but in a good way.

125
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,799
I drink to forget I gotta get up
for work in the morning.

126
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,336
Semco see, that's your problem,
semco.

127
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,559
You really ought to
drink because you remember you have a job.

128
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
Employment is a curse.

129
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,936
Phil you have a job, Phil.

130
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,176
You call that a job?
I call it an illusion.

131
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,960
You get paid.
Is money an illusion?

132
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,960
My kid brother,
the jerk philosopher.

133
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Where do you work?

134
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,855
Dannie works at the New York times.

135
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,816
No kidding.

136
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,720
It's a job.

137
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,576
But I want to write.
That's why I watch movies.

138
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Everybody's a writer...

139
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,840
Therese say, therese-before
I get too drunk to remember...

140
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,816
You did it? It's fixed?

141
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,816
He said it was a cinch.
No sweat.

142
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Thank you, Phil!
I was missing it!

143
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,255
So, you take pictures?

144
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,056
Well.

145
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,936
She's more excited by some chintzy

146
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,816
camera than she is about
sailing with me to Europe.

147
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
Women.

148
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,480
You said it, pal!

149
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,515
I don't believe it!
Does the house un-American

150
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,336
activities know you're back on the streets?
Hey honey, hey darling.

151
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,216
Terry, honey,
it's been ages. Call me, would you?

152
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,759
I will, I promise!

153
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,495
You still owe me for that poker game!

154
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,120
Richard, watch out, you're!

155
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,456
You come by the times,
for dinner sometime?

156
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,375
I work at night, so... I've

157
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,320
got a good pal who's a
junior photo editor.

158
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,480
He loves to pontificate.
I'll introduce you.

159
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,269
Really? I would like that.

160
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,279
Yeah? Okay.

161
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,196
Sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six…. Sixty?

162
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Fifty-four.

163
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,159
That must be your daddy.
Come on. We'd better finish up.

164
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,536
Mommy can you come skating too

165
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,216
oh, I wish I could, sweet pea.

166
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,799
Why plea please?

167
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,799
Hiya, sunshine.

168
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,415
Daddy! I want mommy to come.

169
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,840
You do don't you?

170
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,519
You're early.

171
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:48,879
Mail came.

172
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,240
Cy Harrison's wife.
Jeanette

173
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,200
Jeanette asked about you.

174
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,679
Did she?

175
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,240
You can color the trunk honey.

176
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,240
I know she'd love to see you there.

177
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
Give her my best.
I've always liked Jeanette.

178
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,160
I'd like you to be there.

179
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry, harge.
I have plans.

180
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,839
Mommy wants to give

Thank you.

185
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,435
I told this

186
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,855
customer it would get to
her by Christmas Eve.

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,096
According to what we've been told. Three days should be...

188
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,119

delivered this afternoon.

189
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,680
- Oh. Right. So... it arrived? She signed for it?
- It arrived.

190
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
Great. Thank you. Thanks.

00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,855
Belivet? Miss belivet?

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,855

Sorry, would you excuse me. I...

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,230
Of course.

195
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,615
Hello?

196
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,895
Is this employee 645-a,
Theresa belivet?

197
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,375
Yes.

198
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,599
We're patching you though

199
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,460
so it was you.

200
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,599
Oh hello. Mrs. aird?
Did you receive the train set alright?

201
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,279
I did. Yes.

202
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,076
And the gloves. Thank

203
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,079
you so much. You're a
star for sending them.

204
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,256
I just wanna to say thank you.
Really.

205
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,240
Of course.

206
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
What... what I wanna to say was

207
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,415
do you geta lunch hour there?

208
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,615
Let me take you to lunch.
It's the least I can do.

209
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Yes, of course.
But you don't have to...

210
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,839
I'm free tomorrow.

211
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,359
Tomorrow?

212
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,799
No, I don't know it.
Hold on.

213
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,799
Can I borrow a pencil and paper?

214
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,809
Thank you.

215
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,410
All right

216
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

217
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,759
I'll have the creamed spinach
over poached eggs.

218
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,480
And a dry Martini.
With an olive.

219
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,180
I'll have the same.

220
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,599
The meal or the drink?

221
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
All of it. Thank you.

222
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,390
Cigarette?

223
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,990
Yes please.

224
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,880
So what kind of a name is belivet?

225
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,816
T's Czech. It's changed.
Originally...

226
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,079
It's very original.

227
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,839
Well

228
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,296
and your first name?

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,039
Therese

230
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,519
therese, not ter-eeza

231
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,359
no.

232
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,799
Therese belivet.

233
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,829
It's lovely.

234
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,230
And yours?

235
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,960
Carol.

236
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,160
Carol.

237
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,496
Two dry Martinis.

238
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you.

239
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,670
Cheers.
Cheers.

240
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,881
So
You… I'm sure you thought

241
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,289
it was a man who sent
back your gloves.

242
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,759
I did.

243
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,019
I thought it might
be a man in the ski department.

244
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,059
I'm sorry.

245
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,086
No,
I'm delighted. I doubt

246
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,099
very much if I'd have
gone to lunch with him.

247
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,240
Your perfume.

248
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,119
Yes?

249
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,440
It's nice.

250
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,519
Thank you.

251
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,256
Harge thank you.
Harge bought

252
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,496
me a bottle years ago,
before we were married.

253
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,960
I've been
wearing it ever since.

254
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,839
Harge is your husband?

255
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,119
Yes. Well. Technically we...
We're divorcing.

256
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,256
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't be.

258
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,230
And do you live alone, therese belivet?

259
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:57,359
I do.

260
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,859
Well there's Richard.
He wants to live with me.

261
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,400
No, it's nothing like that.
It's... he'd like to marry me.

262
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,135
I see.

263
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Would you like to marry him?

264
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,039
I barely even know what to order for lunch.

265
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,480
And your meals.

266
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Thank you.

267
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,279
Enjoy.

268
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm starved.
Bon appetit.

269
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,369
What do you do on Sundays?

270
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,960
Nothing in particular.
What do you do?

271
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,319
Nothing... lately.

272
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,759
I mean, if you'd like to visit me some time,
you're welcome to.

273
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,799
At least there's some
pretty country around where I live.

274
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,119
Would you like to come out this Sunday?

275
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,559
Yes.

276
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,960
What a
strange girl you are.

277
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,160
Why?

278
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,039
Flung out of space.

279
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,339
Just see harge's
mother's face when she sees me in this.

280
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,895
Maybe I should stop home and change.

281
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't be a stupe.

282
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,920
Maybe I should just not show up?

283
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,096
Well than I'll be blamed

284
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,839
for it. So you'd better
just grin and bear it.

285
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,400
You want to tell me about her?

286
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,519
Therese?

287
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,119
She returned my gloves.

288
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
And?

289
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,215
And if you don't get us
out of this traffic soon,

290
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,839
I won't have to worry about that damned party.

291
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,200
Where... is my compact.
God damn it.

292
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,799
You look fine.

293
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,976
Come in with me.
Just for a minute.

294
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,215
Don't even start.

295
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,000
- You're the one who cancelled on us
- you nitwit!

296
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,240
I know. I'm sorry. I'm going!

297
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,880
Call me later.

298
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,079
You're always the
most beautiful woman in any room.

299
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,250
Tell your mother that.

300
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,675
Keep an eye out, will

301
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,359
you? Cy will scream if
he catches me with this.

302
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,529
What will he do?
Dock your allowance?

303
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,039
He doesn't like me to smoke.

304
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,839
So? You like it.

305
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,359
Carol, I... it's really not my business

306
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,655
but if you're going to be alone on Christmas

307
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
cy and I would love to have you.

308
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,599
Thank you, Jeanette.

309
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
I don't know.

310
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I don't know.
I might get away by myself.

311
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,359
At least for a few days.

312
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,119
Don't worry.
Nothing will break if you pick it up.

313
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,529
What are your pictures like?

314
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,880
I don't know.
They're probably not very good.

315
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,940
I mean... what are they?
What do you take pictures of?

316
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,910
Trees. Birds. Windows. Anything, really.

317
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,200
What do you write about?

318
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,759
People.

319
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,576
Always feel funny taking pictures of people.

320
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,599
Like it's some sort of a ..

321
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,079
Invasion of privacy?

322
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes.

323
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,720
All of us, you know,
we have affinities for people.

324
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,319
We like certain people.
You like certain people right?

325
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,375
Sometimes.

326
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
You don't like others.

327
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,421
And you don't know why

328
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,826
you're attracted to some
people and not others,

329
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,480
the only thing you know is... you

330
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:03,160
either are attracted or
you're not attracted.

331
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,970
It's like physics bouncing
off each other like pin balls.

332
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,830
Yeah but... not everything's

333
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,069
as simple as a bunch of
pin balls reacting or,

334
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,180
some things don't
even react. But everything's alive.

335
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,079
It' s late. I should go.

336
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,480
You shouldn't

337
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,000
why? Did you mind?

338
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:54,839
No.

339
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,119
I have to go.

340
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,039
Come back tomorrow? Or Wednesday?

341
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,039
Maybe. I don't know.

342
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,319
Here.

343
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,240
Thanks.

344
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,599
And thanks for staying sober
and driving me home.

345
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
Harge goodnight, harge.

346
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,279
Carol

347
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,160
come to my parents for Christmas.

348
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,119
We had a good time tonight.

349
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,319
It was one night harge.

350
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,640
I don't like the idea of you being alone.

351
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm not alone. There's rindy. And a...

352
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,279
Abbey.

353
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,920
There's always Abby.

354
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,516
Harge Abby and I were

355
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:55,440
over long before you and
I were over, harge.

356
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,336
I'll have rindy packed

357
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,680
and ready for you at four on Christmas Eve.

358
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,759
It shouldn't be like this.

359
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
I know.

360
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,829
Mama's special girl.

361
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,670
Goodnight, Florence.

362
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,200
Where's this place in jersey?

363
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,359
The country. I don't really know.

364
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,536
My uncle sal lives in union city

365
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,559
and he claims it's pretty dangerous at night

366
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,559
it's not union city.

367
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,599
Okay.

368
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,599
There's my ride.

369
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:19,920
Hi.

370
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,039
Hello. Carol aird.

371
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,336
Richard semco.
Glad to meet you.

372
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,279
Likewise.

373
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,519
Therese speaks very highly of you.

374
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
That's well.
So you'll get her back here safe and sound?

375
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,400
I think I see snow

376
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,359
wouldn't that be wonderful?

377
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,759
I love the snow

378
00:32:18,769 --> 00:31:37,586
makes you feel like Christmas,
don't you think?

379
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,920
Love you.

380
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,119
You still with me?

381
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
Yes

382
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,650
mommy's home!

383
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,329
Hello, my darling!
Guess what I brought you?

384
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,815
I bet you'll never guess...

385
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,320
Is it blue?

386
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,320
No, it's green.

387
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,679
Oh it's long isn't it.
Do you need scissors?

388
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,615
Maybe we should do the star first.

389
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,199
We can do that,
where's the star?

390
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,735
The gold or...

391
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,599
- You choose
- ok

392
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,639
that's my girl.

393
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,679
What do you think?

394
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,559
Good.

395
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:22,599
That is the most beautiful
tree in the whole wide world.

396
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,840
Were those pictures of me you were taking?
At the tree lot?

397
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,579
I'm sorry. I should have asked.

398
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,360
Don't apologize.

399
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,920
I've been trying to...

400
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,840
A friend of mine told me
I should be more interested. In humans.

401
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,840
And how's that going?

402
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,119
It's going well... actually.

403
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,599
I'm glad.

404
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,079
That's beautiful.

405
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,150
Is that what you want to be?

406
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
A photographer?

407
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,190
I think so. If I have any talent for it.

408
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,320
Isn't that something other people
let you know you have.

409
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
And all you can do is...

410
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Keep working.

411
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,440
Use what feels right.
Throw away the rest.

412
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,039
I suppose so.

413
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,800
Will you show me your work?

414
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,376
Sure. I mean, I haven't sold anything.

415
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,655
Or even shown a picture
to anyone who could buy one.

416
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,679
I don't even have a decent camera.

417
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,889
But they're all at my place.
Under the sink, mostly.

418
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,880
Invite me round.

419
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,440
Harge harge.
What's wrong?

420
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,476
Nothing. Does there have

421
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,559
to be a problem for me
to visit my wife?

422
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,679
That's not fair, harge.

423
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,840
We agreed that rindy
would stay with me until Christmas Eve.

424
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,456
What do you suggest I do?

425
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,016
You think I prefer traipsing

426
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,599
off to west palm beach
for the holiday?

427
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,400
It was all mother's idea

428
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,576
but I'm not... ready...
She's not packed,

429
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,576
she's asleep upstairs in bed!

430
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,175
What about my Christmas with my daughter?

431
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,456
I'm sorry, Carol,
but it can't be helped.

432
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,280
The flight's in the morning
you think I've packed already?

433
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Goddammit!

434
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,340
How do you know my wife?

435
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,340
Harge, please...

436
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,936
I... work at frankenberg's.
The department store.

437
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,815
I ordered a gift from her desk.
I forgot my gloves.

438
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
She returned them.
I thanked her...

439
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,239
That's bold.

440
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,679
Can I do anything?

441
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
Just... leave it be.

442
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,909
Okay, snow flake.
Gimme a big one.

443
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,000
You're going to have a wonderful Christmas,
I promise.

444
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,239
There's room for you in the car, mommy.
You can come with us!

445
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,960
Oh, darling…
I wish I could...

446
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
You know sometimes...

447
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,596
Mommies and daddies decide there isn't

448
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,840
enough room for them both
in the same place at the same time

449
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,036
anyway, mommy has to be here to make sure

450
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:59,360
Santa's elf doesn't give your gift
from mommy to another little girl.

451
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,239
You wouldn't want that, would you?

452
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,280
No.

453
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,159
I love you snowflake

454
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,400
you smell good.

455
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,280
You're drunk.

456
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,440
Harge, I'm very cold.

457
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,960
Let me get you some coffee.

458
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,039
I'm not drunk.

459
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,800
You can still come with us.
Go back a bag.

460
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,016
I can't do that.

461
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,079
Yes, you can.

462
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:45,416
What are you gonna do?

463
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,076
You're gonna stay here with Abby?

464
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,760
You're gonna stay
with the shop girl over there?

465
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,760
What are you gonna do?

466
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,615
Stop it. God damn it.

467
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,639
I put nothing past women like you. Carol.

468
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,639
You married a woman like me.

469
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,039
If you don't get in that car
with us right now?

470
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,199
Then what? Then it's over?

471
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,639
God damn you

472
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,199
you were never... cruel.

473
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,480
Harge.

474
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,679
I should call a cab.

475
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,045
And just when you think it

476
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,900
can't get any worse,
you run out of cigarettes.

477
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,416
Oh...
I... tell me where to go.

478
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
I'll buy some for you.
I don't mind really.

479
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,376
You don't have to run out in

480
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,639
- the middle of nowhere to buy cigarettes.
- I'm fine.

481
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,880
The next train's at 8.30.
I'll drive you to the station.

482
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,000
Hello?

483
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,655
Do you know what time it is, miss belivet?

484
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,679
- I'm sorry,
- it just rang...

485
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Hello?

486
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:09,840
I was... horrible. Earlier.

487
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,199
Will you forgive me?

488
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,159
Yes...

489
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,159
I mean

490
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,840
then will you... would you...
Let me... come see you tomorrow evening?

491
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,239
Alright, yes...

492
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,199
I want to... know.

493
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,960
I mean, I want to ask you... things.

494
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,239
But I'm not sure you want that.

495
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,679
Ask me. Things. Please.

496
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,856
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

497
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,215
Thank you Mrs. aird.

498
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,655
There he is.

499
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,096
Now will you talk to me?

500
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,096
I didn't want you to come
all the way down here

501
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,119
just... give it to me, straight, Fred.

502
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,159
What am I not to worry
about until after the holiday?

503
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,536
Jerry rix served some

504
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:49,719
papers this morning,
to my complete surprise.

505
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,360
Why don't you sit.

506
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,815
Why is it people think you're

507
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,599
going to take bad news better
if you're sitting down?

508
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,456
Rindy, harge took out an injunction

509
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,615
which denies you any access to
rindy until the custody hearing.

510
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:05,320
What?

511
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,715
Harge改 rindy唯
and I'm afraid harge has changed

512
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:11,880
his mind about joint custody.
He wants sole custody of rindy.

513
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,599
成 we've already
reached an agreement about custody.

514
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,920
What is this all about?

515
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,476
29号级庭院久式文 they'll be filing
the formal papers on the twenty-ninth

516
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,400
in district family court one. For
the, uh, permanent petition, that is.

517
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,936
Can he do this?
Is it... right?

518
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,599
合 I don't know if it's
right, but it's certainly legal.

519
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
On what grounds.

520
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,835
再处... listen.
Let's deal with

521
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,800
this after Christmas.
You'll have a chance to-

522
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,559
on. What. Grounds.

523
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,159
官考虑条款 they're petitioning the
judge to consider a morality clause.

524
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,239
A morality... what
the hell does that mean?

525
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,119
兜圈 Abby gerhard okay. I won't
mince words with you. Abby gerhard.

526
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,916
联 列似 also they're
suggesting similar associations

527
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,255
with, well they're alleging
evidence of a pattern of behave

528
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,840
列据 evidence of a pattern?

529
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,000
Abbyrindy教 Abby... Abby is
rindy's godmother. Abby is...

530
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,559
拥 拥rindy... if he can't
have me, I can't have rindy. That's…

531
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,215
I'm sorry.
But they seem serious.

532
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,239
When's
the custody hearing?

533
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,735
碰假积压案 that's hard to say, with
the holidays and a backlog of cases.

534
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,400
佳测 Fred your best guess, Fred.

535
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,559
中旬戏 中旬 not before the middle
of march. Could be middle of April.

536
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,000
Can I see her?

537
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,376
建议 not - let me put it this way
it would not be advisable under the

538
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,376
校室 at school?
In an office with a-

539
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,679
the
issue is not where

00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,436
场 -Carol 严肃控
surely a visit supervised

541
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,079
by a teacher or a -Carol, these
are serious allegations.

542
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,199
图联 forcing
contact before the hearing

543
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,476
调查 - you
simply invite further

544
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,679
scrutiny concerning your conduct.
My conduct!

545
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,559
Jesus Christ.

546
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,559
亲 I'm her mother
for god's sake.

547
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,679
条款 a morality clause.

548
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,800
I see

549
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,320
do you?

550
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:09,320
No

551
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,000
Rindy离言 there's nothing
moral about taking rindy from me.

552
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,619
张 yes,
that's it thank you.

553
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,480
Find what you wanted?

554
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,639
商 something for
someone at the store.

555
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,639
噢 oh that's nice of you.

556
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,320
趟 you should stop
by on Christmas sometime.

557
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,920
My mom's sort
of planning on it.

558
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,039
…... Christmas... that's
for families. I'd feel.. I don't know...

559
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,039
Terry you
are family, Terry.

560
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,076
集 I'm
thinking of putting

561
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,960
together a portfolio, you
know, of my pictures.

562
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,559
始 start taking portraits, even.
Apply for jobs.

563
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:26,215
报社或者纽约报 dannie...
Maybe at a newspaper.

564
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:27,416
Maybe at the times.
Dannie knows someone...

565
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,800
欧洲 have you been
thinking more about Europe?

566
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:32,599
Terry Terry?

567
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,199
What?

568
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,920
How many times
have you been in love?

569
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,079
Never.

570
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,079
Until you.

571
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,480
Don't lie. You told me about
those two other girls.

572
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,400
Come on. They were

573
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,719
I had sex with them.
That's not the same thing.

574
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,916
Meaning... I'm different

575
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,760
because you haven't...
Gone all the way with me?

576
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:01,840
No

577
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,119
Hey, what's this all about?

578
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,760
I love you. That's what's different.

579
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,480
Have you ever been in love with a boy?

580
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,800
No.

581
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,079
But you've heard of it?

582
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,255
Of course. I mean, have I heard of
people like that? Sure.

583
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,096
I don't mean people like that. I mean

584
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,936
two people who just...
Fall in love. With each other.

585
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Say, a boy and a boy.
Out of the blue.

586
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,960
I don't know anyone like that.

587
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,635
But I'll tell you this... there's

588
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:46,079
always some reason for it.
In the background.

589
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,360
So you don't think it could happen to somebody,

590
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,360
just anybody?
No. I don't.

591
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,239
What are you saying?
Are you in love with a girl?

592
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,280
No

593
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,800
Don't you know
I want to spend my life with you?

594
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,335
Come to France with me.
Let's get married.

595
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,119
Richard, I'm not... ready. For that.
I can't make myself...

596
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,360
What? Tell me.

597
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:14,679
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I'm sorry.

598
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,280
I found rindy's hair brush
underneath my pillow this morning.

599
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:25,519
Full of her hair.

600
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,496
She does that, you know,

601
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,719
to let me know she's been a good girl
and brushed properly.

602
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,000
I usually clean it out but
today, for some reason...

603
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,960
How could he. How dare he...
A morality what?

604
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,496
Clause, he said.

605
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,896
Carol if I'm responsible in any way

606
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,880
don't you dare

607
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,519
don't you ever.

608
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,936
Anyway, I've got my eye

609
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,639
on this redhead who owns a steak house
outside of paramus.

610
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,655
Rita Hayworth I'm talking...
Serious Rita Hayworth redhead.

611
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,360
Really? You think you have
what it takes to handle a redhead?

612
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,239
You going somewhere?

613
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,079
- West.
- I thought

614
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,519
at least for a few weeks until the hearing.

615
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,840
What else am I going to do?

616
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:36,480
I know you don't like to drive alone. So.

617
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,800
She's young.

618
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:45,840
Tell me you know what you're doing.

619
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,679
I don't.

620
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,599
I never did

621
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,079
your landlady let me in.

622
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,960
Merry Christmas.

623
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,559
Open it.

624
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:40,360
Oh Carol.

625
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:58,039
It's not that good. I was rushed,

626
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,039
I mean...
I can do better.

627
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:03,880
It's perfect.

628
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,480
Is this you?

629
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,199
Um-huh.

630
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,775
Do you keep anything in

631
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,239
the icebox besides photo chemicals?
I'm feeling...

632
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:25,239
Sure.

633
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,880
Is there any point in, I don't know...
Fighting it?

634
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:08,800
The injunction?

635
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:10,679
No.

636
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,519
I feel useless.

637
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,679
Like I can't help you or offer anything

638
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,239
it has nothing to do with you.

639
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,719
I'm going away for a while.

640
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,400
When?... where?

641
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:34,440
Wherever my car will take me.

642
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:36,559
West.

643
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:38,920
Soon.

644
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,119
And I thought...
Perhaps you might like to come with me.

645
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:53,960
Would you?

646
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,679
Yes.

647
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,039
Yes, I would.

648
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:15,440
You don't know her.

649
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,800
You can forward any mail to Chicago,
general post

650
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,079
I've paid the rent through February.
I had a little extra

651
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,360
some money I saved

652
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,335
Terry for our trip. Our trip, Terry.

653
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
And now you're...

654
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,840
I don't believe this is happening!

655
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,039
I can't explain it. I just...

656
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,295
You've got one hell

657
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,920
of a crush on this women...
Like a schoolgirl.

658
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:46,056
I do not
I just like her is all.

659
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,079
I'm fond of anybody I can really talk to.

660
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,119
Nice

661
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:53,159
you know what I think?

662
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,599
I think two weeks form now,
you'll be wishing that

663
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,119
she'll get tired of you, and then
you'll gonna wish you were never...

664
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:03,255
You don't understand

665
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,016
I do，I understand completely.
You're in a trance!

666
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,996
I'm wide awake. I've never

667
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:10,000
felt more awake.
Why don't you leave me alone?

668
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,199
Are we over?
Is that what this is?

669
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,416
I didn't say that.

670
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,956
But why should I want to

671
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,519
be with you if all you do
is argue about this?

672
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,076
- To say
- to say for a minute you

673
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:29,016
practically want to say goodbye
because of some silly crush!

674
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,039
I didn't say that.
You said it?

675
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:36,119
You made me buy boat tickets,
I got a better job for you...

676
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,480
I asked you to marry me,
for chrissakes.

677
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,916
I didn't make you do

678
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,320
anything. I never asked you for...
Anything.

679
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,079
Maybe that's the problem.

680
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:48,896
I swear to you, two weeks from

681
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,320
now you'll be begging me
to forget this ever!

682
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:54,335
Richard...
Richard!

683
00:58:54,360 --> 01:00:00,023
Have a great trip, Terry!

684
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,896
For you. Merry Christmas.

685
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,536
Oh no. You shouldn't have.

686
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,119
Open it.

687
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,360
I played it for you.
At your house.

688
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:34,719
I remember.

689
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,376
Thank you.

690
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,976
Oh god, I look a fright

691
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
no you do not,
you look wonderful.

692
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,519
Just stay like that.

693
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,320
Do you miss Richard?

694
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,760
No. I haven't thought about him all day.

695
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,159
Or of home. Really.

696
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,280
Home.

697
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:05,840
I have to speak to her.

698
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,440
What are you doing here?

699
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,880
You're supposed to be in Florida.

700
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,815
I couldn't do it.

701
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,599
Because rindy wanted
to be with her mother on Christmas.

702
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,856
Not that it's any of your business.

703
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,096
Just go get her.
I know she's here.

704
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,096
You've got some
fucking nerve ordering me around.

705
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:24,119
And, no. She's not here.

706
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:27,536
That's impossible.

707
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:29,536
She's not home.
She's not with me.

708
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:30,800
She must be with you.

709
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,476
You've spent ten years making

710
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,679
damned sure her only point
of reference is you,

711
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:42,135
your job, your friends, your family,
your...

712
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,159
Where is she. Goddamn it.

713
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,815
Abby she's still my wife, Abby.

714
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,856
She's my responsiblity.

715
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,396
You should have thought of that

716
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,960
before you slapped her
with that injunction.

717
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,880
I'm closing the door.

718
01:03:57,679 --> 01:03:58,800
I love her.

719
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,199
I can't help you with that.

720
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,719
Carol?

721
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,159
Therese, is that you?

722
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:49,175
Yes!

723
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:52,239
Would you be a sweetie and fetch
my red knit sweater?

724
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,695
It's in the big
suitcase on the bed.

725
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:55,400
Okay.

726
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:21,840
Hey, slowpoke...

727
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,000
Found it.

728
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,360
Thanks. Everything all right?

729
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,760
- I'm just
- suddenly starving.

730
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,719
I won't be a minute.

731
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,239
You hungry?

732
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,239
Sure.

733
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:53,599
Do you feel... safe.

734
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:56,376
With me, I mean?

735
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,239
You're full of surprises.

736
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,396
I mean you would tell me...

737
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,719
If something scared you.
And I could help.

738
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:10,280
I'm not frightened, therese.

739
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,416
Our standard rooms come equipped
with stereophonic console radios,

740
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,596
or if you prefer, the presidential

741
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,800
suite is available.
At a very attractive rate.

742
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:45,456
Two standard rooms should be fine.

743
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Why not take the presidential suite?

744
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,719
If the rate's attractive...

745
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:06,719
Can I help you with that?

746
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:09,760
Thank you.

747
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,760
It's so cold.

748
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,679
So cold, my glasses have fogged
right the way over.

749
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,480
Here you go.

750
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,719
Thanks again. G'night.

751
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,679
Night.

752
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,840
Don't blink.

753
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,400
There

754
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,519
I need lipstick.

755
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,000
Again.

756
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,639
Take a look at yourself.

757
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,880
Beautiful.

758
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,119
Next?

759
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,956
Would mademoiselle be so

760
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,800
kind as to apply at the pulse points only?

761
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,319
Me, too.

762
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,760
That's divine.

763
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:29,800
Smell that.

764
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:38,520
To president McKinley.

765
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,775
Good morning. Glad to see you
didn't freeze over or nothing.

766
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,720
You too.

767
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:24,239
I'm afraid the coffee is not very good

768
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:26,239
long as it's hot.

769
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,319
What's in the case?

770
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,279
Oh. Notions. I'm a
I sell them. Or try to.

771
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,935
Lousy coffee.

772
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,039
I'm sorry

773
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,880
excuse me?

774
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,216
We were just chatting.

775
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:46,239
Name's Tucker... Tommy

776
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,840
therese belivet Carol aird.

777
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:50,199
Pleased to meet you.

778
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,800
Mr. Tucker sells notions.

779
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,055
I see.

780
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:01,055
I don't really know what notions are.
Exactly.

781
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:03,015
But they do instruct us to use that word.

782
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:04,456
Sales appeals to women.

783
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:05,600
Do you sell lipstick?

784
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:08,680
No. But I have a sewing kit.

785
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,399
You don't need a sewing kit.
I can tell.

786
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,576
We should make Chicago

787
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,640
by five or six, if we get an early start.

788
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,336
I'm headeding.

789
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:22,015
There's a short cut across the

790
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:23,720
interstates, knocks three hours
off the drive.

791
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,239
Two hours that'll be something.

792
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,256
Can we stop to buy some magazines?

793
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,399
I have field and stream,
national geographic...

794
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,895
Popular photography?

795
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,560
Course not.
I am doomed to remain without a sale.

796
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:27,256
Is this alright?

797
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:28,479
Thank you so much.

798
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,880
Finally. A real bed.

799
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:36,880
Heaven.

800
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:42,520
And the furniture!

801
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,935
Good evening.

802
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,095
Table for two, please, for dinner.

803
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:03,975
Are you staying here at the hotel?

804
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,239
Yes, it's room...

805
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,319
623, Mrs. aird.

806
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,319
That'll be just a moment, Mrs. aird.

807
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,850
Therese belivet

808
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,439
hargess aird. Hello.

809
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,176
Someone's popular.

810
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,536
All from Richard.

811
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,935
Aren't you going to pick up your mail?

812
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,975
Nobody knows I'm here.

813
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,456
Were you... making a call?

814
01:13:58,479 --> 01:13:59,000
What?

815
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,520
Ladies room.

816
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:34,729
Happy new year.

817
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,189
Happy new year.

818
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:50,050
Harge and I never spend
new year's Eve together.

819
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,590
There's always a business function,
always clients to entertain.

820
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,609
I've always spent new year's Eve alone.
In crowds.

821
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:09,420
I'm not alone this year.

822
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:48,739
Take me to bed.

823
01:16:10,789 --> 01:16:12,630
I never looked like that.

824
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,510
You're trembling.

825
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,460
Don't. I want to see you.

826
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,520
My angel. Flung out of space.

827
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,510
What town is this again?

828
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:40,710
This? Waterloo. Isn't that awful?

829
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,105
You the folks in 42?

830
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,416
We're checking out.

831
01:18:57,439 --> 01:18:59,789
Telegram come for you last night.

832
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:04,680
When did this arrive?

833
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,670
Early. Seven. Nine. I ain't a clock, lady.

834
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:23,235
Where's my suitcase?

835
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,206
I put it in the back.

836
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:26,235
I want my fucking suitcase.

837
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,386
Carol...
What's going on?

838
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:28,359
Carol!

839
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,170
Carol what are you going to do with that?
What happened?

840
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,460
Carol, you're scaring me.

841
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,800
Where's the tape, you son of a bitch.

842
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,886
How much is harge paying

843
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:11,546
you for this? I'll give you double, triple.

844
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:12,296
Whatever you want.

845
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:13,536
I wish I could oblige you, ma'am.

846
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,456
But the tape is already on,
its way to your husband.

847
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:17,460
That can't be right.

848
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,649
My reputation rests on my efficiency,
Mrs. aird.

849
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,119
How do I know you're not lying?

850
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:27,770
You don't. Ma'am

851
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,399
how could you.

852
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:51,690
I am a professional,

853
01:20:51,715 --> 01:20:53,229
miss belivet. It's not personal.

854
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:57,270
Let's get out of here.

855
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:08,970
There's nothing we can do.
As soon as we got the telegram

856
01:21:10,489 --> 01:21:14,180
earliest flight into LaGuardia
is tomorrow afternoon...

857
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:19,006
Oh Abby, I don't know how to fix this...

858
01:21:19,029 --> 01:21:20,529
I haven't the strength...

859
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,110
What are you thinking?

860
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:37,985
You know how many times
a day I ask you that?

861
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,380
I'm sorry. What am I thinking?

862
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,826
I'm thinking that I'm utterlty selfish.
And I

863
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,975
don't do this. You had no idea.

864
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,805
How could you have known?

865
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:49,246
I should have said no to you.

866
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,569
But I can never say no.

867
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:57,345
And it's selfish because I take...
Everything.

868
01:21:57,369 --> 01:21:58,716
And I don't know...
Anything.

869
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,416
I don't know what I want.

870
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:03,050
How could I if I say yes to everything?

871
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:23,100
I took what you gave willingly.

872
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:39,090
It's not your fault, therese.
Alright.

873
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,855
Thank you, darling.

874
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,960
You know. Shattered. Sickened.

875
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:04,836
I hope so.

876
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:06,376
Anything else you need?

877
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,326
Talk tomorrow.

878
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,315
Try to get some sleep. And don't worry.

879
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,136
I will. And thank you.

880
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:12,149
Night

881
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,800
you don't have to sleep over there.

882
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,560
She's gone?

883
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:56,130
Early this morning.

884
01:24:57,819 --> 01:24:59,220
Is she coming back?

885
01:25:01,659 --> 01:25:02,130
No.

886
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,779
This is all my fault.

887
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,010
Nonsense.

888
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,020
We should get going.

889
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:25,789
Eat something.

890
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:30,029
Suit yourself.

891
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,826
Why do you hate me?
I've never done anything to you.

892
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,815
Do you think I've flown halfway

893
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,805
across the country to drive you back east

894
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:47,380
because I hate you,
and want to see you suffer?

895
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:50,746
It's for Carol. Not for me.

896
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,390
That's...

897
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:05,939
With you and Carol, what happened?

898
01:26:06,909 --> 01:26:09,440
Carol it's completely different.

899
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:12,020
I've known Carol since
I was 10 years old.

900
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,619
It was five or six years ago. Summer

901
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:25,876
late one night.

902
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:29,920
My Ford broke down at my mother's house.

903
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,739
We tried to stay up, but...

904
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:39,206
Curled up together in my old twin bed.

905
01:26:39,229 --> 01:26:44,520
And that was it... for a while.

906
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:50,355
And then it changed.

907
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,529
It changes.

908
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,079
Nobody's fault.

909
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,229
So

910
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,079
Here, she...

911
01:27:27,729 --> 01:27:32,539
Dearest. There are no accidents

912
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,770
and he would have found us
one way or another.

913
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:41,880
Everything comes full circle.

914
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,979
Be grateful it was sooner rather than later.

915
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:50,985
You'll think it harsh of me to say so,

916
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:54,560
but no explanation I offer will satisfy you.

917
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:00,945
Please don't be angry when I tell you

918
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:05,810
that you seek resolutions
and explanations because you're young.

919
01:28:06,609 --> 01:28:09,310
But you will understand this one day.

920
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:39,996
And when it, happens,
I want you to imagine me there

921
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,159
to greet you.

922
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:47,210
Our lives stretched out ahead of us,
a perpetual sunrise.

923
01:29:00,529 --> 01:29:04,996
But until then,
there must be no contact between us.

924
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:10,729
I have much to do, and you,
my darling, even more.

925
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:16,229
Please believe that I would do anything
to see you happy

926
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:43,270
and so I do the only thing I can...
I release you.

927
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:12,510
Hello?

928
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:17,170
Carol?

929
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:41,220
I miss you...
I miss you.

930
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:12,815
Therese, these are seriously

931
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,706
good. I mean, they really capture...
Whoever this is.

932
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:19,380
They're just practice.

933
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:32,310
You really wanna put together a portfolio.

934
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,265
Say the word,
I'll introduce you to my pal at the times.

935
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:40,640
There's always a clerk job going.

936
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,810
You went away with her, right?

937
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,760
Yes.

938
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:54,609
What happened?

939
01:32:56,369 --> 01:33:00,640
Ohh. Nothing. It's hard to...

940
01:33:02,569 --> 01:33:04,815
Is it because I tried to kiss you that day?

941
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,211
Because if it is, don't even think

942
01:33:07,234 --> 01:33:09,605
about that, I mean, don't be afraid of...

943
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:10,630
I'm not afraid.

944
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,140
Let's finish while we still have light, okay?

945
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:29,706
I still think you have to put together that portfolio.

946
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:31,159
Okay.

947
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,659
More mashed potatoes, Carol?

948
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,340
Yes, thanks. They look delicious.

949
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:51,680
Thank you..

950
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,121
Chestermarge rindy I thought...
Maybe...

951
01:34:02,145 --> 01:34:05,409
Chester and Marge would be here...
With rindy..

952
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:08,630
Marge said to go ahead, not to wait.

953
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,149
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

954
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,485
Harge tells us you've been

955
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:21,395
getting along quite well
with your doctor, Carol.

956
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,815
And why shouldn't she be getting on well.

957
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,590
He is a very expensive doctor.

958
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:30,880
Actually he's not a doctor
but a psychotherapist.

959
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:35,945
Well he is very well regarded.

960
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,225
A Yale man, like your uncle.

961
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,029
Does that make him a doctor?

962
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,470
But I do like him.
Very much. He's been a great help.

963
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:02,615
Oh baby...
My baby girl…

964
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,689
mommy!

965
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,880
Look how much you've grown.

966
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,829
Give me a big squeeze.

967
01:35:15,229 --> 01:35:18,909
That's a long trip,
you must be hungry sweetheart.

968
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,479
You want something to eat?

969
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:33,065
Stay. Stay.

970
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,449
Don't be daft.

971
01:36:44,949 --> 01:36:47,619
I don'y know if I can keep it happen,
Abby.

972
01:36:53,029 --> 01:36:57,420
How many more
tomato aspic lunches...

973
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:04,100
Then I come home every night without her.

974
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:07,239
To what like this!

975
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,819
And therese?

976
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,445
What about her?

977
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:20,739
Have you heard anything?

978
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:26,989
Oh no. No.

979
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:31,456
It's been over a month since she tried to call.

980
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:39,460
Nothing since then. I wish I...

981
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:44,296
Have you? Heard anything?

982
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:45,989
From therese? No.

983
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,869
She must have started her job at the times,
though.

984
01:37:57,729 --> 01:38:04,920
I should have said: Therese. Wait.

985
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,409
Who the hell is turning around in my drive?

986
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:17,576
I should go.

987
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,466
You don't have to.

988
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:20,649
I do.

989
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,305
We expect given the seriousness of the charges

990
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:28,966
and the incontestability of the evidence,

991
01:39:28,989 --> 01:39:33,115
the court will grant solo custody
of the child to my client.

992
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,310
Not so fast, Jerry.

993
01:39:34,909 --> 01:39:38,416
My client's psychotherapist is perfectly satisfied

994
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:40,805
with her recovery from...
The events of the winter

995
01:39:40,829 --> 01:39:43,956
and is more than capable of caring
for her child.

996
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:48,130
She's had no further contact
with the girl in question.

997
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,631
We have the sworn

998
01:39:50,654 --> 01:39:52,636
depositions of two saddlebrook
institute psychiatrists

999
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:55,176
clearly stating that, in their opinions,

1000
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,716
a series of events, precipitated
by my client's husband,

1001
01:39:57,739 --> 01:39:59,926
drove her to suffer an emotional break.

1002
01:39:59,949 --> 01:40:01,636
Which resulted in this described behavior.

1003
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:02,746
That's absurd!

1004
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:03,515
Furthermore…

1005
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:06,546
alright Fred this is how you're going to play this.

1006
01:40:06,569 --> 01:40:06,820
Furthermore, given the manner in which

1007
01:40:06,845 --> 01:40:07,095
these tapes were obtained and recorded

1008
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,550
we're confident in their inadmissability...

1009
01:40:09,369 --> 01:40:10,725
Okay. First off, I'd

1010
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,130
like to see these depositions. And second...

1011
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,979
Fred... please.
Don't... may I speak?

1012
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,136
I won't deny the truth of what's contained
in those tapes.

1013
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:18,926
This is off the record, honey.

1014
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:20,170
Might as well be on the record.

1015
01:40:22,869 --> 01:40:28,340
Harge. I nwant you to be happy.

1016
01:40:29,619 --> 01:40:33,126
I didn't give you that.
I failed you.

1017
01:40:33,149 --> 01:40:34,626
We both could have given. More.

1018
01:40:34,649 --> 01:40:38,409
But we gave each other rindy,

1019
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:45,210
and that's the most breathtaking,
the most generous of gifts.

1020
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:48,430
Why are we spending so

1021
01:40:48,454 --> 01:40:50,819
much time trying to keep
her from each other.

1022
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:57,315
What happened with therese,
I wanted.

1023
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:03,305
And I will not deny it or say that I reg..

1024
01:41:03,329 --> 01:41:06,216
But I do regret, I grieve

1025
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,149
the mess we're about to make
of our child's life.

1026
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:12,819
Harge we are both responsible.

1027
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,810
Let's set it right.

1028
01:41:22,539 --> 01:41:27,326
I think that harge should have custody of rindy.

1029
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,260
Could I suggest that let's take a break, folks

1030
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,855
Fred, no.

1031
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,445
Fred. Let me have my speak.

1032
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,416
Because if you don't...

1033
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:35,369
I won't be able to cope

1034
01:41:37,319 --> 01:41:38,095
I'm no martyr.

1035
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:40,836
I have no clue what's best for me.

1036
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:42,515
But I do know. I feel it

1037
01:41:42,539 --> 01:41:44,220
in my bones what is best for my daughter.

1038
01:41:47,449 --> 01:41:49,286
I want visits with her, harge.

1039
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,826
I don't care if they're supervised.

1040
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:52,539
But they need to be regular.

1041
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,680
There was a time when
I would've done most anything

1042
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:04,569
I would've locked myself away
to keep rindy with me.

1043
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,841
But what use am

1044
01:42:08,864 --> 01:42:11,569
I to her, to us,
living against my own grain

1045
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,676
so that's the deal.

1046
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:17,006
I won't... I cannot negotiate anymore.

1047
01:42:17,029 --> 01:42:19,039
Take it or leave it.

1048
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:23,409
If you leave it, we go to court.

1049
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:28,275
We go to court and it will get ugly.

1050
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,430
We're not ugly people, harge.

1051
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,770
Carol, Carol.

1052
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,260
Belivet

1053
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,199
hand delivered. Swank.

1054
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,300
I wasn't sure you'd come.

1055
01:44:57,399 --> 01:44:59,326
It's nice of you to see me.

1056
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:00,350
Don't say that.

1057
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,595
Do you hate me, therese?

1058
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:08,279
How could I hate you?

1059
01:45:16,579 --> 01:45:18,546
Abby tells me you're thriving.

1060
01:45:18,569 --> 01:45:22,515
You've no idea
how pleased I am for you.

1061
01:45:22,539 --> 01:45:26,340
You look very fine, you know.

1062
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,645
As if you've suddenly blossomed.

1063
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:33,676
Is that what comes
of getting away from me?

1064
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:34,449
No.

1065
01:45:44,609 --> 01:45:47,435
What?

1066
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,789
Nothing.

1067
01:45:53,569 --> 01:45:56,655
Harge and I are selling the house.

1068
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,689
I've taken an apartment on Madison Avenue.

1069
01:46:01,829 --> 01:46:04,605
And a job, believe it or not.

1070
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:06,886
I'm going to work for a

1071
01:46:06,909 --> 01:46:09,189
furniture house on fourth Avenue as a buyer.

1072
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,539
Have you seen rindy?

1073
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,449
Once or twice.

1074
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,176
She's living with harge for now.

1075
01:46:22,199 --> 01:46:26,149
It's the right thing.

1076
01:46:30,949 --> 01:46:40,159
Anyway, the apartment's a nice big one...
Big enough for two.

1077
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,595
I was hoping you might
like to come and live with me,

1078
01:46:44,619 --> 01:46:50,869
but I guess you won't. Would you?

1079
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:57,750
I don't think so.

1080
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:03,081
I'm meeting some people

1081
01:47:03,104 --> 01:47:05,475
at the furniture house
at the oak room at nine.

1082
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,475
If you want to have dinner...

1083
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,555
If you change your mind...

1084
01:47:09,579 --> 01:47:10,659
I think you'd like them.

1085
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:25,010
Well. That's that.

1086
01:47:40,069 --> 01:47:41,460
I love you.

1087
01:47:43,779 --> 01:47:45,489
Therese? Is that you?

1088
01:47:47,489 --> 01:47:48,569
What do you know!

1089
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,426
I'm saying to myself, I know that girl.

1090
01:47:51,449 --> 01:47:52,265
Jack.

1091
01:47:52,289 --> 01:47:53,445
It's great to see you, therese.

1092
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:54,775
It's been, well, months.

1093
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,500
Months.

1094
01:47:56,039 --> 01:47:57,909
Jack, this is Carol aird.

1095
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,445
Pleased to meet you.

1096
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,380
Likewise.

1097
01:48:00,909 --> 01:48:03,845
Hey, Ted gray's meeting me here

1098
01:48:03,869 --> 01:48:05,676
and a bunch of us are going down
to Phil's party.

1099
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:07,126
You're going aren't you?

1100
01:48:07,149 --> 01:48:09,326
Yes. I just planned to get there a little...

1101
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:10,210
You should go ahead.

1102
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,659
You coming along?

1103
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:13,595
No.

1104
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:16,140
I should make a few calls before dinner,
anyway.

1105
01:48:17,029 --> 01:48:18,369
I should really run.

1106
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:20,560
You sure?

1107
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:22,279
Of course.

1108
01:48:26,289 --> 01:48:28,206
Well, it would be great to catch a ride.

1109
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:29,319
Yeah, sure.

1110
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,826
You two have a wonderful night.

1111
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:36,275
Nice meeting you, Jack.

1112
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,189
Nice meeting you.

1113
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:45,006
Alright, well let me go

Back in a flash.

1121
01:49:51,979 --> 01:49:55,989
Nothing! There better be beer. Or wine.

1122
01:50:41,739 --> 01:50:44,386
You can have her, she's one

1123
01:50:44,409 --> 01:50:47,055

phonies if you ask me.

01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:49,206
I'm gonna remember that. Charles.

1125
01:50:49,229 --> 01:50:53,140
Where are you going Ted?
Stick around a minute.

1126
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:57,555

01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:02,520
Aren't you going to ask me how I knew that?

1129
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,689
Aren't most people here Phil's friends?

1130
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:08,819
I can see why Phil speaks so highly of you.

1131
01:51:10,039 --> 01:51:10,810
Can you?

1132
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,689
Sorry I'll be out in a minute.

1133
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:33,155
Do you have a reservation?

1134
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,756

01:52:34,779 --> 01:52:36,619

00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,036
It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

176
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,711
You scared the shit out of me.

177
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,756
I'm sorry about the theatrics,
but we had no choice.

178
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,259
The police have been
a pain in the ass lately.

179
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,885
How have you been?

180
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,638
THEO: Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

181
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
Cut the lights.

182
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,069
The police keep using
that old photo of you in the posters.

183
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,405
It doesn't do you justice.

184
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,282
What do the police
know about justice?

185
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,700
What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

186
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,328
PATRIC: The Fishes fight for equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain!

187
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,370
LUKE: He knows what we do.

188
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,414
I know you almost blew me up
in a coffee shop yesterday.

189
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,498
My ears are still ringing.

190
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
LUKE: We don't bomb.
PATRIC: That was the government.

191
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,168
That's what they do to spread the fear.

192
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,252
What about Liverpool?

193
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,962
JULIAN: After Liverpool,
we stopped bombing.

194
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,881
We started speaking to the people.

195
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,592
And they're joining us, Theo.
British people, too.

196
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,510
I don't talk politics.

197
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,928
That's all you ever used to do.

198
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,680
That was 20 years ago.

199
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,682
I'm a lot more successful now.

200
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,684
Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

201
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,270
-IAN: I don't think that's a good idea.
-Come on!

202
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,237
You're smoking?

203
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,947
Yeah. It's not working.

204
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,159
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

205
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,828
Were your parents in New York
when it happened?

206
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,705
-Yeah.
-Shit.

207
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,708
Yeah, well, that's the world
we live in now, isn't it?

208
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,461
Why am I here, Jules?

209
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,713
I need your help.
I need transit papers.

210
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,257
Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

211
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,386
Need to get her to the coast,
past security checkpoints.

212
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,223
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years
and you come asking me for transit papers?

213
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,432
Can you do it?

214
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,101
I don't see how.

215
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,685
You could ask your cousin.

216
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,523
The government finances
his Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.

217
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,607
Yeah, but he'd never do it.

218
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,234
He would if you asked him.

219
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,986
I can't. It's too dangerous.

220
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,284
I can get you £5,000.
I know you need the money.

221

222
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,704
What are you talking about?

223
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,873
I don't fucking need your money.

224
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,834
Right. Sorry.

225
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,461
My mistake.

226
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,679
You know that ringing
in your ears? That...

(IMITATING RINGING)

228
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,810
That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
Like their swan song.

229
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,063
Once it's gone,
you'll never hear that frequency again.

230
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,357
Enjoy it while it lasts.

231
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,736
This never fucking happened,

232
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,031
so don't go telling tales,
'cause we'll be watching you.

233
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,576
At work, when you sleep,

234
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,205
when you have a piss, we'll be watching.
All the fucking time.

235
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,291
THEO: Jeez, your breath stinks.

236
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,461
-No, it doesn't.
-Yes, it does.

237
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,171
LUKE: It was Julian's idea bringing you here.

238
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,047
She put herself at great risk.

239
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,341
Now you know about
the five grand we can offer you.

240
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,634
So if you change your mind,

241
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,345
pin this to the notice board
at Camden tube. We'll do the rest.

242
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,896

Disease and famine!

245
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,108
Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!

246
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,781
And in his anger he has taken away
his most precious gift to us!

247

Mr. Faron, the minister is
expecting you. This way, sir.

248
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,574
I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.

249
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,701
You got something in your teeth.

250
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,627
If you'll excuse me.

251
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,693
Couldn't save La Pietà.
Smashed up before we got there.

252

Pretty rummy, huh?

253
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,824
THEO: My mom had a plastic one
in the bathroom.

254
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,827
It was a lamp.

255
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,622
Good to see you, Theo.

256
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,920
NIGEL: We got to keep
Las Meninas and a few other Velásquezes,

257
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,673
but we only got a hold of two Goyas.

258
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,842
That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.

259
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,344
THEO: Not to mention people.

260
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,762
How's Martha?

Sends her love.

-Yes.

Well, the thing is,

265
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,824
I met this girl.

266
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,034
Cute?

267
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,786
Beautiful.

268
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,204
Is it serious?

269
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,914
Very.

270
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,337
She's got this brother in Brighton and
she hasn't seen him for about five years,

271
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,255
and he's not doing too good.

272
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,841
I mean, pretty sick.

273
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,261
I don't think he's gonna make it.

274
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,429
Sorry.

275
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,100
I've got money.
I was just hoping that you might...

276
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,783
I was hoping you could get us
the transit papers to get to the coast.

277
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,411
Transit papers?
That's quite a favor.

278

Hang on. We got a problem.

All I could get were joint transit papers,

300
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,534
which means I would have to escort the girl.

00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,369
Will you?

00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,747
Gone. Bye.

524
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,292
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

525
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,713
It's wacko. Why not make machines
that suck eight titties?

526
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:36,759
Is that what you want to talk about?
Cows and titties?

527
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,802
Julian told me about your baby.

528
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,846
Said his name was Dylan.

529
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:45,392
You taught him to swim when he was two.
He called you "Papa."

530
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,271
She said if anything goes spooky,
I should talk to you.

531
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,316
Said you'd help me,
said you'd get me to the boat.

532
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,276
-What boat?
-The Tomorrow.

533
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,569
The Tomorrow?

534
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,739
I don't know what you're talking about.

535
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,908
But I'm sure your friends
can take care of you.

536
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,077
But Julian said only trust you.

537
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,245
She said you'd help me.

538
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,331
I don't know why she said that.

539
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,626
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

540
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,710
You can't leave.

541
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,170
Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

542
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,630
-I'm sorry.
-Wait!

543
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,509
What are you doing? Don't do that.

544
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,363
I'm scared.

545
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,662
Please help me.

546
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,836
Jesus Christ.

547
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,463
LUKE: Kee! Kee!
MIRIAM: What are you doing?

548
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,466
Are you all right?

549
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,802
She wanted him to know.
She has the right.

550
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,346
Of course she has.

551
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,556
For God's sake.

552
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,392
When you're ready, come inside.
Everybody's arrived.

553
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,977
She's pregnant.

554
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,687
Now you know what's at stake.

555
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:16,900
But she's pregnant.

556
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,277
Yeah, I know.

557
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,655
It's a miracle, isn't it?

558
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,831
Fishes terrorist leader
Julian Taylor was killed today

559
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,459
in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.

560
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,504
Four other terrorists escaped
after murdering two officers.

561
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,592
Police say they have sufficient
forensic and surveillance evidence

562
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,510
to identify the four killers.

563
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,598
All suspects should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

564
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,768
This was broadcast an hour ago.

565
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,770
We have to assume
it's just a matter of time

566
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,646
before they identify the rest of us,

567
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:55,814
which includes you, Theo.

568
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,399
WOMAN: Why is he here?
MAN: He's not a Fish.

569
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,442
He's not one of us.

570
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,610
KEE: I want him here.

571
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,528
LUKE: Kee wants him, he stays.

572
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,115
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

573
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,158
ALL: Right.

574
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,451
Now we got to reevaluate that position.

575
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,788
No, there's no need.
We move forward with the original plan.

576
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:11,914
Yes!

577
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,166
She'll never make it.
The police are looking for her.

578
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,627
We can find a way.
It's what Julian wanted.

579
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,128
We'd be risking the girl's life.

580
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,672
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

581
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,841
And this baby is the flag
that could unite us all!

582
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,302
MIRIAM: We said we'd never use
this baby for political purposes.

583
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,595
KEE: My baby's not a flag.

584
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,222
Make it public!

585
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
WOMAN: What?

586
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,099
-What?
-What?

587
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,226
Excuse me?

588
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,395
You should make it public.

589
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,732
You saw the telly.
She's about to be very public.

590
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,109
THEO: It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

591
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,529
Oh, right. And then
the government will say,

592
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,031
"We were wrong.
Fugees are humans, too."

593
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,241
Well, whatever is going on,

594
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,451
whatever your political ideas are,
it's irrelevant.

595
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,911
-It doesn't matter.
-WOMAN 1: Come on.

596
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,830
-She needs a doctor.
-MAN: You really don't get it.

597
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,998
WOMAN 2: Look, the government
will take her baby

598
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,084
and parade a posh black
English lady as the mother.

599
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,961
-And she'll never see it again.
-KEE: Nobody's taking my baby!

600
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,213
We all know this government
would never acknowledge

601
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,298
the first human birth
in 18 years from a fugee.

602
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,508
A wanted fugee.

603
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,678
Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron
what they do to immigrants in this country?

604
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,764
MIRIAM: He knows.
He's seen the cages. He's not that stupid.

605
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,391
KEE: I'm not going to the government.

606
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,476
You told me you would
get me to the Human Project.

607
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,936
-You promised me.
-I know.

608
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,563
And we will.

609
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,942
But I don't think it's safe to
try and reach the coast now.

610
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,947
You could stay here, Kee.
It's a safe place for you to have your child.

611
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,866
And when you and the baby are well enough,

612
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,201
we will find a way to
get you to the Human Project.

613
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,244
I promise you, Kee.

614
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,581
It could take months
to get back in touch with them again.

615
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,127
This is true.
We have to take it under consideration.

616
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,463
Kee, this is your decision.

617
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,384
What do you think?

618
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:50,971
I think you need proper care.

619
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,097
EMILY: Oh, brilliant!

620
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,682
She has proper care!

621
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,310
-What the fuck does he know?
-Hang on. Kee?

622
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,062
Kee, this is your choice.

623
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,901
-I have my baby here...
-Yes!

624
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,444
...then you get me
to the Human Project.

625
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,529
Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

626
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,573
LUKE: We need to organize safe houses.

627
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,991
No more than three days in one place.

628
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,826
MIRIAM: No, no, you can't
keep moving her around.

629
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,244
LUKE: It's for her safety.

630
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,767
PATRIC: Please help him!

631
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,935
RADO: What are you doing?

632
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,937
-He's hurt really badly!
-Oh, shit, fuck.

633
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,146
PATRIC: I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

634
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,272
You're not supposed
to be here!

635
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,440
There's fucking
police everywhere!

636
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,943
-What do you think you're doing?
-He's been bleeding for hours!

637
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,362
LUKE: Shut up! Get his bike
out of here. Get it out!

638
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,126
PATRIC: What was I supposed to do?

639
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,338
LUKE: It's a simple fucking plan.
Get in here, Patric!

640
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,967
What the fuck are you doing here?

641
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,051
No fucking excuses!

642
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,469
IAN: You have a first aid kit? Medicine?

643
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,845
TOMASZ: Mostly for cows.

644
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,472
Iodine, bandages, clean towels,

645
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,932
whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

646
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,725
And for God's sake,
hide the fucking motorcycle.

647
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,977
IAN: You put everything at risk.

648
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,228
PATRIC: What was I supposed to do?

649
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,691
What about all the fucking police, Ian?
You said it would be safe!

650
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,319
IAN: We paid the gang.
We had no idea about the cops.

651
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,911
IAN: You broke the protocol.
What were you thinking?

652
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,329
PATRIC: What was I thinking?

653
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,707
You could be responsible
for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

654
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,083
He needs a proper doctor!

655
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,626
Don't you get it?

656
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,836
We have a baby.

657
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,256
When people see we have a baby,
everyone will join us in the Uprising.

658
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,676
But we can forget about the baby
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

659
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,094
What was I supposed to do?

660
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,014
You saw how he is.
He's on death's fucking door!

661
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,306
-LUKE: Take it easy.
-You broke protocol.

662
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,017
He's my fucking cousin!

663
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,687
Luke, he needs a doctor.

664
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,065
Don't worry.
We'll take care of him. Simon, right?

665
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,191
Aye, Simon.

666
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,484
All right, sit down, Patric.

667
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,863
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

668
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,491
Be proud to know that because of
the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

669
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,702
The baby will stay with us.

670
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,081
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

671
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,917
No. Tomorrow.
We'll do him then, after we move the girl.

672
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:30,547
Patric, you ever break protocol again,

673
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,717
I'll have to kill you.

674
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,810
(MIRIAM SNORING)

675
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,231
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

676
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,941
-Listen to me.
-KEE: What's going on?

677
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:54,196
Luke killed Julian.
They want your baby. They killed Julian.

678
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,032
They're gonna...
They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

679
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,825
We have to leave. We have to go now.

680
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,577
Miriam, shut up!

681
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,704
Trust me, we've got to go.

682
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,332
Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

683
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,084
Get off!

684
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,796
I'm going with him.
Miriam, you can stay if you want.

685
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,509
Miriam, you have to
keep your mouth shut.

686
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,677
-I mean it.
-All right. All right.

687
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,160
LUKE: We're moving the girl
to Bristol straight away.

688
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,998
We need to bring weapons over...

689
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,669
The refugee camps...

690
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,469
RADO: Zaphyr,
he looks bloody fucking awful.

691
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,595
ZAPHYR: Yeah. Really?

692
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,098
All that dirt and sand in there,
nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

693
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,641
Shit! It's fucking disgusting.

694
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,892
He's not gonna make it.

695
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,646
Of course not gonna make it,
with all the blood and guts coming out.

696
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,067
RADO: Hey, Samir.

697

699
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,438
THEO: Shit.

700
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,703
Stop! Stop the car!
Stop the fucking car!

701
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,580
LUKE: Don't shoot!

702
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,666
Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

703
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,668
-Stop!
-LUKE: The girl's in the car!

704
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,504
Stop the fucking car!
Give me the fucking keys.

705
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,423
Give me the fucking keys.

706
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,842
MIRIAM: Get down! Get down!

707
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,638
Can't you get it moving any faster?
For God's sake!

708
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,181
Come on. Come on.

709
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,099
LUKE: Stop!

710
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,726
Stop!

711
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,102
THEO: Shit.

712
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,147
KEE: They're coming!
They're coming!

713
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,651
MIRIAM: Get going, get going!
They're getting closer!

714
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,616
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

715
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,495
Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

716

719

Wait till it gets faster!

720
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,398
All right! All right!
Just push, you push!

721
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,615

I'm fine.

728

MIRIAM: We need to find a safe house.

was really fucking safe.

730
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,852
MIRIAM: Well, what do you suggest?

731
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,396
THEO: Don't worry. I know where to go.

732
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,173
Wait here.

733
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,719
Oh, fuck.

734
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,490
Fuck.

735
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,620
Jasper?

736
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,789
Janice?

737
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,306
Jasper?

738
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,522
Oh, fuck!

739
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,981
Oh, fuck you.

740
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,943
What are you doing with this shit?

741
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:29,322
This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.

742
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,908
It's not bullshit what they say.

743
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,701
They pass away quite peacefully.

744
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,161
Jasper.

745
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,123
Meet Miriam and Kee.

746
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,971
MIRIAM: The Tomorrow is
a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat.

747
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,597
They'll take us to the Human Project.

748
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,851
I told you, amigo,
the Human Project is real.

749
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,311
Yeah, but you're also the guy
that believes in UFOs.

750
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,106
Tell them about that thing
you saw on the heath.

751
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,524
You saw a UFO?

752
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,653
Did you know that the Human Project

753
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,822
is supposed to have
a community on the Azores?

754
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,783
It's a sanctuary.
That's where they'll take us, Kee.

755
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,702
Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

756
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:20,790
It's going to stop at the last two
weather buoys en route at sunset.

757
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,836
So it will be tonight at Windsmore
and then two night's time at Bexhill.

758
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,046
You can forget about Windsmore.
We'd never make it in time.

759
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,048
No, it's our only chance.
We can't get to Bexhill.

760
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,467
That's a refugee camp.

761
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,469
Eureka! Eat and rest.

762
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:36,055
With a little bit of luck,
you're going to need all your energy.

763
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,557
Where are you going?

764
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,058
Feed her for me, Theo.

765
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,979
Kee, your baby is the miracle

766
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,398
the whole world
has been waiting for.

767
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,900
Shantih, shantih, shantih.

768
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,527
Come on. Come on.

769
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,446
Shantih, shantih, shantih.

770
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,073
Did he really see a UFO?

771
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,326
KEE: Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

772
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,288
She's doing something.

773
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,917
She smited me with that.
Said it was good for my baby.

774
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,421
Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

775
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,470
Earnest.

776
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,555
(KEE LAUGHING)

777
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,973
Yeah.

778
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,476
How many months?

779
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,644
Eight.

780
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,604
It takes nine months.

781
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:07,981
I know.

782
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,483
Who's the father?

783
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,153
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

784
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,738
Sorry?

785
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,116
(KEE LAUGHING)

786
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,828
That'd be wicked, eh?

787
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,329
Yeah, it would.

788
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,916
Fuck knows. I don't know
most of the wankers' names.

789
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,254
You know, when I started puking,
I thought I catch the pest.

790
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,798
But then my belly started getting big.

791
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,552
Nobody ever told me these things.

792
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,596
I never seen a pregnant woman before.

793
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,180
But I knew.

794
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,850
I felt like a freak.

795
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,019
I didn't tell nobody.

796
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:51,691
I thought about the Quietus thing.
Supposed to be suave.

797
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,860
Pretty music and all that.

798
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,531
Then the baby kicked.

799
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:03,661
I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
And I feel it. And me, too.

800
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,580
I am alive.

801
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,546
Froley.

802
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,008
Name my baby Froley.

803
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,678
It's the first baby in 18 years.

804
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,473
-You can't call it Froley.
-Says who?

805
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,808
Kee, I've found you a boat.

806
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,976
-KEE: Great.
-How?

807
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,311
We get ourselves arrested.

808
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,354
-Oh, Jesus.
-No, no.

809
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:33,399
Syd, this border guard I sell pot to,
has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

810
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,569
Nicely ironic, eh?
We break into prison!

811
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,823
Wicked.

812
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,818
"Froley."

813
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,154
Come on.

814
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:31,165
JASPER: Everything is
a mythical cosmic battle

815
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,669
between faith and chance.

816
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,587
MIRIAM: Maybe I shouldn't.

817
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,965
You already did.
Take another one.

818
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,677
Now cough.

819
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,137
(COUGHING)

820
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,347
What do you taste?

821
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,724
MIRIAM: Strawberries.

822
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,018
Strawberries?
That's what it's called. Strawberry Cough.

823
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,103
(LAUGHING)

824
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,229
KEE: Wicked.

825
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:57,608
So, you've got faith over here, right,
and chance over there.

826
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,694
-MIRIAM: Like yin and yang.
-Sort of.

827
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,571
MIRIAM: Or Shiva and Shakti.

828
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,697
Lennon and McCartney.

829
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,450
KEE: Look, Julian and Theo.

830
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,701
Yeah, there you go.

831
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,912
Julian and Theo met among
a million protestors in a rally

832
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,247
by chance.

833
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,041
But they were there
because of what they believed in

834
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,793
in the first place, their faith.

835
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,670
They wanted to change the world.

836
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,506
And their faith kept them together.

837
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,177
But by chance, Dylan was born.

838
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,845
This is him?

839
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,683
Yeah, that's him. He would have been
about your age. Magical child.

840
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,019
Beautiful.

841
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,355
-Their faith put in praxis.
-Praxis?

842
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,482
MIRIAM: What happened?

843
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,608
Chance.

844
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,943
He was their sweet little dream.

845
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:44,363
He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

846
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,700
Little lungs.

847
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:52,705
And in 2008,
along came the flu pandemic.

848
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,709
And then, by chance,

849
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,503
he was gone.

850
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,712
MIRIAM: Oh, Jesus.

851
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,217
You see, Theo's faith

852
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,053
lost out to chance.

853
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,555
So,

854
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,894
why bother if life's going
to make its own choices?

855
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:18,022
KEE: Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
JASPER: Yeah.

856
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,482
MIRIAM: Oh, boy. That's terrible.

857
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:23,194
But, you know,
everything happens for a reason.

858
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,779
JASPER: That I don't know.

859
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,199
But Theo and Julian would
always bring Dylan. He loved it here.

860
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,663
(ALARM SOUNDING IN DISTANCE)

861
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,253
(ALARM BLARING)

862
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,757
JASPER: It's the alarm!
Someone's breaking in!

863
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,425
What is it?

864
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,927
Look at this.

865
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,598
Shit.

866
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,525
Jasper, hurry up!

867
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,279
Where's Janice?

868
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,740
Take the back path to the main road,
then follow the map I've given Miriam.

869
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,033
-Yeah, I've got it.

1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,880
We're getting straight gammas...

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,480
...every half pulse at irregular intervals.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,280
Let's move to right ascension 23 hours,
5 minutes.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,440
What the hell is going on out here?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,440
Alpha Orionis is going supernova.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,840
Sometime in the next 100 million years.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,200
-Thursday.
-Excuse me?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,720
Thursday. It's going supernova Thursday.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
lf Alpha Orionis
Were about to go supernova...

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,240
...there would be silicon flashes...

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,720
...neutrino emissions....

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Even in daylight,
We would be able to see....

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,720
You predicted this?

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,640
Excuse me, Sam, I know you're busy...

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,320
...but it's almost noon.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,040
It's almost noon.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,240
It's noon, everybody. Let's go!

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,040
Get in position! Let's go!

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,440
What?

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,760
What are you doing?

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,640
You're pointing the damn thing down!

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,640
Professor,
there's this other phenomenon...

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,920
...that Sam gives his priority to at noon.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
Other priority? Now?

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
Every day.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,360
What could be more important?

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,000
Actually, this event isn't strictly celestial.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,400
"l love you

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,440
"He loved me

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,440
"Said the little blue man

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,440
"And scared me right out of my wits"

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,840
What is it?

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
Remember I told you they were
going to pick a teacher...

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
...to represent the district
at the school in New York?

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,680
New York? You?

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,680
That's great.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't look at me like that.

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
It's only two months.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
It's not like I'm going to the moon.

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
Two months is a long time.

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
You could come.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680
You know I can't.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,840
You could take off work.

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
You just never
Want to get out of this town...

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
...and see the possibilities.

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
Everything I want to see is right here.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
You, the sky.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,800
I went to school
in that building right there.

49
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,200
I hung upside down on this jungle gym.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,480
ln 20 years, I haven't moved an inch.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,040
I fell in love with you on this junglegym.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,040
You know how much I want to do this,
but I love you...

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
...so if you tell me to stay, I'll stay.

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Stay.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
Hey, Joe, hoist it up!

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
It's got to be higher.

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,320
Much higher.

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Higher.

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Mr. Green, what are you doing here?

60
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
I was just on my way to the airport.

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
Come here, Sam.

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
ls Linda all right?

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Listen to me.

64
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Love can sometimes be
a very difficult thing.

65
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,000
Listen up.

66
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,240
"Dear Sam, this is the most difficult thing
I've ever done.

67
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
"I'm sorry I don't have the courage...

68
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
"...to do it face-to-face.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
"l never planned this, Sam."

70
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
Mr. Green, what is this?

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,120
She left you. I'm reading her Dear John.

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,320
"It's not you, Sam.
How can I make you understand?

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,920
"Your life is set.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
"You have your stars
and your friends and the town, but...

75
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,440
"...l feel like I'm just finding out...

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
"...What mine is all about.

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,640
"Oh, Sam, so many emotions
are surfacing as I write this."

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
Where is she, Mr. Green?

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,160
She thought it would be best
if you didn't talk for a while.

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
Let me finish this off.

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,160
"You're my best friend in the world, Sam...

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
"...so you must know
that this is the way I am.

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
"l can't help it. It's my nature."

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,440
It's true, son. She's nuts.

85
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
Where're you going? I'm not finished.

86
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,840
The best part's coming up.

87
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,840
Would you mind just checking?

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
Two blocks down and to the left.

89
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Thanks.

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,000
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

91
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm sure you are.

92
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,680
Honey!

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
What is it?

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
Can you get that?

95
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm taking a nap.

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
I'm in the bath.

97
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,920
All right.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,120
I hear you, God damn it!

99
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Are you OK?

100
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,160
What's this table doing here?

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
This better be goddamn good!

102
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
You're ruining my beauty sleep!

103
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Damn you! Lay off the buzzer!

104
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,080
Who is it?

105
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,600
No problem here.

106
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
Who is it?

107
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
Morning, everybody.

108
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,320
Morning, Linda. Morning, Tarzan.

109
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
We are...

110
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,880
...six minutes later than yesterday.

111
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,400
That's six, carry the two. Good.

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,120
Ah, there.

113
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
See that?

114
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Medium smile, no teeth.

115
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,400
Don't forget the vase.

116
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,080
Got to get it perfectly centered.

117
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,560
There? No.

118
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,640
There? No.

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,520
One more. Why not?

120
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,320
Annoying, isn't it, honey?

121
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,280
Grin all you want, monkey man.

122
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
All you are is a passing meteor shower.

123
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
You'll be gone soon enough.

124
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,960
I feel sorry for you, you poor bastard.

125
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Carl, it's me, Sam.

126
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,240
Calm down. I'm fine.

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm still in New York.

128
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,400
We're great. Linda's very happy.

129
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,440
We may stay a while. We're very busy.

130
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,040
There's lots to do.

131
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,120
Listen, Carl, I need you to sell my truck.

132
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Whatever you can get for it.

133
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm just a little short of cash right now.

134
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm still here.

135
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Listen, Carl,
there's something else I need...

136
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
...and Professor Wells
doesn't have to know about it.

137
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,600
Hey, Linda. How you doing?

138
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
You want to hear something funny?

139
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,920
I saw this on the news before I came out.

140
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Fainting goats. I'm not making this up.

141
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,920
There's this breed of goats.

142
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,680
I don't know why, but...

143
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,000
...they faint at the slightest thing.

144
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,040
lf they hear a loud noise
or a gun goes off...

145
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,920
...they black out, fall right over,
one after the other.

146
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
I thought you'd like that.

147
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,840
Get off.

148
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't even have a chart for that.

149
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,600
Get over here.

150
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,880
Gotcha!

151
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,200
Get away from here!

152
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm warning you! I have a gun!

153
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh, shit.

154
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,800
What the hell are you?

155
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,840
What do you want? Who are you?

156
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
Excuse me. I asked a question.

157
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,440
I live here. What do you want?

158
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
I asked you a question.

159
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't touch that.

160
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,760
Get away from that.

161
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

162
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
They'll hear you.

163
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
What are you talking about?

164
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,800
Your little Goldilocks and my ex-fiancé.

165
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,000
Hold it.

166
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,040
Are you saying that guy,
that thing over there...?

167
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,040
-What's your name?
-Mike.

168
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,920
-What's your name, Mike?
-Sam.

169
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm Maggie.

170
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll be staying here a while.

171
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
I sleep naked.
It's the only way I'm comfortable.

172
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,440
So don't think of it as a come-on...

173
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
...because if you so much as breathe
in my direction...

174
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
...Will nail your Willy to that beam.

175
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Don't mess with my stuff,
don't get in my way...

176
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,160
...and I'm sure we'll get along fine.

177
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
Nighty-night.

178
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
What is all this stuff?

179
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
Bugging equipment, cactus.

180
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Like listening bugging?

181
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
Bugging who?

182
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
Take a wild guess.

183
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,520
Why would anyone want to do that?

184
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,120
'Cause I want to hear
What goes on in there.

185
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,240
Don't you want to hear
What goes on in there?

186
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,240
No, I do not.

187
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Why not?

188
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
'Cause that would be
an invasion of her privacy.

189
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,840
Excuse me, Mr. Video.

190
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
That's not a video.

191
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
It's a camera obscura.

192
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,320
It's pure light.

193
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm not spying.

194
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,840
I just want to be with her.

195
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
That's completely different.

196
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,560
I know how you feel.

197
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,960
You want him back so badly
that you can't stand it.

198
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,800
It's like your guts
are twisting around inside.

199
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
But bugging their apartment....

200
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,680
What?

201
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,600
I don't want him back.
I want him vaporized.

202
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,840
Extinguished!

203
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
When I'm done with him...

204
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,200
...he'll be a twitchy little stain on the floor.

205
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,120
ls that what you're doing?

206
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,720
You're waiting
for her to leave him for you?

207
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,840
Absolutely.

208
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Have you seen him?

209
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,920
He is irrelevant.
Linda and I are soul mates.

210
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
This is just a passing phase.

211
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,720
They're going to break up tonight.
I know it.

212
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,080
I'm listening.

213
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm an astronomer.

214
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,520
It's my job to find patterns in things...

215
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,040
...that seem completely random.

216
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,720
I found a pattern.

217
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
It's all in the data.

218
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,760
The data.

219
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
This data.

220
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,880
"Mutual feeding activity."

221
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
It's the number of times
that Linda and what's-his-name...

222
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
...feed each other.

223
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,920
You're counting.

224
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,760
Not just that. Everything.

225
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,720
Kisses, hugs, smiles, fights.

226
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,920
They fight?

227
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,080
Not yet.

228
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,280
Long looks, whispering, shouting.

229
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,400
They shout?

230
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,160
You're missing the point.

231
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,160
Tonight there's going to be a fight.

232
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,760
They are going to break up...

233
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,960
...and I'm going to be right here for her.

234
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Tonight this will all be over...

235
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,920
...so you might as well start packing
your bags.

236
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,760
That is the most pathetic thing
I've ever heard.

237
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,760
I don't mean that trivially.

238
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm a photographer.
I've seen a lot of things.

239
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,720
I once took pictures
of a man who ate his own legs...

240
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
...and you would be the black sheep
of that family.

241
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,480
What's your evil plan?
Squirt him with squirt guns?

242
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,120
Throw rotten strawberries at him?

243
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
You looked in my satchel?

244
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah. Call a cop.

245
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,720
You are a strange, tragic little man.

246
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,240
Say what you want.
Linda and I are in love.

247
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Except for her boning my boyfriend...

248
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
...you guys are the perfect couple.

249
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,760
Listen, Catwoman, at the end of the day...

250
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,560
...she is coming back to me,
and we're going to be happy.

251
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
And where are you going to be?

252
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,960
All alone somewhere,
hatching some little revenge scheme.

253
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,760
Let me tell you something, Sam.

254
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,440
Listen very carefully. Are you listening?

255
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,880
The only way that girl
is coming back to you...

256
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,720
...is if a blast of semen catapults her...

257
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,320
...across the street
and through the window.

258
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
I want you out.

259
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,280
Not going to happen.

260
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
I was here first.

261
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,840
Put me down for half the rent
and get out of my face.

262
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,240
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

263
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,280
Why not?

264
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,720
You paid for it.

265
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,240
You stole my money.

266
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
You took everything I had to buy this crap?

267
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,040
That was everything you had?

268
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,920
What the hell is that for, anyway?

269
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,600
It's pretty, Sam.

270
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,800
There we go.

271
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
You can hear them?

272
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
Are they talking?

273
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,200
What about?

274
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,120
You wouldn't be interested.

275
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,840
Let me hear.

276
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,240
It's wrong, Sam.

277
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,040
Just for a second.

278
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,080
I just want to hear her sweet voice.

279
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,120
Beg me.

280
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,200
Please.

281
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
Excuse me. Did you say something?

282
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,560
Please let me hear.

283
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Oh, my God.

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,280
He's killing her.

285
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,800
He's killing her, all right...

286
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
...and she's loving every minute of it.

287
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,240
She's not like that.

288
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
She likes to make love quiet
and slow and gentle.

289
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
That girl of yours is a carnival ride.

290
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,280
This is horrible.

291
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
This is worse than I'd imagined.

292
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
Want me to turn it off?

293
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
No. I need to hear it.

294
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,480
How very brave.

295
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
He's making love to her in French.

296
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,840
You know, Sam,
French men are very small.

297
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,400
But not this guy.

298
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,680
It's like Godzilla's tail.

299
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,200
He could take down Tokyo with that thing.

300
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,360
This has got to be
the longest orgasm I've heard.

301
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
You want your charts?

302
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,440
You enjoy making me suffer.

303
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,040
Help me get him, Sam.

304
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,800
Take the road less traveled.

305
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,240
lt'll make all the difference.

306
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,120
Forget it.

307
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,200
I will not get sucked into your nightmare.

308
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,520
Whatever.

309
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,360
I think I can get this in stereo.

310
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,120
Welcome to New York, spy-boy.

311
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,200
Slim Jim?

312
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,720
Let's see what Ken and Barbie
are having tonight.

313
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,320
Squab.

314
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,760
He marinates it for half a day
in a lemon-wine sauce...

315
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,400
...and he braises it with sugar.

316
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Please be quiet. I have to concentrate.

317
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,280
It's happening tonight.

318
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
Smells delicious.

319
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,760
I'll tell you a secret.

320
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
It's not my recipe.

321
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,960
I met an old man, and he said...

322
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
...only prepare it for the woman you love.

323
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,920
Later I found out he made it
for a party he catered.

324
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,480
Five hundred people.
He's just bursting with love.

325
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,440
You should go to his restaurant sometime.

326
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,920
Good food, good people.

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,680
Wait. Take the spoon like this.

328
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Just let her eat it, you maggot!

329
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,480
It's the best thing I've ever eaten.

330
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Will you shut up?

331
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,920
I love to watch you eat.

332
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,960
She hates having people watch her eat.

333
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,720
He's going down in flames.

334
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,080
Here it comes.

335
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,760
Oh, you know,
I heard the most amusing story.

336
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,960
There is this...What are they called?

337
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
Sheep.

338
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
Yeah. A breed of goats.

339
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,800
And when they hear a sharp sound,
they fall over.

340
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
A sharp sound?

341
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
Yeah. Anything.

342
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,880
You clap your hands, and they fall over.

343
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
That's my story.

344
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
They pass out
When they hear a sharp sound.

345
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,040
It's true.

346
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
They just fall over on the ground.

347
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,680
That's my kiss.

348
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,400
That's my....

349
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh, not the food.

350
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,160
I'll do it.

351
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,120
I'll do whatever you want.

352
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
This has to stop.

353
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
I don't care about right or wrong anymore.

354
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,160
This must stop.

355
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,840
All you gotta do is nudge him.

356
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,040
Just graze him like that.

357
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
Sorry.

358
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,000
You're sorry?
You should be goddamned sorry.

359
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,920
You think you can trample
a person and say you're sorry?

360
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,360
Well, you can't.

361
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,560
You can't trample on somebody's
life and say, "I'm sorry."

362
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,080
There ought to be
something more you can say...

363
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,280
...When you walk all over somebody.

364
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,040
And you're throwing food everywhere!

365
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,160
I think we took a detour
from the plan there.

366
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,840
I really hit him, didn't l?

367
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,040
You smacked him one, all right!

368
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
How'd it feel?

369
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,080
Great!

370
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,360
What is your plan?
What do you want to do?

371
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,680
I just want his dignity, that's all.

372
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,720
I want him penniless, hopeless,
loveless, finished off.

373
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,240
I just wish him very, very ill.

374
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
How ill are we talking here?

375
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
I'm not saying I want him dead.

376
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,240
But, should that occur,
people die all the time.

377
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,280
Why should he be any different?

378
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,720
Just thinking on my feet, though.

379
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,320
I don't have to decide
the death part right now.

380
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,280
I can wait and see how I feel...

381
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,440
...once his dignity's a thing of the past.

382
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,640
Am I boring you?

383
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
Thank you, Anton.

384
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him.

385
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,640
He's just in love.

386
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,040
He's just in love, the same as me.

387
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,640
Define love.

388
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,600
Why?

389
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,480
Because every other word
out of you mouth is "love."

390
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
I'd like to know what it is...

391
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,400
...this magical ideal of yours. Define it.

392
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,400
Well, it's like, I don't know.

393
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,480
It's like all your life you walk around...

394
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,360
...With this feeling of emptiness
in your stomach.

395
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,280
You feel completely hollow.

396
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,600
And when you're in love, you feel...

397
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
...not hollow.

398
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,440
It's like without it, there's nothing.

399
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,280
A shell. A cavernous emptiness.

400
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,800
Forget it. You can't define it.

401
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
When I was a kid, my father had this dog.

402
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,160
lt started to get weak and sickly
so he took it to the vet.

403
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,880
The doctor examines it and says...

404
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,200
...a maggot must've laid eggs
in the dog's butt.

405
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
He says there's not much they can do.

406
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,640
The baby maggots have crawled up
and started to grow...

407
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,360
...and eventually they're going to eat
the dog alive from the inside out.

408
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,160
He says it should be put to sleep
because it's an old dog, anyway.

409
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,600
But Father won't do it.

410
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,040
He takes it home.

411
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,400
He puts it on the bed.

412
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
He starts to reach up into the dog...

413
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,320
...picking out the maggots with his fingers,
one by one.

414
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,080
lt takes him all night,
but he gets every last one.

415
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
That dog outlived my father.

416
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
That's love, Sam.

417
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,640
You're not that tough, Maggie.

418
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,840
I can tell you're not that tough.

419
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,240
And you can forget
about a career with Hallmark.

420
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,480
Won't he miss the card?

421
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
He won't know what hit him
till the bill comes...

422
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,400
...'cause he only uses his platinum.

423
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll just take everything in this whole area.

424
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,440
You know Anton's having an affair?

425
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,280
He is?

426
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,400
That's what Linda's going to think.

427
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Where are you sending them?

428
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,680
To my Nana.

429
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,040
The old battle-ax
should get a kick out of this.

430
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,600
How much to put lipstick on the monkey?

431
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,000
ls that for you or for him?

432
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,480
I don't touch the monkey.

433
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,160
I don't want to have anything
to do with the monkey.

434
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,520
How's 40?

435
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,560
For 50 I'd strap on a garter
and wax her legs.

436
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,640
Lovely lipstick, darling.

437
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
Honey, you can't be treating me this way.

438
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,400
We've known each other too long.

439
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,560
You can't even look me in the eye.

440
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,120
What? You're in love?

441
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,880
You're in love with that man?

442
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,680
That man could never make you happy.

443
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,280
What the hell is that? Shit!

444
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,040
Good God! Kiss him, baby!

445
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,480
Get this goddamned monkey off my back!

446
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
Give that man a hand!

447
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,680
OK, that's fine.

448
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,520
No problem.

449
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,600
Greta thanks you. I thank you.

450
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,040
Hello, sweetheart.

451
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,160
Here we go. The target's home.

452
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
You know bankers.

453
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,160
They want to know every little thing.

454
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,280
What do they know
about the restaurant business?

455
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,080
Are we packed?

456
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey, why don't we forget
about the Hamptons...

457
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,800
...and spend the weekend in bed?

458
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,120
There, that look!

459
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,480
She sees it.

460
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
Stay with her.

461
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Go back to her, Sam!

462
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,560
Stick to her.

463
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Relax.

464
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,080
Anything you wanted to tell me?

465
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,000
What?

466
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
What's that on your collar?

467
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,920
Turn it up. I can't hear them.

468
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
Oh, that.

469
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,600
You'll never believe this.

470
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm walking through washington Square...

471
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,640
...and there's this stupid man.

472
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
You know, some guy with a monkey.

473
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,200
A street performer?

474
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,680
That son of a bitch, yeah.

475
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,720
The monkey jumps on me
and won't get off my back.

476
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,320
You're kidding.

477
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,880
The people all around, they are laughing.

478
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,640
And the monkey is kissing me, kissing me.

479
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,760
I think it peed on me. It stinks.

480
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,280
What is she laughing at?

481
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,200
I don't know.

482
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,080
What do you think of the story?
I'll show you what I think.

483
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
I'll get you.

484
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,360
Let's forget about the Hamptons.

485
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,200
It's going very well, don't you think?

486
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Drink up, buddy,
'cause tonight we're going in.

487
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,880
There they go.

488
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,720
We want to go to the Long lsland railroad.

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,480
ldiot never even changed the lock.

490
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,560
Close it.

491
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,640
It's so much smaller than it looks on TV.

492
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,720
ln the couch.

493
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,560
What?

494
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,200
ln the couch. Don't make it obvious.

495
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,080
-You're kidding.
-Just do it.

496
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,440
Why were you wearing them?

497
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
Authenticity.

498
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,240
What are you going to do?

499
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,440
Receipts.

500
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
Why are we whispering?

501
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,880
I don't know.

502
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,960
Mine.

503
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,800
Mine.

504
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
Mine.

505
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,120
Mine.

506
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,280
Perfection, yes?

507
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
Voilà.

508
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,760
This is comfortable.

509
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,720
This is what you wear to walk about...

510
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,920
...With everything swinging freely.

511
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,720
Look at me. I am so fabulous.

512
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
I am so beautiful.

513
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,320
Witness my matted chest hairs.

514
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,120
They are nice, no?

515
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,840
What do you think?

516
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,480
You look....

517
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Look at this.

518
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,400
I love you, Linda.

519
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,440
I hate you, Anton.

520
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
I got to make the bed.

521
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,840
Sure. Right.

522
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
Can you clean the kitchen?

523
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,560
We should get out of here.

524
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,960
I think we should talk.

525
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,280
Nothing to talk about.

526
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,720
Yes, there is. Something happened.
I would like to talk about it.

527
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,360
Nothing happened, Sam.

528
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,480
OK? Nothing happened.

529
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,320
I know what you're going through.

530
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,840
I'm going through the same thing.

531
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,080
Get this straight, pal. I'm not like you.

532
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,520
I don't care what you're going through.

533
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,000
lf I thought you and I were alike
in the most trivial way...

534
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,320
...l would tie a rope around my neck.

535
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,920
I'm sorry.

536
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,760
Last night wasn't us, Maggie.

537
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,600
I know. I'm glad you know.

538
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,280
Maybe we should just,
I don't know, call it a day.

539
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,400
You know what's going to happen to her,
Sam?

540
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,440
He's going to make her feel
like she's the only woman in the world.

541
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,960
When he looks at her,
it'll be just like a kid...

542
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,800
...looks at a Christmas tree
all lit up and shiny.

543
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,680
For the first time,
she'll feel like she's really been seen...

544
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,280
...and really loved.

545
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,520
And then...

546
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,240
...and then three weeks later...

547
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,240
...she'll find a pair of panties in the couch.

548
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,880
Then she'll learn that she was
just a steppingstone.

549
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,760
That he was just using her to get a visa.

550
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,360
lt'll change her, Sam.

551
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,680
I understand.

552
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,200
You know what's always bothered me?

553
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,760
I can't see the side of her face.

554
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,320
I can never see the left side of her face...

555
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
...When she's standing here
in the kitchen...

556
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
...because of these things in the window.

557
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,200
So help me move this over a little bit.

558
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,840
Good?

559
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,360
A little more.

560
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,640
Good.

561
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,920
What?

562
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,360
I saw the sign about the job.

563
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
I don't want a half salt shaker on the table.

564
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,600
You go and refill it immediately.

565
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,880
Pardon.

566
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,640
ll faut tout leur apprendre!

567
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,680
Nothing here for you. Go.

568
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,200
Why?

569
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Do I need a reason in my own restaurant?

570
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,880
Of course not.

571
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,480
I don't like your face, that's why.

572
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,880
Just go.

573
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,440
Wait.

574
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,440
Why did you do that?

575
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,120
Why did I do what?

576
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,240
The flowers.
Why did you move it like that?

577
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,520
I wanted them to be
in the middle of the table.

578
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,720
Why?

579
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,840
Because it was...

580
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,400
...it was just something that I had to do.

581
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,320
Perhaps at heart you seek perfection, no?

582
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,560
Yes, perhaps I do.

583
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,600
Almost done?

584
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
Almost.

585
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Good work.

586
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Why don't you stop for a moment?

587
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,040
I know who you are.

588
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,480
lt took me a little while, but I figure it out.

589
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,600
Dry off your hands.

590
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,640
lt was you who attacked me that day.

591
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
Couldn't see your eyes,
but I don't forget a face.

592
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,840
You didn't put an address down
on your application.

593
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,240
You are homeless, aren't you?

594
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,440
That's OK. Don't be ashamed.

595
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,120
You know, I was hungry myself once.

596
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,240
I would see a rich man, a man I envied...

597
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,360
...l would want to strangle him.

598
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,600
But that's not the way I found.

599
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,360
You must better yourself.

600
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,960
Don't be ashamed.

601
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,640
Give me your hand. Come on.

602
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,680
I like a man who fights for what he wants.

603
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,680
But if you ever mess with me again...

604
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,920
...I'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull.

605
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,160
Excuse my French.

606
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,240
Was a good punch, huh?

607
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,800
Solid.

608
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,480
lt was nice.

609
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,080
So you did all his dishes
and got punched in the face.

610
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,240
What was your thinking there?

611
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,920
I'm missing something.
What was your plan?

612
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,920
No plan. I just wanted to face him.

613
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,360
I wanted to be
in the same room with him...

614
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,840
...to talk to him.

615
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,360
ln my mind, he was like a god.

616
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,360
Now what do you think?

617
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,840
Well, it's not like he's God God anymore.

618
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,600
He's more like a volcano god or a sea god.

619
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,920
One of those sub-gods.

620
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
Maggie, I think he likes me.

621
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,000
One thing, though.

622
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,600
He said something
about having sex with my skull.

623
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,040
He says that to everybody.

624
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,800
Don't worry about it.

625
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,120
Sorry.

626
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,960
I don't like the sound of it.

627
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,880
I don't like the image that it conjures.

628
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,360
I can't honestly say I blame you, Sam.

629
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,040
So I let go with my hands...

630
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,960
...and I fell off the top
of the junglegym face-first...

631
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,240
...and I broke this tooth in half.

632
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,960
I'm laying on my back,
blood all over my face...

633
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,400
...the kids are yelling,
the teachers are freaking out...

634
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,720
...and I look up, and there she is.

635
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,400
She's just looking down at me...

636
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,960
...With this worried little smile on her face.

637
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,800
I swear to God, when I saw her,
the pain just went away.

638
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,840
Once I took pictures
of a bunch of ducklings...

639
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,600
...Who imprinted on a gardener.

640
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,360
They thought he was Mama...

641
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,160
...and they used to chase him around
all day...

642
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,000
...While he drove around
on his lawn mower.

643
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,720
That's exactly what it feels like.

644
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,880
It's like she's branded on my brain.

645
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,560
What happened to this guy...

646
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,760
...is that one day he forgot
the ducks were there.

647
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,120
He put the mower in reverse,
chewed them to pieces.

648
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,560
Don't you know any happy stories?

649
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,680
There he is.

650
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,040
That's him!

651
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,080
Let's get him!

652
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Our work is done.

653
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,840
Midgets coming out of the blue.

654
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,360
I had to protect myself with one of them.

655
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,040
Midgets coming out of the blue?

656
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,320
Yeah.
Little children shooting perfume at me.

657
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,760
From their guns.

658
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,600
Perfume from their guns?

659
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,520
Yeah. Water guns?

660
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,720
Squirt guns?

661
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
Yeah, I think. Squirt guns.

662
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,720
Spooky, huh?

663
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,920
Wait, the loaf, I think it's burning.

664
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,360
Look at him trying
to weasel his way out of it.

665
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,600
He didn't do anything, Sam.

666
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,800
Anton,
don't you think it's a little peculiar...

667
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,000
...that little children would be shooting
perfume at you?

668
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,800
I thought it was something
American kids do.

669
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,960
A fad, I don't know.
We should have some salad.

670
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
It's very expensive perfume, Anton.

671
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,160
I used to wear that perfume.

672
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,520
Good call, Sam!

673
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,920
Last week you had lipstick on your collar.

674
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,600
From the monkey.

675
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,800
And now perfume...

676
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,360
...from squirt guns
from rich New York kids.

677
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,840
What are the odds...

678
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,960
...of something like that
happening to one person?

679
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,680
I don't know. Ask a mathematician.

680
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,800
Ask your old boyfriend,
the Milky way man.

681
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,160
That's you, Sam.

682
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,160
What are you getting at?

683
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,880
You're driving me crazy.

684
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,720
Anton,
I want you to promise me something.

685
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,320
Just promise that if you were
ever doing anything...

686
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,440
...that you would tell me.

687
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,000
Why are you even thinking of such a thing?

688
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,400
Maybe we could work it out.

689
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,600
I just couldn't take it
if you were lying to me.

690
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,680
Sweetie,
Why would I have sex with a hamburger...

691
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,560
...When I can make love to a steak?

692
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,640
Oh, come on.

693
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
Forget about it.

694
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,720
She's this close, Sam.

695
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,760
This close.

696
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,520
Bring some cups and saucers.

697
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,560
And bring some other bottles.

698
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,400
What did I miss?

699
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,000
I think we're getting to them.

700
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,160
I definitely think
that we're getting to them.

701
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,160
Did you get the sweet and sour?

702
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,440
Look, my darling...

703
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,280
...l wanted to show you
how well my hands fit on my knees...

704
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,920
...and to give you a little kiss.

705
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,720
Get away from me, please. You are rude.

706
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,560
But I love you, my little lamb.
I must have you.

707
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,720
My love is throbbing
at quite a fevered cadence.

708
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,240
You cannot have me.

709
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,120
My love is reserved for another.

710
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,600
You cannot mean....

711
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,600
Yes, the Milky way man!

712
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,480
No! Anyone but him.

713
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,800
This is a man who can predict
puffer cluster emissions.

714
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,920
To him I am nothing.

715
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,480
A little, teeny...I'm a worm.

716
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,760
I love his emissions.

717
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,520
Not every man...

718
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,360
...can be a Milky way man.

719
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,320
What will you do now?

720
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,880
Forlorn, I will roam the earth by myself,
thinking of you...

721
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,480
...and pausing occasionally to have
the sex with the skullses.

722
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,400
That's good.

723
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,640
Now be quiet about that...

724
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,360
...or I will make you eat
another one of those pecans!

725
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,560
This is very good.

726
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,880
Look how I'm licking my fingers.
You like that?

727
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,160
I like everything. I am French.

728
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,600
Ordering!

729
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,120
I've been dying for one of these all night.

730
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,160
Can I ask you a question, Anton?

731
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,720
Sure you can.

732
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,360
How do you like America?

733
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,720
Why do you ask?

734
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,520
You're French.

735
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,960
Do you ever miss it?

736
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,360
Do you ever get lonely
for your own country?

737
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,920
I was never so much French
since I've been here.

738
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,640
You know Superman?

739
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,160
That's me, I'm Superman.

740
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,920
And France was like Krypton.

741
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,160
On Krypton everybody was Superman.

742
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,560
You make a nice sauce.

743
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,320
Everybody make a nice sauce.

744
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,680
You say hello to a nice woman
With your French accent...

745
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,120
...and everybody says, "Hello! "

746
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,560
But here on Earth, the moment I arrived...

747
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,840
...l knew this was the place
I had special powers.

748
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,200
I talk about my little town...

749
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,000
...and the bankers open their checkbooks
and say...

750
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,000
..."How great, charming,
and exotic you are, Anton."

751
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,240
I could read the phone book to a woman...

752
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,800
...and they become hypnotized,
Wet as morning daisies.

753
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,360
Here I have these powers.

754
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,800
Back home, I was nothing.

755
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,520
But here, I'm Superman.

756
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,840
Hip-hip, America!
Hip-hip, land of freedom!

757
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,120
Now you, you're not French.

758
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,120
But it's OK, you know?

759
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,600
You still have opportunity in this country.

760
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,200
Yesterday, he had no job, no future.

761
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,240
But today, a step-up.

762
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,080
A little step, but a step.

763
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,000
Soon you can afford a place
to live and get a girlfriend.

764
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,960
I have a girlfriend.

765
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,080
No, really. Pretty girl?

766
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,560
She's the most wonderful woman
in the world.

767
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,200
She must love you a good deal.

768
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,440
You think women only want men
for their money?

769
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,880
No, not just money.

770
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,240
Power also, and success.

771
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,680
Don't fool yourself, dishwasher.

772
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,920
They want a man
Who takes what he wants.

773
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,200
I don't think that's true.

774
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,920
Listen.

775
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,360
My girlfriend was seeing a man
When I met her.

776
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,600
I took her back to my place,
and I ask her about him...

777
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,080
...very innocently, of course.

778
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,000
Of course.

779
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,240
She had many wonderful things
to say about him.

780
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,400
How nice and devoted, how gentle he was.

781
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,280
So I started to probe in very subtle ways...

782
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,240
...about how strong, powerful,
and successful he was.

783
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,600
I was very good.

784
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,640
ln no time,
We were lying together on my couch.

785
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,240
I think she wanted me
to force her away from him.

786
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,400
You could see it in her eyes.

787
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,040
She wanted the battle.

788
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,320
She was crying, too,
but she was kissing me.

789
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,120
Later, of course, she came like a rocket.

790
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,280
Don't worry about the glass.

791
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,440
I won't charge you this time.

792
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,040
Anton, he's here. Matheson.

793
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Matheson? Are you sure?

794
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,760
Table nine.

795
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,480
Oh, my God. It's him.

796
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,240
Go.

797
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,360
I'll take care of him.

798
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,360
Did you bring them?

799
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,440
What I just did was the most
revolting thing I've ever done.

800
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,880
Harold Matheson,
the food critic for the Times.

801
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,840
Big step.
Are you sure you're ready for this?

802
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,200
Everyone!

803
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,480
I Want everyone to do a good job tonight.

804
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,480
I want everything perfect.

805
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,200
Didier, I can see this is not good!

806
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,000
And you, dishwasher,
you don't drop a dish tonight.

807
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,320
I want everything perfect for the bastard.

808
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,320
Heaven for the pig.

809
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,040
Gimme, gimme.

810
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,760
I've created a monster.

811
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,840
I asked your steward for a Chenin Blanc...

812
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,400
...and he brought me this.

813
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,880
You have any idea how that happened?

814
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,200
I took the liberty, Mr. Matheson.

815
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,240
It's from my private reserve.

816
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,840
You know, if I had a suspicious mind...

817
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,200
...I'd think you're trying to get
on my good side.

818
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,400
I thought you would enjoy the year.

819
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,800
I'd say that your little ruse
is working very well...

820
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,040
...especially if you could locate
another bottle.

821
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,800
Well, certainly. Excuse me.

822
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,200
We might find a bottle or two.

823
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,440
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Matheson.

824
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,280
I've just come back from France.

825
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Whereabouts are you from?

826
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,920
It's just Beaucaire.

827
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,560
It's just a small province
in the south of France.

828
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,640
Oh, Beaucaire.

829
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,920
I know that. lsn't that near NÎmes?

830
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,960
ls that near NÎmes?

831
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,360
Excuse me?

832
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,240
ls that near NÎmes?

833
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,920
Yes, it's near there.

834
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,840
Oh, my God!

835
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,120
Did you see that?

836
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,480
I remember.

837
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,280
It's a little to the south and over the hill.

838
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,560
Yes, it is on the other side of the hill.

839
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,920
It's a little south.

840
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,240
The look on Matheson's face.

841
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,880
What are you smiling about?

842
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,360
I'm sorry.

843
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,840
lts legs were fighting
in his mouth like this.

844
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,840
Everything I had is in that restaurant.

845
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,520
It's not that bad. I have my job.

846
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,960
Your teacher's salary
Won't pay for the toilet paper!

847
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,240
That's because they don't
pay teachers what they're worth.

848
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,680
ln some parts of the world--

849
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,120
Linda, don't go there.

850
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Do you mind if we don't have
this discussion again right now?

851
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,680
Thank you, Anton.

852
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,520
-Don't be angry.
-I'm not angry.

853
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,600
She's angry.

854
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,680
What if they close me down permanently?

855
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,520
What would you do?

856
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,400
What do you mean?

857
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,520
I mean,
if I couldn't afford this nice place anymore?

858
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,600
You can always find work.

859
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,480
You can go back to modeling--

860
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,960
He was a model?

861
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,200
What if I couldn't find work?

862
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,400
Then what?

863
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,200
What would you do if I were poor?

864
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,160
I would sit out on the curb
With you all day...

865
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,240
...and sell pencils.

866
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,800
Then when it got dark, we would crawl...

867
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,600
...into our cozy refrigerator box
and make love all night...

868
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,240
...and then sell pencils again at sun-up.

869
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,160
Where are you going?

870
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,280
Where's he going?

871
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,280
What's he doing?

872
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,120
Talk to me.

873
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,320
He's getting something off of a shelf.

874
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,840
What is it?

875
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,760
It's a ring. Oh, no!

876
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,360
What does it look like?

877
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,280
It's a circle of diamonds with a....

878
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,640
A big, fat opal in the middle?

879
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,400
I'm familiar with it.

880
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,440
Ton visage, ton corps...

881
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,800
...tu es à moi,je suis à toi.
Je t'aime, mon amour.

882
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,840
What is that?

883
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,840
-The bastard.
-What?

884
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,680
Would you like to be my wife?

885
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,840
Here.

886
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,320
Nana!

887
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,800
So you found me.

888
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,520
I get 50 pounds of flowers
delivered to my door...

889
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,760
...and I call the florist...

890
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,560
...and he gives me your name
and this charming address...

891
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,520
...and the earrings and the perfume...

892
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,960
...and the television set, for Christ's sake.

893
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,040
What's got into your head, girl?

894
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,040
Too much? You didn't like them?

895
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,880
It's one thing not to call
your mother for ages...

896
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,920
...but to hide from me for two months.

897
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,160
You better be found
lying dead in the gutter...

898
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,920
...if you know what's good for you.

899
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,600
What is that?
Your tits look like hard little rocks.

900
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,520
Cut it out.

901
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,920
As for you...

902
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,680
...taking my little girl away from me.

903
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,640
Come here now!

904
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,240
I'm Margaret's Nana.

905
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,800
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you,
Anton.

906
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,400
I'm very happy to finally be meeting you,
too.

907
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,160
lf we hurry,
We can get you some vanilla custard...

908
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,480
...at Di Roberti's before it closes.

909
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,240
The spoon goes in right side up, dear.

910
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,280
We weren't brought up in a barn.

911
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,000
Nana, you got something
in your teeth right here.

912
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,280
Here, hand them to me.

913
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,080
Oh, you little bitch!

914
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,920
Oh, dear, it's late.

915
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,080
I think I better be getting home.

916
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,640
You have to go already?

917
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,120
I've got a yoga class in the morning.

918
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,040
But first, I want to take your picture.

919
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,360
Move in closer.

920
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,280
Put your arm around her, Anton.

921
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,320
Put your arm around her.

922
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,240
Maggie, don't make a face.

923
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,600
I'm not.

924
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,560
She always makes a face
When you take her picture.

925
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,640
I do not.

926
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,240
For Pete's sake, just act natural.

927
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,360
Why don't you give her a kiss, Anton?

928
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,720
It's my mistake.

929
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,760
Don't be shy. Come on.

930
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,480
You can do better than that, Anton.

931
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,600
Yeah, Anton, you can do better than that.

932
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,360
Did you see a flash?

933
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,040
God, I hate these things.

934
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,360
Come on, kiss.

935
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,160
All right, Maggie, dear,
Will you take care of the check?

936
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,240
Just spend the night with us.

937
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,120
ln that Bohemian hell hole?

938
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,160
How long were you in our
hell hole before we got there?

939
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,200
Not very long.
I just straightened up a little.

940
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,480
Listened to the radio.

941
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,640
What radio?

942
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,000
Oh, the radio.

943
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,920
What was on the radio?

944
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,600
Some little radio play.

945
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,480
More like a soap opera.

946
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,080
I'm ashamed to admit
I listened to that silly thing.

947
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,080
-What was it about?
-Who cares?

948
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,240
I want to hear more about the both of you.

949
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,720
I'm interested, too.

950
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,200
Let's see, it was two characters.

951
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,920
A Frenchman and a girl.

952
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,160
ln the beginning, he's on his way home...

953
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,280
...and she's upset about something.

954
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,840
lt turns out she thinks
he's having an affair.

955
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,280
And he says, "l didn't, I didn't! "

956
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,600
And she says,
"Well, how do you explain this?"...

957
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,840
...and shows him some undergarments
she found in the couch...

958
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,720
...and some other things he can't explain,
and he denies it.

959
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,760
Then she says something about monkeys.

960
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,520
I really couldn't follow that.

961
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,320
And then there was silence for a bit...

962
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,080
...and then he confesses.

963
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,840
He what?

964
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,600
He confesses.

965
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,280
He was seeing another woman...

966
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,760
...an investor or something.
lt was a little confusing.

967
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,240
Come on, let's go!

968
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,840
Then what happened?

969
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,440
He starts crying and begging her
to forgive him...

970
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,640
...and she says a certain four-letter word...

971
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,520
...more than a couple of times
and storms out.

972
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,640
I didn't know you were so interested
in this kind of thing.

973
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,280
We listen to that show all the time.

974
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,920
Watch your fingers.

975
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,200
I've got it.

976
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,400
Good.

977
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,960
Look at him.

978
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,240
All right.

979
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,000
I can't. I have to go.

980
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm waiting for a call. Shit.

981
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,160
Qui est là? Who is it?

982
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,440
Anton? I'm Mr. Green.

983
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,560
Linda's father.

984
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,760
How are you? Come on.

985
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,680
Can I offer you something, a cup--

986
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,040
"Anton, you hurt me very badly.

987
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,360
"All I asked for was honesty,
and you betrayed me.

988
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,240
"l had hoped...."

989
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,160
Ah, hell....

990
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,480
I can't believe it. We did it!

991
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,920
Why?

992
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,640
We did it, Sam!

993
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,720
All this time,
and we weren't even here for it.

994
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,120
What are you going to do now?

995
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,240
She left suddenly, right?

996
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,800
So she probably went someplace familiar.

997
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,320
To the hotel where she was staying before.

998
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,800
You're probably right.

999
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,240
What are you waiting for, Sam?

1000
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,720
Go get her.

1001
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,160
Now?

1002
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,880
Yeah, now. What's the matter with now?

1003
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,840
I can't. What would it look like?

1004
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,160
Who cares? She's not thinking straight.

1005
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,800
She'll buy anything.

1006
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,720
What's the big hurry
to get me out of here?

1007
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,920
Look, if you don't want her after all this....

1008
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,960
Of course I do.

1009
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,400
I don't care about that.

1010
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,920
It's your business.

1011
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,240
I still got some work to do...

1012
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,160
...and, no offense,
but I really miss my privacy.

1013
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,080
I thought we could just take
a minute to say good-bye.

1014
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,680
I mean, it feels kind of strange to not....

1015
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,320
You have to wreck everything, don't you?

1016
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,000
Are we done saying good-bye yet?

1017
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,520
You're still here.

1018
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,000
No, she does not want to see you.

1019
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,240
You are not welcome.

1020
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,400
You try and sneak in here again,
and you're going to jail.

1021
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,320
How dare you, you salopard?

1022
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,360
I rape your skull!

1023
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,640
Dishwasher!

1024
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,640
I knew it was you.

1025
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,240
Anton, hi.

1026
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,600
ls that any kind of greeting
for your old boss?

1027
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,040
How are you?

1028
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,120
I've never been better.

1029
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,640
Every day is a holiday,
every night the Fourth of July.

1030
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, good. Well, I better be going.

1031
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,840
I'm lying.

1032
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,400
I feel terrible.

1033
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,200
I broke up with my fiancée.

1034
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,200
My restaurant is gone,
and I'm running out of money.

1035
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,120
I'm sorry.

1036
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,040
Don't worry. Don't be sorry.

1037
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,400
Do you have a place yet?

1038
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,440
Not yet.

1039
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,920
You'll stay with me, then.

1040
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,120
Why? You don't even know me.

1041
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,080
I know one thing.

1042
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,520
That last night at the restaurant...

1043
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,920
...everyone is running around, even me...

1044
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,920
...but I notice you in your little room.

1045
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,040
You were not looking out...

1046
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,520
...you were not staring
stupidly like the rest.

1047
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,360
You just kept working like a rock.

1048
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,480
You're a good man, good friend.

1049
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,720
What's your name, by the way?

1050
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,600
Mike, I'm a nervous wreck.

1051
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,600
I'm not doing well on my own.

1052
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,560
I feel vide.

1053
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,840
It's like somebody
has thrown away a piece of me.

1054
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,200
How do you say vide...

1055
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,600
...When there is nothing inside something?

1056
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,800
Hollow.

1057
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Yeah. That's how I feel.

1058
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,000
I feel so hollow.

1059
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,240
You would be doing me a favor, really.

1060
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,560
Just one drink.

1061
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,360
I can't go back to
that empty apartment by myself.

1062
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,040
I will die. Please.

1063
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,720
That's it. No more.

1064
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,640
You must try this one next.

1065
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,840
It's a sexy little Margaux from '83.

1066
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,640
I was going to give it to Matheson...

1067
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,000
...to help wash down the bugs.

1068
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,760
Mike, I don't know how she found out.

1069
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,440
I was going to tell this
other woman good-bye, anyway.

1070
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,240
I only slept with her to help
the loan for my restaurant.

1071
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,000
It's not like I cheated, you know...

1072
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,920
...and it was only once with this woman.

1073
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,280
And I hardly came at all...

1074
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,680
...just a fraction of what I'm capable.

1075
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,120
I thought of Linda the entire time.

1076
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,040
lf that can be twisted
into something terrible...

1077
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,040
...I'm surely the only sane man
in a world gone mad.

1078
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,120
Don't you think?

1079
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,680
I really couldn't say, Anton.

1080
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,280
I'm going to get her back, Mike.

1081
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,480
She needs me.

1082
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,240
I have to get her back.

1083
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,000
This is really good.

1084
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,240
I'm sorry. It is.

1085
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,800
Time for bed.

1086
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,160
I have modeling work
Waiting for me tomorrow.

1087
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,400
A step down, yes,
but Anton Depeux isn't proud.

1088
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,520
Look at me, Mike.

1089
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,320
I haven't gained a pound
since my modeling days.

1090
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,280
I'm going to be just fine,
and you don't worry about me.

1091
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,880
I guess I better be moseying on, then.

1092
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,840
Let you get your beauty rest.

1093
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,280
Please, a little longer.

1094
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,000
You know,
the crème caramel is almost done...

1095
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,640
...and I have a very nice wine
for my friend Pierre.

1096
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,560
I'll be right back. Here you go. Please.

1097
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,000
Wait there.

1098
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,160
Maggie, come to the window.

1099
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,040
Please, this wasn't my idea.

1100
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,160
Maggie, don't be angry with me.

1101
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,760
Maggie, look at him.
How could I leave him?

1102
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,640
I haven't done this in years.

1103
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,640
How is it in English?

1104
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,600
"Our Father, who art in heaven..."

1105
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,440
"Our Father, who art in heaven..."
I miss my father.

1106
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,280
"Hallowed be Thy name..."

1107
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,880
"Hollow...hollow..."

1108
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,080
"Hallowed be Thy name...."

1109
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,720
Stay out of my business.

1110
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,920
After you, Abner...and Evelyn.

1111
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,600
Marching good. We're being a snake.

1112
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,920
A snake. We're looking good.

1113
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,440
Now be an elephant.

1114
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,200
And marching and two and....

1115
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,800
Oh, my God!

1116
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,240
Sam, it is you.

1117
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,200
You're here because of me?

1118
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,640
God, Sam, I can't believe
you're actually here with me.

1119
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,400
I can't, either.

1120
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,840
lf only you knew
What I've been going through...

1121
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,440
...the last couple of days.

1122
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,520
Listen to me, feeling sorry for myself.

1123
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,200
You know what I miss?

1124
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,600
I miss noon.

1125
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,920
Me, too.

1126
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,720
Sometimes I look up and wave at the sky.

1127
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,000
-The kids think I'm nuts.
-l know.

1128
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,760
Of course you do.

1129
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,320
You've been watching me
through your telescope...

1130
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,200
...all the way from Archer's Bluff.

1131
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,080
Sam, you're the best.

1132
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,280
How could I ever leave you?
What was I thinking?

1133
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,640
Why did you?

1134
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,120
I don't know. I'm nuts.

1135
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,720
That's what my father says.

1136
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,680
That's not a real answer.

1137
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,960
I know.

1138
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,440
Why did I ever leave you, Sam?

1139
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,160
You're so generous and kind and honest.

1140
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,120
Linda,
you don't know everything about me.

1141
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,440
Of course I do.

1142
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,800
You're my Milky way man.

1143
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,760
You're in love with that man?

1144
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,040
You're breaking my heart!

1145
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,280
Get him off! Come on!

1146
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,240
Kiss me, Sam, please.

1147
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,360
I got a stud.

1148
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,160
That I didn't know.

1149
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,480
Linda, let's go!

1150
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,000
I got to go.

1151
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,280
Come to my hotel tonight.

1152
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,440
The Evangeline, eight o'clock?

1153
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,960
Eight o'clock. I'll be there.

1154
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,880
Let's give that man a hand.

1155
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,760
Thank you, thank you.

1156
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,440
Go to hell! Take anything you want.

1157
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,160
Don't forget the TV!

1158
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,440
And don't forget the sofa also!

1159
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,840
Voleurs! Fascistes!

1160
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,960
How dare you?

1161
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,520
I'll rape your skull, you salopard!

1162
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,200
Look out.

1163
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,120
Anton, what's going on?

1164
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,040
Credit card bastards!

1165
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,840
They say I owe them thousands.

1166
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,200
I never used the card.

1167
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,240
Help me find my other shoe...

1168
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,000
...because if I find my other shoe,
I will be just fine.

1169
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,240
I have a nice little
modeling job waiting for me...

1170
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,560
...With a nice little agency...

1171
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,560
...and after I get my money,
I'm going to go down...

1172
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,600
...and wipe it in their disgusting
credit card faces!

1173
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,280
You can't keep Anton Depeux down...

1174
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,240
...because Anton Depeux
is going to be just fine!

1175
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,880
Look at me now, you credit card bastards!

1176
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,200
What, a pimple?

1177
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,040
Tell me it's not a pimple.

1178
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,520
ls it a rash or an allergy?

1179
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,280
It's called a chronic allergy.

1180
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,640
It's from food or mold,
like shellfish, strawberries--

1181
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,080
Strawberries?

1182
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,960
I haven't touched any of...

1183
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,120
...of those...for years.

1184
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,120
Well, can I get you some ice or heat?
Ointment?

1185
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,960
Look! Look! Look!

1186
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,960
I am...look....

1187
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,720
There you go.

1188
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,520
There you go, lover.

1189
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,120
That's what I want to hear.

1190
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,520
Hold it! Stop!

1191
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,360
We need to talk.

1192
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,880
So how was your date with Linda?

1193
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,480
You looked cozy. I'm happy it worked out.

1194
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,440
You were there?

1195
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,800
I miss you, Sam.

1196
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,400
We were like girlfriends.

1197
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,600
This isn't about him anymore, is it?

1198
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,920
Who, him?

1199
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,480
You know, call me a hopeless romantic.

1200
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,880
I just hate to let him out of my sight.

1201
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:45,920
Where are you going?

1202
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,440
Nothing worse can happen to me.

1203
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,560
I have to see Linda.

1204
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,720
This is very painful.

1205
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,360
Maybe now isn't a good time.

1206
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,720
You don't look your best.

1207
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,120
What if she's seeing another man, Mike?

1208
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,920
Another man touching her hair, her hips...

1209
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,160
...her pink panties.

1210
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,360
Oh, God, her pink panties.

1211
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,480
The one with the little....

1212
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,840
You think me pathetic, don't you?

1213
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,280
Yes, I do.

1214
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,760
With Linda,
the worst moments of my life...

1215
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,080
...Were the happiest I've ever known.

1216
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,840
Even as the world was crashing
around my shoulders...

1217
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,360
...l had the most extraordinary
times with her.

1218
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,760
Yet I only knew her a brief time.

1219
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,800
Your woman, how long do you know her?

1220
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,920
A few weeks.

1221
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,680
A few weeks? Love comes swift and hard.

1222
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,800
Not a few weeks. Since we were kids.

1223
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,760
You just said a few weeks.

1224
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,960
I did. I said that.

1225
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,520
I didn't say you didn't.

1226
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,200
But I did. I said that.

1227
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,880
How did you two meet?

1228
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,920
Common interests.

1229
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,120
When will I meet her?

1230
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,560
We're actually not together anymore.

1231
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,000
You didn't get along?

1232
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,800
No. We had a great time together.

1233
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,480
And what drove you apart?

1234
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,000
Another guy.

1235
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,480
She loves another man?

1236
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,840
No, she hates him.

1237
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
She hates his guts.

1238
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,320
Anton, I'm sorry. I have to go.

1239
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,040
You're not coming with me to see her?

1240
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,240
You're on your own, sport.

1241
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,520
What in the world are you doing?
I didn't even come close to him!

1242
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,560
I'm so sorry, Anton.

1243
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,560
I'm so sorry.

1244
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,680
Linda. Where is Linda?

1245
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,040
It's all right. I'm here.

1246
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,520
Linda Green!

1247
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,240
Nice and slow.

1248
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,080
I got you.

1249
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,640
Go back.

1250
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,280
I almost killed him, Maggie.

1251
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,880
I was trying to protect him
from somebody...

1252
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,400
...Who I thought was you,
and I almost killed him.

1253
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,440
I broke his arms and his ribs.

1254
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,080
For what?

1255
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,080
I was going to ask you about that, Sam.

1256
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Not that I'm ungrateful.

1257
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,680
Stop it, Maggie. Just stop it.

1258
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,560
I was just curious about that.

1259
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,240
This isn't about him anymore.
This is about us.

1260
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,640
You and me.

1261
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,080
I love you, Maggie.

1262
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,600
Oh, God, don't do this.

1263
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,080
I love you.

1264
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,440
-What are you doing?
-And I know you love me.

1265
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,760
Why are you saying that?

1266
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
-l know you love me.
-Don't do this, Sam.

1267
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,120
You're crazy about me.

1268
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,360
You should go home.
Just get on a plane and go.

1269
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,800
I won't hurt you, Maggie, I swear.

1270
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,880
Look, I am trying to be nice, and you....

1271
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,560
I don't love you, Sam.

1272
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,320
I don't have one iota of feeling
for you whatsoever.

1273
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,680
Then what were you doing this morning
Watching me and Linda?

1274
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,040
He wasn't there.

1275
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,200
Why were you there?

1276
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,840
It's none of your business
anymore what I do or why.

1277
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,960
You were there watching me...

1278
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,240
...because you care about me,
because you have feelings for me.

1279
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,240
You want to know why I was there, Sam?
You really want to know?

1280
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,560
Pictures.

1281
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,640
Pictures of you and Linda.

1282
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,920
I told you I want him finished off.

1283
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,040
lt doesn't have anything to do
With you and me.

1284
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,280
I told you, stay out of my way.

1285
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,840
That's it?

1286
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,120
lf that's what you want,
that's what it's going to take.

1287
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Fine. Let's get it the hell over with, then.

1288
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,760
Thank God, Mike. Thank God you're back.

1289
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,520
Scratch me, Mike, please.

1290
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,840
Scratch my chest, my face, quickly.

1291
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,080
Why?

1292
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,760
Please, I'm not kidding. I can't stand it.

1293
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,400
Why should I help you?

1294
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,960
For the love of God, Mike!

1295
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,520
What did you do, Anton?

1296
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,040
You must've done something
terrible to deserve all this.

1297
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,520
What did you do?

1298
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't understand
What you're talking about.

1299
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,360
Confess, Anton!

1300
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,720
Have you gone mad?

1301
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,320
I'm begging you.

1302
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,760
Just for a moment.

1303
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,640
Just one scratch.

1304
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,800
Look at you.
You've lost everything you have.

1305
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,800
Your money, your love, your self-respect.

1306
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,320
You're broken, Anton.

1307
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,960
You're repulsive!

1308
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,880
ls this what you want? ls this enough?

1309
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,240
No, huh? You want more?

1310
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,920
All right.

1311
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,400
Do it, Anton. Confess.

1312
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,200
Confess what?

1313
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,320
That you hurt people!

1314
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,000
Who, Linda? Yes, I cheated on Linda.

1315
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,560
I admit it, but why should you care?

1316
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,400
You were using her, weren't you?

1317
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,920
What are you talking about?

1318
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,480
Just admit it!

1319
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,600
That you were using her
to stay in this country...

1320
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,080
...just the way you used Maggie!

1321
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,760
I never told you anything about Maggie.

1322
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,000
Who the hell are you?

1323
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,320
I'm the Milky way man...

1324
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,440
...and I know everything.

1325
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,400
You're going to hurt yourself.

1326
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,320
You're killing yourself.

1327
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,040
Here. Let me help you.

1328
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,720
How's this? You enjoying the show?

1329
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,880
Maggie was my angel.

1330
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,600
She brought me here, in America.

1331
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
I was nothing before I met her.

1332
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,880
Just a waiter in a little café in Paris.

1333
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,320
Yeah. I used her.

1334
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,320
I used her terribly.

1335
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,960
But I didn't think it mattered...

1336
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,720
...because I was...

1337
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,240
...sure that I would grow to love her.

1338
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,960
I thought if I could just love her, then...

1339
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,080
...it would be all right.

1340
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,680
The shame would go away.

1341
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,680
You can't choose who you love, Mike...

1342
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,920
...or whoever the hell you are...

1343
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,280
...and I love Linda.

1344
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,160
I love Linda.

1345
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,880
More than anything!

1346
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,800
Who the hell do you think
you are to judge?

1347
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,520
Who the hell do you think you are?

1348
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,080
I'm nobody, Anton.

1349
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,560
I'm nobody.

1350
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,120
Nobody to nobody.

1351
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,040
Linda, we need to talk.

1352
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,320
Hello? Yes, please.

1353
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,760
I need to be scratched on my face,
my chest, and my back.

1354
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,160
Please. Hello?

1355
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,600
lt is an emergency call. I swear.

1356
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,120
Hello, mister?

1357
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,920
Say we're even.

1358
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,760
-What?
-Just say it.

1359
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,400
Yes, we are even.

1360
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,680
Good.

1361
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,440
So how ya been?

1362
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,240
Here! I'm here, Linda!

1363
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,080
Oh, baby! Look at you!

1364
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,720
Oh, God!

1365
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,400
Oh, honey!

1366
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,600
I love you.

1367
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,880
You're everything to me.

1368
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,600
Bad dog! Go away!

1369
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,200
So I saw this episode of Lassie today...

1370
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:41,120
...and Lassie was accused
of a crime she didn't commit...

1371
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,840
...and the ranger was coming
to put her to sleep.

1372
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,240
How's Lassie going to get out of this one?

1373
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,400
Well, the little boy found out
that the ranger was coming...

1374
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,800
...and he told Lassie that...

1375
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,000
...that she had to go away, far away.

1376
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,400
For her own good.

1377
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,920
But Lassie wouldn't leave.

1378
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,440
See, Lassie just couldn't leave the boy.

1379
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,160
What did he do?

1380
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,640
He told her that he never liked her.

1381
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,960
He said, "l hate you.

1382
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,960
"l hate you, Lassie. You're a bad dog.

1383
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,400
"l hope I never see you again."

1384
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,440
That must have made Lassie sad.

1385
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,560
Yes, it did.

1386
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,080
Lassie trotted off...

1387
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,600
...very sadly.

1388
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,920
But you know what happened?

1389
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,960
Lassie came home, Maggie.

1390
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,920
Did the little boy make it with Lassie?

1391
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,440
Yes, he did.

1392
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:11,000


1393
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,920
You can hear them?

1394
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,880
Are they talking?

1395
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,040
-What about?
-You wouldn't be interested.

1396
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,280
I just want to hear her sweet voice.

1397
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,320
Oh, my God. He's killing her.

1398
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,680
He's killing her, all right.

1399
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,280
That girl of yours is a carnival ride.

1400
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,120
This is worse than I'd imagined.

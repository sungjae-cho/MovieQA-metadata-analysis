1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,320
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm in.

4
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,680
We're almost there.

5
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,600
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,000
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,920
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,120
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

9
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,800
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,800
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,680
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
To trust me.

13
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,680
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,720
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,080
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,680
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,080
I just wish...

22
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,880
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,880
That's all.

24
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
I just wish I knew.

25
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,520
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Here you are.

27
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,080
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,720
<i>These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.</i>

29
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,120
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,880
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,520
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

32
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,120
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,000
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
<i>- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.</i>

36
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,120
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,720
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Why not?

40
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,200
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,880
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,200
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Niobe.

44
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,280
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,720
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,920
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,680
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
What are we gonna do?

49
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,280
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

50
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,200
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,000
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,320
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I don't know.

57
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,320
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

58
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,920
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

59
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,480
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,080
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,920
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,600
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,480
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,880
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,600
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,080
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
He won't.

73
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,520
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,880
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,320
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,600
A gift.

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
You see, he set me free.

80
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,120
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,480
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

82
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,080
He gave you this.

83
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,880
He said you set him free.

84
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,120
Is everything all right, sir?

85
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,920
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

86
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,200
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

87
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,000
Go.

88
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Hiya, fellas.

89
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

90
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

91
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
- He is still...
- Only human.

92
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,680
Upgrades.

93
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,800
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,520
It's happening exactly as before.

95
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,200
Well, not exactly.

96
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

97
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Agents just came out of nowhere.

98
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

99
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,600
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

100
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
Where is he now?

101
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,200
He's doing his Superman thing.

102
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
Where are you?

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,400
<i>This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.</i>

104
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.</i>

105
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

106
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,720
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

107
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.</i>

108
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,720
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

109
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
Roger that, Control.

110
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,320
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,120
No place like it.

112
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,320
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

113
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,080
<i>The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.</i>

114
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
Understood.

115
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
Captain Mifune.

116
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,320
Captain Morpheus.

117
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,200
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

118
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

119
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,880
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

120
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,520
- Link.
- Sir?

121
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,080
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

122
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,800
Understood, sir.

123
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,000
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

124
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

125
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,400
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

126
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,080
What happened?

127
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,600
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

128
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,320
Yeah, she can do that.

129
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,600
Neo!

130
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,280
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

131
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

132
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,080
You know what they say
about the life you save.

133
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't save his life.

134
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
Hiya, Neo.

135
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,000
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

136
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,720
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

137
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,520
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

138
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,880
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

140
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

141
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

142
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,320
Let me guess.

143
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,720
<i>I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

144
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,120
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

145
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm sure he has reasons...

146
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,920
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

147
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,520
You know, it's fate.

148
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,200
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

149
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,800
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

150
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,400
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,000
You saved yourself.

152
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,800
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

153
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,400
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

154
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

155
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,680
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

156
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,480
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

157
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,280
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

158
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

159
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,520
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

160
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,520
I don't want to hear that shit!

161
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,200
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

162
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,680
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.

163
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,480
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

164
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,120
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

165
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,600
How?

166
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,520
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

167
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,080
Not everyone believes what you believe.

168
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
My beliefs do not require them to.

169
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,920
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

170
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,720
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

171
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,680
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

172
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,880
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

173
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

174
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

175
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,720
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

176
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,600
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

177
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,920
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

178
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,920
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

179
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,120
- Captain.
- Councillor.

180
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,480
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

181
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,600
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

182
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,200
The people must be told
what is happening.

183
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Of course, councillor.

184
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,720
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

185
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,680
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

186
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,880
A panic is not what anyone wants.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

188
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,120
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

189
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

190
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,520
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

191
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,520
Consider that in the past six months...

192
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

193
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,600
This attack is an act of desperation.

194
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,480
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

195
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
I hope you're right, captain.

196
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,120
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

197
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,680
It is simply a matter of time.

198
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
My stop.

199
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,720
See you soon.

200
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,320
Hopefully not too soon.

201
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,520
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

202
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,200
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,720
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

204
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,000
<i>- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.</i>

205
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

206
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,800
<i>Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.</i>

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,280
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

208
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
<i>I have a daughter on the Icarus.</i>

209
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,520
No, wait.

210
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,080
It's all right. They need you.

211
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
- I need you.
- I know.

212
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,120
There's time.

213
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Where's my puss...?

214
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

215
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,000
God!

216
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,080
Uncle Link!

217
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,680
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

218
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,920
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

219
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
- Yeah!
- Okay!

220
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,280
Okay? All right.

221
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,400
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

222
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,720
One, two, three, lift!

223
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,920
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

224
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,720
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

225
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,680
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

226
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

227
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,480
You be careful with her.

228
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

229
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
Out the door! Both of you, march!

230
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,520
- Bye!
- Bye!

231
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm gonna get what?

232
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,320
<i>Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

233
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

234
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,600
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

235
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
- Why?
- You know why.

236
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

237
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,520
Maybe. But it's too late now.

238
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,200
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

239
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,880
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

240
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,920
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

241
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,720
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

242
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm afraid of it.

243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

244
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,320
It won't.

245
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,200
How can you say that to me?

246
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,320
Because of Morpheus.

247
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,880
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

248
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,120
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

249
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

250
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,920
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

251
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,000
...I'm starting to believe him too.

252
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,280
Be careful, Link.

253
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,720
Please be careful.

254
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,720
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

255
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

256
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,480
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

257
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,720
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

258
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
...our children.

259
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

260
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,280
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

261
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
...and who stand here beside us.

262
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,320
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

263
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,520
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

264
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,880
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

265
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,280
I give you Morpheus.

266
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Zion! Hear me!

267
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It is true what many of you have heard.

268
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,000
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

269
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,920
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

270
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,800
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

271
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,400
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

272
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,600
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

273
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,800
Why?

274
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,880
Because I believe something you do not?

275
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,880
No!

276
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,920
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

277
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,800
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

278
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,200
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

279
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,800
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

280
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,480
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

281
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,480
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

282
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,320
We are still here!

283
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Tonight...

284
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,080
...let us send a message to that army.

285
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,200
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

286
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,120
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

287
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
...of earth, steel and stone.

288
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

289
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,920
Tonight, let us make them remember:

290
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,880
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

291
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,200
I remember.

292
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,320
I remember you used to dance.

293
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,000
I remember you were pretty good.

294
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,880
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

295
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,320
...that will never change.

296
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,400
Niobe!

297
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,600
Some things do change.

298
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,800
Excuse me.

299
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,480
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,480
I was thinking, everyone is here.

301
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,280
Follow me.

302
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,520
Neo, what is it?

303
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,920
What's wrong?

304
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
It's okay, you can tell me.

305
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,400
Trinity...

306
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,280
Don't be afraid.

307
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,680
I can't lose you.

308
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,600
You're not gonna lose me.

309
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,320
You feel this?

310
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm never letting go.

311
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,480
Good night, Zion.

312
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Sweet dreams.

313
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,480
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

314
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,200
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

315
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

316
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,680
You first.

317
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,880
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

318
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,080
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

319
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,600
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

320
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,200
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

321
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,000
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

322
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,720
So could I.

323
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,080
It's nice tonight.

324
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,880
Very calm.

325
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,680
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

326
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,480
Not everyone.

327
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,280
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

328
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,280
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

329
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,320
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

330
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,720
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

331
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,920
That you are in fact still human.

332
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,120
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

333
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,200
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

334
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,800
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

335
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,280
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

336
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,320
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

337
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,720
I like it down here.

338
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:25,400
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

339
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,520
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.

340
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,480
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

341
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,800
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

342
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,480
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

343
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,000
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

344
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,120
And when I look at these machines...

345
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,080
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

346
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,120
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

347
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Of course not. How could they?

348
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
The idea is pure nonsense...

349
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,480
...but it does make one wonder just...

350
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,200
...what is control?

351
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,280
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

352
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,000
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

353
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,800
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

354
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,000
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

355
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
...our heat, our air.

356
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,680
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

357
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,320
No. No point.

358
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,880
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

359
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,280
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

360
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,120
Good point.

361
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

362
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,120
There is so much in this world...

363
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,000
...that I do not understand.

364
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,320
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

365
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,280
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

366
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,400
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

367
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,200
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

368
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,280
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

369
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,120
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

370
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,880
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

371
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,680
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

372
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,200
It's time to go.

373
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,520
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

374
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,920
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

375
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,520
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

376
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Right now, that operator's me.

377
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
I know.

378
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,680
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

379
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,880
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

380
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,000
It's always brought me luck.

381
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,080
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

382
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,600
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

383
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,800
Just keep it with you. Please.

384
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,880
For me.

385
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,520
Okay.

386
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

387
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Bane.

388
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,080
Is something wrong?

389
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,920
No, I'm fine.

390
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,800
I just wanted to catch you to say...

391
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,720
...good luck.

392
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
Thanks.

393
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,400
We'll see you.

394
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,880
Neo! Just in time.

395
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,280
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

396
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,000
I had to give something to Neo.

397
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,320
A gift from one of the orphans.

398
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,680
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

399
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,880
He said you'd understand.

400
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Thanks.

401
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,120
<i>I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.</i>

402
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,200
That is correct.

403
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,200
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

404
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
Of course.

405
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,200
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

406
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I understand that, commander.

407
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,480
<i>Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?</i>

408
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,280
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

409
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,920
Be careful.

410
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,920
Hello.

411
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,120
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

412
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,400
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

413
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,320
Apologize for what?

414
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,600
For this.

415
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,680
Good.

416
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

417
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,520
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

418
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,520
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

419
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,800
...until you fight them.

420
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,680
Come. She's waiting.

421
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,920
Where the hell did they go?

422
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,880
These are back doors, aren't they?

423
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Programmer access.

424
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,480
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

425
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,400
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

426
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,800
Are you a programmer?

427
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Then what are you?

428
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,680
I protect that which matters most.

429
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,600
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

430
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,720
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

431
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,080
My goodness, look at you.

432
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,120
You turned out all right, didn't you?

433
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,400
- How do you feel?
- L...

434
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,000
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

435
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,680
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

436
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,400
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

437
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,520
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

438
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,480
So...

439
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,800
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

440
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,280
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

441
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,120
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

442
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,520
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

443
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,720
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

444
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,280
...another kind of control.

445
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,800
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

446
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,680
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

447
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,920
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

448
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,520
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

449
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,120
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

450
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,920
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

451
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,200
Candy?

452
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,000
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

453
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,280
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

454
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,280
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

455
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,920
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

456
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,080
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

457
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,200
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

458
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,120
I love candy.

459
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,000
But why help us?

460
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,520
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

461
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

462
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,200
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

463
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,720
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

464
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,400
Look. See those birds?

465
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,880
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

466
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,720
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

467
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,680
There are programs running
all over the place.

468
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,080
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

469
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,920
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

470
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,000
Well, you hear about them all the time.

471
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,280
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

472
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,200
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

473
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,800
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

474
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,200
...is the system assimilating
some program...

475
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,800
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

476
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,880
Programs hacking programs.

477
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

478
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,680
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

479
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,920
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

480
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,400
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

481
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,280
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

482
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,080
...or return to the source.

483
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,800
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

484
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
Where you must go.

485
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

486
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,400
...in your dreams, haven't you?

487
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,320
A door made of light?

488
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,920
What happens when you go through
the door?

489
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,800
I see Trinity...

490
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
...and something happens...

491
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,000
...something bad.

492
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,000
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

493
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,720
- Do you see her die?
- No.

494
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,400
You have the sight now, Neo.

495
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,400
You are looking at the world
without time.

496
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,920
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

497
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,680
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

498
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,880
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

499
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,720
No, you've already made the choice.

500
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,280
Now you have to understand it.

501
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,280
No.

502
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,480
I can't do that. I won't.

503
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,520
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

504
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,000
Because you're the One.

505
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,000
What if I can't?

506
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,080
What happens if I fail?

507
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,520
Then Zion will fall.

508
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,280
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

509
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,720
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

510
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
The Keymaker?

511
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,520
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

512
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,200
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

513
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,800
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

514
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,680
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

515
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,480
What do all men with power want?
More power.

516
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,320
Be there at that exact time...

517
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,000
...and you will have a chance.

518
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,920
We must go.

519
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,280
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

520
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

521
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,400
But for what it's worth...

522
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,920
...you've made a believer out of me.

523
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,200
Good luck, kiddo.

524
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,120
Mr. Anderson.

525
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,080
Did you get my package?

526
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,320
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

528
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,080
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,720
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,800
Our connection.

531
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,480
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,920
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

533
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,600
...something overwritten or copied.

534
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,400
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

535
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,480
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,320
And what reason is that?

537
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,480
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,800
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,280
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

540
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,200
...but it happened anyway.

541
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,880
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,280
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

543
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,320
...but I didn't.

544
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,480
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

545
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,320
...compelled to disobey.

546
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,480
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,400
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,680
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,480
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,080
Congratulations.

551
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,120
Thank you.

552
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,080
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

553
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,200
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,000
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,920
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,280
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

557
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,080
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,200
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,120
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,800
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,320
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,720
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,480
Purpose.

564
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,280
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,680
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,480
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,280
Me, me, me.

568
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,520
Me too.

569
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,120
More.

570
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,520
It is inevitable.

571
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,280
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,880
Are you all right?

573
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,800
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,200
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

575
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,000
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,520
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,680
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

578
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,480
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,880
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,480
It felt like dying.

581
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,680
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,520
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

583
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,080
These points of intersection
are crucial...

584
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,000
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,000
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

586
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,720
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,080
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

588
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,920
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,920
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,480
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,280
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

592
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,720
<i>...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

593
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,280
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,720
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,480
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

596
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,000
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,400
<i>It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

598
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,520
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,480
Careful, commander.

600
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,920
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,800
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,520
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

604
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,280
There's no need for such an order.

605
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,880
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,400
<i>The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

607
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,480
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

608
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,400
<i>Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.</i>

609
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,400
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,880
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,600
Is there another?

612
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,920
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,920
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

614
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,520
...before I put you in one.

615
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,600
Is there no other?

616
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,200
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

617
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,200
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,000
<i>Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.</i>

619
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,320
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,400
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,400
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,520
Why?

623
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,920
Because some things
never change, Jason...

624
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,320
...and some things do.

625
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,400
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,800
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,520
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,520
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,280
Bad for us.

631
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,120
Here we go.

632
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,600
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,680
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,880
Follow me.

635
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,600
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

636
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,120
Right?

637
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,520
And the legendary Morpheus.

638
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,000
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

639
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,480
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

640
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,480
Something to eat? Drink?

641
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,680
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

642
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,320
For the sake of appearances.

643
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,800
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

644
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,800
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

645
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,600
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

646
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,600
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

647
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,720
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

648
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,880
...especially to curse with.

649
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,120
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

650
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,400
You know why we are here.

651
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,720
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

652
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:39,720
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

653
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,400
We are looking for the Keymaker.

654
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,320
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

655
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,280
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

656
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,120
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

657
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,800
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

658
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

659
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
But do you?

660
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,600
You think you do, but you do not.

661
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,920
You are here
because you were sent here.

662
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

663
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,400
It is, of course, the way of all things.

664
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,120
You see, there is only one constant...

665
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,280
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

666
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,000
Causality.

667
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,400
Action, reaction.

668
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,600
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

669
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,400
No. Wrong.

670
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,000
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

671
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,080
...and those without.

672
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,720
Look there at that woman.

673
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,120
My God, just look at her...

674
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,920
...affecting everyone around her.

675
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,600
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

676
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,480
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

677
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,720
...a very special dessert.

678
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,200
I wrote it myself.

679
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,480
It starts so simply...

680
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,000
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

681
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,600
...poetry.

682
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,120
First...

683
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,800
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

684
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,920
You can see it, Neo, yes?

685
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,880
She does not understand why.

686
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,520
Is it the wine? No.

687
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,920
What is it then? What is the reason?

688
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,800
And soon it does not matter.

689
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,800
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

690
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,080
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

691
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,520
And this is the nature of the universe.

692
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,080
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

693
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,720
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

694
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,720
Beneath our poised appearance...

695
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,920
...the truth is, we are completely...

696
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,520
...out of control.

697
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,280
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

698
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:31,880
Our only hope, our only peace, is
to understand it, to understand the why.

699
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,320
"Why" is what separates us from them...

700
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,720
...you from me.

701
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,480
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

702
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,800
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

703
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,600
Another link in the chain.

704
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,080
But fear not.

705
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,920
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

706
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,600
...I will tell you what to do next.

707
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,680
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

708
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Her time is almost up.

709
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,400
<i>Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.</i>

710
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,000
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

711
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:18,280
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.

712
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,280
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

713
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,000
<i>Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.</i>

714
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,280
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

715
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,800
<i>Cause and effect. Au revoir.</i>

716
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,600
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

717
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,600
Well, that didn't go so well.

718
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,000
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

719
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

720
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,120
Or didn't do something.

721
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,400
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

722
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,200
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

723
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,520
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

724
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Get out.

725
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:27,080
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

726
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:33,000
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

727
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,320
He was so different.

728
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,480
He was like you.

729
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,720
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

730
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,680
- What?
- A kiss.

731
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,120
Excuse me?

732
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,320
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

733
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,600
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

734
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,680
It's all over you both.

735
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,720
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

736
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,520
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

737
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,520
Just a sample.

738
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,480
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

739
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,400
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

740
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,680
Why should we trust you?

741
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,680
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

742
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,480
All right.

743
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,480
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

744
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
All right.

745
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,400
Terrible. Forget it.

746
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,680
Wait.

747
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,000
Okay.

748
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Yes.

749
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,480
That's it.

750
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,920
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

751
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,080
Come with me.

752
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,600
Not again.

753
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,400
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

754
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,320
These fellas work for my husband.

755
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,080
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

756
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,800
Aren't you, boys?

757
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,880
Yes, mistress.

758
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,680
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

759
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,920
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

760
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:08,000
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

761
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,000
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

762
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,600
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

763
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,280
...or you can stay there and die.

764
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,000
He's in the ladies' room!

765
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,680
Hurry.

766
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,280
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

767
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,280
I've been waiting for you.

768
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,400
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

769
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,200
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

770
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,280
There is no cause for this. What cause?

771
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,600
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

772
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,320
Lipstick? Lipstick.

773
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,200
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

774
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,400
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

775
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,680
Woman, this is nothing.

776
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:48,200
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

777
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,280
Have fun.

778
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,480
All right.

779
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,400
All right.

780
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,280
Let us find out where this goes.

781
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,200
You two, get the Keymaker.

782
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,400
That's a nice trick.

783
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,800
I cannot go back.

784
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,200
I'll handle them.

785
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:24,600
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

786
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Okay, you have some skill.

787
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,400
Kill him.

788
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,000
You see? He's just a man.

789
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,000
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

790
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,800
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

791
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

792
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,480
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

793
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,200
Close it, quick!

794
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,280
Could we move along?

795
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,200
Run!

796
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,680
Step away from the door.

797
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,800
We owe you for that.

798
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,120
Just like new.

799
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,800
Drop your weapon.

800
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,680
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

801
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,400
He can handle himself.

802
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,400
Get in back.

803
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,600
Shit.

804
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,480
<i>- Operator.
- Link, where am I?</i>

805
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,080
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

806
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,600
<i>- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

807
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,080
<i>- Shit!
- What?</i>

808
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,800
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

809
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,200
<i>- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

810
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,800
<i>- Operator.
- Get us out of here.</i>

811
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,600
<i>- Won 't be easy.
- I know. We're inside the core network.</i>

812
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,280
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

813
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,520
<i>- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.</i>

814
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,200
<i>- Fine, we'll make it.
- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

815
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,600
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

816
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,600
Hold on!

817
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,280
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

818
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,120
Are you watching this, Link?

819
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,800
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

820
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,600
Any suggestions?

821
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

822
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,200
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

823
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,000
<i>- Got it.
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.</i>

824
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,680
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?

825
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,200
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

826
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,800
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

827
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,000
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

828
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,680
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

829
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,680
Then let us hope...

830
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,200
...that I was wrong.

831
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,600
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

832
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,400
We've been sent to bring you in.

833
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,480
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

834
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,600
<i>- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.</i>

835
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,600
Repeat, they're approaching the...

836
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,720
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

837
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,720
<i>Shots fired.</i>

838
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,000
Move!

839
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,600
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

840
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,600
Trinity.

841
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,120
Get him out of here.

842
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,600
Come on!

843
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,400
Crush him.

844
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,600
Morpheus.

845
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,200
He's okay. Keep moving.

846
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,880
Let's go.

847
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,480
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

848
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,880
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

849
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,400
Wait.

850
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,120
Cancel that.

851
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,400
You are handy.

852
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,400
Jump on.

853
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,600
She means nothing.

854
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,800
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

855
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,200
<i>One-Adam- 12, please respond.</i>

856
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,000
Get down.

857
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,200
Gotcha.

858
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,000
She's good.

859
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,400
You are no longer necessary.

860
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,320
We do only what we're meant to do.

861
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,280
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

862
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,000
Go kick his ass.

863
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,720
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

864
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,800
What is that?

865
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,200
Yes! Yes!

866
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,600
<i>We have confirmation from the Icarus.</i>

867
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,400
First two ships
are in position for counterattack.

868
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,720
Good.

869
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,600
Any change?

870
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,400
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

871
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,600
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

872
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,200
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

873
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,600
Yes, sir.

874
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,000
<i>There is a building.</i>

875
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:16,600
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

876
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,600
...and no stair can reach.

877
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:25,120
<i>This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.</i>

878
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,520
Hidden places.

879
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,280
But one door is special.

880
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,600
One door leads to the source.

881
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,800
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

882
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,320
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

883
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,120
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

884
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,080
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

885
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,520
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

886
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,600
- Lf one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

887
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,520
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

888
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,200
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

889
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,400
<i>There is a power station.</i>

890
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,720
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

891
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,000
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

892
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:26,200
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed.</i>

893
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,120
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated.</i>

894
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,600
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

895
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

896
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,720
- There's no time.
- Why?

897
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,800
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

898
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,200
But another connection
must first be made.

899
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,720
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

900
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,400
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

901
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,720
<i>That is the length and breadth
of the window.</i>

902
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,000
Only the One can open the door...

903
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,000
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

904
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,800
How do you know all this?

905
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,920
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

906
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,280
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

907
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,320
Neo, I know something's wrong.

908
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,880
You don't have to tell me.

909
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,720
I just want you to know that I'm here.

910
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,520
All must be done as one.

911
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,600
Can't hurt.

912
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
If one fails...

913
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,400
<i>... all fail.</i>

914
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,400
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

915
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:53,920
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

916
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,520
Hey!

917
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:59,520
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

918
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,400
Okay, they're inside.

919
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,920
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

920
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,600
Oh, shit.

921
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:26,000
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

922
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,600
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

923
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

924
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:38,880
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

925
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:44,400
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

926
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,000
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

927
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,480
<i>I see purpose.</i>

928
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:59,200
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

929
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:04,200
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

930
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,520
...the very meaning of our lives.

931
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,680
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

932
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,080
I promise you, if I can, I will.

933
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,600
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

934
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,400
...no matter what...

935
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,800
...to stay out of the Matrix?

936
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,600
Why?

937
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,520
Please.

938
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,800
All right.

939
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,400
What is it, Niobe?

940
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,480
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

941
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,800
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

942
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,800
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

943
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,720
But how would that be different
from any other day?

944
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:14,000
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

945
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,120
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

946
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,280
<i>... in any place.</i>

947
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,280
Incoming. Incoming!

948
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,800
Incoming!

949
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,800
Now consider the alternative.

950
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,400
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

951
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,800
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

952
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,600
Isn't that worth fighting for?

953
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,200
Isn't that worth dying for?

954
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,600
- Time?
- Three minutes.

955
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,800
Almost there.

956
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,400
It is done.

957
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,800
Find the others.

958
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,000
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

959
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,680
- What about Soren?
- There.

960
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,600
They're still inside, but...

961
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,520
They're not moving.

962
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,480
That's it, let's go.

963
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,320
Call Neo now.

964
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,800
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

965
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,080
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

966
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,600
Jesus.

967
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:19,680
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

968
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,680
The hell it is.

969
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,680
What are you...? Trinity!

970
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,800
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

971
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
We're talking less than five minutes.

972
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,600
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

973
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,200
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

974
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,200
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

975
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,800
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

976
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,800
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

977
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,680
<i>- Operator.
- I'm in.</i>

978
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,920
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

979
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,480
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

980
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:21,800
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

981
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,800
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

982
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:30,200
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

983
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,880
I want exactly what you want.

984
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,120
I want everything.

985
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,920
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

986
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,800
Go ahead, shoot.

987
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

988
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,400
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

989
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,200
Hold it right there, little lady.

990
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,880
If you can't beat us...

991
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,800
Join us.

992
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,000
Morpheus!

993
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

994
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,200
One minute.

995
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Come on.

996
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,000
Come on.

997
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,400
Please.

998
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,400
Kill them.

999
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:22,880
They're in.

1000
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,000
<i>I don 't believe it.</i>

1001
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,920
It was meant to be.

1002
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:47,200
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1003
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,800
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1004
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,080
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1005
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,600
Hello, Neo.

1006
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,800
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1007
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,400
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1008
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,600
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1009
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,680
...you remain irrevocably human.

1010
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,280
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1011
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,600
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1012
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,280
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1013
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,680
Why am I here?

1014
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,600
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1015
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,000
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1016
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:38,080
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1017
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,000
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1018
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:45,400
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1019
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,000
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1020
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:52,400
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1021
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:56,400
...which has led you, inexorably...

1022
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,480
...here.

1023
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:02,600
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1024
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,400
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1025
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,120
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1026
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,600
The Matrix is older than you know.

1027
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,600
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1028
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,000
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1029
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,480
<i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1030
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:24,000
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1031
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,400
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1032
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:30,480
...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1033
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,800
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1034
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,200
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1035
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,480
<i>You can 't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1036
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,400
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1037
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,600
<i>You can 't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1038
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,200
Choice.

1039
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,200
The problem is choice.

1040
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:16,000
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1041
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,920
Flawless, sublime.

1042
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,400
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1043
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,400
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1044
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,680
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1045
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,720
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1046
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,720
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1047
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:39,000
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1048
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,880
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1049
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,000
...because it required a lesser mind.

1050
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:50,880
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1051
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:55,600
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1052
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:00,320
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1053
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:06,200
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1054
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,000
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1055
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:13,520
<i>As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...</i>

1056
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,400
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1057
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,600
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1058
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,000
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1059
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:28,000
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1060
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,800
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1061
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:35,120
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1062
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:39,200
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1063
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,000
This is about Zion.

1064
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,000
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1065
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:49,400
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1066
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:50,720
Bullshit.

1067
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,920
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1068
01:49:54,080 --> 01:50:00,320
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1069
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,320
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1070
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,680
The function of the One...

1071
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,400
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1072
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,200
...reinserting the prime program.

1073
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:28,600
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1074
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,800
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1075
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,400
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1076
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,800
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1077
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,400
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1078
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,600
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1079
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,800
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1080
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:54,080
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1081
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,880
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1082
01:50:57,120 --> 01:51:00,480
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1083
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,200
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1084
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,800
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1085
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,320
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1086
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,920
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1087
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,320
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1088
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,280
...your experience is far more specific...

1089
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,400
...vis-á-vis love.

1090
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,880
Trinity!

1091
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:39,200
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1092
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,600
No.

1093
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,200
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1094
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:48,400
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1095
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,400
...as both beginning and end.

1096
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,080
There are two doors.

1097
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,400
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1098
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:04,000
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1099
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:08,320
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1100
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,800
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1101
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,920
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1102
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:21,120
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1103
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,680
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1104
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:32,080
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1105
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1106
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,600
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1107
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,880
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1108
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,400
We won't.

1109
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,680
We got a serious situation, sir.

1110
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,200
Oh, no.

1111
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,800
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

1112
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,000
Holy shit, he caught her.

1113
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,200
Neo, I had to.

1114
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,000
I know.

1115
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,320
The bullet is still inside.

1116
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,400
Trinity...

1117
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:31,200
...don't you quit on me now.

1118
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,480
I'm sorry.

1119
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,000
Trinity.

1120
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,400
Trinity...

1121
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,320
...I know you can hear me.

1122
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,520
I'm not letting go.

1123
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,200
I can't.

1124
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,480
I love you too damn much.

1125
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,200
I can't take this.

1126
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,800
I guess this makes us even.

1127
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,800
I don't understand it.

1128
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,880
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1129
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1130
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,800
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1131
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,200
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1132
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,120
- What?
- How do you know that?

1133
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,520
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1134
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:23,200
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1135
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,000
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1136
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:31,200
The prophecy was a lie.

1137
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,200
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1138
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:38,320
It was all another system of control.

1139
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,400
I don't believe that.

1140
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:44,000
But you said it yourself.

1141
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:48,000
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1142
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,200
I'm sorry.

1143
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,600
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1144
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,800
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1145
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,480
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1146
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:11,800
Oh, no!

1147
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,000
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1148
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,600
It's a bomb.

1149
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,880
We have to get out of here. Now.

1150
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:05,920
I have dreamed a dream...

1151
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,000
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1152
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,800
Here they come.

1153
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,720
Let's go, Morpheus.

1154
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1155
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,200
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1156
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,280
What?

1157
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,400
I can feel them.

1158
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,880
Neo!

1159
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,320
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1160
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,200
<i>It's the Hammer.</i>

1161
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:39,000
He's in some kind of coma...

1162
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,280
...but his vitals are stable.

1163
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,320
What about you?

1164
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,480
I'm fine.

1165
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,880
You could use some rest.

1166
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,800
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1167
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,200
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1168
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:03,120
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1169
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,920
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1170
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:09,400
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1171
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,200
...until someone screwed it up.

1172
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,800
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1173
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,720
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

1174
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,920
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1175
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,800
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1176
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,280
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1177
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,200
Who?

1178
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,880
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1179
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,200
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1180
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,480
You found one?

1181
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,800
Only one.

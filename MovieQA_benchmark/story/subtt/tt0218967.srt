1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,502
This will be the final

3
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,090
to London, Heathrow.

4
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,132
Okay.

5
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,267
I'm not even

6
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,937
Then it'll be
like I never left.

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,606
Okay ?

8
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,578
Wait.

9
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,500
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

10
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,751
About the plane ?

11
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,131
You think it's gonna crash ?
Don't say that.

12
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,217
No. Look, I know that
we've talked about this

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,887
and we agreed that
going to London was

14
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,725
But in my heart...
this feels wrong.

15
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,354
Don't go, Jack.
You mean don't go at all ?

16
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,772
Well, what--
what about my internship ?

17
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,568
Believe me, I know--
I know what an incredible

18
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,697
For us, Kate.
Right, for us.

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,158
But I'm afraid that
if you get on that plane--

20
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:01,496
We're at the airport.
Nobody ever thinks clearly

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,291
So we should just trust
the decision we already made.

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,001
You've been accepted
to one of the best law schools

23
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:12,715
I've got this internship
at Barclay's Bank.

24
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,844
You wanna do something
great, Jack ?

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,725
Let's flush the plan.
Let's start our lives

26
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,226
I mean, I have no idea
what this life is gonna

27
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:28,482
but I know that it has
the both of us in it,

28
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:34,278
The plan doesn't
make us great, Jack.

29
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,615
What we have together,
that's what makes us great.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,587
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you too. I do.

31
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:59,553
And one year in London
is not gonna change that.

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,181
A hundred years
couldn't change that.

33
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,161
Experts are predicting
a mild rally in the bond market.

34
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:37,424
Last night was incredible.

35
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,678
I said, last night was great.

36
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,346
You are
an amazing lover.

37
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,599
Thanks.
You're not bad yourself.

38
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:49,185
- I wanna see you again.
- I'd like that too.

39
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,481
Tonight.
It's Christmas eve, Jack.

40
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:57,028
So ? I'll pour
eggnog over you.

41
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,781
- I have to go visit

42
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,828
Jersey ? Do you have
any idea what the traffic's

43
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,413
That's why I'm taking
the train.

44
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,751
It was nice
meeting you, Jack.

Mrs. Peterson.
Hello, Jack.

56
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:18,232
You don't have to stop
singing on my account.

57
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,529
So, when are you gonna leave
that old corpse, Mr. Peterson,

58
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,033
You know you could never
satisfy me the way he does.

59
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,412
Ah.

60
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,538
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Campbell.

61
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:34,748
How'd you make out
this year, Tony ?

62
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:39,461
About four grand,
and a bottle of 25-year-old

63
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,589
I'm putting it all in
commercial paper like you said.

64
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,966
Good, but just until
the deutsche mark turns.

65
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:46,594
- Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
- All right.

66
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:31,012
Good morning, Joe.
Merry Christmas, sir.

67
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:39,647
Campbell wants
these available.

68
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,650
Better you than me.

69
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:48,155
If Med Tech shares fall
any lower than 43,

70
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,158
we're in trouble
with the stock valuations.

71
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,994
So for God's sake,
please watch what you say

72
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:59,500
We still have almost a full day
of trading before zero hour,

73
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,544
A penny for

74
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:06,840
Hmm ? Oh, God, I'm sorry.

75
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:09,843
Jack, I was thinking about,
you know, Dee and the kids.

76
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:12,179
I promised
I'd be home for dinner.

77
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,965
- Oh, is that tonight ?

78
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:19,060
You think I like being
here on Christmas eve, Alan ?

79
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:21,437
No. Well, maybe.

80
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,983
Okay.

81
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:29,404
Okay, maybe I do have
a touch of tunnel vision

82
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:31,741
But in two days
we're going to announce...

83
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,993
one of the largest mergers
in U.S. corporate history.

84
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:38,914
When a deal like this turns up,
you get on it and you ride it

85
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:42,710
You don't ask it
for a vacation.

86
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,878
December 26. After that
there'll be so much money

87
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,923
it'll be like Christmas
every day.

88
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:52,386
December 26, people. If you'd
like to celebrate that day,

89
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,513
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

90
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,267
I want my gift to you
to be the first gift you open

91
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,103
Because my gift comes

92
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,065
You're right.
I'm focused. I'm there.

93
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,984
Good man. Everybody,
turn to page 12

94
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,120
You have six messages.
Two of them are imperative.

95
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:22,291
I'm not even here now.
Good night. Merry Christmas.

96
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,251
It's only 8:30.
I'm disappointed. Got some

97
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:29,424
You too ? This holiday's about
giving. I'm giving everything

98
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:33,759
So in a way, I'm more
Christmassy than anybody.

99
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,306
Oh, and Oxford called.
Ooh, my suits are ready.

100
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,642
- Mm-hmm.
- Care for a Lifesaver ?

101
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,936
No, thank you.
Help yourself.

102
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:52,987
Kate Reynolds.
Her assistant said you could

103
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,572
Kate Reynolds was
my girlfriend in college.

104
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,000
I almost married her.

105
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,118
Married ?
Almost married.

106
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:03,998
And almost a broker
at E.F. Hutton.

107
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:07,335
She didn't want me
to go to London.

108
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,255
We're standing at the airport
saying good-bye,

109
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,050
So you left her.

110
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:17,136
- Wasn't easy.
- Oh, stop it.

111
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,305
I took the road
less traveled, Adelle.

112
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:23,850
And look where it took ya.
I'm gonna get this gal

113
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:30,816
Nope.
You almost married

114
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,902
You're not even curious
why she called ?

115
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,238
She's probably just having
a fit of nostalgia.

116
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:39,742
Lonely Christmas eve. Called
the one that got away. Why

117
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,244
This happened
a very, very long time ago.

118
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:45,122
8:35 on Christmas eve.

119
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,374
Jack Campbell still
at his desk.

120
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,711
Now there's
a Hallmark moment for you.

121
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,798
Peter, I don't see you
rushing home to trim the tree.

122
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:58,677
That's because
I'm a heartless bastard

123
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,222
Well, you know what ?
God love you for that.

124
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:06,560
Got a call
from Terry Haight.

125
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,104
Bob Thomas is nervous.

126
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,733
That'll happen when you're
about to spend $130 billion

127
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,569
Somebody's gotta
nurse him through this.

128
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,947
Why are you staring
at my breasts, Peter ?

129
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:19,948
I need you, tiger.
Where is he ?

130
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:23,368
- Aspen.
- Call Aunt Irma and tell her

131
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:26,205
You're a credit
to capitalism, Jack.

132
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,206
Hey, Peter, let me
ask you a question.

133
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,585
An old girlfriend
calls you out of the blue

134
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:35,338
- What do you do ?
- You suddenly having trouble

135
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:39,676
- Yeah.
- Leave it in the past.

136
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,930
Old flames are like
old tax returns--

137
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:46,141
put 'em in the file cabinet
for three years, and then

138
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,106
I'll leave from my office
tomorrow in the afternoon.

139
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,400
Call the group.
Schedule an emergency

140
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,362
That'll be a nice
little holiday treat.

141
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,554
Good night, Frank.
Hey, Mr. Campbell.

142
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:28,432
Why didn't you call down ?
I would have had Joe

143
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,978
I'm thinking I'll walk tonight.
It's a nice night for it.

144
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:33,104
I'll send your car
home for you.

145
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,732
- And Merry Christmas
to you, sir.

146
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:25,364
Eggnog ?
Yeah, dairy case.

147
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,409
Okay.

148
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:41,881
Hey, yo. Y'all
do the lotto here, right ?

149
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,508
Yeah.
Cool. 'Cause I got a winner,

150
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:49,056
Certified, good as gold. I know
lotto keep a lot of brothers

151
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,599
Don't do me none, son,
'cause I'd be like--

152
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:54,686
Bang on the lottery !
You know what I mean ?

153
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,021
Relax, son. Relax.
I got you four numbers.

154
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:02,318
6, 14, 16, 49.
That's a winner, son.

155
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:05,321
$238, B.
Cheddar coming.

156
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:10,285
Give me my money.
I'm sorry. Your ticket bad.

157
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:14,413
What are you talking about, B. ?
You draw in the lines with

158
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:18,251
Yo, buster,
check the ticket, son.

159
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:21,336
Yo, you ain't even looked
at the ticket. You looking

160
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:24,214
You get out now !
You take the ticket

161
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:26,509
Next customer in line !

162
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,761
You get out or I call 9-1-1.

163
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,555
Oh, my God !

164
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:34,934
Check the ticket, stupid.

165
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:39,355
Look at the ticket.
Shit, now I'm gonna

166
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,067
That's my word. You best
check that ticket, fool!

167
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,527
Was I talking to you ?

168
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,905
Maybe I'll buy it from you.
You know, make a little

169
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,036
Stupid-ass white boy in
$2,000 suit gets capped trying

170
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,959
That's what you wanna see ?
You wanna see Cash up in here ?

171
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:02,878
Do you wanna die ?

172
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,090
Do you want to die ?

173
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,552
No.

174
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:17,559
Look, I'm talking about
a business deal.

175
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:20,520
Okay ? I buy the ticket
from you for $200.

176
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:24,400
I take it to a store where
the guy behind the counter

177
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,319
I just made myself
a quick $38.

178
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:29,864
Like I said, it's--

179
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:32,157
it's just a business deal.

180
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,253
All right. Yeah.

181
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,254
All right.

182
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:53,136
You blew it, B.
You blew it.

183
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:57,140
The ticket was real.
Damn, you had your chance too.

184
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,353
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.

185
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,369
How'd you know my name
was Jack ?

186
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,704
I call
all you guys Jack.

187
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:23,958
Here. Nice doing
business with ya.

188
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:28,088
Hey. Hey, um--

189
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:33,385
What do you want to carry
that gun around for anyway ?

190
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:36,887
You're just gonna wind up
doing something you regret.

191
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:39,224
You're talking
to the wrong person

192
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:43,812
I mean, there must be
programs out there

193
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:47,356
Wait a minute.
Are you actually trying

194
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,443
This is bananas.

195
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,531
This man thinks
I need to be saved, yo !

196
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,533
Well, everybody
needs something.

197
00:15:56,658 --> 00:16:00,244
Yeah ? Well, what
do you need, Jack ?

198
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,125
Me ?
You just said,

199
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,376
I got everything I need.

200
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,878
Wow. It must be great
being you.

201
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:13,591
I'm not saying that you'd be
able to do it without some hard

202
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,010
and possibly some medicine.

203
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,557
You know, I'm gonna
really enjoy this.

204
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,728
You just remember that
you did this, Jack, okay ?

205
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,354
You brought this
on yourself.

206
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,028
Merry Christmas.

207
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,995
Mmm, ten more minutes, Jack.

208
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,830
It's Christmas.

209
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:24,054
♪Jingle bells
Santa smells

210
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:27,808
- ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la ♪

211
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,643
- Who's here ?
- Rise and shine.

212
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:33,605
Don't you think
we should open some presents ?

213
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:37,191
- I think you should give Mama
five more minutes in bed.

214
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,902
Can we do that ?
Yea !

215
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,741
- It's Christmas !
- Look, your sister's

216
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:48,329
What is this dog
doing on the bed?

217
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,747
Did Santa come ?
I don't know.

218
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,416
- Let's go see the presents.
- You wanna get some presents ?

219
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,543
Mommy just needs
to wake up.

220
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,797
Jack. Strong coffee.

221
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,808
Oh, Jack.
Merry Christmas, dear.

222
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,104
Lorraine. Ed.

223
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:17,815
Hey, Jack, you old bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya.

224
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,360
Talk to him. One day a year
away from the Ponderosa.

225
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:23,195
- I don't think
that's asking too much.

226
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:26,574
Tell her, Jack, for God's sake.
You're the only one around here

227
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,370
- I need some eggnog.
- 'Course you do, sweet thing.

228
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:32,121
Excuse me.
Where you going,

229
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,006
Josh, Annie, giddyup !
Where's my car ?

230
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,007
What ?
Where's my Ferrari ?

231
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:46,427
What the hell are you talking--
What's he talking about ?

232
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:48,971
Let me borrow your car
and then I promise

233
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,431
My Caddy ?
Drive your own damn car.

234
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,934
Oh, just let him borrow
your precious Cadillac,

235
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,563
There's a perfectly
good minivan sitting out there

236
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,232
What the hell's wrong
with him anyway ?

237
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:32,055
- Tony, thank God !
- Sorry, pal. Entrance is for

238
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,226
What ? What are
you talking about ?

239
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,688
Jack Campbell, penthouse "C."
What's the matter with you ?

240
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,940
Mrs. Peterson, I think
there's something wrong

241
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:44,986
Who is this man ?

242
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,488
Oh, come on.
What is going on

243
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:52,952
Is this like a, uh--
a Christmas joke ?

244
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:56,288
"Who is this man ?"
Well, we're on the co-op board

245
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,664
And we fought side by side
for garbage disposals.

246
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:02,044
And every morning we exchange
quasi-sexual witty banter.

247
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,713
Okay ?
Shall I call the cops ?

248
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,299
No, I'm gonna call the cops !
You're scaring me.

249
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,177
- No, no, no, no.
- Thank you for not

250
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,930
Now, I'm going upstairs,
I'm gonna get some sleep.

251
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,599
Sleep you shall.
Noblesse oblige isn't dead.

252
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:19,895
Let's, um--Let's get you
some help. Surely there's a

253
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,980
A shelter ?

254
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:26,151
Hey, hey, are you
smacked out of your head ?

255
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:29,612
I'm the richest man in
this building ! I've got twice

256
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:32,323
And I'm going upstairs.
Take a walk, pal.

257
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:35,118
Oh, not cool.
Not cool !

258
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:37,704
You wanna get cute ?
Get cute.

259
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,873
I'm gonna go to my office.
I'm gonna file a complaint

260
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,753
I'm gonna have you fired, Tony.
And, Mrs. Peterson, you're on

261
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,591
So you better just stop
whatever this is

262
00:21:57,266 --> 00:22:00,394
Oh, yeah.
Oh. Oh, yeah.

263
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,187
Oh, come on !

264
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:14,282
Frank, you won't believe
what's been happening to me.

265
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,284
Hold it right there.
Where's Mintz ?

266
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:19,496
The building is closed, pal.
You have to come back tomorrow.

267
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:24,167
Frank, why do I feel
the need to remind you that

268
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:29,089
I don't care who you are.
It's Christmas, and like I told

269
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,216
I don't think
you heard me correctly.

270
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,926
I'm Jack Campbell.

271
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,220
Jack Campbell !

272
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:40,100
President !

273
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:50,319
Have a nice holiday, man.

274
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:12,882
- That's my car !
- Hi, Jack.

275
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:15,676
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is

276
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:17,803
and you're feeling
quite shocked, but just hop in.

277
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:21,515
I'll explain everything
to you, okay ?

278
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,560
Come on.

279
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,561
Come on.

280
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,571
You're probably gonna
wanna buckle up, Jack.

281
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:44,830
- What's happening to me ?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.

282
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:48,876
This kind of thing makes
a lot of guys have to throw up.

283
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,462
So if you feel the urge,
you roll down the window

284
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:55,549
Try not to get

285
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,550
After all, you brought
this on yourself.

286
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,762
Brought what on myself ?
I didn't do anything !

287
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,266
" I got everything I need."
That sound familiar ?

288
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,728
You mean 'cause you thought
I was cocky, I'm now on

289
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,563
Bag yourself, Jack.

290
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,861
Oh, my God! Ah !

291
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:20,658
The way you intervened
in that store last night, you

292
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:24,577
I mean, it was
incredibly impressive all

293
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,329
Oh, God !
to the upper echelons

294
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:30,041
Please just tell me
what's happening to me

295
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,919
without the mumbo-jumbo.

296
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:36,549
This is a glimpse, Jack.
A glimpse ?

297
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:39,092
I--A glimpse of what ?

298
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:42,095
You're gonna have to
figure that out for yourself

299
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,889
- How much time ?
- As much time as it takes,

300
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,100
which in your case is probably
gonna be considerable.

301
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:49,811
Okay, look, look. I-I-I
just want my life back, okay ?

302
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:53,274
Now, what's it gonna take ?
You wanna talk turkey ?

303
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:56,026
Let's talk turkey.
How much money ?

304
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:59,738
- It doesn't work like that,
and I can't tell you why.

305
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,782
Because you have to figure
this thing out for yourself.

306
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:06,118
Are you listening to me ?
Figure it out, figure it out.

307
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:09,456
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this

308
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:13,585
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on

309
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:19,675
What's this ?
Open it.

310
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,426
What is it,
some kind of a signal ?

311
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:27,890
Will you come

312
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,975
Now you gotta
get out of the car, Jack.

313
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,857
But what do I do ?
I'm sorry. I can't spend

314
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:39,611
I got some other business
I gotta take care of.

315
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,864
You can't just
leave me like this.

316
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,911
Okay. Look, you wanna
get some air ? Let's get

317
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:51,956
We'll walk and I'll explain
everything to you, okay ?

318
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,752
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

319
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,931
Excuse me. Do you know
where Merrison Street is ?

320
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:53,143
Jeannie.

321
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,979
I found Jack.
Oh, there you are, stranger.

322
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,565
Where you been ?

323
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:08,949
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.

324
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,620
Kate called and asked
if I knew where you were, so--

325
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:19,460
Oh, I put the Barcalounger
in the center of the room.

326
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,463
What do you think ?

327
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,717
It's a great room.
Great room.

328
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:29,638
You and me, buddy,
we know how to live, huh ?

329
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:31,597
Come on.

330
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:36,645
Come on, Jack.
Come on--

331
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,846
Whoo !

332
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,484
Come on, buddy.
Take your seat.

333
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,243
Are you okay ?

334
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,164
I mean, you take off Christmas
morning and you don't tell

335
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:04,630
- We're friends ?
- Talk to me.

336
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,635
I'm having kind of
a bad day.

337
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:14,264
You know, I read somewhere
that the suicide rate doubles

338
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:17,183
What am I saying that for ?
You don't wanna hear that.

339
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:22,021
Is it--
Is it trouble at work ?

340
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,316
I--I don't think so.

341
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,361
Well, it's not Kate,
is it ?

342
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:33,992
You see, huh ?
It's like we're inside

343
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:36,161
Kate's my wife.

344
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:41,541
Just keep saying it over
and over again, Jack,

345
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:51,010
Look, you know,
you fit the profile exactly--

346
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:55,472
in your 30s, house, kids,
financial responsibilities.

347
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:58,890
You start thinking
this isn't the life

348
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,728
Where's the romance,
you know ?

349
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:04,271
Where's the joie de vivre ?

350
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:09,736
Suddenly every lingerie ad
in the Newark Star-Ledger...

351
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:12,405
represents a life
that you can't have.

352
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,745
It's just two kids,
right ?

353
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:23,332
Come on. Come on.

354
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:27,128
All right, sometimes
it feels like you gave up

355
00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:30,589
But look what you got.
Look at that:

356
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:33,760
two-and-a-half baths,
a partially finished basement.

357
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,846
And good kids.
Look. You know what ?

358
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:39,307
You probably don't wanna
hear this right now.

359
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:43,186
But remember last summer when
I almost had that thing with

360
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:45,146
You remember what
you said to me ?

361
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:50,108
You said, " Don't screw up
the best thing in your life...

362
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:53,071
just because
you're a little unsure

363
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:55,113
Okay ?

364
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,626
Go get 'em, tiger.

365
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,868
Could you hold on
a second?

366
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:54,256
Um, never mind because--
because he just walked in.

367
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,551
Thank you. Thank you.

368
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:03,432
Do you... have any idea
what you put us through today ?

369
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:07,060
You walk out of here
at 7:30 in the morning.

370
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:11,022
You don't tell me
where you're going,

371
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:13,526
And I don't see you
till hours later ?

372
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,029
I called all of our friends.
I had the state troopers

373
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:20,199
I was on the phone
with the hospital,

374
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:25,077
What kind of man leaves his
family Christmas morning without

375
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:28,415
What kind of a man
does that, Jack ?

376
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,709
Could you--Could you please
stop yelling at me ?

377
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:39,468
Where were you ?
I was in the city.

378
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:42,887
The city ?
New York City ?

379
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:45,224
Yeah.
Why ?

380
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:52,688
Because that's where I live.
Don't start, Jack.

381
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:55,192
Look, you don't understand.

382
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:58,486
I--I--I woke up
this morning here.

383
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,408
And this is very strange
because...

384
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:05,410
this isn't my house.

385
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,537
And those aren't my kids.

386
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:12,083
I-I-I'm not a dad.
You're not my wife.

387
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,584
You know what, Jack.
It's not funny this time...

388
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,587
because I am really mad.

389
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:19,173
I mean, really mad.
I mean it.

390
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:20,677
I don't even--

391
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:26,932
What--

392
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,183
What's that ?

393
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:36,274
I like it.
Thanks, Dad.

394
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,859
That's mine. Hey,
I need that back.

395
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:41,195
She took my bell.

396
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:44,824
You missed the whole thing--

397
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,661
the pancakes
and the presents.

398
00:32:47,744 --> 00:32:51,247
You spent six hours
putting that bike together

399
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:54,918
and then you didn't even
get to see the look on her face

400
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,297
You missed Christmas, Jack.

401
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:05,010
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,182
You know, we don't even

403
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:13,519
And at least you're okay.
I'm okay, we're okay.

404
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:17,815
But you've gotta get dressed
for the Thompson party.

405
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,109
I don't care how hilarious
you think it is.

406
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,694
Party ? No, I'm not
going to a party.

407
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:26,115
You look forward
to this party all year.

408
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,368
Believe me, Kate.
I really don't think

409
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:31,746
is the right move for me
at the present time.

410
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay, fine. You know what ?
Then you just do

411
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:40,088
What are you doing ?
Telling my mother she doesn't

412
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:42,924
Why not ?
Because you'll be here.

413
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:49,209
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

414
00:33:56,812 --> 00:34:01,484
This is--This is
just subpar.

415
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:28,010
♪ Oh, the weather outside
is frightful ♪

416
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,721
Lance, here you go.

417
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,933
Excuse me.

418
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:39,104
♪ Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow ♪

419
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:42,232

signs of stopping ♪

420
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:44,401
Kate. Jack.
Evelyn.

421
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:47,487
Come in. Hey, everybody,
Kate and Jack are here.

422
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,573
Hey !

423
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:51,783
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

424
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,952
Jack,
Merry Christmas.

425
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:59,124
Whoops.
Here.

426
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:02,209
So, like the dress ?
Oh, it's lovely.

427
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:05,880
I thought
I saw you notice it

428
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,215
It's lovely.
It's lovely.

429
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:20,688
There he is.

430
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:23,981
Hey, Jack.
Happy holidays, man.

431
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,611
Jack, come on over.

432
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:34,116
Hey, Jack.
Cheers, baby.

433
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,287
You guys see Van Horn
last night ?

434
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:40,791
That kid's gonna take
the Nets to the championship.

435
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,792
They suck.

436
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:48,714
But they're due.
They're certainly due.

437
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,634
So, tomorrow's
the big day, Jackie.

438
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:54,512
Okay. Why ?

439
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:57,182
My triple bypass.

440
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:59,850
I'm going
under the knife tomorrow.

441
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,854
Triple bypass.
Yeah.

442
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:04,397
You really think you
should be eating all that ?

443
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:06,398
Figure I'm going in
for a cleaning tomorrow.

444
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,653
Might as well load up
on the fried stuff tonight,

445
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,236
That's good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.

446
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:15,658
Some fried pork,
mashed potatoes.

447
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:18,745
- How 'bout a cigar, Jack ?
- Oh, no, thank you.

448
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:21,664
- Come on. They're
American made, not Cuban.

449
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,333
Come on.

450
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,003
Very nice.
I thought you'd like 'em.

451
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:32,383
Mm. Mmm !

452
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:34,386
Superb.

453
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:37,137
How 'bout you, Arnie ?
I'm all right. Thanks.

454
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:41,349
Finger food ?
No, thank you.

455
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,104
Come on.
Soon as I put 'em down,

456
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,230
You always do.
No, I'm okay.

457
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:49,023
Let me. They will melt
in your mouth.

458
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,695
Yeah.

459
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:58,827
Good ?
Fabulous.

460
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,580
At the end of this whole thing,
she made me this

461
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:05,666
It was really lovely.

462
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:09,211
So I'm slipping it on and
I notice that she's misspelled

463
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:13,048
Uh-oh.
I spent the entire day

464
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:17,012
with a sweater that said,
" Nonprofit layers

465
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,516
So you're a lawyer ?

466
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:26,562
A nonprofit lawyer ?

467
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:28,897
Probono.

468
00:37:29,023 --> 00:37:32,359
- You don't get paid at all ?
Nobody makes a dime ?

469
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,449
"Any hoo--"

470
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,628
I better go wake my mom.
There you go.

471
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:53,630
Uh, I don't think so.

472
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:56,800
- She's your dog, Jack.
- No, she's not.

473
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,261
You're right.
She's the kids' dog.

474
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:03,056
Maybe we should go wake Josh
and make him walk her.

475
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:15,276
If you take a dump sometime
in this century, then we could

476
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,740
If I can even remember
how to get home.

477
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,117
You remember,
don't you, girl ?

478
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,986

Oh. That baby's crying.

00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,209
And ?

486
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:03,134
Don't give me that look,
Jack. Tuesday's your day

487
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:06,638

Ohh !

494
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,541
You're not really
my dad, are you ?

495
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,714
No, I'm not.

496
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,592
I work on Wall Street,
you know, with

497
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,136
I live in an apartment
with a doorman.

498
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:32,931
And I can buy
almost anything I want.

499
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,726
This isn't my life.
It's just a glimpse.

500
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,062
Where's my real dad ?

501
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:44,026
I don't know.
But don't worry.

502
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:47,822
He loves you, and I'm sure
he'll be back very soon.

503
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:15,765
What are you doing ?

504
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:29,363
They did a pretty good job.

505
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,906
Who did ?

506
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:33,951
The aliens
in the mother ship.

507
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:35,952
You look just like him.

508
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,914
Oh, thanks.

509
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:41,499
Slightly better looking
though, right ?

510
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:47,255
Oh, no, you're not gonna
start crying, are you ?

511
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,508
I don't think I could
really deal with that right now.

512
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,763
Do you like kids ?

513
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,015
On a case by case basis.

514
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:01,852
Do you know how
to make chocolate milk ?

515
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:06,357
I--I think I could
figure it out.

516
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,028
Promise you won't kidnap
me and my brother...

517
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:12,446
and plant stuff
in our brains ?

518
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,198
Sure.

519
00:43:20,872 --> 00:43:23,833
Welcome to Earth.

521
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:37,346
♪ Look at all the crocodiles
swimming in the--♪

522
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,432

Check.

524
00:43:52,528 --> 00:43:54,946
Just push the red button.

525
00:43:58,784 --> 00:44:00,661
Okay.

526
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:15,635
Do I get a receipt
or something ?

527
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:27,605
I have winter camping

00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:30,357
5:30. Okay.
And try not to be late...

529
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:34,863
'cause kids don't like to be

Bye.
Bye.

531
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:44,120
- Hey, Annie.
Where do I go now ?

532
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:48,124
Big Ed's Tires ?
Why ?

533
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:52,045
- 'Cause you work there.
- You mean I sell tires.

534
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,343
That's what I do.
I'm a tire salesman.

535
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:07,602
Good Lord !

536
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:36,839
- Morning, Jack.
- Hi.

537
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:43,638
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

538
00:45:43,763 --> 00:45:45,765
Hey, Jack.

539
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:57,568
Jack, my boy.

540
00:45:57,693 --> 00:46:00,780
Hey, guess who I played
bridge with two nights ago.

541
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:03,199
Hell, you'll never guess.

542
00:46:03,283 --> 00:46:07,704
One Sydney Potter.
That's Sydney Potter,

543
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,874
Only the third biggest
trucking outfit in the state.

544
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:14,502
"Any hoo, " he's looking
for a new parts supplier.

545
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:17,254
We can handle volume
like that, now can't we, Jack ?

546
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:21,301
I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that, Ed.

547
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:22,845
Right on.

548
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:25,804
Right on.

549
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:38,108
Excuse me. Uh, do I--
do I have a private office

550
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,987
Sure, Jack.

551
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:43,989
Where is it ?

552
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:46,534
Oh, uh, it's--

553
00:46:46,618 --> 00:46:48,619
it's right back--
right back there.

554
00:46:48,702 --> 00:46:51,456
Thank you.
Yeah.

555
00:47:29,743 --> 00:47:31,661
Oh, no.

556
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:45,134
You must've needed this
every day.

557
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:14,661
What are you smiling about ?

558
00:48:17,499 --> 00:48:20,209
Eighty-eight ?

559
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:25,215
I was in London in 1988.

560
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:32,641
You never went to London.

561
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,646
Jack, you're needed in mag

562
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:49,698
I was the number one
junior sales associate

563
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:52,325
Did you know that ?
Uh, no.

564
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,328
That's great.

565
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:56,997
That's the kind of thing
you could really build on,

566
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:01,834
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I mean, sales has always been

567
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:03,753
Uh-huh.

568
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,382
Well, look, here we are.
The mag wheels. Mag wheels.

569
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,425
Oh.
So.

570
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,346
Hey, Jack, um,
are you sure you're okay ?

571
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:17,058
Well, I'm just
a little confused right now

572
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:18,435
Uh--

573
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,982
I just started here
last Tuesday, so--

574
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:32,991
The closing tip was

575
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:36,536
Much of the market's action
today was fueled by the latest

576
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:38,454
to hit Wall Street...

577
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,833
when Global Health Systems
and Med Tech Pharmaceutical

578
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:46,547
to join forces in a massive
$122 billion stock swap deal,

579
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,881
the largest ever
in the health care industry.

580
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:51,759
When asked about the possible
anti-competitive implications,

581
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:54,596
Global chairman Bob Thomas
referred reporters...

582
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,975
to P.K. Lassiter & Company
president Alan Mintz,

583
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,146
- That's my deal !
- Ironically, Mintz first met

584
00:50:03,271 --> 00:50:05,815
While coaching their pregnant
wives, Mintz and Thomas...

585
00:50:05,898 --> 00:50:09,068
struck up a dialog,
and two months later,

586
00:50:09,193 --> 00:50:12,156
He wasn't the architect !
I'm the architect !

587
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:17,075
Labor department officials
announced today that 275,000

588
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:18,362
The kids are asleep.

589
00:50:20,288 --> 00:50:22,540
The kids, hon.
Honey.

590
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,587
Sweetheart, I said
the kids are asleep.

591
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:31,757
That's just great.
Those little monkeys

592
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:34,719
Hey, I was watching that.

593
00:50:34,802 --> 00:50:36,322
Not tonight.

594
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,518
Please leave
my socks alone.

595
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:52,238
Wait.

596
00:50:53,403 --> 00:50:57,200
- You want me.
- That is the general idea,

597
00:50:59,076 --> 00:51:02,246
Oh, well, maybe we should
grab a bottle of wine first.

598
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,331
Kind of break the ice.

599
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:07,583
Yeah, that's very funny.
Look, it's 10:30.

600
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:10,421
By 11:00 you're gonna be
snoring like a monster,

601
00:51:10,505 --> 00:51:12,547
but that's very sweet.

602
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:15,091
I'll remember that
for next time.

603
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:18,012
Whatever you say...
honey.

604
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,138

No, I'm serious.

611
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:46,665
You're really stunning.

This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.

You were always
a very pretty girl in college.

00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:56,966
But this--

615
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:01,847

How can you do that ?

617
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,021
What ?

618
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:12,315
Look at me like you
haven't seen me every day

619
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:19,822
Okay, wait. Don't move.
Don't look.

620

Stay right there.

Mary Janes, Mommy.
You promised.

629
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:54,041
That's right.
I did promise.

630
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,711
We're gonna stop
at the kids' shoe

631
00:53:56,836 --> 00:54:00,339
and then I gotta
pick up my watch

632
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,300
Then I'm gonna go
to the linen store.

633
00:54:02,383 --> 00:54:04,553
Why don't we go
to all the stores ?

634
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:07,721
Every single store
in this god forsaken

635
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:09,765
Wouldn't that
be exciting ?

636
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:14,144
You know what ?
Why don't I take the kids,

637
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:18,148
and you just stay here
and hang out

638
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:20,693
Come on, hon.

639
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:40,795
It's perfect
for your frame.

640
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:43,382
Why don't you try it on ?

641
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:51,055
I might want to take
an inch out of the back.

642
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:53,059
Lengthen the sleeve.

643
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:59,064
You look amazing
in that suit.

644
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,527
I mean, really--
wow !

645
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:07,990
Off the charts, great.

646
00:55:08,074 --> 00:55:10,325
It's an unbelievable thing.

647
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,287
Wearing this suit
actually makes me feel

648
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,671
I'm gonna buy it.

649
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:28,425
It's $2, 400.

650
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:31,554
Are you out of your mind ?
Come on, let's go.

651
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,016
She got those shoes.
Those shoes were $25.

652
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:37,310
Come on.
Take it off, all right ?

653
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,272
We'll go to the food court
and get one of those

654
00:55:40,355 --> 00:55:42,482
Daddy's a crazy guy.

655
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:44,527
No.

656
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:48,530
No.

657
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:54,201
Do you have any idea
what my life is like ?

658
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:58,957
- Excuse me ?
- I wake up in the morning

659
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:01,001
I drop the kids off,

660
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:03,794
spend eight hours
selling tires retail.

661
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:05,798
Retail, Kate.

662
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:09,426
I pick the kids up,
walk the dog,

663
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:12,470
which, by the way,
carries the added bonus...

664
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:16,558
of carting away
her monstrous crap.

665
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,852
I play with the kids,
take out the garbage,

666
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:21,896
get six hours of sleep
if I'm lucky.

667
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:23,898
Then everything starts
all over again.

668
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:25,649
So what's in it for me ?

669
00:56:25,774 --> 00:56:28,612
Wh-Where are my Mary Janes ?

670
00:56:31,156 --> 00:56:34,534
You know, it's sad to hear
that your life is such

671
00:56:34,618 --> 00:56:37,829
I can't believe it isn't
a disappointment to you!

672
00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:42,082
Jesus, Kate, I could
have been a thousand times

673
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,835
I could have been
one of the richest--

674
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,467
How could you do this to me ?
How could you let me give up

675
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:54,428
Really, I want to know.

676
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:56,514
Who are you ?

677
00:56:56,598 --> 00:56:59,517
All right, look.
I'm sorry.

678
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,144
I'm sorry I was such

679
00:57:03,227 --> 00:57:05,148
and I'm such a prick now !

680
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:07,483
But maybe I'm just not...

681
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:11,195
the same guy that I was
when we got married.

682
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,447
You know what ?
Maybe you're not.

683
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:18,452
Because the Jack Campbell
I married would not need

684
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,956
to feel better
about his life.

685
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:24,416
But I'm telling you,
if that's what it's

686
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,127
Jesus !
We 'll take the money out

687
00:57:28,253 --> 00:57:31,674
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.

688
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:34,676
It'll be the highlight
of my week.

689
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,735
Listen, I'm really sorry
about that back in the store.

690
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:54,738
I don't want to fight
with you.

691
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:59,492
I just sometimes wonder
how we ended up here,

692
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:03,123
I mean, back in college,
d-did you see us here ?

693
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:06,374
Life has thrown us
a few surprises.

694
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:09,963
It really has, hasn't it ?

695
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:13,716
Yeah. So, if you had to,
what would you say

696
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:17,761
Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.

697
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:22,599
- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.

698
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:24,643
Yeah, that must have been.

699
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:28,814
I mean, that--that was.
That was a very

700
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:33,234
- What are you gonna do ?
- I think it turned out

701
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,404
Yeah.
I really like Annie.

702
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:37,448
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.

703
00:58:37,531 --> 00:58:39,450
No, I love her.
I love Annie.

704
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:41,367
I'm just--

705
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:45,998
We had a lot of good times,
didn't we ?

706
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,420
Do you remember
the place on Charles Street

707
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:53,839
Charles Street ?

708
00:58:55,716 --> 00:58:58,176
In the village ?

709
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,472
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.

710
00:59:00,597 --> 00:59:04,473
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.

711
00:59:04,598 --> 00:59:06,476
Why did we ever leave ?

712
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:09,812
You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.

713
00:59:09,938 --> 00:59:12,857
Then there was the whole trek
out to the hospital.

714
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,697
You were great. I mean,
surviving the heart attack

715
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:22,284
- You had a heart attack ?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.

716
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:26,037
'Cause I am--
I'm still mad at you.

717
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,666
Who knows what would
have happened if you hadn't

718
00:59:30,749 --> 00:59:33,586
That's why I work
for Big Ed.

719
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,424
That's why I work
for Big Ed. Yeah.

720
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:44,348
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.

721
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:47,392
Bought that house,
and I've been working

722
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,271
Sayonara, Wall Street.

723
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:54,356
Our life in a nutshell.

724
00:59:54,439 --> 00:59:57,068
If you want to
look at it that way.

725
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,696
How would you look at it ?

726
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:05,411
A great success story.

727
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,003
What do you say, Jack ?
Show 'em how to do it, baby.

728
01:00:15,628 --> 01:00:19,007
- Damn !
-Jesus, Jack.

729
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:23,135
It's a league match.
Where's your follow through ?

730
01:00:23,218 --> 01:00:26,389
You know what ?
I'm doing the best I can.

731
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:28,724
It's okay, Jack.

732
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,019
Why am I so competitive

733
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:34,397
You can still
pick up that spare.

734
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:38,401
Here we go.
Hurt 'em.

735
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:41,696
You're Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.

736
01:00:41,821 --> 01:00:45,324
You shot the rapids in Kanai.
You ran with the bulls

737
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:48,244
You've jumped out of an airplane
over the Mojave Desert,

738
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:51,205
You can do this.
You can do this.

739
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:02,550
Yes ! Victorious !

740
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:04,028
Ha-ha ? Ah-ha ?

741
01:01:06,511 --> 01:01:08,597
Huh ? All right!

742
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,933
High five !

743
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:14,269
You're up.
Go get 'em.

744
01:01:24,405 --> 01:01:26,531
Hi, Jack.

745
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,745
Evelyn, right ?

746
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,706
I saw you on lane 20.
You got the flu

747
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,875
Something like that,
yeah.

748
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,712
Need a nurse ?

749
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,713
Are you a nurse ?

750
01:01:41,797 --> 01:01:43,966
If that's what you want.

751
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,886
Hey, wait a minute.

752
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,305
Um, don't run away.

753
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:54,310
Are we--

754
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,478
Are we what, Jack ?

755
01:01:56,603 --> 01:01:58,479
Well--

756
01:01:58,562 --> 01:02:01,568
Is there something
going on between us ?

757
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,575
Are we finally
being honest ?

758
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,744
It would help me
if we were.

759
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,912
Okay. You're right.

760
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:19,166
We've been dancing
around this for years.

761
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,920
Here goes.

762
01:02:22,045 --> 01:02:25,716
When I get dressed
for a party, and I know

763
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:30,345
let's just say
I don't go strapless

764
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:34,099
I've got six sets
of snow tires piled up

765
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:37,769
and I won't even drive
in the snow.

766
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,437
And our kids
just happen to be...

767
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:43,942
in the same ballet class
every year.

768
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:48,696
So, if you're asking
whether I'd like it

769
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:51,658
the answer's yes.

770
01:02:51,742 --> 01:02:53,660
Kate would never
have to know.

771
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:00,000
Do I have your number ?

772
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,379
Steve's out of town
with the kids this weekend.

773
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:07,925
Why don't you
just stop by ?

774
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:23,689
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.

775
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:26,360
I feel good.
Guess that 71 took

776
01:03:26,443 --> 01:03:30,529
No. I just saw
Evelyn Thompson.

777
01:03:30,695 --> 01:03:32,573
She's relentless.

778
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:34,952
She wants to have
an affair with me.

779
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:39,705
- She said that ?
- Pretty much.

780
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,751
What is it about you ?

781
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:49,341
So... if you would write
her exact address down there.

782
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:52,717
You have a pen ? Please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,305
You're not actually thinking
about cheating on Kate ?

784
01:03:56,473 --> 01:03:59,683
Well, it wouldn't really
be cheating, Arnie.

785
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,980
It's complicated.

786
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:07,692
Maybe I haven't been as good
a consigliere as you've been

787
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:10,319
A little flirtation
is harmless,

788
01:04:10,444 --> 01:04:12,948
but you're dealing
with fire here, man.

789
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:16,116
The Fidelity Bank and Trust
is a tough creditor.

790
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:19,536
You make a deposit
somewhere else, they

791
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:21,956
forever, all right ?

792
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,041
Arnie, I don't want
your head to explode,

793
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,751
but I'm telling you,
those rules don't apply to me.

794
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:28,837
I-I'm not even--

795
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,216
I'm not talking about rules.
I'm talking about--

796
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:34,302
Y-You're--

797
01:04:34,385 --> 01:04:37,931
There isn't a guy
in Union County who wouldn't

798
01:04:38,098 --> 01:04:40,266
to be with Kate,
all right ?

799
01:04:40,432 --> 01:04:43,768
She's amazing, and you're
gonna fuck it up.

800
01:04:43,852 --> 01:04:46,981
Just think about that,
all right ?

801
01:05:00,953 --> 01:05:03,663
Hey, honey.
How was the game ?

802
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:06,333
Long and boring
and generally pretty sad.

803
01:05:07,459 --> 01:05:09,961
Arnie seemed to enjoy it.

804
01:05:10,086 --> 01:05:12,464
Sort of.

805
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:15,009
Hey, where's
that chocolate cake ?

806
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:20,890
- Do you mean
this chocolate cake ?

807
01:05:21,015 --> 01:05:25,144
I was saving it because I
got nauseated by that precooked

808
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:29,189
Mmm. Mmm.
It's good.

809
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:31,524
Give me that cake.

810
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:33,776
No way.

811
01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:37,490
Come on.
I'm sorry.

812
01:05:37,615 --> 01:05:39,491
It's too important to me.

You know what I
like to hear.

01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:43,013
I know, baby.
I know what you

826

Tell me.
Tell me, tell me.

827
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:50,187
You're a bad girl, baby.
You make me so hot.

Not it ?

830
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:58,778
Nice, Jack.

831
01:07:00,447 --> 01:07:03,158
What ?
Sweeping me off my feet.

832
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,119
You make me hot.

833
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:52,330
What do you say, everyone ?

834
01:07:52,413 --> 01:07:54,708
This is a little birthday
party for Katie.

835
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,419
Good to see you kids
still together.

836

Very exciting.

Jack ? The man.
Yes. Yes.

839
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:07,972
Do you have anything
to say to your lovely wife

840
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:11,308
You happy she was born ?
Hey, hey !

841
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:14,271
That's funny, Jack.
You know what ?

842
01:08:14,354 --> 01:08:17,772
Wow, your birthday.
It's--You're my wife.

sweetheart.

Yeah.

876
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:22,354
Yeah, Jack !

877
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:25,275
There's love in the air.

878
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:28,653
He loves her.
It's official.

879
01:10:57,724 --> 01:11:00,602
Mmm. Come on,
it's time to get up, honey.

880
01:11:00,685 --> 01:11:02,854
Go, go.

881
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:39,890
Good morning, Joshie.

882
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:47,774
Happy anniversary, honey.

883
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:51,778
Now, listen, before you
do whatever crazy stunt

884
01:11:51,903 --> 01:11:54,445
I want you
to open mine first.

885
01:11:56,114 --> 01:11:57,950
Maybe I should wait.

886
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:01,495
No ! Come on !
Come on, come on, come on.

887
01:12:11,128 --> 01:12:13,174
Zeena ?

888
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:18,970
I found it
at an outlet store.

889
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:23,225
Look, I know it's a knock off,
but I think it's gonna

890
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:27,604
You--

891
01:12:27,688 --> 01:12:30,107
Ah, enjoy it, sweetheart.

892
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:36,989
Uh--

893
01:12:37,114 --> 01:12:40,992
Yeah, uh--You're probably
expecting something from me.

894
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:43,412
Um, here's the thing.

895
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:49,334
I hadn't really planned
on giving you your

896
01:12:49,418 --> 01:12:51,419
until tonight.

897
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:53,546
You know, anniversary's
good all day.

898
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:56,717
What are you talking about ?
You can never wait all day.

899
01:12:56,842 --> 01:12:59,636
You can't even wait
till it's light out.

900
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:03,307
I know. I know.
That's me. It's true.

901
01:13:03,473 --> 01:13:06,809
And--But, um,

902
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:08,810
it's funny.

903
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:19,406
You forgot.

904
01:13:19,573 --> 01:13:22,950
You actually forgot
our anniversary.

905
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:27,123
I'll fix it.
I'll go out right now

906
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,206
I'll make it right.

907
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:47,184
Let me know if
there's enough chocolate

908
01:13:52,356 --> 01:13:54,732
Mm, not bad.
Good.

909
01:13:54,815 --> 01:13:56,733
I should have warned you.

910
01:13:56,816 --> 01:14:00,780
Dad always does
something really special

911
01:14:00,905 --> 01:14:04,533
Like what ?
One year he had a star

912
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,996
He had a star
named after her ?

913
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,625
Well, that's nice,
but isn't that

914
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,461
Mom liked it.

915
01:14:15,628 --> 01:14:19,548
Maybe there's a jewelry store
at the mall. I can pick her up

916
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:22,425
That's good, but...

917
01:14:22,509 --> 01:14:24,763
you did forget
the anniversary.

918
01:14:24,846 --> 01:14:28,098
That's right.
That is a major oversight.

919
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,687
So, if I'm Kate,
I can't afford

920
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:37,525
My husband's career
is definitely a crushing

921
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,444
I'm trapped in suburbia.

922
01:14:43,029 --> 01:14:45,533
Did he ever take her
to the city ?

923
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:48,243
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

924
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:56,585
Jack, can we afford

925
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,799
I'm taking my baby out
for our anniversary.

926
01:15:06,637 --> 01:15:10,931
We'll have the Terrine
of Quail Breast with

927
01:15:11,056 --> 01:15:15,187
Then the Veal Medallions
in Raspberry Truffle Sauce.

928
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:18,607
And the Sea Scallops
with Pureed Artichoke Hearts.

929
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:22,571
Very good, sir.
And may I say, those are all

930
01:15:22,654 --> 01:15:26,531
You may. Also, we'll have
a bottle of Lafite, '82.

931
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:30,702
Honey, that's an $800
bottle of wine.

932
01:15:32,746 --> 01:15:36,625
We'll just have some red wine
by the glass.

933
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:44,591
You are so not
off the hook yet, Slick.

934
01:15:44,674 --> 01:15:46,594
But I'm getting close,
right ?

935
01:15:48,888 --> 01:15:50,640
You wanna dance ?

936
01:15:53,057 --> 01:15:55,685
I-I don't think
there's dancing here, Jack.

937
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,270
Sure, there is.
Come on.

938
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:36,477
Not bad for a tire salesman
from New Jersey.

939
01:16:36,602 --> 01:16:38,520
I have my moments.

940
01:16:43,774 --> 01:16:46,486
You gotta try
one of these.

941
01:16:52,032 --> 01:16:54,828
Ahh.

942
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,747
God, I miss that taste.

943
01:17:01,626 --> 01:17:04,421
I need to tell you
something.

944
01:17:04,504 --> 01:17:05,489
Okay.

945
01:17:07,213 --> 01:17:09,718
I think it may help us,

946
01:17:09,843 --> 01:17:12,595
but there's a slight chance
it could make things worse.

947
01:17:17,851 --> 01:17:20,769
I'm living
someone else's--

948
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:29,278
I feel like I'm living
someone else's life.

949
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:35,451
I remember I used to
walk to work, and, uh,

950
01:17:35,576 --> 01:17:38,787
I had a warm bialy
in my hand,

951
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:42,791
and a hot cup of coffee
from Dean & Deluca,

952
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:47,463
the crisp feeling
of The Wall Street Journal,

953
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,257
the smell of leather
from my briefcase.

954
01:17:50,341 --> 01:17:53,761
I used to be so sure
about everything,

955
01:17:53,844 --> 01:17:57,555
You know, I-I knew
exactly who I was...

956
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,767
and what I wanted.

957
01:18:01,685 --> 01:18:04,103
And then one morning,
I woke up...

958
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,568
and suddenly
it was all different.

959
01:18:09,693 --> 01:18:12,863
Worse, do you mean ?
No.

960
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,450
Well, maybe a few things,

961
01:18:15,575 --> 01:18:18,451
but mostly just different.

962
01:18:18,576 --> 01:18:20,787
And it's okay.

963
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,791
But I never used to
be like this, Kate.

964
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:27,127
I was the guy
who had it all figured out.

965
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:30,338
I had no doubts.
I had no regrets.

966
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:33,259
And now ?

967
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:35,261
Now I don't.

968
01:18:35,386 --> 01:18:37,638
I don't have it
all figured out.

969
01:18:37,721 --> 01:18:39,473
Me neither.

970
01:18:39,556 --> 01:18:41,766
But you always seem
so certain.

971
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,436
Do you think
there aren't mornings

972
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:47,105
and wonder, "What the hell
am I doing in New Jersey ?"

973
01:18:47,187 --> 01:18:48,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

974
01:18:49,108 --> 01:18:52,652
Yeah.
My office is a dump.

975
01:18:52,777 --> 01:18:55,947
I answer my own phone,
and you seen my paycheck.

976
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:59,410
Your paycheck is a disgrace
to paychecks.

977
01:19:00,661 --> 01:19:03,204
Can you imagine a life...

978
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:05,791
where everything
was just easy ?

979
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:10,295
You know, where you ask
for things, and people

980
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,088
It's wonderful.

981
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,099
I think about it too.

982
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,517
I do.

983
01:19:24,643 --> 01:19:28,563
I wonder about what kind
of life I would have had

984
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,274
And ?

985
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:36,571
Then I realize I've just erased
all the things in my life

986
01:19:36,696 --> 01:19:39,282
You and the kids.

987
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:41,285
Good things.

988
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:43,119
Yeah.

989
01:19:45,495 --> 01:19:47,499
What are you sure about ?

990
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,003
I'm sure that right now,

991
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,837
there's nowhere else
I'd rather be

992
01:20:07,894 --> 01:20:09,979
Oh.

993
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:11,981
Oh, Jack.

994
01:20:17,278 --> 01:20:19,489
You like it ?
Ohh.

995
01:20:28,296 --> 01:20:29,791
This is beautiful.

996
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,880
You know champagne
makes me do crazy things.

997
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:39,093
I'll just fill yours
up to the top.

998
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:46,099
I don't know
how you did it, Hoss,

999
01:20:46,224 --> 01:20:49,185
I'm out
of the doghouse ?

1000
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:54,148
Happy anniversary,
sweetheart.

1001
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:00,864
You may even get lucky
tonight, Jack.

1002
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:11,332
You're so beautiful.

1003
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,334
I already told you
you were gonna get lucky.

1004
01:21:17,338 --> 01:21:19,923
My God.

1005
01:21:20,048 --> 01:21:22,260
All this time,

1006
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:25,346
I never stopped
loving you.

1007
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,520
That's all I wanted

1008
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:07,804
I'm gonna wear
the usual today.

1009
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:09,806
What are you thinking ?

1010
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:13,853
You want to come
to work with Dad,

1011
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,563
It's fun.
I'm pretty good at it.

1012
01:22:16,688 --> 01:22:20,317
Who's this ? Who's that ?
Who is that ?

1013
01:22:20,442 --> 01:22:22,902
Who's on that tie ?

1014
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:24,655
That's Grandpa.

1015
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,490
Yes.

1016
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,702
Jack !

1017
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,209
Mmm.

1018
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:43,965
Have a great day.

1019
01:22:49,596 --> 01:22:52,974
For the money,
this is hands down

1020
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:55,518
Okay.
I guess I'll take 'em.

1021
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:57,563
You won't regret it.
Tommy.

1022
01:22:57,646 --> 01:23:01,023
Would you set Mr. Collin up
with four B.F. Goodrich

1023
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:06,070
Give him ten percent off
for having the best costume.

1024
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,489
You bet.
Right this way, sir.

1025
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:10,491
Tell me, does the tire
smell good ?

1026
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,746
Remember our

1027
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:18,542
balance and alignment
for free !

1028
01:23:23,797 --> 01:23:27,509
How are you doing today ?
It just blew out on me.

1029
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:30,011
Do you have a tire
like that ?

1030
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:34,473
I seem to have
some sort of a blowout here.

1031
01:23:34,599 --> 01:23:37,351
- Why don't you let me
take this one, Kenny ?

1032
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:40,147
Peter Lassiter.

1033
01:23:40,272 --> 01:23:42,315
Do I know you ?
Not exactly.

1034
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,069
I've seen you on CN BC.
You look taller

1035
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:51,324
Truth is, Mintz was so busy
timing his wife's breathing,

1036
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:55,244
he didn't realize that
Med Tech needed Global more

1037
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:58,079
Ten days, two weeks tops,
they would have approached

1038
01:23:58,204 --> 01:24:02,710
I'm willing to bet anything
it would have been

1039
01:24:02,835 --> 01:24:06,130
The trouble is, Peter,
you had a pussycat

1040
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:08,591
What you needed
was a Doberman.

1041
01:24:10,886 --> 01:24:13,721
I'm impressed.
I really am.

1042
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:17,099
Now, about my car.

1043
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:22,146
Sure. We're gonna have to
special order that tire,

1044
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:24,814
so it'll be ready
in a couple of days.

1045
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:30,238
All right.
This is my office address.

1046
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:37,162
Why don't you drop off
the car yourself ?

1047
01:25:07,273 --> 01:25:10,527
We're really more
of a boutique operation,

1048
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:14,073
But you're not interested
in boutique dollars.

1049
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,659
He's expecting you,
Mr. Lassiter.

1050
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:20,663
Alan,
this is Jack Campbell,

1051
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:22,956
the one I was
telling you about.

1052
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,751
Of course.
Jack. Hi.

1053
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:30,297
No, just call me Alan.
We like to cultivate a very

1054
01:25:31,797 --> 01:25:34,802
I can see that.
What can I tell you ?

1055
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:39,013
Uh, actually, yes.
Two of them. Good ones.

1056
01:25:39,096 --> 01:25:42,018
Great, great.
Why don't you have a seat ?

1057
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:46,187
Peter mentioned to me
that you're an avid

1058
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:51,193
But he didn't say
whether you had any actual

1059
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:56,823
Um, I was a sales associate
at E.F. Hutton.

1060
01:25:56,948 --> 01:25:59,242
A broker, really ?

1061
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:01,828
And now you're in
the tire business ?

1062
01:26:01,953 --> 01:26:04,080
That's right.
And auto supply.

1063
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:06,292
In the retail end,
I understand.

1064
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:09,586
We get about 60 percent
of our business

1065
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:14,175
And do you mind me asking
what kind of sales you did

1066
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,221
Just ball park.
We did 1.7 million

1067
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:20,429
1.7. That's great.

1068
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:22,724
And what do you project
for this year ?

1069
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:25,018
I think we're gonna have
a banner year.

1070
01:26:25,143 --> 01:26:27,687
Sales are up
almost 20 percent

1071
01:26:27,812 --> 01:26:30,147
and we just landed
a major trucking company

1072
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:33,611
You did ? That's great.
So that puts you just a tad

1073
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:37,321
That's right.
And that would make us

1074
01:26:37,446 --> 01:26:39,700
Excuse me. I'm gonna get
a glass of water.

1075
01:26:50,293 --> 01:26:54,839
Look, I know our paltry
little $2 million in sales...

1076
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:57,842
is about what you spend a year
on office supplies.

1077
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,845
And some regional
trucking company account

1078
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:03,975
to a multi-billion-dollar
merger.

1079
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:07,226
- I'm not trying to knock
the tire business.

1080
01:27:07,309 --> 01:27:10,813
I'm in your shoes,
I'm thinking the same thing,

1081
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:13,774
Business is business.
Wall Street, Main Street.

1082
01:27:13,857 --> 01:27:16,319
It's all a bunch of people
getting up in the morning,

1083
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:19,071
trying to figure out
how they're going to send

1084
01:27:19,196 --> 01:27:22,826
It's just people,
and I know people.

1085
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:25,829
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Take you, for instance, Alan.

1086
01:27:25,912 --> 01:27:28,873
You have
a certain energy about you,

1087
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:31,834
I wouldn't be surprised
if you drank about 16

1088
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:37,007
You're an excellent father,
but you feel guilty about the

1089
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,717
You drink bourbon, but you
offer your clients Scotch.

1090
01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:43,554
And your wife
decorated this office.

1091
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:46,182
He certainly seems
to have your number.

1092
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,226
You're a little tougher,
Peter.

1093
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,477
For one thing,
you like expensive things.

1094
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:53,940
That's easy.
You've seen my car.

1095
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:57,526
You smoke
Hoyo de Monterreys.

1096
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,737
You're a Scotch man,
single malt,

1097
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:03,157
not because it's trendy
but because you've been

1098
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,826
and you like to stay
with what works.

1099
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:09,163
You have two
great loves in your life:

1100
01:28:09,288 --> 01:28:11,415
and this company.

1101
01:28:11,582 --> 01:28:16,128
And you're a man who prides
himself in finding talent

1102
01:28:17,754 --> 01:28:20,799
- How would you know that ?
- Because I'm here.

1103
01:28:20,925 --> 01:28:23,594
I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes

1104
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:25,553
I'll start wherever
I have to start.

1105
01:28:25,637 --> 01:28:27,556
I'll park cars
if I have to.

1106
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,185
The biggest part of judging
character is knowing yourself,

1107
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:34,856
I can do this job.
I can.

1108
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:38,234
Give me a chance, Peter.
I won't let you down.

1109
01:28:43,905 --> 01:28:47,408
Alan, why don't you
show Jack around ?

1110
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:51,080
This is our war room.
We did seven major deals

1111
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:53,414
three of them... hostile.

1112
01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:56,252
Seven ?
Yeah. You get a kind

1113
01:28:56,418 --> 01:28:59,296
Can we cut the shit here
for a minute ? Where did you

1114
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:02,091
Did you go through his wallet ?
Did you surf some Net ?

1115
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:05,052
It doesn't really matter
because that circus act

1116
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:07,596
may have dazzled Lassiter,
but it doesn't cut any shit

1117
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,014
Even if you get this job,
which I highly doubt,

1118
01:29:10,098 --> 01:29:12,017
let me just give you
a word of warning.

1119
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:15,477
Peter Lassiter gets tired
of his pet projects

1120
01:29:15,602 --> 01:29:19,525
I've got that big office
because I prove myself to him

1121
01:29:19,608 --> 01:29:22,111
Nobody is gonna come in here
and turn the old man's head,

1122
01:29:22,278 --> 01:29:25,155
especially not
some tire salesman

1123
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,783
So if you're cautious
and you're quiet,

1124
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,326
you watch yourself,
stay away from Lassiter,

1125
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:33,581
maybe I'll think about
keeping you on here

1126
01:29:33,706 --> 01:29:35,582
Do we understand
each other ?

1127
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:39,460
Alan !

1128
01:29:39,586 --> 01:29:41,463
God, you really
are different.

1129
01:29:41,588 --> 01:29:44,215
Excuse me ?
I mean, wow !

1130
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,095
I'm impressed.
I'm impressed.

1131
01:29:50,389 --> 01:29:52,473
Are we understanding
each other ?

1132
01:29:52,557 --> 01:29:54,518
Yes, Alan,
I understand you.

1133
01:29:54,602 --> 01:29:57,312
Okay then.
Good.

1134
01:29:57,478 --> 01:30:00,690
Good.
Okay. Okay.

1135
01:30:00,815 --> 01:30:02,692
Alan !

1136
01:30:10,326 --> 01:30:13,285
Keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.

1137
01:30:16,999 --> 01:30:19,375
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

1138
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:21,376
Welcome to Xanadu.

1139
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:27,175
It's pretty incredible,
isn't it ?

1140
01:30:27,257 --> 01:30:30,137
It's like a museum.
Uh-huh.

1141
01:30:34,556 --> 01:30:36,476
Look around.

1142
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:46,319
So what's
the big surprise ?

1143
01:30:46,444 --> 01:30:48,946
You didn't rent this
for the weekend, did you ?

1144
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:51,991
Think... bigger.

1145
01:30:52,075 --> 01:30:54,159
For the week ?

1146
01:30:54,284 --> 01:30:57,038
This place is a perk,
Kate.

1147
01:30:58,957 --> 01:31:01,876
A perk ?
Mm-hmm.

1148
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:03,795
For what ?

1149
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,840
A company called P.K. Lassiter
Investment House...

1150
01:31:06,924 --> 01:31:10,175
uses it to attract
new executives.

1151
01:31:10,259 --> 01:31:12,512
I'm going into arbitrage,
honey.

1152
01:31:12,637 --> 01:31:15,014
It turns out
I have a knack for it.

1153
01:31:17,266 --> 01:31:19,142
Jack, what are you
talking about ?

1154
01:31:19,268 --> 01:31:22,981
I'll be making
twice what I make now,

1155
01:31:23,064 --> 01:31:25,816
That's just to start.
And we can live

1156
01:31:25,899 --> 01:31:27,693
practically rent free...

1157
01:31:27,776 --> 01:31:30,154
until we find
a place of our own.

1158
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,323
Are you out of your mind ?

1159
01:31:33,448 --> 01:31:35,367
I don't think so.

1160
01:31:35,492 --> 01:31:38,496
This is gonna be a better life
for all of us. We can put Annie

1161
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:40,706
Annie goes to
a great school, Jack.

1162
01:31:40,872 --> 01:31:43,458
I'm talking
about the best schools

1163
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:47,421
What could you possibly
be thinking about ?

1164
01:31:47,504 --> 01:31:50,842
Well, this is New York City.
It's like the needy people

1165
01:31:50,925 --> 01:31:55,178
Your Jersey clients aren't
a tenth as pathetic as the

1166
01:31:55,262 --> 01:31:58,931
I can't even believe
you're talking about

1167
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:02,686
I thought the reason we left
was because we didn't want to

1168
01:32:02,811 --> 01:32:06,064
No. No.
This is the center

1169
01:32:06,148 --> 01:32:08,900
If I were living in Roman times,
I would live in Rome.

1170
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:11,779
"Today America
is the Roman empire.

1171
01:32:11,946 --> 01:32:13,822
John Lennon.
Jack !

1172
01:32:13,947 --> 01:32:17,326
Okay, you know something ?
I'm detecting, like,

1173
01:32:17,451 --> 01:32:21,371
This was supposed to be
a happy day, so guess what ?

1174
01:32:21,455 --> 01:32:23,998
We don't have to live here.
Forget it.

1175
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:26,961
- I'll commute.
I'll drive to work.

1176
01:32:27,045 --> 01:32:31,298
In traffic,
it's over an hour each way.

1177
01:32:31,381 --> 01:32:35,427
- When are you ever
going to see the kids ?

1178
01:32:35,552 --> 01:32:37,638
You're not understanding me.

1179
01:32:37,763 --> 01:32:41,683
I'm talking about
a perfect life,

1180
01:32:41,767 --> 01:32:44,269
Everything we pictured
when we were young.

1181
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:47,356
You said so yourself.
Life has thrown us

1182
01:32:47,481 --> 01:32:49,398
We made sacrifices.
Well, guess what ?

1183
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:52,819
Now I can finally
get us back on track.

1184
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:57,073
I want to do that.
I need to do that as a man !

1185
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,243
For all of us.

1186
01:33:01,328 --> 01:33:04,581
Please just think about this
for one second.

1187
01:33:04,706 --> 01:33:07,500
No more lousy restaurants.

1188
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:09,753
No more clipping coupons.

1189
01:33:09,836 --> 01:33:11,754
No more shoveling snow.

1190
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,006
Then get a goddamn
snowblower, Jack !

1191
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:18,135
Don't go get a new career
without even telling me

1192
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,139
And don't--don't take Annie
out of a school she loves.

1193
01:33:22,265 --> 01:33:26,812
Don't move us out of a house
we've become a family in.

1194
01:33:29,565 --> 01:33:32,109
You're--You're--

1195
01:33:32,192 --> 01:33:36,153
Don't you see ?
I'm talking about us

1196
01:33:36,237 --> 01:33:38,155
that other people envy.

1197
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,158
Oh, Jack.

1198
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:44,453
They already do envy us.

1199
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,974
From London to New York.

1200
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,479
I came back.

1201
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:02,698
When you got on that plane,
I was sure it was over.

1202
01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:09,788
I left the airport afraid
I'd never see you again.

1203
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,792
And then you showed up
the very next day.

1204
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:18,463
That was a good surprise.

1205
01:35:21,968 --> 01:35:25,972
You know, I think about
the decision you made.

1206
01:35:31,519 --> 01:35:34,312
Maybe I was being naive,
but I believed...

1207
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,900
that we would grow old together
in this house,

1208
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:43,196
that we'd spend holidays
here and...

1209
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:49,328
have our grandchildren
come visit us here.

1210
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:55,084
I had this image of us
all gray and wrinkly,

1211
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,378
and me...
working in the garden,

1212
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:02,340
and you repainting
the deck.

1213
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:16,646
But things change.

1214
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,277
If you need this, Jack,

1215
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:25,531
if you really need this,

1216
01:36:25,656 --> 01:36:28,115
I will take these kids
from a life they love,

1217
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:31,286
and I'll take myself
from the only home we've

1218
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:35,291
and I'll move wherever
you need to go.

1219
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:37,834
I'll do that
because I love you.

1220
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,506
I love you,

1221
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,509
and that's more important to me
than our address.

1222
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:51,556
I choose us.

1223
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,931
Oh. I'm gonna chase you.

1224
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:36,225
You can't catch me.
No, you can't. You can't.

1225
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,442
Whoa ! Oh. Whoops !

1226
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:45,986
I fell down.

1227
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:53,618
I knew you'd come back.

1228
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,958
Oh, Annie.

1229
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,959
I love you.

1230
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:29,320
What are you doing ?
Ringing my bell.

1231
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:42,751
4.99 ?
It's just salt,

1232
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,959
Ninety-nine cents, darling.

1233
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:48,547
Out often.

1234
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:52,218
- You.
-Jack !

1235
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,553
What's up ?
How you feeling, baby ?

1236
01:38:54,678 --> 01:38:57,973
Why are you here ?

1237
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:03,855
Here's your change, darling.
Five, six, seven, eight,

1238
01:39:03,939 --> 01:39:06,357
nine, oh-one.

1239
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,025
Is that rock salt ?

1240
01:39:09,108 --> 01:39:12,821
Look at you, man.
Went and got all domestic

1241
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,031
You really figured
some things out, huh ?

1242
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:17,367
You're not
sending me back.

1243
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:22,205
- Everything okay ?
- Yeah.

1244
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:24,333
Hey, did you hear me ?

1245
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,253
Wait a second.
I'm talking to you.

1246
01:39:28,278 --> 01:39:29,630
You see that ?

1247
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:33,382
Character.
And for what, for nine bucks ?

1248
01:39:33,465 --> 01:39:36,094
I'm not going back.
You understand me ?

1249
01:39:36,177 --> 01:39:38,221
Okay, relax, Jack.
You can't do this.

1250
01:39:38,304 --> 01:39:41,182
You can't keep coming in
and out of people's lives,

1251
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:43,183
It's not right.

1252
01:39:43,267 --> 01:39:47,314
A glimpse, by definition,
is an impermanent thing, Jack.

1253
01:39:59,241 --> 01:40:02,204
I've got kids.
I'm going home.

1254
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,723
Is it morning yet ?

1255
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,850
No, honey.

1256
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,852
Go back to sleep.

1257
01:41:13,774 --> 01:41:15,693
Take care, Annie.

1258
01:41:18,111 --> 01:41:20,823
I'm going back to
the mother ship.

1259
01:41:28,706 --> 01:41:30,625
Hey.

1260
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:32,626
Hey.

1261
01:41:38,382 --> 01:41:42,762
These past few weeks,
I know I've done some--

1262
01:41:42,887 --> 01:41:45,264
some unusual things.

1263
01:41:46,932 --> 01:41:49,227
It's been interesting,
that's for sure.

1264
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:54,356
I've done some good things,
too, though, haven't I ?

1265
01:41:56,109 --> 01:41:59,778
You've been Jack Campbell,
and that's always a good thing.

1266
01:42:05,325 --> 01:42:08,870
I need you
to remember me, Kate.

1267
01:42:08,996 --> 01:42:11,248
How I am right now...

1268
01:42:11,415 --> 01:42:14,085
at this very moment.

1269
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:18,298
I need you to put
that image in your heart

1270
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:21,508
Keep it with you
no matter what happens.

1271
01:42:23,427 --> 01:42:27,430
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1272
01:42:27,513 --> 01:42:29,933
Please just promise me.

1273
01:42:30,058 --> 01:42:33,479
You have to promise me,
because if you don't, then

1274
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:35,689
and I don't think
I can live with that.

1275
01:42:37,065 --> 01:42:38,943
I promise.

1276
01:42:41,862 --> 01:42:43,780
Promise me again.

1277
01:42:47,659 --> 01:42:49,578
I promise.
Okay.

1278
01:42:49,703 --> 01:42:51,579
Now come to bed.

1279
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:56,585
Soon.

1280
01:44:50,782 --> 01:44:52,700
Yeah.

1281
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:57,331
What time is it ?

1282
01:44:57,456 --> 01:45:00,082
Okay. Yeah.

1283
01:45:29,861 --> 01:45:33,032
Waiting for me
by the door, huh ?

1284
01:45:33,157 --> 01:45:35,617
Wow.

1285
01:45:35,742 --> 01:45:38,078
Merry Christmas.

1286
01:45:38,161 --> 01:45:41,123
Christmas ?
It's not Christmas.

1287
01:45:41,207 --> 01:45:43,709
It's whatever you
want it to be, Jack.

1288
01:45:43,793 --> 01:45:45,877
It's not Christmas.

1289
01:45:46,002 --> 01:45:48,590
Jack. Jack ?

1290
01:46:34,217 --> 01:46:36,762
Can I help you ?

1291
01:46:36,929 --> 01:46:39,431
Is Kate here ?

1292
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:41,558
Does Kate live here ?
Kate ? No.

1293
01:46:41,641 --> 01:46:44,144
There's nobody
named Kate here.

1294
01:46:46,271 --> 01:46:48,148
Of course not.

1295
01:46:49,607 --> 01:46:51,650
You okay ?

1296
01:46:53,404 --> 01:46:55,280
No.

1297
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:11,086
Hello.

1298
01:47:11,212 --> 01:47:14,174
Santa Claus, where are you ?
Everybody's here.

1299
01:47:14,299 --> 01:47:17,760
- Adelle ?
- You're a half an hour late.

1300
01:47:17,927 --> 01:47:20,347
The emergency strategy session,
trip to Aspen ?

1301
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:22,349
Is this ringing
any bells ?

1302
01:47:22,432 --> 01:47:25,476
Everybody is panicked
here, Jack.

1303
01:47:27,562 --> 01:47:30,065
Jack ?

1304
01:47:30,148 --> 01:47:32,733
I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

1305
01:47:32,858 --> 01:47:37,112
No, I'm not gonna go talk
to them until I have something

1306
01:47:37,196 --> 01:47:40,449
Steve, I don't care
if it's Christmas day.

1307
01:47:40,616 --> 01:47:43,161
Wait a minute.
Jack just walked in.

1308
01:47:43,328 --> 01:47:45,747
Thank God that you're--

1309
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:48,791
- You're here.
Are you all right ?

1310
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:52,045
What's--
Well, it's not good.

1311
01:47:52,128 --> 01:47:56,091
Bob Thomas has been talking to
a European drug company, Jack,

1312
01:47:56,216 --> 01:48:00,762
They're gonna let Bob buy
a minority stake, and let him

1313
01:48:00,887 --> 01:48:04,807
Global knows. I don't know
how they know, but they know

1314
01:48:04,974 --> 01:48:08,394
They think that somehow
we should have been prepared

1315
01:48:08,477 --> 01:48:11,064
Oh, God, we're in trouble.

1316
01:48:11,147 --> 01:48:14,400
You know something, Alan ?

1317
01:48:14,483 --> 01:48:18,947
Somewhere inside of you,
there's a much more

1318
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:22,865
Is this another one of those
Sun Tzu Art of War tricks ?

1319
01:48:24,285 --> 01:48:26,161
No.

1320
01:48:26,328 --> 01:48:28,372
So what are we
gonna do, Jack ?

1321
01:48:29,498 --> 01:48:31,332
Jack ?

1322
01:48:33,211 --> 01:48:36,255
I'll tell you exactly
what we're going to do.

1323
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:39,133
You're going to do
whatever you have to do

1324
01:48:39,258 --> 01:48:42,136
which European company
he's been talking to.

1325
01:48:42,261 --> 01:48:45,222
Then I'm going to
clean myself up,

1326
01:48:45,306 --> 01:48:49,977
fly to Aspen
and drink eggnog

1327
01:48:50,102 --> 01:48:54,023
His wife and kids will be
playing in the background

1328
01:48:54,148 --> 01:48:57,026
while I convince him
that the European company...

1329
01:48:57,151 --> 01:48:59,069
is the devil...

1330
01:48:59,194 --> 01:49:02,740
and Global is the answer
to his prayers.

1331
01:49:02,865 --> 01:49:06,493
Then I'm gonna spend
four hours skiing... alone.

1332
01:49:07,786 --> 01:49:12,332
Completely
and utterly alone.

1333
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:17,671
I'm going to do that
because that is my life,

1334
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:19,715
that's what's real...

1335
01:49:19,798 --> 01:49:22,509
and there's nothing
I can do to change that.

1336
01:49:40,401 --> 01:49:42,403
For Manhattan.

1337
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,447
Kate Reynolds.

1338
01:49:49,285 --> 01:49:51,204
I need an address too.

1339
01:50:16,145 --> 01:50:18,982
It's very fragile,
so I want you to be

1340
01:50:19,065 --> 01:50:21,485
It's valuable.
It's over 300 years old.

1341
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,153
You'll probably need
a few guys to carry it.

1342
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:28,199
The painting is also very,
very old, so take extra care.

1343
01:50:28,283 --> 01:50:31,202
It means a lot to Kate, okay ?
I appreciate it.

1344
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:34,622
Yeah ? What ?

1345
01:50:34,747 --> 01:50:37,709
Are you from
the moving company ?

1346
01:50:37,834 --> 01:50:40,253
I'm an old... friend
of Kate's.

1347
01:50:41,629 --> 01:50:43,548
Kate, some guy is here.

1348
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:47,968
Did you call the airline
like I asked you to do ?

1349
01:50:48,051 --> 01:50:50,805
Jack.
Kate.

1350
01:50:50,972 --> 01:50:53,433
God, it's been a long time.
You look--

1351
01:50:53,516 --> 01:50:56,311
You look great.
Thanks.

1352
01:50:57,937 --> 01:51:00,733
I--Come on in.
Come on in.

1353
01:51:00,816 --> 01:51:04,235
I'm just doing some--
Lori, do you know

1354
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:08,031
I'm sorry.

1355
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,490
No, no, no !
You know what--

1356
01:51:10,617 --> 01:51:12,869
Don't--Please.
I don't even care.

1357
01:51:12,952 --> 01:51:15,495
Oh, great. Thank you.

1358
01:51:16,788 --> 01:51:19,792
- What's going on ?
- I'm moving to Paris.

1359
01:51:19,876 --> 01:51:23,170
Hey, Lori,
have you seen that box ?

1360
01:51:23,253 --> 01:51:26,090
I put it with the rest
of the Salvation Army stuff.

1361
01:51:26,174 --> 01:51:28,384
Do you want me
to look for the box

1362
01:51:28,468 --> 01:51:31,428
Hey, kind of under
a little pressure here.

1363
01:51:31,553 --> 01:51:34,057
Hey, kind of
giving up Christmas day

1364
01:51:34,182 --> 01:51:38,644
Hey, didn't mind offering
to help when she was opening

1365
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:42,273
- Maybe it's by
the wardrobe boxes.

1366
01:51:43,733 --> 01:51:46,860
- So you're moving.
- Yeah, to Paris.

1367
01:51:46,985 --> 01:51:50,406
My firm has an office there.
I'm gonna be heading it up.

1368
01:51:50,490 --> 01:51:53,451
Paris. Paris, France ?

1369
01:51:53,534 --> 01:51:56,120
That's the one.

1370
01:51:56,246 --> 01:51:59,539
So you're--you're not
at a nonprofit firm ?

1371
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:02,084
God, no, not with

1372
01:52:02,209 --> 01:52:04,545
Are you married ?

1373
01:52:04,628 --> 01:52:08,173
No, I never got married,
Jack. You ?

1374
01:52:08,257 --> 01:52:11,094
Not exactly.

1375
01:52:11,218 --> 01:52:13,512
Look, could we
take a minute here,

1376
01:52:13,636 --> 01:52:15,765
maybe go get a cup of coffee
or something ?

1377
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:19,310
- I'll go for a cup of coffee.
- Yes. I found it.

1378
01:52:19,394 --> 01:52:21,978
Congratulations.
Your earlier flight

1379
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:24,439
but I got you
out of Kennedy

1380
01:52:24,524 --> 01:52:27,109
- Excellent.
- Am I good or what ?

1381
01:52:27,192 --> 01:52:29,151
Yes, you're brilliant.

1382
01:52:29,235 --> 01:52:31,154
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1383
01:52:31,238 --> 01:52:34,866
Here you go. It's just
some old stuff of yours.

1384
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:38,370
Do you ever think
about us, Kate ?

1385
01:52:38,453 --> 01:52:40,373
About what might
have happened ?

1386
01:52:46,128 --> 01:52:48,046
Jack, I'll tell you what.

1387
01:52:48,171 --> 01:52:52,384
If you're ever in Paris,
look me up and we'll go have

1388
01:52:52,467 --> 01:52:55,720
Or cafe. Or cafe au lait.
Oh, wait. No, no, no, no !

1389
01:52:55,803 --> 01:52:59,725
Don't close that up.
I will never find

1390
01:52:59,808 --> 01:53:02,853
Well, I marked it.
Just be more specific

1391
01:53:06,733 --> 01:53:10,192
We 'll leave it open then.
I was just trying

1392
01:53:17,116 --> 01:53:19,035
Make a right here.

1393
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:21,622
Sir, you're gonna be late

1394
01:53:21,747 --> 01:53:24,750
We're not going
to the airport.

1395
01:54:51,961 --> 01:54:54,088
You can't leave this here.

1396
01:54:54,171 --> 01:54:56,132
You can't park here !

1397
01:55:20,406 --> 01:55:23,283
Kate ! You can't go.

1398
01:55:23,408 --> 01:55:26,287
- Don't get on that plane.
-Jack ?

1399
01:55:26,412 --> 01:55:29,164
Please, let's just
go have a cup of coffee.

1400
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:32,627
I'm sure there's another
flight to Paris tonight.

1401
01:55:32,752 --> 01:55:36,588
Jack.
What are you doing here ?

1402
01:55:40,759 --> 01:55:42,803
Do you need closure ?

1403
01:55:42,886 --> 01:55:45,890
Because if you do,
after all these years,

1404
01:55:46,015 --> 01:55:48,850
I'm okay. I'm fine.

1405
01:55:50,519 --> 01:55:53,981
I--I was heartbroken,
Jack,

1406
01:55:54,065 --> 01:55:57,525
but I got over it,
I moved on, and...

1407
01:55:59,027 --> 01:56:02,155
you should move on too.

1408
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,823
Okay ? I'm sorry.

1409
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:08,496
I just can't--
I've gotta go.

1410
01:56:08,704 --> 01:56:11,915
I-I--I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1411
01:56:16,963 --> 01:56:19,381
Can I just--
I'm sorry. I was here.

1412
01:56:31,518 --> 01:56:34,354
We have a house in Jersey !

1413
01:56:35,814 --> 01:56:38,191
We have two kids.

1414
01:56:38,316 --> 01:56:40,570
Annie and Josh.

1415
01:56:40,694 --> 01:56:44,448
Annie's not much
of a violin player,

1416
01:56:44,574 --> 01:56:49,828
She's a little precocious,
but that's only because she

1417
01:56:49,953 --> 01:56:53,080
And when she smiles--

1418
01:56:55,207 --> 01:56:57,127
And Josh,

1419
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,463
he has your eyes.

1420
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:03,132
He doesn't say much,
but we know he's smart.

1421
01:57:03,215 --> 01:57:05,428
He's always got
his eyes open.

1422
01:57:05,553 --> 01:57:07,929
You know,
he's always watching us.

1423
01:57:08,054 --> 01:57:11,891
Sometimes you can look at him
and you just know...

1424
01:57:12,016 --> 01:57:14,602
he's learning something new.

1425
01:57:14,810 --> 01:57:17,229
It's like witnessing
a miracle.

1426
01:57:17,313 --> 01:57:21,110
The house is a mess,
but it's ours.

1427
01:57:21,235 --> 01:57:25,780
After 122 more payments,
it's going to be ours.

1428
01:57:25,906 --> 01:57:29,701
And you,
you're a nonprofit lawyer.

1429
01:57:29,784 --> 01:57:33,747
That's right.
You're completely nonprofit.

1430
01:57:33,872 --> 01:57:36,415
But that doesn't seem
to bother you.

1431
01:57:38,876 --> 01:57:41,671
And we're in love.

1432
01:57:41,755 --> 01:57:45,300
After 13 years of marriage,
we're still unbelievably

1433
01:57:46,927 --> 01:57:50,638
You won't even let me touch you
till I've said it.

1434
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:52,641
I sing to you.

1435
01:57:52,724 --> 01:57:57,313
Not all the time,
but definitely

1436
01:57:57,396 --> 01:58:02,024
And we've--we've dealt
with our share of surprises

1437
01:58:02,107 --> 01:58:04,985
but we stayed together.

1438
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:06,987
You see,

1439
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:11,534
you're a better person
than I am,

1440
01:58:11,618 --> 01:58:16,372
and it made me
a better person

1441
01:58:16,455 --> 01:58:19,043
I don't know.
Maybe it was all

1442
01:58:19,168 --> 01:58:21,794
Maybe I went to bed
one lonely night

1443
01:58:21,919 --> 01:58:24,463
and I imagined it all,
but...

1444
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:27,633
I swear, nothing's ever
felt more real.

1445
01:58:30,427 --> 01:58:34,473
And if you get
on that plane right now,

1446
01:58:34,598 --> 01:58:37,142
it'll disappear forever.

1447
01:58:40,105 --> 01:58:43,816
I know we could both
go on with our lives,

1448
01:58:43,941 --> 01:58:46,319
But I've seen...

1449
01:58:46,444 --> 01:58:48,570
what we could be like
together.

1450
01:58:52,449 --> 01:58:55,287
And I choose us.

1451
01:58:57,162 --> 01:58:59,038
Please, Kate.

1452
01:58:59,122 --> 01:59:02,085
One cup of coffee.

1453
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:04,879
You can always
go to Paris.

1454
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:07,590
Just... please,

1455
01:59:08,758 --> 01:59:10,676
not tonight.

1456
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,730
Okay, Jack.

1457
01:59:28,235 --> 01:59:30,112
Okay.

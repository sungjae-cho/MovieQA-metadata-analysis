1
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
Better hurry.

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
Here you go, my friend.

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,480
Make sure you get us as close as you can!

4
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,720
I'll give you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

5
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm going to get you close,
but not too close.

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
You don't want to be eaten.

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,520
- Ready, amigo?
- Ready!

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,160
One, two, three!

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,280
Eric, heave!

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,520
Scared?

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
This is great.

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
See anything yet?

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
No, not yet.

14
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
- What was that?
- I don't know.

15
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Hold on!

16
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
- What's happening?
- Just hold on!

17
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,760
Make it stop!

18
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,040
What happened to them?

19
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't know. Oh, my God.

20
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,560
- We're going to crash!
- No, we're not.

21
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm going to take this loose!

22
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,680
- Let go of the rope!
- We're gonna crash!

23
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,040
Move your hands!

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Come on!

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
Here we go!

26
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
It's going be okay, bud.

27
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,680
Charlie, those are herbivores.
They wouldn't fight each other.

28
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,080
But these are carnivores,
and they really like fighting each other.

29
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,880
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each other's throats out.

30
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,480
Alan, he's three. Let's wait till he's five.

31
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,160
Right. Sorry, Charlie.

32
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

33
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,680
It's Tom. He says he has to talk to you
about the last chapter.

34
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,080
Tell him I won't lose the Horner quote.
My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.

35
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,160
Hey, Mark!

36
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Hey, babe, look who's here.

37
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
This is Alan.

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Nice to meet you, Alan.

39
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Daddy, this is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

40
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
Dinosaur man?

41
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Jack, say my name. Is my name Alan?

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Is my name Alan?

43
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,160
He used to know me.

44
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
- It's sad, huh?
- Here you go.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,080
Thanks. Mark's been working
for the State Department now.

46
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,320
What do they do, Mark?

47
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,480
International relations,
mostly treaty law, things like that.

48
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,160
- Call of the wild one.
- I'll go.

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,560
You guys catch up.

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
Thanks, babe.

51
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
He's a great guy.

52
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,080
- So, what are you working on now?
- Raptors, mostly.

53
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
My favourite.

54
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,560
Do you remember the sounds they made?

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
I try not to.

56
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,600
All our theories about Raptor intelligence...

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,520
...what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
- Tell me.
- We did cranial scans of a fossil skull...

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,800
...and found what looks to be
a very sophisticated resonating chamber.

60
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Wait a second. So we were right.

61
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,400
- They'd the ability to vocalise.
- It's the key to their social intelligence.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Which explains
why they could work as a team.

63
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,120
They'd coordinate attacks so their prey
wouldn't know what was going on.

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,440
- They could talk to each other.
- To a degree we never imagined.

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,080
Ellie, they were smart.

66
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,920
They were smarter
than dolphins or whales.

67
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840
They were smarter than primates.

68
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,480
I just wanted to say, if you ever need help,
sometimes you forget to ask.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,640
So you can call me. Anything, anytime.

70
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Sure.

71
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
You're still the best.

72
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,680
I mean that.

73
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,840
The last of my breed.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,720
It is through the study of the
anterior chamber in multiple specimens...

75
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,560
...that we can determine the correlation
between the upper palate and the larynx.

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,400
This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you...

77
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,240
...that the Raptor was capable
of sophisticated vocalizations...

78
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,720
...which would have been
a tremendous evolutionary advantage.

79
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,440
Raptors were fierce, intelligent...

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,200
...and socially sophisticated.

81
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,840
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Were it not for the cataclysmic events
which overtook them...

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,000
...it's entirely possible
that Raptors rather than humans...

84
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,400
...would have become
the dominant species on this planet.

85
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,080
I hope this has been of interest.

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,200
It certainly excites us as paleontologists.

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,160
There is much more to discover.

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,480
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for, your support.

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,320
Thank you.

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,880
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.

91
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
Now, does anyone have a question?

92
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Fine. Does anyone have a question
that does not relate to Jurassic Park?

93
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Or the incident in San Diego...

94
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
...which I did not witness?

95
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,680
Yes, sir?

96
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Your theory on Raptors is good,
but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

97
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone
decide how to handle that second island...

98
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,760
...scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

99
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,280
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.

100
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,320
What is left of them is fossilised...

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,880
...in the rocks. And it is in the rock...

102
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,480
...that real scientists make real discoveries.

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,920
What John Hammond and Ingen
did at Jurassic Park...

104
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,600
...is create genetically engineered
theme park monsters.

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,280
Nothing more and nothing less.

106
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
Are you saying
you wouldn't want to visit Isla Sorna...

107
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,720
...and study them if you had the chance?

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
No force on Earth or Heaven...

109
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,840
...could get me on that island.

110
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
What we got here, Nashy?

111
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,000
Einhorn 20-millimetre,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

112
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,200
10-shot, magazine fed,
rotating bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,240
High explosive...

114
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
Udesky.

115
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
- It's Paul Kirby. Just checking...
- Yes, sir.

116
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
We're good to go here.

117
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,000
Matter of fact, I can lock things down
just as soon as you drop me that payment.

118
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,240
Well, that's right...

119
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,120
...two of the very best men
I could possibly find.

120
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
No, I haven't worked
with them personally...

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,400
...but believe me, sir, both of these men
come very highly recommended.

122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,040
- Are you all right?
- Nothing to worry about, sir.

123
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,600
It's gonna be a walk in the park.

124
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,960
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.

125
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,080
Let's try the toothbrush.

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,920
You've got to go slowly.

127
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Just take a little bit at a time.

128
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
I can never tell what's rock
and what's bone.

129
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Technically, it's all rock.

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,640
The calcium in the bones
is replaced during fossilization.

131
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,400
But you can feel the difference. See?

132
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,480
Rough...

133
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
...smooth.

134
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Rough, smooth.

135
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
Dr. Grant.

136
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
Mr. Brennan.

137
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
So, how did it go?

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
Well, it's not too late
to change your major, Billy.

139
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
- That good, huh?
- Worse.

140
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,600
We'll to have to pack up in four weeks.

141
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,000
Three.

142
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,000
I had to rent some equipment.

143
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,160
Come here. I got to show you something.

144
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
- You like computers, right?
- I like the abacus, Billy.

145
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Meet the future of paleontology.

146
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,200
It's a rapid prototyper.

147
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,080
I enter the scanned data
from the Raptor skull.

148
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,840
The computer breaks it down
into thousands of slices.

149
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,640
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

150
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
It's done.

151
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,680
I give you the resonating chamber
of a Velociraptor.

152
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
Listen to this.

153
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,120
Wow.

154
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,080
This is brilliant, Billy. Really, it is.

155
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,400
Sad to say, it's just a little bit late.

156
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,240
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises.

157
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
My card. How you doing, Billy?

158
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,400
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

159
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,000
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.

160
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,920
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
Would you have dinner
with my wife and me this evening?

162
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,440
- lt'll be our treat.
- That'd be great but...

163
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,480
...I'm tired, I've been travelling.
Maybe some other time.

164
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Believe me, this will be worth your while.

165
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,200
- We'd love to.
- Oh, terrific! That's the spirit. Good.

166
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,000
This evening then.

167
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Billy, thank you for coming.
Dr. Grant, how are you?

168
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,080
Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant.

169
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
Mrs. Kirby, how are you?

170
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
What are you boys drinking?

171
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,920
- lce Pick, Catfish.
- Two, please, Cat.

172
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,680
- We've admired your work for years.
- Really. Truly inspiring.

173
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,920
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,400
We've been on nearly every adventure tour
they can come up with:

175
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,240
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.

176
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,200
We even have two seats reserved
on the first commercial flight to the moon.

177
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,080
For our wedding anniversary this year,
we wanted to do something really special.

178
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,480
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.

179
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,280
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

180
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,440
And we'd like you to be our guide.

181
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,160
There you go, guys.

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,440
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby,
but I'm a very, very busy man.

183
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,720
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

184
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,560
No, no. You're the best.

185
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,720
You've seen these animals in the flesh.
There's no one who comes close to you.

186
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,440
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

187
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,680
That's the interesting part,
because we have permission to fly low.

188
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
How low?

189
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

190
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,120
From what I understand,
it's pretty much whatever we want.

191
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,520
That's hard to believe.

192
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,040
Through my business dealings,
import-export, emerging markets...

193
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,360
...I've made a lot of friends in high places.

194
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,080
In this case, the Costa Rican government.

195
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,680
Dr. Grant, you have no idea...

196
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,400
...how important it is that you come along.
It would make all the difference.

197
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,600
Mrs. Kirby, I...

198
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,640
And, of course, we'd love to make
a contribution to your research here.

199
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
So...

200
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,360
...I could write all kinds of numbers
on this cheque, Dr. Grant.

201
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
Tell me...

202
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,360
...what's it gonna take?

203
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,720
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,120
No way.

205
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
This one's lucky.

206
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
Couple of years ago,
some buddies and I went hang gliding...

207
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,720
...off these cliffs in New Zealand.

208
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,400
And this big updraft came and swept me
right against the side. Wham!

209
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,720
That does sound lucky.

210
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,840
It was this strap alone that saved my life.

211
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,200
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.

212
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,840
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,440
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

214
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,880
The bones will still be there
when we get back.

215
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,040
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

216
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,760
And truth is, you got me into this.

217
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,480
And I have no intention
of being on my own with these people.

218
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,560
Don't get too excited.

219
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,080
Chances are, we won't see a thing.

220
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
Your turn to be nice.

221
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,520
Wake me when we get there.

222
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,200
So how do you know the Kirbys?

223
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,280
Through our church.

224
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Alan.

225
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,280
Alan!

226
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,880
Wake up. We're almost there.

227
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,960
MAN ON RADIO: Unidentified aircraft
approaching Isla Sorna...

228
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,200
...this is San Juan Approach.
You're flying in restricted airspace.

229
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,920
Immediately turn to coordinates two...

230
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,520
My God, I had forgotten.

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,840
We did it, honey. We're here.

232
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,240
Cooper! if you see anything, yell up!

233
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,520
No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

234
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,120
Everyone, if you look out the left
of the plane...

235
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,640
...you can see
a whole herd of Brachiosaurus.

236
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,280
In fact, you can see at the front
of the group the alpha male grazing there.

237
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

238
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,920
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

239
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
Mrs. Kirby, look!

240
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,520
Out here, you'll see a group of...

241
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?

242
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,760
No! I told you,
I want to circle first, see the whole island.

243
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,600
What do you mean? You can't land!

244
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,440
Hold on. I can explain...

245
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
You cannot land on this island!

246
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,880
- It will be fine.
- Don't worry, please.

247
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,000
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

248
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,120
Will you please sit down?

249
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,760
Billy...

250
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,120
...tell me we didn't land.

251
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,160
Eric!

252
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Ben!

253
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,600
I think they're looking for someone.

254
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,640
Ben!

255
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Dr. Grant, are you all right?

256
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,160
- I'm sorry we had to be so rough.
- Who hit me? Who hit me?

257
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
That would be Cooper.

258
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,200
What are they doing?

259
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,480
Setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

260
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,520
Trust me, on this island,
there's no such thing as safe!

261
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
We have to get back on that plane!

262
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,120
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!

263
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
- Amanda!
- Ben!

264
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,760
Honey, Dr. Grant said
that's a bad idea!

265
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,360
What?

266
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,040
He says it's a bad idea!

267
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
What's a bad idea?

268
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,760
What was that?

269
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,080
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

270
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,920
I don't think so. It sounds bigger.

271
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,320
We have to leave! We have to leave now!

272
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Get on the plane!

273
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
Get on the plane!

274
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,520
- What about the other guy?
- Cooper's a professional.

275
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
He can handle himself.

276
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,080
Get on the plane!

277
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,160
It's all right.

278
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,840
- Paul, we can't...
- It's all right.

279
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
We'll circle the island.

280
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,840
Give me a hand, Udesky!

281
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Stop!

282
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,680
What are you doing?

283
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,800
That's Cooper!

284
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
Stop.

285
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,600
Come on, get out of the way!

286
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,920
You know I can't stop this plane.

287
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,560
Oh, my God!

288
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,240
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

289
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,760
You okay?

290
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,360
We're okay up here.

291
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,720
Everyone, just stay put.

292
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
San Juan Approach. Mayday, mayday!

293
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,040
Who has the satellite phone?

294
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,640
I do. I got it right here.

295
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,320
We're not getting anything.
The radio's gone.

296
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,120
We haven't landed yet.

297
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,000
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.

298
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
What was that?

299
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,760
Keep still! Keep still!

300
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,600
Relax. What is it? What?

301
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,000
- What is it?
- Hold it!

302
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Hang on, everyone!

303
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,160
Help me!

304
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Mrs. Kirby, come back!

305
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Amanda!

306
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,600
Follow me! This way!

307
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,600
In here!

308
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
I think we lost him.

309
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,960
It's okay, it's dead.

310
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,440
Nobody move a muscle.

311
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,800
No, no! Please, don't! Stop, please.

312
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,560
It's time you did some explaining,
Mr. Kirby.

313
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,600
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

314
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,480
No one would help us. The Costa Rican
government said this is a no-fly zone.

315
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,640
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy...

316
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,760
...told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?

317
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,960
You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

318
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,640
- No!
- He was with a friend.

319
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,480
Ben Hildebrand.

320
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,800
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.

321
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
All right, why me?

322
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,120
He said we needed someone
who'd been on the island before.

323
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,240
Yes, but I did not tell you
to kidnap somebody.

324
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,160
I have never been on this island.

325
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,520
Sure you have. You wrote that book.

326
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,520
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

327
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,960
You mean there are two islands
with dinosaurs?

328
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,120
- Stay out of this.
- How long have they been missing?

329
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,600
- Eight weeks.
- Almost eight weeks now.

330
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Billy. We'll go back to the plane,
salvage what we can.

331
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
Then we make for the coast.

332
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,040
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island
without our son.

333
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Then you can go and look for him.

334
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,280
Or you can stick with us,
as long as you don't hold us up.

335
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
Either way...

336
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,080
...you probably won't get off
this island alive.

337
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
So? What do we do?

338
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,120
We search for your son...

339
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
...in the direction that they're going.

340
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
Excellent.

341
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840
PAUL: Sorry.

342
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,240
It's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.

343
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,320
How much weight
did you say you lost?

344
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,200
About 25 pounds. I've been swimming.

345
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,080
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

346
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,920
I know. I learned.

347
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,080
- You look good.
- So do you.

348
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,760
- How would you classify it, Billy?
- Well...

349
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,480
...it's a super-predator.

350
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
A Suchomimus.

351
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
- That snout.
- No, think bigger.

352
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
- Baryonyx?
- Not with that sail.

353
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,240
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

354
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,560
- I don't remember that on Ingen's list.
- Because it wasn't on their list.

355
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,440
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

356
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,760
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.
When you climbed K2...

357
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,160
...did you base camp
at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

358
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,600
30,000 feet.
We were pretty close to the top.

359
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,280
You were about 1,000 feet above it,
actually.

360
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
No, that's a common mistake.

361
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,880
There's no such thing
as Kirby Enterprises, is there?

362
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,280
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.
The "Plus" stands for bathroom fixtures.

363
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,960
We're in the Westgate Shopping Centre,
Enid, Oklahoma...

364
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,960
I don't suppose that cheque
you wrote us is any good.

365
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,200
- I will pay you the money I owe you.
- This is good.

366
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,880
Here we are, in the worst place
in the world, and we're not being paid!

367
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,880
Wait, fellas. Hold on!

368
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,560
I'll make this up to you.

369
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,440
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen...

370
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,720
- You're not a mercenary, are you?
- I never said I was.

371
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,960
That's true. What are you?

372
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,880
I'm like a booking agent. One of the guys
got sick and couldn't come.

373
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
Excuse me. Here.

374
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,600
- So you run a hardware store?
- Paint and tile, yeah.

375
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,280
- You never can tell about people, can you?
- Ain't that the truth?

376
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,120
- Eric!
- Quiet.

377
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
Would you stop that?

378
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,040
Dr. Grant says
this is very dangerous territory.

379
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,720
Maybe we should split up.

380
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,840
- We could cover twice as much.
- Dr. Grant says that's a bad idea.

381
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Dr. Grant says this...

382
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,000
Why hire an expert
if we don't use his advice?

383
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,400
Except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric.

384
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,960
- He's looking for the coast.
- Go ahead and scream.

385
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,160
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks you,
don't come crying to me.

386
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,520
- Don't worry about that.
- What? What did you say?

387
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
- What did you say?
- Never mind! Paul, just drop it!

388
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,720
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

389
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
- Eric!
- Eric!

390
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,680
- Mrs. Kirby! Mrs. Kirby!
- Eric!

391
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,760
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote
they're still in the vicinity.

392
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,160
Young adult.

393
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,680
Hey, guys!

394
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,440
That's my camera.

395
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,160
The battery's dead.

396
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,080
I've got an idea.

397
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
Let me have the camera.

398
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,400
Where were you on that one, Ma?

399
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Okay, dive. Dive.

400
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,240
Come on, Ma.

401
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,880
- Eric.
- Ma, you were supposed to catch itl

402
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,800
I shot this the morning they disappeared.

403
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,480
I want that. Let me take that.

404
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,720
Come on, give me that. Come on, baby.

405
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,640
See anything yet?

406
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,680
No, not yet!

407
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
What was that?

408
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,120
Unclip us.

409
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,760
- There's a big clip!
- I can't see. I can't do it!

410
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,120
I'm going to unhook you, all right?

411
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,880
One, two, three!

412
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

413
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,040
The camera's still on.

414
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,480
He's alive. I know he's alive.

415
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,400
We're gonna find him.

416
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,800
Can you fly one of those?

417
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,440
Maybe.

418
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
As long as the sail is not torn.

419
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,360
Well, let's take it.

420
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,880
If we spot a plane,
it might be a good way to get attention.

421
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Pull it over this way.

422
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,840
I got it, hold on! Okay. Okay.

423
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,360
My God!

424
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,920
Okay, you're free.

425
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,320
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

426
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,920
Amanda!

427
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
Wait!

428
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
Amanda!

429
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,640
Amanda, stop.

430
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ben.

431
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,040
It's not Ben, Paul.

432
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,120
It's Eric. He's out there all by himself.

433
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,160
I know, I know.

434
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,360
Our baby is out here all by himself.

435
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,040
Listen to me. We'll find him.

436
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,360
I promise.

437
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,400
Paul.

438
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,480
Dr. Grant!

439
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,440
You should come look at this!

440
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,360
Raptor.

441
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,880
We're going to find him.

442
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

443
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
Kid's got resources.

444
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,920
Remember what it was like
to try to ground him?

445
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,520
Where's Billy?

446
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,960
What are you doing?

447
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,080
I was photographing the nest.

448
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,960
Don't do that again.

449
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm sorry.

450
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
If I lose you,
it's just me and the damn tourists.

451
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,000
I bet you Eric is in there.

452
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,520
Don't you think? I'd bet my bottom dollar!

453
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,840
What do you think it is?

454
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,160
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

455
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,760
- Eric!
- Paul! Don't.

456
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,600
What the hell.

457
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,160
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

458
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,600
I've got $1.10.

459
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
This is how you make dinosaurs?

460
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
No.

461
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,000
This is how you play God.

462
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,200
This way!

463
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,160
It's locked!

464
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,040
- This way, this way!
- Go! Go!

465
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Hey, over here!

466
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,280
Push, push!

467
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,840
My God.

468
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,840
He's calling for help.

469
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,720
Come on!

470
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,400
Into the herd!

471
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,800
Head for the trees!

472
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,360
Udesky.

473
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,640
Mr. Kirby!

474
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,200
- Billy?
- ls Alan with you?

475
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
Oh, my God.

476
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,440
Mr. Udesky!

477
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,920
He's dead.

478
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,280
Oh, my God. No, he's not.

479
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,960
No, wait. Something's not right.

480
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,600
We've got to help him.

481
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,080
Amanda!

482
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,680
Hold on!

483
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,040
They set a trap.

484
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,440
They actually set a trap.

485
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
What are you saying?

486
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,920
What are you looking for?

487
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,360
Wait!

488
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,840
Thanks.

489
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,120
Thanks a lot, Eric.

490
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,880
You know who I am?

491
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,840
Yeah.

492
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,120
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

493
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,120
Together?

494
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,680
Together.

495
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,800
That's not good.

496
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,960
They don't do so well together.

497
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,720
You'd be surprised what people can do...

498
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,440
...when they have to.

499
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,640
You're Alan Grant.

500
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,680
What are you doing here?

501
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,000
Your parents...

502
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,040
...invited me along.

503
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,440
I read both of your books.

504
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,600
I liked the first one more.

505
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,800
Before you were on the island.

506
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,520
You liked dinosaurs back then.

507
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,600
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet.

508
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,560
When Ingen cleared out,
they left a lot of stuff behind.

509
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,680
Any weapons?

510
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,520
No, and I just used the last
of the gas grenades.

511
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,240
And I appreciate that.

512
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,080
Be careful with that. T-Rex.

513
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,160
It scares the smaller ones away...

514
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,880
...but it attracts one really big one
with a fin.

515
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,280
This is T-Rex pee?

516
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,040
How did you get it?

517
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,760
You don't want to know.

518
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,840
- Dessert?
- Sure.

519
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,600
I have to tell you, I'm astonished
you've lasted eight weeks on this island.

520
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,240
Is that all it's been?

521
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,000
You're alive and that's the important thing.

522
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,240
Thanks to you,
that's one thing we have in common.

523
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,640
Did you read Malcolm's book?

524
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,640
Yeah.

525
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,080
So?

526
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,200
I don't know. I mean...

527
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,360
It was kind of preachy.

528
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,280
And too much chaos. Everything is chaos.

529
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,000
Seemed like he was high on himself.

530
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,840
That's two things that we have in common.

531
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,960
Listen.

532
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,800
Compys!

533
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,160
Alan!

534
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Alan!

535
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,200
Alan!

536
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,280
No matter how this turns out...

537
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,000
...it wasn't your fault.

538
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,360
Eric's always been a strong-willed kid.

539
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,480
Always.

540
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,800
Then you throw someone
like Ben Hildebrand into the mix...

541
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,920
...and...

542
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,920
...well.

543
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,000
Well, what?

544
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,240
All I'm saying is, it's not your fault.

545
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,360
No.

546
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,360
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

547
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,080
You drive five miles under the speed limit.

548
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,960
And I've totalled three cars in three years.

549
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,120
Well, not three.

550
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
The Buick wasn't really totalled.

551
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,600
I just said it was,
because I wanted to get the S.U.V.

552
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,640
I am so sorry that you have to be here.

553
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
I'm not.

554
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,560
There's a boat,
right alongside the bank.

555
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,920
- Looks in good shape.
- A rescue boat?

556
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,280
No, no.

557
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,120
Just something left behind.

558
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,680
But it floats.

559
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,560
We stick to the plan.

560
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,720
Head for the coast.

561
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,560
You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?

562
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,000
The coast was Alan's idea.
If he's alive, that's where he's headed.

563
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
I agree.

564
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,480
What about Eric?

565
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,440
Eric's a smart kid.

566
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,960
He probably knows
his best chance is by the coast.

567
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,960
He figures the big dinosaurs
are in the centre of the island.

568
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,200
Right?

569
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,720
Sure.

570
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,920
You know what this is?

571
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,440
It's a Raptor claw.
I used to have one.

572
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,320
A fossil.

573
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,840
Mine is new.

574
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,600
How much of the island did you explore?

575
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,200
I stayed pretty close to the compound.

576
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,920
I figured if anyone came looking for me,
that's where they'd start.

577
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,760
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

578
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,800
Are you sure?

579
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,480
The closer you get to water,
the bigger things get.

580
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,040
If we can find our way
down into the canyon...

581
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,680
...we can follow
that river out to the coast.

582
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,480
After we find your parents.

583
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,800
Then what?

584
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,240
- One step at a time.
- Listen.

585
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,840
What?

586
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,160
That's my dad's satellite phone!

587
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Wait a minute. How do you know?

588
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,560
"Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"

589
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,720
Dad!

590
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,200
Mum!

591
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,760
Mum! Dad!

592
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,720
- Eric!
- Eric!

593
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,520
Eric! This way!

594
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,800
Mum! Dad!

595
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,840
Eric!

596
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,240
Mum, Dad! Mum, Dad!

597
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,000
I knew it. My God.

598
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,960
I knew it.

599
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Oh, God.

600
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,520
Boy, am I glad to see you.

601
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,360
Hey, you got my bag.

602
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,080
Yeah. Lucky strap.

603
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,360
Want me to carry it?

604
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,520
We need to find a gap here.

605
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,640
- How did you know we were here?
- The phone.

606
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,920
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

607
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,880
- My phone?
- Your satellite phone.

608
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,640
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

609
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,120
- When did you use it last?
- On the plane.

610
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,720
I got a call on the plane and...

611
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,600
- What?
- I loaned it to Nash.

612
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,040
He must have had it when he...

613
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,440
Run.

614
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,800
Alan, you want to give me the bag back?

615
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,720
It's okay, I got it.

616
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,280
Please, give me the bag.

617
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,280
It's not safe.

618
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,560
Raptor eggs.

619
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,160
Did you steal Raptor eggs?

620
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,640
Now it all makes sense.

621
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,200
I swear, if I'd known
you were going to end up with them...

622
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,720
It was an impulse,
I thought they'd be worth a fortune.

623
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,760
Enough to fund the dig site
another 10 more years.

624
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,200
You have to believe me.

625
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,760
This was a stupid decision,
but I did it with the best intentions.

626
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,480
"With the best intentions."

627
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,240
Some of the worst things imaginable
have been done with the best intentions.

628
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,080
You know what, Billy?

629
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,000
As far as I'm concerned...

630
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,320
...you're no better than the people
that built this place.

631
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,600
What are you doing?
Those things are after us because of those.

632
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,080
Those things know we have the eggs.

633
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,360
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

634
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,760
- What if they catch us with them?
- What if they catch us without them?

635
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,800
There's a boat at the bottom,
just downriver.

636
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,480
We can try and make it to the coast,
at least.

637
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,320
- You okay?
- Yeah.

638
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,680
Let's do this one at a time, shall we?

639
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,000
Okay, come on over!

640
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,240
One at a time!

641
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,920
All right, Eric.

642
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,160
I'm going to leave you just for a minute.
And then you'll be right behind me, okay?

643
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,080
Mum!

644
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,280
I've been alone in a water truck
for eight weeks.

645
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,360
I think I can manage
the next two minutes without you.

646
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,360
Right, we're all together now.

647
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,800
Okay, Eric.

648
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,480
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

649
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,720
Over you go.

650
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,440
Mum?

651
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,000
Oh, my God.

652
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,600
- What is it?
- It's a birdcage.

653
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,600
For what?

654
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,040
Dad!

655
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,000
Eric!

656
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,520
Eric!

657
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,880
Eric!

658
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,160
I can't see him!

659
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,320
Eric!

660
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,640
No!

661
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,600
This way!

662
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,760
Billy? Billy!

663
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,240
Billy, stop!
Don't, Billy!

664
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,440
Billy!

665
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,600
Eric, hold on!

666
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,480
Eric!

667
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,320
Jump!

668
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,160
Billy!

669
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,720
Let go now!

670
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,400
- Eric!
- He's there.

671
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,600
Eric!

672
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,160
There he is! He's across the river!

673
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,120
Get him out of here!

674
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,120
- No!
- Go, Eric!

675
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,880
What about Billy?

676
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,520
Hang on, Billy!

677
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,640
Wait.

678
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,640
Get away!

679
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,160
There's plenty of gasoline.

680
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,160
Now we've just got to make our way
to the coast.

681
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,000
Work out some sort of a signal.

682
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,000
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

683
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,880
Dr. Grant?

684
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,480
Hey, Eric, how are you doing?

685
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,600
I'm sorry about Billy.

686
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,080
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

687
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,440
I said:

688
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,000
"You're as bad as the people
that built this place."

689
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,720
Which wasn't true.

690
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,200
Billy was just young. That's all.

691
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,760
I have a theory
that there are two kinds of boys.

692
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,200
There are those
who want to be astronomers...

693
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,600
...and those who want to be astronauts.

694
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,880
The astronomer, or the paleontologist...

695
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,320
...gets to study these amazing things
from a place of complete safety.

696
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,240
- But then you never get to go into space.
- Exactly.

697
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,680
It's the difference
between imagining and seeing.

698
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,080
To be able to touch them.

699
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,080
And that's all Billy wanted.

700
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,800
Dr. Grant.

701
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,680
You know something, Dr. Grant?

702
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,720
Billy was right.

703
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,600
Listen.

704
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,440
Find it before it stops!

705
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,360
Eric, you stay on that boat.

706
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,320
It's here. It's here.

707
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,800
God.

708
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,760
I got it.

709
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,040
Hello? Hello?

710
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,280
You too can own a timeshare...

711
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,920
...in beautiful Guadalajara.

712
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,360
Enjoy a meal in one
of our four-star restaurants.

713
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,480
Look out!

714
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,360
Turn off the power.

715
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,440
You've got juice for maybe one call.

716
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,680
Whatever you do,
don't call the U.S. Embassy.

717
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,520
They won't do a damn thing.

718
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,240
Hey, guys, come here!
Look at this!

719
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,600
- Bonitos.
- Something must have spooked them!

720
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,320
Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby.

721
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,800
Open the throttle!

722
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,160
Pick up.

723
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,680
Hello?

724
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,760
Ellie?

725
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,280
Hello?

726
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,680
Charlie!

727
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,160
- Charlie!
- Hello?

728
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,840
Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now!

729
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,320
Take the phone to Mummy!

730
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,520
It's the dinosaur man!

731
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,400
- Okay.
- Listen to me, Charlie.

732
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,520
Charlie!

733
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
Are you taking the phone to Mum?

734
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
Charlie!

735
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,760
Oh, ho-ho! Hi, everybody!

736
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,880
It's great to be here!

737
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,240
Hi, there! How are you?

738
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,200
This is going to be great.

739
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,560
- Who's on the phone?
- The dinosaur man.

740
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,320
He is? Alan?

741
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,040
Look in the boxes! Find a weapon!

742
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,040
Where's the phone?

743
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,680
- There!
- Get the phone!

744
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,480
Ellie, listen to me!

745
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,000
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

746
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,040
The river! Site B!

747
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,000
The river!

748
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,800
Hello?

749
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,120
Hey!

750
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,880
Dad! Dad!

751
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,840
Paul!

752
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,640
Dad!

753
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,760
Paul, you jerk!

754
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,080
You can't leave me like this!

755
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,240
I'm not going anywhere!

756
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,040
Remember when we went fishing
a couple of summers ago?

757
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,000
I was putting the boat in the water
and the trailer sank?

758
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,320
The tow truck tried to pull us out
and it got dragged in, too.

759
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,840
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

760
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,480
I miss fishing.

761
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,200
Mr. Kirby?

762
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,560
That lady you called. Who is she?

763
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,480
How do you know that she can help us?

764
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,760
She's the one person
I could always count on. I owe her a lot.

765
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,560
- I don't think I ever told her that.
- You should.

766
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,800
You hear that?

767
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,520
The ocean.

768
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,080
They want the eggs.

769
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.

770
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,280
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

771
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,840
She thinks you stole the eggs.

772
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,000
Get behind me.

773
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,320
Give me the eggs.

774
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,560
Do it, Mum.

775
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,280
No. Call for help.

776
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,720
That's a helicopter.

777
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,640
Dr. Grant?

778
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,920
- Dr. Alan Grant?
- Stop!

779
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,960
That's a very bad idea!

780
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,040
- Second squad, move!
- Wow!

781
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,280
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

782
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,880
God bless you, Ellie.

783
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,840
- Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
- What?

784
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,720
You made it.

785
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,200
Yeah.

786
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,840
I rescued your hat.

787
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,440
- Dr. Grant, we need to go now!
- Oh, yeah.

788
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,240
Well, that's the important thing.

789
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,720
Dr. Grant!

790
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,720
Can I get you to sit here
and buckle up, sir?

791
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,760
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm,
six souls on board.

792
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,440
Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.

793
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,480
What the hell is that?

794
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,240
Dr. Grant, look!

795
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,800
Where do you think they're going?

796
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,400
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

797
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,440
It's a whole new world for them.

798
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,800
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.

799
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,440
Let's go home.

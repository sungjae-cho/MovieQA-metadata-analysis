1
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,480
<i>Best place we went to
since we've been here.</i>

2
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:14,851
<i>Definitely, man.</i>

3
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,651
<i>Way to go, buddy.
Brother.</i>

4
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:20,023
<i>You guys coming back to my
place? All right. Let's go.</i>

5
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,657
Hey!

6
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,798
Shame, shame.
Closing down the beer garden.

7
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,534
Hundred-meter dash powered
by knackwurst and lager.

8
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,741
Where are you guys from?

9
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:38,805
What's your event?

10
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:42,646
They don't speak English,
man.

11
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:47,784
Let's help them over.
Come on. Up?

12
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:49,383
Here you go.

13
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,856
Let's go.
I got you. Come on.

14
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:57,626
Up. Yeah. All right?

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,997
You guys take care.
See you.

16
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:08,805
Take it easy.
See you.

17
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,810
You're taking
the grade tomorrow.

18
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,573
Watch yourself, man.

19
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,709
<i>I'm Jim McKay
speaking to you live</i>

20
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,457
<i>at this moment,
from ABC headquarters</i>

21
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,533
<i>just outside the Olympic
village in Munich, West Germany.</i>

22
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,763
<i>The peace of what have been
called the "serene Olympics"</i>

23
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:02,302
<i>was shattered just before dawn
this morning, about 5:00.</i>

24
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:06,152
<i>There is great uncertainty
about how many Israelis</i>

25
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,491
<i>are being held hostage
in the apartment.</i>

26
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,360
<i>It now appears that Black September
has tossed a piece of paper</i>

27
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:13,764
<i>out the window.
A list of demands.</i>

28
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,428
<i>They want what they call
"The Israeli war machine",</i>

29
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:20,338
<i>to release 200 Arabs, which it
insists are political prisoners</i>

30
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,672
<i>or the hostages
will be killed.</i>

31
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:24,777
<i>The terrorist communique
ends with an appeal</i>

32
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,913
<i>for revolutionaries
of the world to unite.</i>

33
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,374
<i>McKAY: This is building
number 31. At this moment</i>

34
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:36,282
<i>eight or nine terrified
living human beings</i>

35
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,257
<i>are being held prisoner.</i>

36
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,852
<i>The demands have been many.
There's someone right now.</i>

37
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,461
<i>This certainly has to be
one of the guerrillas.</i>

38
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:47,797
<i>A man with a stocking mask
on his face. Weird.</i>

39
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,966
<i>What's going on inside
that head and that mind?</i>

40
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,938
<i>Just a short
while ago, there was</i>

41
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,942
<i>another in this long series
of negotiations.</i>

42
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,538
<i>The spokesman for the group
came out, spoke, went back.</i>

43
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:04,311
<i>It seems to be a process
of speak and consultation.</i>

44
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:07,252
<i>McKAY: Does it mean it's all right?
Or does it mean it's all over?</i>

45
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:08,811
<i>Come and get us.</i>

46
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,551
<i>As Peter Jennings indicated,
the German army</i>

47
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,083
<i>because of very
complicated laws</i>

48
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,991
<i>would not be allowed
to participate.</i>

49
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:20,261
<i>And there you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag</i>

50
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,359
<i>in which is obviously
a machine gun.</i>

51
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:24,267
<i>Peter Jennings, once again,
is stationed</i>

52
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,636
<i>inside the Olympic village.
With the naked eye, Peter,</i>

53
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,106
<i>what do you see now?</i>

54
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:31,076
<i>Jim, there are
now a great many</i>

55
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,672
<i>maybe a dozen already,
of those security men</i>

56
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,978
<i>in athletic uniforms.</i>

57
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,463
Stop!

58
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,975
<i>It now appears that the siege
of the apartment building</i>

59
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,135
<i>where the hostages are being
held has been called off</i>

60
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,179
<i>and the German police
are retreating from the area.</i>

61
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,238
<i>Officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans</i>

62
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,476
<i>when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building</i>

63
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,109
<i>and demanded
they call off the siege</i>

64
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:13,744
<i>pointing out
that the entire operation</i>

65
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,913
<i>was being watched
on a television set</i>

66
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,044
<i>within the apartment.</i>

67
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,522
<i>Apparently, new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen</i>

68
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,685
<i>and their hostages,
though it isn't yet known</i>

69
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,228
<i>when or where
this might occur.</i>

70
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,388
<i>This is Peter.
Do you have something</i>

71
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,262
<i>to report to us
from where you are?</i>

72
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,927
<i>This is Cosell.
I certainly do, Peter.</i>

73
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,063
<i>We have an immense flurry
of action here.</i>

74
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,633
<i>Suddenly, in the whole area between
building 20 and building 12</i>

75
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,936
<i>they have been clearing
out cars.</i>

76
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,073
<i>Obviously wary of an assault
from the German police</i>

77
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,663
<i>within
five minutes.</i>

78
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,323
<i>What I'm hearing
from here is that</i>

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,927
<i>they're heading to an airport
called FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck</i>

80
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,671
<i>...says the chopper
just landed</i>

81
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,069
<i>at the back
of the Olympic village here.</i>

82
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,869
<i>Can you see gate number seven?</i>

83
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,706
<i>This is Vance Kolvig.
What I have seen are</i>

84
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,542
<i>four hostages
in one helicopter</i>

85
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,947
<i>and it looks like five hostages
in the first helicopter.</i>

86
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,917
<i>Yes, I just got back
a little while ago</i>

87
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:21,045
<i>and it was obvious
that something</i>

88
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,486
<i>quite serious
was going on out there.</i>

89
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,956
<i>Here we are, outside the
gates. There are armored cars</i>

90
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:26,048
<i>police cars</i>

91
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,626
<i>Police are pouring in through
the gates with lights flashing</i>

92
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:31,961
<i>and here come some more. Five,
six, here comes another one.</i>

93
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:34,364
<i>Seven armored cars have gone
in through the gates now.</i>

94
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,130
<i>They're mounting
a major invasion.</i>

95
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,535
<i>The latest word we get
from the airport is that</i>

96
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,836
<i>quote, "all hell has broken
loose out there."</i>

97
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:59,292
<i>It's just arrived, Peter.
The bus has arrived</i>

98
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,419
<i>to the helicopters.
We have reports now</i>

99
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:05,158
<i>that all the hostages,
all nine hostages are safe.</i>

100
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,592
<i>We repeat, we have confirmed,
it's just past 1:00 a.m.</i>

101
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,399
<i>The fighting ceased
at midnight.</i>

102
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:13,531
<i>Well, that's at least 24
we've seen go in</i>

103
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,097
<i>and now we can see
the lights flashing</i>

104
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,837
<i>There was a terrible battle at
the airport, but the hostages</i>

105
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,436
<i>somehow the hostages are safe.</i>

106
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:23,039
<i>And, according to these
reports, all Arab terrorists</i>

107
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:24,846
<i>have died by German gunfire.</i>

108
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,944
<i>Originally it was said
that the hostages were safe</i>

109
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:30,115
<i>but now that has been changed.</i>

110
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,385
<i>An Olympic spokesman
said that</i>

111
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,484
<i>CIOFFI: Of the areas in the
world, this is one of the areas</i>

112
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,301
<i>They've spent their youth,
their young people</i>

113
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,802
<i>they've spent all their money
on wars.</i>

114
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,601
<i>Now they have a chance to build
their nations. These nations</i>

115
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:49,268
<i>And, of course, they're compatible.
The Arabs and the Israelis</i>

116
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:51,174
<i>are perfectly compatible
as far as I can tell.</i>

117
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,076
<i>And now, as you say, Peter,
you're quite right.</i>

118
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,377
<i>They've been jolted apart
again, as they were</i>

119
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,316
<i>seeming to come just a little
closer. Little hope.</i>

120
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,853
<i>We've just gotten the final
word. When I was a kid</i>

121
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:03,515
<i>my father used to say our greatest
hopes and our worst fears</i>

122
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,082
<i>are seldom realized. Our worst
fears have been realized tonight.</i>

123
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:09,994
<i>They've now said that
there were 11 hostages.</i>

124
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,555
<i>Two were killed
in their rooms</i>

125
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,195
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

126
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,634
<i>Nine were killed
at the airport tonight.</i>

127
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,498
<i>They're all gone.</i>

128
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,835
<i>before a quiet
crowd of 80,000.</i>

129
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,073
<i>After the ceremony,
the surviving team</i>

130
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,138
<i>saw the coffins
of their fallen comrades</i>

131
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,980
<i>loaded onto an airplane
to bring them home together.</i>

132
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:34,646
<i>Enormous crowds also gathered
on Dizengoff Street</i>

133
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:38,123
<i>and in Jerusalem on the plaza
in front of the Knesset.</i>

134
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,920
<i>People are weeping,
tearing their clothes.</i>

135
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:43,690
<i>The funerals, which will be
held tomorrow in Jerusalem</i>

136
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:46,665
<i>are expected to draw
tens of thousands of mourners.</i>

137
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,202
<i>These are the names of the
members of the Israeli team</i>

138

00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,879
Now we're going
to have a baby.

171
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,054
Eleven names.

172
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,683
Give us the order,
and we'll begin.

173
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,497
It's the same as Eichmann.

174
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,290
We say to these butchers:

175
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,232
"You didn't want
to share this world with us..."

176
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,703
"then we don't have
to share this world with you."

177
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,171
There's legitimacy for this.
Am I correct?

178
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,812
Ambushed
and slaughtered again...

179
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,242
while the rest of the world is
playing games, Olympic torches...

180
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:50,119
and brass bands
and dead Jews in Germany.

181
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,851
And the world
couldn't care less.

182
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,019
We've responded.
We sent 70 fighter jets.

183
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:56,255
A response no one heard.

184
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,890
Air strikes on guerrilla training
centers. That's a response.

185
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,900
No one notices what happens
in the border camps.

186
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,664
Sixty Arabs dead, at least.
Who knows how many wounded.

187
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:06,171
This is about fixing
the world's attention.

188
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,834
Well, it's not just
a publicity stunt.

189
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,636
Let me remind you.

190
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,071
Ali Hassan Salameh,
he invented Black September.

191
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,113
He is the architect
of the Munich murders.

192
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,843
These people.

193
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,815
They're sworn to destroy us.

194
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,158
Forget peace for now.

195
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,096
We have to show them
we're strong.

196
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:34,733
We have laws,
we represent civilization.

197
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,097
Some people say we can't
afford to be civilized.

198
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,503
I've always resisted
such people.

199
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,972
But I don't know
who these maniacs are...

200
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:46,035
and where they come from.

201
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,748
Palestinians?

202
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,150
They're not recognizable.

203
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,519
You tell me what law
protects people like these.

204
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:03,092
Today I'm hearing
with new ears.

205
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,166
Every civilization
finds it necessary...

206
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:10,965
to negotiate compromises
with its own values.

207
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:15,704
I've made a decision.

208
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:18,244
The responsibility
is entirely mine.

209
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,349
Avner?
Yes?

210
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,754
We're going to Jerusalem.
Get in.

211
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,149
Come on, sir.

212
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:44,866
Hello. I'm General Zamir.

213
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:46,296
Yes.

214
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,566
You swore us in.

215
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,904
My unit,
when I joined Mossad.

216
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,741
I don't remember you.

217
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,142
Of course, I know your father.

218
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,387
Avner.

219
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:12,390
<i>It's been... Two years
since I worked for you.</i>

220
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,124
I remember.
Please, sit down.

221
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,698
Harari.

222
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:20,028
General Nadav.

223
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,435
And General Yariv.

224
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:25,473
How are you?
How is your father?

225
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,308
He's fine. Thank you.

226
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:32,376
Coffee? It's wonderful
to see you again.

227
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:33,578
Sit.

228
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,784
The chief of the Mossad,
two generals...

229
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:41,623
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

230
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,162
This is something new.

231
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,801
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

232
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:54,636
We want to ask you. Will
you undertake a mission?

233
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,572
An important mission. You will
have to leave the country...

234
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,943
and your family,
maybe for years.

235
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:03,949
And it is dangerous. You
can't talk about it to anyone.

236
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,644
Not even your wife.

237
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,651
Now you should
say something.

238
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,785
Do you have any questions?

239
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:21,231
So, this isn't about guarding
tourists on El Al jets?

240
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:25,337
No questions?

241
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,273
Did we mention
how dangerous it is?

242
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,275
You know, my sister
died on Tuesday.

243
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,942
No, I didn't know that.
Cancer.

244
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,715
I couldn't go to the
athletes' funerals...

245
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,307
because she died.

246
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,716
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

247
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,781
Family matters.

248
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:53,858
Your wife is pregnant.
Yes, seven months.

249
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:55,128
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

250
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,266
You were one
of my favorite bodyguards.

251
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:01,034
You know,
I like neat, durable men.

252
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:04,372
You liked having
the son of a hero around.

253
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:09,013
Truth be told, you don't
look much like your father.

254
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,208
No?

255
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:14,684
Your mother
is who you resemble.

256
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:35,200
Tomorrow morning.

257
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:38,108
If you can't decide
in one day...

258
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,571
you can't decide.

259
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,922
Her sister died.

260
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,586
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

261
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:56,356
because some people
are angry at her...

262
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,023
for not negotiating
with the terrorists.

263
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,330
She didn't go
to the funerals...

264
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,638
because she didn't
want to be booed.

265
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,076
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

266
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,545
You'll say yes.

267
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,811
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

268
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:47,343
How late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex?

269
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:50,910
Labor.

270
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,729
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

271
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:10,831
Will you?

272
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,931
Whatever they want, make
sure they give you a raise.

273
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,068
I need things for the baby.

274
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,606
I can't live
with refusing this.

275
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:25,312
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

276
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,547
She abandoned you on that
kibbutz. She didn't abandon me.

277
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:30,089
My father was missing.

278
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:32,488
He was in prison,
she was overwhelmed.

279
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,357
Oh, yes. She did what anybody would do.

280
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:38,827
Yeah, so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you.

281
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:42,190
Now you think Israel
is your mother.

282
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,506
So listen.

283
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,637
I'm going to go along
with this, until I don't.

284
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,950
Do you understand me?
I love you.

285
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:04,483
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

286
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:14,794
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

287
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,995
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits, or pensions...

288
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,563
or legal aid
or medical assistance.

289
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,605
It's a contract
that there is no contract.

290
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:27,279
Do I get a copy?
You don't.

291
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:29,679
Your pension contribution
refund.

292
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,410
You're now officially
unofficial.

293
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,453
Unemployed and uninsured.

294
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,580
You'll open two accounts...

295
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:39,955
at the Union de Banques Suisse
in Geneva...

296
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:41,516
on Rue du Commerce.

297
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:45,121
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

298
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,393
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

299
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,162
when you get what accumulates.

300
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:52,068
Also, for each of your men, you
open an account for his salary.

301
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:56,131
How many men do I have for this...
In the operational funds box...

302
00:19:56,209 --> 00:20:00,009
we will deposit
250,000 American dollars.

303
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,311
You take it out,
we put more in.

304
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,645
I want receipts.

305
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,943
You are not working
for the Baron Rothschild.

306
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,319
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

307
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,917
I'm an old Galicianer
from a mud hut in the Ukraine.

308
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,588
And I don't trust Yekke putzes
let loose in Europe...

309
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:18,824
with unlimited operational
expenses.

310
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:21,366
I was born in Israel.
I'm not a Yekke.

311
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:24,096
Where is your grandpa from?
Frankfurt.

312
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,163
You're a Yekke.

313
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:30,534
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

314
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:34,369
Also, we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds.

315
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,276
You can leave messages
for us.

316
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:41,115
But there shouldn't be messages.
I don't care about that.

317
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:45,418
Bring me receipts,
you got me? I got you.

318
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:49,625
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying for it.

319
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,166
We have 11 Palestinian
names.

320
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,260
Each had a hand
in planning Munich.

321
00:20:57,337 --> 00:21:00,170
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

322
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,502
They're all in Europe now.

323
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,041
You'll stay there
as long as it takes.

324
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:06,203
Europe only, not the Arab
countries. That's for us, not you.

325
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,440
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

326
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,948
Who needs it?

327
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:13,281
You'll have no contact
with us.

328
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,177
You're not going to give me
any information?

329
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:18,690
We deposit money from a
fund that doesn't exist...

330
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:21,818
into a box we don't know about,
in a bank we never set foot in.

331
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:24,455
We can't help you because
we never heard of you before.

332
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,226
You'll do what
the terrorists do.

333
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,564
You think they report back
to home base? They don't.

334
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,795
We want them dead.

335
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:35,107
Nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea.

336
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,075
You can ask questions now.

337
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,111
Am I alone?
Four others.

338
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:42,279
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

339
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,610
cleanup to make sure
you don't...

340
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,842
accidentally
drop your fake passport...

341
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,785
next to the dead body.
You're the team leader.

342
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,120
Who kills the targets?
You do. Who else?

343
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:55,861
Use guns if you have to,
but the bombs are preferable.

344
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,988
One of your guys
knows how to make them.

345
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:01,363
<i>We want everyone to read in Le Monde
some famous Arab terrorist is dead.</i>

346
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,026
Who knows who blew him up?

347
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,537
Why me?
So what's wrong with you?

348
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:08,466
I'm not an experienced
field operative.

349
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,940
So I'm not known.
Not even I know you now.

350
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:14,675
And also, I lived in Frankfurt
when I was a kid...

351
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,045
so I'm a Yekke Jew who
knows his way around Europe.

352
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:20,382
That's a good reason. Here's
one more. You're ordinary.

353
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:22,478
You aren't a sabra
Charles Bronson.

354
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:24,284
I am a sabra.
I know.

355
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:26,757
I know so much about you.
You're a nice sabra...

356
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:29,852
with a dog and a baby on the way.
You won't shoot Spanish bellhops.

357
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,920
No bellhops. No civilians.

358
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,330
That kind of trouble
we can't afford.

359
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,800
The hard thing will
not be finding them.

360
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,895
Some of them, anyway,
are not so carefully hidden.

361
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,406
The hard thing will be
not punishing yourselves...

362
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:43,840
by getting caught
or getting killed.

363
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,572
You want the last piece of baklava? No.

364
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,807
Smart decision.
You should avoid sweets.

365
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:52,215
After all, you just signed
away your dental insurance.

366
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:56,645
<i>This is Pierre Bouchet,
your captain, speaking.</i>

367
00:22:56,723 --> 00:23:00,318
<i>Welcome aboard Flight SA 74
direct to Geneva.</i>

368
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:03,692
<i>We are now at a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet</i>

369
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,163
<i>and we wish you
a pleasant flight.</i>

370
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:54,211
Don't shoot. I don't
understand what you're saying.

371
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,638
Easy, easy, easy.

372
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:15,716
Press the buzzer
when you're done.

373
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:36,434
Have a nice day.
Thank you.

374
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:42,674
I'm not good at it.
No.

375
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,114
Hebrew?
No.

376
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:46,310
A team leader who cooks.
What a luxury.

377
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,684
Years in the kibbutz kitchen.
You've done this before?

378
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,052
Done what?

379
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,747
Sit. Come on.

380
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:56,057
<i>Because I joined Mossad
10 minutes ago, and I'm</i>

381
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,858
<i>Look, I want to kill every
one of these pigs, but</i>

382
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,129
Thank you.

383
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:05,898
<i>So, some of you have training
in this kind of</i>

384
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,065
He sells antiques.
Right here in Frankfurt.

385
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:09,938
It's a front,
but successful.

386
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm a documents
and identities specialist...

387
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:14,740
with a sharp eye
for early Danish Modern.

388
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:16,809
And you?

389
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:19,075
Oh, I make toys.

390
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:22,446
I thought you made bombs.
Toys, in Brussels.

391
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:25,149
For bombs,
I had to go to night school.

392
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,422
My wife's expecting.

393
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,154
<i>Mazel tov.
Mazel tov.</i>

394
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:31,753
Beautiful. When?
Couple of months.

395
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:34,858
Think we'll be done
by then?

396
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:37,959
Is it Ali Hassan Salameh
we're after?

397
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:42,503
I mean, that's the job,
right?

398
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:46,502
We're here to kill the guy
who planned Munich. Am I right?

399
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:53,209
It's strange, isn't it, to
think of oneself as an assassin?

400
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,720
Think of yourself
as something else then.

401
00:27:55,788 --> 00:28:00,248
A soldier in a war. I mean,
you know how to shoot...

402
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,922
to assassinate people, right?

403
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,726
<i>Mazels on the baby,
and all that. That's great.</i>

404
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,131
<i>That's just fantastic.
But, I mean</i>

405
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,968
You make dolls
in a toy shop...

406
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:17,136
and you shop for sofas...

407
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:19,306
and you,
I don't know what you do.

408
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,573
Me? I worry.

409
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,848
So, why'd they make you
team leader?

410
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,545
Because he really knows
how to cook a brisket.

411
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,441
<i>Hello?
Andreas.</i>

412
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,113
<i>Surprised? Surprised? You punched me.</i>

413
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,176
<i>You broke my jaw, man.
That was 10 years ago.</i>

414
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:03,449
<i>And you were sleeping
with my girlfriend.</i>

415
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:05,457
<i>Listen, I'm in town.
Are you around?</i>

416
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:07,356
<i>Yeah, actually, I'm
here with my girlfriend.</i>

417
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:09,860
<i>Do you want to come over?
Perfect.</i>

418
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,251
She's incredible,
isn't she?

419
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:44,023
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

420
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:21,462
I miss you, man. We really
used to love each other.

421
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,697
That was a long time ago.
We were in high school.

422
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,035
I have some names.

423
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,637
Some people I need to find
for my rich American friends.

424
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:40,082
Give me my money,
Yvonne.

425
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:45,255
One hundred fifty.
One hundred.

426
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:46,817
Cash.

427
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,686
$100,000.

428
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:54,993
These people I'm looking for,
you don't know them.

429
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,334
We might.
You don't.

430
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,807
But maybe you know someone
who does.

431
00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:05,242
And it's Americans
you work for?

432
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,475
Yes. See?

433
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,670
James Madison.

434
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,311
Americans.

435
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:14,548
We'll ask some friends.

436
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:17,952
Hiding?
The Arabs are not hiding.

437
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:20,390
Munich was a big success for them. Oh?

438
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:22,289
The implications of Munich
for the struggle...

439
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:26,388
They got everyone's attention.
They're recruiting, making plans.

440
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:28,594
Give me a few names.

441
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:35,403
I can't help if I don't know
who you're trying to find.

442
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,237
We'll have to trust.

443
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,402
You have to cross the line.

444
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:43,671
I trust you. You carry cash
and you don't make speeches.

445
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:46,650
Nowadays, everyone makes
speeches, like your friend Andreas.

446
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,346
Talk, talk, talk.

447
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,679
Name me an Arab.

448
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,091
Abu Daoud.

449
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:57,893
Abu Youssef.

450
00:31:58,497 --> 00:31:59,896
Wael Zwaiter.

451
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,365
Kamal Nasser.

452
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,371
Salameh.
Forget Salameh. Too hard.

453
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:09,306
Wait. Who are these guys? Why
are you trying to find Arabs?

454
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,900
Sixty thousand per name.
Dollars.

455
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:15,642
If it's good information. If
it isn't good, it doesn't cost.

456
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:18,312
Wael Zwaiter's here,
in Rome.

457
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:22,350
<i>He just translated the
Arabian Nights into Italian.</i>

458
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:25,683
Tomorrow there's a reading.
He's broke.

459
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,516
He has a niece he calls
every day in Damascus.

460
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:30,858
Are you trying
to join the PLO?

461
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,398
We need to talk. Alone.

462
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:38,164
And also maybe you need people
to help with your work.

463
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:39,568
Cars. Vans.

464
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:56,151
If you tell anybody
about this, I don't know.

465
00:32:57,356 --> 00:32:58,721
Just don't.

466
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:00,656
Just don't.

467
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:21,278
Anything you need,
we'll provide.

468
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:23,538
I need receipts.

469
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:42,692
Keep talking. Keep talking.

470
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,185
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

471
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:21,975
Are you Wael Zwaiter?

472
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,411
Yes, and who are you?

473
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,978
Do you know
why we're here?

474
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,723
Are you Wael Zwaiter?
He said yes already.

475
00:38:38,797 --> 00:38:40,458
He already said yes.

476
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:44,658
What are we doing?

477
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:50,575
What do I do?

478
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:52,973
Do you know why we're here?

479
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,924
What happened?
Why didn't you shoot him?

480
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,558
We shot him.
But I didn't hear a shot.

481
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:18,500
We shot him eight times,
maybe 10 times.

482
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,231
Did you kill him?
He's dead.

483
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:22,102
He shit his pants.
He's dead.

484
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,583
Drink some wine.
We're celebrating.

485
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,693
That old Pesach story.

486
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:18,119
The angels are rejoicing...

487
00:40:18,197 --> 00:40:21,689
because the Egyptians have
just drowned in the Red Sea.

488
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:25,327
I didn't say we're rejoicing.

489
00:40:25,404 --> 00:40:27,565
I said, "We're celebrating."

490
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:30,300
And God said to the angels,
"Why are you celebrating?"

491
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,935
"I've just killed
a multitude of my children."

492
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:34,501
Mr. Zwaiter.

493
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:40,207
He cost us, by my
calculations, roughly $352,000.

494
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:44,815
You didn't finish the story.

495
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:47,116
The angels respond to God.

496
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,188
They say,
"God, we're celebrating..."

497
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:51,889
"because when the people hear
what happened to the Egyptians..."

498
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,488
"they'll understand
your point."

499
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:54,896
Which was?

500
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,892
Don't fuck with the Jews.

501
00:40:59,104 --> 00:41:02,096
I don't know about the rest of
you, but I'm not celebrating.

502
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:04,039
I'm goddamn rejoicing.

503
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:07,305
Here. Put that down.
Put it down. Get up.

504
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:09,006
No, please.
Come on, dance with me.

505
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:11,242
Dance with me. Come on.
No.

506
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:12,778
Come on.

507
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,387
Come on. Hey.

508
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:52,154
<i>This is...
What shall I call you today?</i>

509
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,615
Franz Storsch.

510
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,261
You can call me Louis.

511
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,301
Our service has been
satisfactory? Pricey.

512
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,133
A Jew and a Frenchman. We
could haggle forever, huh?

513
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,769
I'm not a Jew. What do
you suppose a ramson is?

514
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,947
It's a kind of a wild leek. Not
in season, but garlic will do.

515
00:42:18,784 --> 00:42:21,617
My papa sometimes loses
track of the seasons.

516
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:23,712
I know nothing about food.

517
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:26,380
Why does he make me shop?

518
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:32,622
You're wondering
if I'm French Intelligence.

519
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:34,598
Or CIA or KGB.

520
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,458
Or an agent with a profitable
sideline in information.

521
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:41,730
I could be anybody.
You could be anybody, too.

522
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,665
Identity.
That's the boring part now.

523
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:48,302
Here's what isn't boring.

524
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:51,274
As long as you don't work
for any government...

525
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,114
I'm in private business.
Rich Americans, I heard.

526
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,915
I'm in private business, too.
My family.

527
00:42:57,422 --> 00:43:01,916
We can locate almost anyone
for anyone anywhere...

528
00:43:02,194 --> 00:43:04,719
and we are ideologically
promiscuous.

529
00:43:04,863 --> 00:43:07,127
We love everybody,
hate everybody.

530
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,292
I get my feelings confused.

531
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,965
If you're not working
for any government...

532
00:43:12,037 --> 00:43:13,902
we know, or we find...

533
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:16,202
we don't find, you don't pay.

534
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:19,608
<i>Initially it was the
intention of the hijackers</i>

535
00:43:19,678 --> 00:43:23,079
<i>to bring the Lufthansa to
Munich International Airport</i>

536
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:25,343
<i>and then take onboard
the three prisoners</i>

537
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:28,682
<i>at the end of the runway, where
Captain Klausen took his plane</i>

538
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:31,314
<i>while an Arab held
a hand grenade at his head.</i>

539
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,789
Hey, Avner.

540
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:35,588
A Lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from Damascus.

541
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:38,128
The hijackers demanded the
release of three killers...

542
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:39,356
who survived Munich...

543
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:41,729
and the Germans said yes,
instantly.

544
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,997
<i>The Arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to Zagreb.</i>

545
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,004
Look.
They're free now.

546
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:48,838
They're in Libya.

547
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:59,143
No qualms about rejoicing
on their side, eh?

548
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:03,548
<i>The Israeli kills the Arabs</i>

549
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,489
<i>in Egypt, in Jordan,
in Lebanon, in Syria</i>

550
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,026
Look at them.

551
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:11,925
They're movie stars.

552
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:15,690
<i>But did you shoot any
of the Israeli hostages?</i>

553
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:21,372
<i>It's not important to say
if I killed Israelis or not.</i>

554
00:44:21,506 --> 00:44:23,474
We should go to Tripoli.

555
00:44:23,742 --> 00:44:25,039
Kill them.

556
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:26,938
We don't go
to Arab countries.

557
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:29,671
We stick to the names
we've been given.

558
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:33,944
Mahmoud Hamshari.

559
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:42,718
<i>Do you think,
looking back on it now</i>

560
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:45,422
<i>that you achieved anything
in the Munich operation?</i>

561
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,490
<i>We have made our voice heard
by the world.</i>

562
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,463
<i>Are those your words?</i>

563
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:57,438
<i>The same thing again.</i>

564
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:01,639
<i>They have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world</i>

565
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,681
<i>who has not been hearing
before.</i>

566
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:09,710
Well, I believe what
he meant by this is...

567
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:12,518
that now the world
will begin hearing us.

568
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,688
We are, for 24 years, the world's
largest refugee population.

569
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,856
Our homes taken from us.

570
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:24,698
Living in camps,
no future, no food.

571
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:27,101
Nothing decent
for our children.

572
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:30,799
And, so was the attack
in Munich justified?

573
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:34,611
The PLO condemns
attacks on civilians.

574
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:37,671
Though for 24 years...
Tell your newspaper that.

575
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:41,549
...our civilians have been attacked
by the Israelis day after day...

576
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,589
Tell them about all the years
and years of Palestinian blood...

577
00:45:44,689 --> 00:45:47,021
spilled by Israel.
And who mourns for us?

578
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,060
You know,
Israel just bombed...

579
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:51,595
two refugee camps
in Syria and Lebanon.

580
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:54,221
Tell them that...
200 people killed.

581
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:57,697
Right after Munich they did
this. It did not begin in Munich.

582
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:00,670
And where does it end?
How will it ever end?

583
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:16,115
I'm sorry, I need to use your
phone. I need to call my editor.

584
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:17,779
Yes, yes. Sorry.

585
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:21,584
You see it. It's by
the window. Thank you.

586
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,321
This way, please.

587
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:28,209
This man, we don't know
what he did specifically?

588
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,584
Hamshari arranged the attempted
assassination of Ben-Gurion...

589
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:33,385
in Copenhagen
a few years ago.

590
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,221
Now he organizes
for Fatah in France.

591
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:36,521
He organizes?
Yes.

592
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:38,425
In Tel Aviv they showed you
evidence for this?

593
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:39,986
Not evidence.
It was more...

594
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:41,896
this is the story
and I believe them.

595
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,490
Why? Don't you?

596
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,469
<i>It's a crisis, a war.
You don't have to always</i>

597
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:49,701
What? Be thinking?
Scrutinize. Yeah, think.

598
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:52,334
You want to wire Ephraim and
ask for evidence, you do it.

599
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,139
You're on your own.

600
00:48:54,913 --> 00:48:56,676
Okay, I'm done.
Good.

601
00:48:56,748 --> 00:48:58,579
Don't think about it.

602
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:01,244
Okay.

603
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:05,249
So, now, I turn it on.

604
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,885
He picks up the phone,
turns on the red light...

605
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:13,955
then I take out the key,
insert it...

606
00:49:14,532 --> 00:49:15,760
and turn.

607
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:21,991
So now we wait
for the red light.

608
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:52,263
Is the truck blocking the signal? No.

609
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,423
Will the remote still work?

610
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:13,917
Yeah, it's a powerful transmitter.
Go back to your position.

611
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:16,613
You can't start improvising
now. Go back to your corner.

612
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:19,020
Don't worry. It's okay.
It's going to work.

613
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:50,537
Stop!
Stop!

614
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,413
Abort.

615
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:41,191
Are we on or off?

616
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,681
<i>Mahmoud Hamshari?
Yes.</i>

617
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,727
He's at the hospital Cochin.

618
00:54:18,403 --> 00:54:21,031
I don't know how badly we
hurt him. They aren't saying.

619
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,834
Why did you put a firecracker
in that phone?

620
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:24,772
Because I didn't want
to blow up the building.

621
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:27,333
What do you want from me?
An Arab corpse.

622
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:30,779
Another $200,000, more or less,
to eliminate target number two.

623
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:33,373
Yeah, if he's been eliminated.
We should stick with guns.

624
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:35,419
No one notices a shooting.

625
00:54:35,486 --> 00:54:37,010
Bombs achieve
a double objective.

626
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:39,716
They eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists.

627
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:42,225
That only works
when the bombs work.

628
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:43,487
Lunch?

629
00:54:51,202 --> 00:54:54,137
<i>The Israeli embassy in London
was rocked by a letter bomb</i>

630
00:54:54,205 --> 00:54:56,298
<i>shortly after 9:30
this morning.</i>

631
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:58,808
<i>Dr. Ami Shachori was opening
his morning mail</i>

632
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:02,004
<i>when the envelope exploded,
killing him instantly.</i>

633
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:06,311
They discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in Earls Court.

634
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:09,579
<i>I guess they missed one.
Right after Hanukkah.</i>

635
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:13,414
I guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless.

636
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,791
They found other letters
in Israel, of course.

637
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:20,854
Canada, Argentina, Vienna,
Kinshasa, Paris, Brussels.

638
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:24,195
Dozens of them, mainly posted
in the Netherlands.

639
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:26,269
It's all Black September.

640
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:28,669
It's a response, then.

641
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:30,506
To Hamshari.

642
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:32,199
And to Zwaiter.

643
00:55:33,244 --> 00:55:35,712
They're talking to us.
We're in dialogue now.

644
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:38,615
Where are you?

645
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,451
I'm in New York,
following a lead.

646
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,512
I'll call again.

647
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,765
Are you going
to visit your father?

648
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,797
Why is this taking
so long?

649
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:03,429
It isn't fast.

650
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:06,473
We have the best hospitals
in the world.

651
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:11,442
When you were born, your father
was elsewhere. I was alone.

652
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,277
He was in prison.

653
00:56:16,854 --> 00:56:18,583
Should you be here?

654
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,719
Aren't you on duty?

655
00:56:21,325 --> 00:56:23,850
What are you going to do?
Turn me in?

656
00:56:25,663 --> 00:56:26,994
How is he?

657
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:30,060
I don't visit
your father so much.

658
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:32,694
Wilma lets him yell at her
all the time.

659
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,431
She depresses me.

660
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:41,343
How are you?

661
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,444
I'm managing.
Don't worry about me.

662
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,152
I'm proud
of what you are doing.

663
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:54,953
You don't know
what I'm doing.

664
00:57:05,069 --> 00:57:09,096
I look at you and I know
everything I need to know.

665
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:13,801
She is frighteningly
ugly.

666
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,376
She takes after you.

667
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,713
I want you to move,
for a time.

668
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:22,408
I've arranged a place for us
in Brooklyn.

669
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:24,716
I can't come back to Israel.
I don't know how long for...

670
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:25,915
New York?

671
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,084
I can see more of you
this way. New York City?

672
00:57:31,662 --> 00:57:35,029
But I have my family here,
and your parents.

673
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:38,727
You want my parents
to help raise her?

674
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:41,027
Look what they did to me.

675
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,266
Don't you want your daughter
to be an Israeli, Avner?

676
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:48,904
She'll always be an Israeli.

677
00:57:49,313 --> 00:57:52,214
Not in Brooklyn. She'll
just be another homeless Jew.

678
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:54,717
I can't do what I'm doing
if I can't see you.

679
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:56,514
What are you doing?

680
00:57:58,322 --> 00:58:01,120
Don't do it then, Avner.
This is our home.

681
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:04,058
You're the only home
I ever had.

682
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,021
What?

683
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:09,359
This is so corny.

684
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:11,833
It wasn't easy for
me to say that. I bet.

685
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,063
Don't laugh at me then.

686
00:58:14,138 --> 00:58:16,902
Why did I have to marry
a sentimentalist?

687
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:18,874
You're ruining my life.

688
00:58:19,277 --> 00:58:21,268
Your mother's teasing me.

689
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:37,025
Look at the waistline bulge
on that guy.

690
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:40,089
Look at that.
Think he might be armed, eh?

691
00:58:40,598 --> 00:58:42,361
As are the Russians.

692
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,963
It's definitely him.

693
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:47,166
Hussein Abad al-Chir.

694
00:58:47,705 --> 00:58:50,265
His room is next to
Israeli newlyweds.

695
00:58:50,908 --> 00:58:53,240
They married in Cyprus
because she's not Jewish.

696
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,744
A mixed marriage.

697
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:56,302
<i>A shande for the goyim.</i>

698
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,644
Yeah, okay. But let's
try not to blow them up.

699
00:58:59,216 --> 00:59:02,014
The KGB brings him home
every night after dark.

700
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:04,554
He turns on the light,
gets undressed...

701
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:08,080
turns off the light, gets
into bed, we blow up the bed.

702
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:13,286
I knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed.

703
00:59:13,364 --> 00:59:16,629
So every night he slept
on the floor of his closet.

704
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:19,331
He still does, every night.

705
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:21,570
Sleeps in closets.

706
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,698
Now if al-Chir sleeps in
his closet, we're in trouble.

707
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:28,336
But if he gets in the bed,
his weight arms the device...

708
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:30,846
it closes the circuit.

709
00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:34,149
Then we hit the remote.

710
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:42,785
Okay.

711
00:59:43,394 --> 00:59:45,191
Okay, we're good.
We're good, let's go.

712
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:51,700
Careful.

713
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,265
I've checked into the room
next door.

714
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:02,202
Why?
There are balconies.

715
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,441
When he gets into bed...

716
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:07,450
I give the signal
by switching off the light.

717
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:11,053
And if the bomb's too powerful
and you're in the next room?

718
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:13,548
Well, that won't happen.

719
01:00:13,891 --> 01:00:15,085
Right?

720
01:00:15,593 --> 01:00:16,787
Robert?

721
01:00:17,428 --> 01:00:19,055
Robert?
Robert?

722
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:21,798
It won't. No.

723
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:23,856
Okay.

724
01:00:25,569 --> 01:00:26,729
Avner.

725
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,406
Boy or girl?

726
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:33,004
A girl.

727
01:00:34,245 --> 01:00:35,542
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

728
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:41,010
News from Paris.

729
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,653
Dr. Hamshari succumbed
to his wounds.

730
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:50,221
<i>So, again, mazel tov, Avner.</i>

731
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:46,874
Steve, shut up.

732
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,494
Hey.

733
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:29,323
Good evening.

734
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:31,951
Good evening.

735
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:33,620
Beautiful night.

736
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:35,597
Beautiful night, yeah.

737
01:02:37,368 --> 01:02:40,235
- Where are you from? I can't place...
- Dizengoff.

738
01:02:40,304 --> 01:02:42,670
Yes?
I wouldn't have guessed it.

739
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:46,167
I thought perhaps a Swede.

740
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:51,312
I taught in Sweden,
Near Eastern languages.

741
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:53,009
Really?

742
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:56,611
Teaching Lebanese immigrant
women how to clean houses.

743
01:02:56,687 --> 01:02:58,086
In Swedish.

744
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:08,064
Were you here last night?

745
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:11,524
No. Just checked in.
Just arrived.

746
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:14,733
Don't plan to sleep.

747
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:17,364
They keep at it all night.

748
01:03:17,942 --> 01:03:19,603
There, for hours.

749
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:22,075
Take a sleeping pill.
That's okay.

750
01:03:22,146 --> 01:03:23,704
I can sleep through anything.
Are you sure?

751
01:03:23,781 --> 01:03:24,975
You don't want to borrow
one of mine?

752
01:03:25,049 --> 01:03:26,710
Thank you very much. It's okay. Really?

753
01:03:26,784 --> 01:03:27,842
Yes.

754
01:03:27,952 --> 01:03:29,783
So, good night.

755
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:32,213
Pleasant dreams.

756
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:22,095
Wait for the signal.

757
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:24,664
Wait for Avner's light
to go out.

758
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:26,268
Go! Go! Go!

759
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:47,317
Oh, my God!
Help!

760
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:51,761
Oh, my eyes.
My eyes, I can't see.

761
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:53,827
Can someone help me?

762
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:55,489
I can't see.

763
01:05:55,866 --> 01:05:56,855
Avner!

764
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:03,132
Please! Oh, my God!

765
01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:06,174
I can't see.

766
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:09,572
Can you see?
Yes.

767
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:11,011
The stairs are that way.
Okay.

768
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:13,311
Go that way.
Come on. Let's go!

769
01:06:15,452 --> 01:06:17,716
<i>It was much too powerful.
Stop it.</i>

770
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:19,619
<i>You could've blown up
innocent... Target number three.</i>

771
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,850
<i>Target number three
was not in doubt.</i>

772
01:06:20,924 --> 01:06:23,256
<i>The ceiling in the lobby
cracked. You nearly demolished</i>

773
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:24,851
Avner might have been killed.

774
01:06:24,962 --> 01:06:26,486
The plastique was not
what I asked for.

775
01:06:26,563 --> 01:06:28,258
It couldn't have been
the grade I specified.

776
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,357
Someone changed the marking
on the explosive.

777
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,401
What if someone changed
the marking?

778
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,460
What do you mean?
Louis provided the plastique.

779
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:37,062
Avner, Louis provided
the explosives?

780
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:39,632
Yes. Why?
Why are we trusting him?

781
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,536
We have no idea who he is.

782
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:44,610
He's finding our targets.
Yes, but...

783
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,911
But without him,
we'd be nowhere on this!

784
01:06:46,984 --> 01:06:50,351
The plastique was much more
powerful than what I asked for.

785
01:06:50,954 --> 01:06:53,923
Someone changed the label.
I could have killed you.

786
01:06:54,024 --> 01:06:56,322
For all we know,
Louis works for the PLO.

787
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,860
They're using us to do
internal housecleaning.

788
01:06:58,996 --> 01:06:59,985
That's bullshit.

789
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:02,429
Hey,
whose fishing boat is this?

790
01:07:08,238 --> 01:07:09,933
Louis arranged it.

791
01:07:42,606 --> 01:07:44,870
There was nothing wrong
with the explosive.

792
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:48,036
Bomb makers are nervous,
which is understandable.

793
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:49,339
Fear makes them sloppy...

794
01:07:49,446 --> 01:07:50,811
There's nothing wrong
with my bomb maker.

795
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:53,078
It's your explosives.

796
01:07:54,184 --> 01:07:56,618
We found three more
names for you.

797
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,554
Three?
Yes, three.

798
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:04,090
Thought you'd be pleased.
I am.

799
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:06,587
Who?

800
01:08:07,364 --> 01:08:11,198
Kemal Adwan, Kamal Nasser,
and Abu Youssef.

801
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:14,069
Adwan and Abu Youssef.

802
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:16,534
Where?
Lebanon.

803
01:08:17,374 --> 01:08:19,069
They're in Beirut.

804
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:21,337
Adwan, Nasser, Youssef.

805
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:24,047
Serious characters, huh?

806
01:08:24,114 --> 01:08:25,775
Extremely serious.

807
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:29,784
Smile, Mr. Storsch.
It's a second Christmas.

808
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:34,490
I'd like to pay you
a little extra for this.

809
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:36,219
These three names.

810
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:39,628
$600,000.

811
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:44,966
<i>Monsieur Storsch, my group</i>

812
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:46,627
we don't care much
for governments...

813
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:48,170
any governments.

814
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,103
We don't work with
or for them.

815
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:52,607
That's an absolute condition
of my theory.

816
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:54,234
You understand?

817
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:57,303
If I learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt...

818
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:00,748
to buy our acquiescence in
your sharing my information...

819
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:04,548
with, let us say,
CIA or Ml6 or Mossad...

820
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:07,647
I don't work for MI6 or CIA...
You have no idea who you work for.

821
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:08,918
Trust me. You don't.

822
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:13,563
Lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable...

823
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:15,630
and unhappy.

824
01:09:16,934 --> 01:09:20,028
Let me buy you a drink.
No. You save your money.

825
01:09:20,103 --> 01:09:22,435
At these prices,
you're going to need it.

826
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,772
<i>It's obviously
significant information.</i>

827
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:29,835
Abu Youssef is like number three
in the whole Palestinian network.

828
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:31,840
It's like Arafat, Habash,
and then him.

829
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:33,883
Of course he's significant.
Thanks for the instruction...

830
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,782
and enthusiasm. He's the
brains of the fedayeen.

831
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:37,945
I know who he is.
Next to Salameh...

832
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:40,382
Abu Youssef is the worst guy
we're after, right?

833
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,482
And Adwan, he plans all the
actions in the West Bank, right?

834
01:09:44,428 --> 01:09:46,794
We get the significance.
These are serious targets.

835
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:48,455
We want to go to Beirut.
No.

836
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:50,056
You keep away
from the Arab countries.

837
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:52,499
Mossad and the army
will take care of it.

838
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:54,537
What is this contraption?

839
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:57,437
You can't send the army.
We won't allow it.

840
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:00,504
You won't allow it?

841
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,703
Our source doesn't know
we're Mossad.

842
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:04,178
You aren't Mossad.

843
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:06,875
If commandos go to Beirut,
our source will cut us off.

844
01:10:07,017 --> 01:10:10,043
Why don't you and I go for a
walk and talk about this, alone?

845
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,485
The food will get cold.

846
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:13,614
We have to go to Beirut.
We're good at this.

847
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,521
This is our information,
this is our job.

848
01:10:15,592 --> 01:10:17,958
That's touching
in a juvenile sort of way.

849
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:19,586
Listen.
You're doing reasonably well.

850
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:21,392
Reasonably? You're
spending a lot of money.

851
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:22,898
Well, we expected that.

852
01:10:25,302 --> 01:10:28,294
Lots of people in Mossad
don't know about you.

853
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:29,905
No one knows.

854
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,634
So everyone's asking,
"Who's killing the fedayeen?"

855
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:34,734
"Is it our guys?
Why weren't we told?"

856
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,972
Big egos. Lots of screaming.

857
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:40,974
I can maybe include
one or two of you...

858
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:43,519
but excluding Mossad
or the army is impossible.

859
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:44,918
Accept it.

860
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:47,318
We will,
but our source won't.

861
01:10:48,425 --> 01:10:50,154
Who is your source?

862
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:52,653
It's time you told me.

863
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:54,754
That, by the way, is not
a request. It's an order.

864
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:56,822
You can't order him.
He doesn't work for you.

865
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,425
Shut up. I pay you.
You work for me.

866
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:02,766
I work for a metal box in a
bank in Geneva. The box pays me.

867
01:11:02,873 --> 01:11:05,808
You want to find it empty? I
want you to let us do our work!

868
01:11:05,876 --> 01:11:07,867
What's the matter with you?

869
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:10,708
With all of you?
Grow up and do it quick.

870
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:13,305
This is not a game,
a fucking game.

871
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:16,179
Who has the source? Where are
you getting your information?

872
01:11:16,253 --> 01:11:18,346
Give me his goddamn number!

873
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:21,251
I hope the old lady next door
enjoyed that.

874
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:24,521
She's a little deaf but I doubt
she had any trouble hearing you.

875
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,090
Give me the source
and we'll let you take part.

876
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:32,330
Let us go to Beirut.

877
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:36,429
After Beirut, we'll use our source
to find the remaining targets.

878
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:38,534
Let us do our job.

879
01:12:22,185 --> 01:12:24,847
A lot of manpower
to shoot three guys.

880
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:55,117
Ehud Barak.
Daniel.

881
01:13:31,988 --> 01:13:33,012
Go!

882
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,857
Where the fuck is he?

883
01:14:14,631 --> 01:14:15,757
Door!

884
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,102
Let's go!
Go!

885
01:14:26,109 --> 01:14:27,098
Go! Go!

886
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:30,335
Go!

887
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:10,251
It's him!
Don't shoot! No!

888
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:29,833
Fedayeen!

889
01:15:37,113 --> 01:15:38,137
Go!

890
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:46,174
My papa would like to meet you. Papa?

891
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:49,351
My papa.
He runs our little group.

892
01:16:49,686 --> 01:16:51,551
I thought you ran the group.

893
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:54,048
Everybody works for someone.

894
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:57,421
I wasn't in Beirut.

895
01:16:57,894 --> 01:16:59,862
Well, someone was there.

896
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:03,387
The Israeli army, according
to every newspaper on Earth.

897
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,195
But you stayed away...

898
01:17:05,268 --> 01:17:08,567
after you paid so extravagantly
for the information.

899
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:11,298
I don't like to keep
my papa waiting.

900
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:13,603
I need to tell my people
where I'm going.

901
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:15,507
You don't know
where you're going.

902
01:17:15,578 --> 01:17:18,479
And you'll need
to wear this.

903
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,617
Forget it, Louis.
That's just crazy.

904
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:23,276
We're done here.

905
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:30,885
Shit.

906
01:17:31,728 --> 01:17:32,717
Wait!

907
01:17:34,197 --> 01:17:35,186
Wait!

908
01:18:21,277 --> 01:18:22,642
We're here.

909
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:44,427
Papa!

910
01:19:00,016 --> 01:19:01,005
He's over there.

911
01:19:14,564 --> 01:19:16,589
Louis says you're a cook.

912
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:18,757
I know how to cook, yeah.

913
01:19:19,235 --> 01:19:20,634
You help me?

914
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:27,736
Bring these there.

915
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:37,249
No, no. Don't wash. No, no. They
will taste like boiled sponge.

916
01:19:37,554 --> 01:19:39,522
But then why put them
in the sink?

917
01:19:39,589 --> 01:19:42,080
If the juices spurt out,
it's a big mess.

918
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:44,786
The whole kitchen
will smell like piss.

919
01:19:46,696 --> 01:19:48,323
Peel off the fat.

920
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,699
Let me see your hands.

921
01:19:56,673 --> 01:19:58,641
Too big for a good cook.

922
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:01,309
That was my problem, too.
I had been a master...

923
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:04,778
but I have thick, stupid,
butcher's hands just like yours.

924
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:08,783
Well, we are tragic men.
Butcher's hands, gentle souls.

925
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:24,792
These are going to be
too sour to eat.

926
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:28,334
Skin them and prick them,
boil them in sugar.

927
01:20:29,105 --> 01:20:32,370
A little torture, and
you'll see how nice they are.

928
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:36,504
You call me "Papa."
I can't do that.

929
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:38,672
No?
I have a papa already.

930
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,750
You are devoted to him?

931
01:20:43,386 --> 01:20:45,684
Am I here because of
what happened in Beirut?

932
01:20:45,755 --> 01:20:48,246
Your papa must be
proud of his son.

933
01:20:49,826 --> 01:20:52,659
We'll pick a few.
Let the rest ripen.

934
01:20:53,396 --> 01:20:55,261
There are so many people
to feed, but...

935
01:20:55,331 --> 01:20:57,265
But they are your family.
So you have to feed them.

936
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:00,359
Yes. We don't work
with governments.

937
01:21:00,837 --> 01:21:02,464
<i>Louis said. But</i>

938
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:06,497
But you did what you did because
you have to feed your family.

939
01:21:25,232 --> 01:21:27,097
I blew up trains,
bridges...

940
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:29,965
and trucks full of Germans
during the war.

941
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:36,335
My brothers were killed, my papa
and my sister were both hanged.

942
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,638
She was a young girl.

943
01:21:38,712 --> 01:21:42,148
Papa, the guest doesn't
want to hear your war stories.

944
01:21:42,882 --> 01:21:46,613
We paid this price, so Vichy
scum could be replaced...

945
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:48,517
by Gaullist scum...

946
01:21:48,588 --> 01:21:52,115
and the Nazis could be
replaced by Stalin and America.

947
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:54,726
We stay away
from governments.

948
01:21:56,129 --> 01:21:57,596
We say grace?

949
01:21:58,098 --> 01:22:00,328
Maybe our guest
could lead us.

950
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:06,671
No, no, no.
It's not required.

951
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:18,478
Our Father, who gives us
obedient and respectful clients...

952
01:22:18,718 --> 01:22:21,186
who obey the rules according
to which our business thrives...

953
01:22:24,157 --> 01:22:26,318
...whose prevarications
and deceptions...

954
01:22:37,404 --> 01:22:40,066
In my despair
I fathered madmen...

955
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:45,034
who dress like factory workers,
but never do manual labor...

956
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,271
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit...

957
01:22:48,348 --> 01:22:51,749
about Algerians
and who love nothing...

958
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:53,308
not Algerians or French...

959
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:56,048
or flesh and blood,
or anything living.

960
01:22:56,956 --> 01:23:00,756
So I have sympathy for a man
who can say, "I have a papa"...

961
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:02,653
and who does what he must
for his family.

962
01:23:09,602 --> 01:23:11,229
I will say grace.

963
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:22,371
There's some opinion
you should be punished...

964
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:24,610
for what happened
in Beirut.

965
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:26,909
We didn't know
so many would die.

966
01:23:26,986 --> 01:23:30,444
I'm in business with death.
Do you think I'm squeamish?

967
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:36,257
The world has been rough
with you, with your tribe.

968
01:23:38,565 --> 01:23:41,659
It's right to respond roughly
to such treatment.

969
01:23:43,303 --> 01:23:47,501
You pay well and you pay promptly,
so we'll continue together.

970
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:52,405
But no more infractions.
Thank you. You have my word.

971
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:11,286
A few andouillettes
and boudins noirs...

972
01:24:12,532 --> 01:24:16,730
black blood sausage and a
Loire cheese, Selles-sur-Cher.

973
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:20,630
We cover it in ash to
preserve it. Thank you.

974
01:24:22,175 --> 01:24:24,268
You could have been my son.

975
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,072
But you're not.
Remember that.

976
01:24:31,518 --> 01:24:35,545
We'll do business,
but you aren't family.

977
01:25:24,304 --> 01:25:26,329
I have a new name for you.

978
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:29,599
I want Ali Hassan Salameh.

979
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:33,470
No.

980
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:36,911
You know where he is. You
know where all the names are.

981
01:25:36,983 --> 01:25:39,645
Salameh.
Untouchable.

982
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:43,218
Salameh.

983
01:25:51,297 --> 01:25:52,787
Zaid Muchassi.

984
01:25:56,536 --> 01:25:59,232
Zaid Muchassi is in Athens
in two weeks.

985
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:02,364
Not one of our names.
Nevertheless.

986
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:05,134
He is Black September's
KGB contact.

987
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:07,745
Hussein al-Chir
was the KGB contact.

988
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:11,215
<i>Yes. But you put a bomb under
Monsieur al-Chir's bed in Cyprus</i>

989
01:26:11,284 --> 01:26:14,481
and now he's defunct.
Muchassi is his replacement.

990
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:17,913
I hear he's much tougher
than his predecessor.

991
01:26:23,863 --> 01:26:27,321
We offer Muchassi's
whereabouts at the new rate.

992
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:31,092
What new rate?
Three names for $600,000...

993
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:33,695
is $200,000 for one name.

994
01:26:38,378 --> 01:26:41,472
I need you to find me
a place to work in Athens.

995
01:26:41,748 --> 01:26:44,615
Of course. Safe house.

996
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,770
Is this Louis's idea
of a joke?

997
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:13,274
I've had nightmares
that looked like this.

998
01:27:15,181 --> 01:27:18,082
So when they explode, they toss
little white balls of phosphorus...

999
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:21,484
here all around his room. Each
ball, it's like a little sun.

1000
01:27:21,554 --> 01:27:23,522
It burns at around
5,000 degrees.

1001
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:26,457
So the air catches fire.

1002
01:27:26,893 --> 01:27:29,293
Everything in the vicinity
melts.

1003
01:27:29,362 --> 01:27:31,296
Now, the bad news is
they are grenades...

1004
01:27:31,364 --> 01:27:34,561
so I modified them to use
with a remote detonator.

1005
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:36,835
I also should mention
that they're quite old...

1006
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:37,892
like World War II.

1007
01:27:38,371 --> 01:27:41,431
Only four were viable.
We should dump the rest.

1008
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:45,239
There's a porter at the hotel
where Muchassi's staying.

1009
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:47,472
He's gonna let us in the room
when Muchassi goes out.

1010
01:27:47,547 --> 01:27:50,607
Hey. Who provided these
prehistoric explosives?

1011
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:53,777
Louis.
Yeah. I'll thank him for that.

1012
01:28:08,101 --> 01:28:09,329
Tallyho.

1013
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:33,425
Stop! Stop!

1014
01:28:33,493 --> 01:28:37,156
PLO! PLO!
ETA! ETA!

1015
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:39,391
Put the gun down
or we'll shoot.

1016
01:28:39,465 --> 01:28:42,298
Basque! Basque!

1017
01:28:44,604 --> 01:28:47,129
Okay.

1018
01:28:54,947 --> 01:28:57,814
Put the gun down!
Put it down!

1019
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:06,557
Put it down.

1020
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:34,415
Which French? Louis?
Who are you? English?

1021
01:29:35,421 --> 01:29:39,221
Basque. ETA.
Red Army Faction.

1022
01:29:39,859 --> 01:29:43,260
He's ANC.
African. African.

1023
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:47,698
We are from Amman.
I'm Ali.

1024
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:52,635
Said. George. Abed.

1025
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:56,706
We paid for two nights.

1026
01:29:58,111 --> 01:29:59,874
He said it was safe.

1027
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:04,783
He told us the same.
Yes. Safe house.

1028
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,084
Yes.

1029
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:12,580
So we're safe?

1030
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,752
Safe.

1031
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,091
Everyone is safe.

1032
01:31:26,332 --> 01:31:29,995
Eventually the Arab states
will rise against Israel.

1033
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:34,299
They don't like Palestinians,
but they hate the Jews more.

1034
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:37,168
It won't be like 1967.

1035
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:41,111
The rest of the world will see by
then what the Israelis do to us.

1036
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:45,014
They won't help when Egypt
and Syria attack. Even Jordan.

1037
01:31:45,718 --> 01:31:47,811
Israel will cease
to exist.

1038
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:52,580
What?

1039
01:31:53,726 --> 01:31:57,753
This is a dream. You can't take
back a country you never had.

1040
01:31:58,331 --> 01:31:59,992
You sound like a Jew.
Fuck you.

1041
01:32:00,066 --> 01:32:03,126
I'm the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know.

1042
01:32:03,202 --> 01:32:05,432
You people have nothing
to bargain with.

1043
01:32:06,038 --> 01:32:07,630
You'll never get
the land back.

1044
01:32:07,707 --> 01:32:11,336
You'll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for Palestine.

1045
01:32:11,444 --> 01:32:14,004
We have a lot of children.
They'll have children.

1046
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,570
So we can wait forever.

1047
01:32:15,648 --> 01:32:19,209
And if we need to, we can make
the whole planet unsafe for Jews.

1048
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:21,446
You kill Jews and the world
feels bad for them...

1049
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,920
and thinks you are animals.
Yes.

1050
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,050
But then the world will see how
they've made us into animals.

1051
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:31,119
They'll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages.

1052
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:35,931
You are Arabs. There are lots
of places for Arabs.

1053
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,661
You're a Jew sympathizer.

1054
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:43,639
All you Germans,
you're too soft on Israel.

1055
01:32:44,343 --> 01:32:47,779
Well, you give us money, but
you feel guilty about Hitler.

1056
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:50,179
And the Jews exploit
that guilt.

1057
01:32:50,983 --> 01:32:53,213
My father didn't gas
any Jews.

1058
01:32:57,123 --> 01:33:00,024
Tell me something, Ali.
What?

1059
01:33:01,794 --> 01:33:04,524
Do you really miss
your father's olive trees?

1060
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:09,461
Do you honestly think you have to
get back all that... that nothing?

1061
01:33:10,069 --> 01:33:11,832
That chalky soil
and stone huts.

1062
01:33:11,904 --> 01:33:14,771
Is that what you really
want for your children?

1063
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,603
It absolutely is.

1064
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:22,246
It will take a hundred years,
but we'll win.

1065
01:33:23,482 --> 01:33:26,940
How long did it take the Jews
to get their own country?

1066
01:33:27,586 --> 01:33:30,555
How long did it take
the Germans to make Germany?

1067
01:33:30,623 --> 01:33:32,488
And look how well
that worked out.

1068
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:35,493
You don't know what it is
not to have a home.

1069
01:33:35,761 --> 01:33:38,559
That's why you European Reds
don't get it.

1070
01:33:39,165 --> 01:33:42,965
You say, "It's nothing," but
you have a home to come back to.

1071
01:33:43,936 --> 01:33:46,700
ETA, ANC, IRA...

1072
01:33:46,772 --> 01:33:49,900
we all pretend we care about
your international revolution...

1073
01:33:49,976 --> 01:33:51,637
but we don't care.

1074
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:54,410
We want to be nations.

1075
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:57,610
Home is everything.

1076
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:41,091
No, no, no.
No, I watch.

1077
01:34:42,228 --> 01:34:44,594
You only take money
enclosed in papers, yes?

1078
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:45,994
Of course.

1079
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:40,349
Look there.

1080
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:44,314
Here they come
in their pumpkin coach.

1081
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:50,118
The Russians and...

1082
01:35:53,299 --> 01:35:54,823
Cinderella.

1083
01:36:14,253 --> 01:36:18,087
Do we detonate if the other
Arabs go into the room with him?

1084
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:28,361
Why are the Russians waiting?

1085
01:36:29,335 --> 01:36:33,294
Why don't they leave?
They are waiting.

1086
01:36:36,008 --> 01:36:39,808
We are waiting. Stay calm.
Hey, I'm calm.

1087
01:36:51,624 --> 01:36:54,252
He's in his room. Do it.
Is he alone?

1088
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:58,391
How do we know if he's alone?
Just flip the switch. Do it.

1089
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,069
I don't understand it.
What's wrong?

1090
01:37:07,139 --> 01:37:08,936
It's a piece of shit.

1091
01:37:10,176 --> 01:37:12,804
What? Fuck! Not again.
Wait, wait.

1092
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:16,778
Where's the explosion?
It should've exploded by now.

1093
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:19,243
What's gone wrong?
It's another malfunction.

1094
01:37:19,318 --> 01:37:20,342
You know what?

1095
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,284
Or maybe it's delayed...
He has fucked up again!

1096
01:37:22,354 --> 01:37:24,686
Or maybe it could still blow
up. This is a waste of time!

1097
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:26,987
Careful with that stuff,
Hans.

1098
01:37:32,998 --> 01:37:34,522
Hans!
Hans, what are you doing?

1099
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,363
Hans, get back here!

1100
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:42,934
Hey, hey!
What is he doing?

1101
01:37:43,008 --> 01:37:44,600
Hans. No, no.

1102
01:38:12,738 --> 01:38:14,968
So how long
is he going to be?

1103
01:38:16,175 --> 01:38:17,699
Maybe one hour.

1104
01:39:18,771 --> 01:39:19,965
I know you.

1105
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,935
Stop!

1106
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:46,330
Get in! Head down!

1107
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:22,765
Ali? Ali? Ali?

1108
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,243
Are you incapable of making
something that works?

1109
01:40:32,311 --> 01:40:34,404
Shut up! You shut up!

1110
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,038
Does anybody speak Greek?

1111
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:38,447
Shut him up!
Did we kill a Russian?

1112
01:40:38,517 --> 01:40:40,451
That's not good! Where
did you get your training?

1113
01:40:40,519 --> 01:40:43,511
Every single bomb, every
fucking one, is fucked up.

1114
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:45,489
I was not trained to do this!

1115
01:40:45,557 --> 01:40:48,856
I was trained to dismantle
bombs, not to build them!

1116
01:40:51,597 --> 01:40:52,962
Holy shit.

1117
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:58,360
Shin Bet wanted bomb dismantlers.
They picked me from the army.

1118
01:40:58,704 --> 01:41:00,194
A toy maker.
Give me some money.

1119
01:41:00,272 --> 01:41:02,832
They figured I was good
with small machines.

1120
01:41:03,709 --> 01:41:08,146
But then after Munich, they asked
if I could build bombs instead.

1121
01:41:09,348 --> 01:41:10,838
So I said yes.

1122
01:41:17,222 --> 01:41:20,385
Come on. Here.

1123
01:41:29,468 --> 01:41:31,834
<i>The three went to the
side of the customs hall</i>

1124
01:41:31,904 --> 01:41:34,930
<i>took out pieces of their rifles,
and quickly assembled them.</i>

1125
01:41:35,007 --> 01:41:38,204
<i>Then they threw hand grenades into
the long queues of passengers</i>

1126
01:41:38,277 --> 01:41:42,270
<i>waiting to clear passport
control and began automatic fire.</i>

1127
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,577
<i>It was all over
in a matter of minutes.</i>

1128
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:46,447
<i>And the firing
was indiscriminate.</i>

1129
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:47,951
Salameh is in London.

1130
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:54,516
He goes there periodically
to meet with his CIA contact.

1131
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,818
His what?
Salameh works for the CIA.

1132
01:41:59,932 --> 01:42:01,194
Bullshit.

1133
01:42:01,366 --> 01:42:03,800
Salameh guarantees
that Black September...

1134
01:42:03,869 --> 01:42:05,632
won't touch
American diplomats.

1135
01:42:05,704 --> 01:42:08,639
In exchange, the CIA
gives him lots of money.

1136
01:42:08,774 --> 01:42:10,935
And they don't ask
what he uses it for.

1137
01:42:12,945 --> 01:42:15,209
Did he tell them
about Munich in advance?

1138
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,907
Did the CIA
know about Munich?

1139
01:42:16,982 --> 01:42:19,450
The CIA didn't even know
Black September existed...

1140
01:42:19,518 --> 01:42:21,042
before Munich.

1141
01:42:22,387 --> 01:42:24,548
<i>One of the guerrillas was shot
through the head</i>

1142
01:42:24,623 --> 01:42:25,851
<i>by a ricochet bullet.</i>

1143
01:42:25,924 --> 01:42:28,415
<i>A second was blown up
by his own hand grenade.</i>

1144
01:42:28,494 --> 01:42:30,587
Since then,
he's been busy.

1145
01:42:31,463 --> 01:42:32,794
Hasn't he?

1146
01:42:34,132 --> 01:42:36,430
All manner
of costly exercises.

1147
01:42:36,935 --> 01:42:39,165
Shooting tourists
in the Athens airport...

1148
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:41,638
blowing up pharmacies
in Amsterdam...

1149
01:42:41,707 --> 01:42:44,767
and that Mossad agent
in Barcelona before that.

1150
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,938
Europe hasn't been this interesting
since Napoleon marched to Moscow.

1151
01:42:50,849 --> 01:42:52,976
Do you have to
do that here?

1152
01:42:53,685 --> 01:42:57,416
Salameh is in London.
For the usual price.

1153
01:43:06,665 --> 01:43:09,156
We followed him from
his doctor to his hotel.

1154
01:43:09,234 --> 01:43:11,532
He's here for eye treatment.
Salameh. You saw him?

1155
01:43:11,603 --> 01:43:12,900
You followed him?
Yes.

1156
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:15,166
Wearing sunglasses in the
rain. Why didn't you shoot him?

1157
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,639
There were bodyguards.
Civilians.

1158
01:43:16,742 --> 01:43:17,936
Were they armed?
Yes.

1159
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:20,410
Well then, they're not
civilians. I'd have done it...

1160
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:22,379
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

1161
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,847
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

1162
01:43:24,917 --> 01:43:26,646
Maybe that's why
we never let you do it.

1163
01:43:26,718 --> 01:43:28,948
We only go after our targets.
Since when?

1164
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:30,716
I mean, why are we worried
about that now?

1165
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:33,883
Do you have any idea
how many laws we've broken?

1166
01:43:34,192 --> 01:43:37,491
It's time to stop your
agonizing. It's counterproductive.

1167
01:43:37,563 --> 01:43:40,999
Including, incidentally, the
laws of the state of Israel...

1168
01:43:41,066 --> 01:43:42,363
which has no death penalty.

1169
01:43:42,434 --> 01:43:45,028
<i>You know what your problem is,
habibi?</i>

1170
01:43:45,137 --> 01:43:46,604
You're disorientated.

1171
01:43:46,672 --> 01:43:49,140
Because the guys we're killing
are dressed in expensive suits...

1172
01:43:49,207 --> 01:43:51,573
and this is London and
not some ugly Arab village.

1173
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:53,338
I'm not disoriented.

1174
01:43:53,412 --> 01:43:55,880
I'm keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself...

1175
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:57,040
that in spite of...

1176
01:43:57,115 --> 01:43:58,878
But it's the same old war
we're fighting...

1177
01:43:58,951 --> 01:44:00,213
I'm still, at least in
principle, a human being.

1178
01:44:00,285 --> 01:44:01,582
Over the same old
scrap of desert!

1179
01:44:01,653 --> 01:44:04,053
It's just we've brought our war
to Copenhagen and Kensington...

1180
01:44:04,122 --> 01:44:06,613
and it's not like these European
anti-Semites don't deserve that.

1181
01:44:06,692 --> 01:44:09,957
Unless we learn to act like
them, we will never defeat them.

1182
01:44:10,028 --> 01:44:12,258
We act like them
all the time.

1183
01:44:12,397 --> 01:44:14,627
What, you think the
Palestinians invented bloodshed?

1184
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:17,168
How do you think we got control
of the land? By being nice?

1185
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:19,635
Somebody pull down this man's
pants. See if he's circumcised.

1186
01:44:19,705 --> 01:44:21,229
I think we have a double agent
in our midst.

1187
01:44:21,306 --> 01:44:23,968
Don't you dare accuse
me of that! Stop it!

1188
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:26,943
My son died in '67, you
foul-mouthed son of a bitch.

1189
01:44:27,012 --> 01:44:29,242
Everything you can ask,
I've done for Israel.

1190
01:44:29,314 --> 01:44:32,374
Ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful.

1191
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:34,976
Why, it's not distasteful to you? No.

1192
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:39,047
'Cause the only blood that
matters to me is Jewish blood.

1193
01:44:41,627 --> 01:44:44,494
Nice job, eh.
Nice job leading.

1194
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:48,759
If the bodyguards are armed,
we kill them.

1195
01:44:48,834 --> 01:44:51,564
They're armed.
Well, then we kill them!

1196
01:45:38,216 --> 01:45:39,308
Taxi!

1197
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:40,440
Taxi!

1198
01:46:24,229 --> 01:46:26,925
Roger Burke, you ugly fuck!
What are you doing in London?

1199
01:46:26,998 --> 01:46:28,932
Get your hands off me.

1200
01:46:29,101 --> 01:46:31,262
Put them up. Put them
up, you fat, wet puss!

1201
01:46:31,336 --> 01:46:33,099
Let's show these limey fucks
what we're made of.

1202
01:46:33,171 --> 01:46:35,867
<i>Hey, wait a minute! Who the fuck...
Who do you think this is then?</i>

1203
01:46:35,941 --> 01:46:37,238
Roger Burke.
Who do you think this is?

1204
01:46:37,309 --> 01:46:40,142
No, you idiot. That is not...
Lay off him, asshole.

1205
01:46:40,245 --> 01:46:42,907
That's not him. Come on.
It's Roger Burke.

1206
01:46:43,615 --> 01:46:44,775
I'm sorry about my friend,
you know?

1207
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:48,183
He's a fucked-up, belligerent guy
with a serious drinking problem.

1208
01:46:48,253 --> 01:46:51,711
Hey, come here.
Lose it.

1209
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:54,088
Come on. Calm down!
Hey, calm down.

1210
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,684
Hey, come here!
Calm down!

1211
01:46:59,331 --> 01:47:02,858
Back off. Get back!

1212
01:47:02,934 --> 01:47:05,232
Back off! Back off!
Fuck off!

1213
01:47:05,303 --> 01:47:06,770
It's me. All right!

1214
01:47:06,838 --> 01:47:09,068
All right. Come on.
Fuck off!

1215
01:47:09,508 --> 01:47:11,874
It's me, Roger, Orrin!
Come on.

1216
01:47:11,943 --> 01:47:16,277
It's me. Remember me? Sorry.
It's all right.

1217
01:47:17,382 --> 01:47:19,612
You should have ducked,
Roger!

1218
01:47:26,491 --> 01:47:28,083
Fucking Americans!

1219
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,923
What the fuck is that?
Was it Salameh?

1220
01:47:29,995 --> 01:47:32,156
Yes, of course
it was fucking Salameh!

1221
01:47:53,985 --> 01:47:56,510
I take it she'd
eat you up a bit, huh?

1222
01:47:57,889 --> 01:47:59,481
You old dog.

1223
01:47:59,758 --> 01:48:01,521
He's got some ideas.

1224
01:48:02,894 --> 01:48:05,385
Oh, the American bloke?
Aren't we all?

1225
01:48:05,831 --> 01:48:08,561
So you've heard these rumors?
These are wild stories.

1226
01:48:08,633 --> 01:48:10,601
Wild stories.
Yeah?

1227
01:48:10,669 --> 01:48:11,658
Yeah.

1228
01:48:36,695 --> 01:48:37,855
Can I?

1229
01:48:46,004 --> 01:48:50,304
I have to go to bed soon.
I work in the morning.

1230
01:48:51,309 --> 01:48:53,436
What kind of work do you do?

1231
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:58,548
The kind that drives you
to drink.

1232
01:48:59,317 --> 01:49:01,046
We must have the same job,
then.

1233
01:49:03,021 --> 01:49:04,750
I love your accent.

1234
01:49:05,757 --> 01:49:07,315
I love your perfume.

1235
01:49:17,836 --> 01:49:20,031
Cuts right through
the smoke.

1236
01:49:22,007 --> 01:49:23,235
Does it?

1237
01:49:24,409 --> 01:49:26,172
It's very nice.

1238
01:49:31,049 --> 01:49:34,212
Look, I don't want
to be forward...

1239
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,512
but it's late...

1240
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:40,287
and I do have to get up early.

1241
01:49:40,959 --> 01:49:42,119
<i>So</i>

1242
01:49:43,795 --> 01:49:46,195
<i>So?
So</i>

1243
01:49:47,832 --> 01:49:50,027
<i>So, you're very nice, and</i>

1244
01:49:53,538 --> 01:49:56,063
Are you really going
to make me ask?

1245
01:50:02,948 --> 01:50:04,210
I just can't.

1246
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:06,572
Pity.

1247
01:50:07,419 --> 01:50:10,081
You're very attractive.
I know.

1248
01:50:13,224 --> 01:50:14,816
If you come to your senses...

1249
01:50:14,893 --> 01:50:17,487
once you get up
to your lonely room...

1250
01:50:17,729 --> 01:50:19,720
well, maybe I'll be here.

1251
01:50:20,665 --> 01:50:25,034
Or maybe I'll be in my room,
alone in bed.

1252
01:50:31,943 --> 01:50:33,308
Good night.

1253
01:50:52,897 --> 01:50:56,162
The drunk Americans.
You think they were CIA?

1254
01:50:56,935 --> 01:51:00,336
They could've been.
For all we know, Louis is CIA.

1255
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:03,067
They work both sides.
Everyone does.

1256
01:51:03,141 --> 01:51:06,110
Or Louis is Mossad.
Now, maybe he isn't...

1257
01:51:06,177 --> 01:51:07,838
but they're using him
to feed us information.

1258
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:09,504
There's no direct link.

1259
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:12,448
Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,
which is giving it to Louis...

1260
01:51:12,517 --> 01:51:14,348
and Ephraim's demanding
we give him Louis...

1261
01:51:14,419 --> 01:51:16,910
because he knows
we expect him to do...

1262
01:51:16,988 --> 01:51:19,889
Stop chasing the mice
inside your skull.

1263
01:51:24,996 --> 01:51:27,931
You know,
I never thought you'd last.

1264
01:51:29,167 --> 01:51:31,135
I thought the same about you.

1265
01:51:31,202 --> 01:51:33,932
From the beginning
you seemed so reluctant.

1266
01:51:34,005 --> 01:51:35,870
I was born reluctant.
Ask my mother.

1267
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,601
If I can't kvetch,
I can't do my job.

1268
01:51:37,675 --> 01:51:39,643
You ever feel reluctant?

1269
01:51:39,978 --> 01:51:42,242
I'm not comfortable
with confusion.

1270
01:51:43,548 --> 01:51:45,948
I knew guys like you
in the army.

1271
01:51:46,317 --> 01:51:48,877
You'll do any terrifying thing
you're asked to do...

1272
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:51,183
but you have to do it running.

1273
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:56,522
You think you can outrun
your fears, your doubts.

1274
01:51:58,396 --> 01:52:03,231
The only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness.

1275
01:52:05,203 --> 01:52:08,104
But everyone's overtaken,
eventually.

1276
01:52:09,874 --> 01:52:12,468
Now, the mice need a brandy.
Will you join me?

1277
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:15,138
No, I'm going to go upstairs,
straight to bed.

1278
01:52:15,213 --> 01:52:16,441
You okay drinking
by yourself?

1279
01:52:16,514 --> 01:52:19,210
It's just a shot to numb
the brain. Good night.

1280
01:52:22,954 --> 01:52:23,943
Oh.

1281
01:52:24,456 --> 01:52:27,357
Beware of the local honey trap. Indeed?

1282
01:52:28,293 --> 01:52:31,057
You can't miss her.
You don't want to.

1283
01:52:51,749 --> 01:52:52,909
Hello.

1284
01:52:53,017 --> 01:52:55,212
<i>This is a trunk call
from Mr. Storsch.</i>

1285
01:52:55,286 --> 01:52:56,548
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

1286
01:52:56,621 --> 01:52:59,784
<i>Shit, Avner, you woke up the
baby, but that's okay... I mean</i>

1287
01:52:59,858 --> 01:53:01,257
How are you?

1288
01:53:02,393 --> 01:53:03,519
<i>I miss you.</i>

1289
01:53:04,362 --> 01:53:07,490
<i>You're in England
or Australia</i>

1290
01:53:07,565 --> 01:53:09,965
<i>or the North Pole...
Yeah, that's right.</i>

1291
01:53:12,036 --> 01:53:14,197
So listen, I was thinking...

1292
01:53:14,272 --> 01:53:17,105
when I'm finished doing
what I'm doing here...

1293
01:53:17,175 --> 01:53:18,836
I want to come to Brooklyn
to see you.

1294
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,708
Brooklyn is depressing. It's
got more churches than Jerusalem.

1295
01:53:21,779 --> 01:53:22,939
Listen to her talk.

1296
01:53:25,617 --> 01:53:28,677
<i>Can you hear me? Can
she hear me? Yeah, yeah.</i>

1297
01:53:29,654 --> 01:53:32,851
<i>Hey. Talk to me.</i>

1298
01:53:35,493 --> 01:53:37,961
<i>Daphna, make her talk.</i>

1299
01:53:48,439 --> 01:53:49,428
Dada.

1300
01:53:54,379 --> 01:53:57,473
Hey. Hey, sweetheart. It's your papa.

1301
01:53:59,617 --> 01:54:01,642
This is my voice, darling.

1302
01:54:03,955 --> 01:54:06,947
This is what I sound like.
Don't forget, okay?

1303
01:54:09,194 --> 01:54:12,095
Listen, I have to get
her to bed. She's tired.

1304
01:54:12,163 --> 01:54:14,063
<i>She'll dream about you.</i>

1305
01:54:46,598 --> 01:54:50,432
<i>We're standing at a distance,
as instructed by the terrorists.</i>

1306
01:54:51,636 --> 01:54:54,161
Are we going?
Is it to the airport?

1307
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:55,501
Can we talk to someone,
just to say...

1308
01:54:55,573 --> 01:54:57,541
Shut up, okay?
Just get on the bus, okay?

1309
01:54:57,609 --> 01:55:01,170
Just to tell our families.
Just to say we are all right!

1310
01:55:01,312 --> 01:55:04,076
Everybody, just relax, okay?
Relax! Calm down.

1311
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,244
We will ride this bus and fly away.
After, you go back to your home...

1312
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,310
or to your Olympic Games.

1313
01:57:08,373 --> 01:57:11,206
Carl. You asshole.

1314
01:57:12,009 --> 01:57:13,636
I saw her first.

1315
01:57:32,029 --> 01:57:33,189
Carl?

1316
01:59:10,661 --> 01:59:14,028
She's Dutch, not political,
entirely business-minded.

1317
01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:17,090
She lives in Hoorn.
She's there now.

1318
01:59:17,702 --> 01:59:19,727
This is dependable
information.

1319
01:59:19,804 --> 01:59:21,829
For which you pay nothing.

1320
01:59:22,106 --> 01:59:24,768
We're giving you this.
You understand why?

1321
01:59:24,842 --> 01:59:27,106
Because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do...

1322
01:59:27,178 --> 01:59:29,043
with the murder of my partner.

1323
01:59:29,113 --> 01:59:32,640
We inhabit a world
of intersecting secrecies.

1324
01:59:33,017 --> 01:59:36,544
We live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet.

1325
01:59:36,621 --> 01:59:38,521
That's what we accept.

1326
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:42,325
We buy information for you
from your enemies.

1327
01:59:43,794 --> 01:59:44,954
This alerts them.

1328
01:59:45,029 --> 01:59:47,327
You're not the only people
looking for names.

1329
01:59:48,332 --> 01:59:50,323
You're telling me
I'm being hunted now?

1330
01:59:50,401 --> 01:59:53,302
He's telling you
it's time for you to quit.

1331
01:59:53,371 --> 01:59:57,171
The race is not to the swift,
nor the battle to the strong...

1332
01:59:57,275 --> 01:59:59,971
but time and chance
happens to them all.

1333
02:00:12,657 --> 02:00:14,420
Evil falls suddenly.

1334
02:00:16,727 --> 02:00:18,752
Who can say when it falls?

1335
02:00:42,153 --> 02:00:44,485
So you're really gonna
kill her?

1336
02:00:45,823 --> 02:00:49,884
All this blood comes back to
us. Eventually it will work.

1337
02:00:50,328 --> 02:00:53,024
Even if it takes years,
we'll beat them.

1338
02:00:54,065 --> 02:00:55,726
We're Jews, Avner.

1339
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:58,393
Jews don't do wrong
because our enemies do wrong.

1340
02:00:58,469 --> 02:01:00,937
We can't afford to be
that decent anymore.

1341
02:01:01,038 --> 02:01:03,199
I don't know that
we ever were that decent.

1342
02:01:03,608 --> 02:01:07,510
Suffering thousands of years of
hatred doesn't make you decent.

1343
02:01:07,778 --> 02:01:11,475
But we're supposed to be
righteous. That's a beautiful thing.

1344
02:01:11,549 --> 02:01:12,914
That's Jewish.

1345
02:01:12,984 --> 02:01:15,145
That's what I knew,
that's what I was taught.

1346
02:01:16,354 --> 02:01:19,118
And now I'm losing it,
and I lose that, that's...

1347
02:01:19,223 --> 02:01:21,350
That's...
That's everything.

1348
02:01:22,026 --> 02:01:23,550
That's my soul.

1349
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:29,693
You need to go rest somewhere.
You don't have to do this one.

1350
02:01:31,936 --> 02:01:33,801
When I need you again,
I'll find you.

1351
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:29,419
Excuse me. Who are you?

1352
02:02:37,735 --> 02:02:39,225
Do you know why we're here?

1353
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:41,427
I want to get dressed, okay?

1354
02:02:47,912 --> 02:02:51,109
Maybe you want to hire me.
You know how good I am.

1355
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:57,546
No. Don't.

1356
02:02:58,389 --> 02:03:00,914
It's such a fucking waste
of talent.

1357
02:03:12,536 --> 02:03:14,367
Where're you going?
Stay here.

1358
02:03:14,438 --> 02:03:15,905
Shell. Shell.

1359
02:03:16,807 --> 02:03:17,899
Yeah.

1360
02:03:53,844 --> 02:03:55,106
Leave it.

1361
02:04:13,364 --> 02:04:16,527
<i>In seven months we've
killed six of the 11 names.</i>

1362
02:04:17,334 --> 02:04:19,564
<i>We've killed one replacement.</i>

1363
02:04:19,904 --> 02:04:21,997
<i>One of our targets
is in prison and four</i>

1364
02:04:22,072 --> 02:04:24,905
<i>including Ali Hassan Salameh,
are at large.</i>

1365
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:27,835
<i>One of our own has fallen.</i>

1366
02:04:28,646 --> 02:04:31,672
<i>Since we began, the other side has
sent letter bombs to 11 embassies</i>

1367
02:04:31,749 --> 02:04:33,717
<i>hijacked three planes</i>

1368
02:04:34,218 --> 02:04:37,847
<i>killed 130 passengers in Athens
and wounded scores more</i>

1369
02:04:38,489 --> 02:04:41,117
and killed our military
attachÃ©.

1370
02:04:41,225 --> 02:04:44,661
Some of it was done by a Venezuelan
called Carlos the Jackal...

1371
02:04:44,728 --> 02:04:46,628
who replaced Zaid Muchassi...

1372
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:48,925
who replaced Hussein al-Chir.

1373
02:04:50,067 --> 02:04:53,628
Black September's original
leadership has been decimated.

1374
02:04:55,706 --> 02:04:58,004
But new leaders
are emerging...

1375
02:04:58,275 --> 02:05:00,869
for whom Black September
wasn't violent enough.

1376
02:05:03,881 --> 02:05:06,475
And to dispatch
our six dispatched targets...

1377
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:09,849
we must have spent something
close to $2 million, right?

1378
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,253
You've been cooking.
Are you expecting company?

1379
02:05:14,158 --> 02:05:16,490
Mrs. Meir
says to the Knesset...

1380
02:05:18,295 --> 02:05:20,923
the world must see
that killing Jews...

1381
02:05:21,131 --> 02:05:24,066
will be from now on
an expensive proposition.

1382
02:05:26,303 --> 02:05:28,601
But killing Palestinians
isn't exactly cheap.

1383
02:05:32,243 --> 02:05:35,838
If all 11 were dead, you'd stop? Yes.

1384
02:05:37,114 --> 02:05:41,210
You're lying.
What about their replacements?

1385
02:05:41,952 --> 02:05:44,785
With each time we kill,
we create six more.

1386
02:05:45,723 --> 02:05:47,520
Maybe they'll have to keep
killing them, then.

1387
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:48,819
Forever.

1388
02:05:50,027 --> 02:05:52,120
Five targets are still alive.

1389
02:05:52,196 --> 02:05:54,187
That's five men
that need to be killed.

1390
02:05:54,265 --> 02:05:56,825
Eventually you forget that in
the beginning you hated doing it.

1391
02:05:56,901 --> 02:05:58,493
For me personally,
I feel less every day.

1392
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:00,594
One day I'm going to wake up,
I'm going to kill...

1393
02:06:00,671 --> 02:06:03,663
I'm going to go back to bed, I'm
not going to feel anything at all.

1394
02:06:05,743 --> 02:06:09,907
Hey, Hans? You know there's a rule
in the book against blind drunks.

1395
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:12,080
Why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

1396
02:06:12,149 --> 02:06:15,448
I mean, there's enough food
here to feed Bangladesh.

1397
02:06:18,455 --> 02:06:22,118
I keep seeing that Dutch woman,
you know, sprawled out like that.

1398
02:06:25,596 --> 02:06:28,497
It's not that I wish
we hadn't killed her.

1399
02:06:28,799 --> 02:06:31,597
I wish I had let you
close up her housecoat.

1400
02:06:32,169 --> 02:06:35,730
Yeah,
but you weren't yourself.

1401
02:06:50,654 --> 02:06:51,814
Avner.

1402
02:06:54,725 --> 02:06:55,714
Avner.

1403
02:06:58,295 --> 02:06:59,284
Avner.

1404
02:06:59,863 --> 02:07:02,855
I went to Hans' flat
above the antique shop...

1405
02:07:03,434 --> 02:07:06,369
<i>just to check up on him
because he was so</i>

1406
02:07:07,371 --> 02:07:10,238
Anyway, he's gone somewhere,
and I waited all night...

1407
02:07:10,307 --> 02:07:11,934
and he's not come back.

1408
02:07:33,063 --> 02:07:34,223
Knife.

1409
02:07:39,336 --> 02:07:41,361
They didn't take anything.

1410
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,558
What?

1411
02:12:35,499 --> 02:12:37,296
It will be beautiful.

1412
02:12:38,769 --> 02:12:42,227
Ali Hassan Salameh is in
Tarifa on the Spanish coast.

1413
02:12:43,307 --> 02:12:46,936
He's at a compound guarded by
all the predictable trouble.

1414
02:12:47,311 --> 02:12:50,041
Bomb makers often die
accidental deaths.

1415
02:12:52,449 --> 02:12:54,747
In Athens
you shot a KGB agent.

1416
02:12:56,853 --> 02:13:00,152
<i>Many people must want
to kill you, Monsieur Storsch.</i>

1417
02:13:00,557 --> 02:13:03,856
But why would I do that?
You pay better than anyone.

1418
02:13:09,399 --> 02:13:11,890
It's dangerous
going after Salameh.

1419
02:13:13,203 --> 02:13:15,068
But he planned
the Munich massacre.

1420
02:13:19,209 --> 02:13:22,940
Eliminate him, and they'll let
you go home. Don't you think?

1421
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:28,077
Yes, Louis. I do.

1422
02:13:32,122 --> 02:13:34,955
You could have a kitchen
like that someday.

1423
02:13:38,061 --> 02:13:41,861
It costs dearly,
but home always does.

1424
02:14:38,555 --> 02:14:41,046
Shit!
It's like a funhouse in there.

1425
02:14:41,858 --> 02:14:43,723
Can you tell how many?

1426
02:15:03,513 --> 02:15:04,912
That's him.

1427
02:15:09,419 --> 02:15:11,614
Are you sure it's him, Avner?

1428
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:15,053
You have to be sure.

1429
02:16:17,254 --> 02:16:18,949
I'm Avner Kaufman.
We know.

1430
02:16:19,022 --> 02:16:21,422
You want to ride with us?
Hop in.

1431
02:16:21,825 --> 02:16:23,122
Please.

1432
02:16:28,965 --> 02:16:31,991
I'm Amos.
This is Avi. Shin Bet.

1433
02:16:32,903 --> 02:16:34,530
We're not supposed to know
who you are...

1434
02:16:35,705 --> 02:16:36,694
because we're not officers.

1435
02:16:37,007 --> 02:16:39,737
We're just shit
and no one tells us shit.

1436
02:16:41,545 --> 02:16:44,173
We've heard about
what you've done.

1437
02:16:46,182 --> 02:16:48,412
We want to say it's
an honor to meet you.

1438
02:16:53,657 --> 02:16:55,716
It's an honor for me,
too.

1439
02:17:05,168 --> 02:17:07,500
I have no problems
with anything you guys did...

1440
02:17:07,571 --> 02:17:10,404
except the woman on
the houseboat in Hoorn.

1441
02:17:11,041 --> 02:17:12,770
Steve's told us about her.

1442
02:17:12,842 --> 02:17:14,036
We took a leave
of absence...

1443
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:15,441
and killed her
off the company clock.

1444
02:17:15,512 --> 02:17:16,570
Don't be an idiot.

1445
02:17:16,646 --> 02:17:19,706
Otherwise, as I said, we have
no problems with the job you did.

1446
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:22,777
Except three
of my men died.

1447
02:17:22,852 --> 02:17:23,944
According
to your colleague...

1448
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:26,147
I should say, emphatically,
according to your colleague...

1449
02:17:26,222 --> 02:17:27,780
not in any way your fault.

1450
02:17:27,857 --> 02:17:29,017
He sings your praises.

1451
02:17:29,092 --> 02:17:31,652
Best guy he ever worked for,
and so on.

1452
02:17:35,565 --> 02:17:38,728
<i>He says this French group...
Louis was his name?</i>

1453
02:17:39,002 --> 02:17:42,028
They sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

1454
02:17:42,105 --> 02:17:43,800
They helped kill your men.

1455
02:17:45,108 --> 02:17:47,372
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

1456
02:17:47,444 --> 02:17:48,741
Tell us who they are.

1457
02:17:51,348 --> 02:17:53,339
They won't work with you.

1458
02:17:54,784 --> 02:17:57,878
It's about loyalty.
You're an Israeli officer.

1459
02:17:58,054 --> 02:18:00,614
That's your only loyalty!
That's it!

1460
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,752
Okay.

1461
02:18:06,229 --> 02:18:09,164
This is General Hofi
of the Northern Command.

1462
02:18:09,332 --> 02:18:10,822
You look good.

1463
02:18:11,534 --> 02:18:15,061
Listen, the Prime Minister
is proud of you and your men.

1464
02:18:15,238 --> 02:18:17,263
She wishes she could tell you
herself, but she can't.

1465
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,274
She never heard of you,
right?

1466
02:18:20,076 --> 02:18:23,534
Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

1467
02:18:23,613 --> 02:18:24,978
For Israel.

1468
02:18:29,419 --> 02:18:32,252
That's it.
There is no medal or anything.

1469
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,960
June 16, 1973.
Avner Kaufman interview.

1470
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:50,701
Go ahead.

1471
02:18:55,078 --> 02:18:57,069
Tell me what you learned.

1472
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:01,950
What I learned?
Yes.

1473
02:19:02,185 --> 02:19:03,914
What did you learn?

1474
02:19:06,556 --> 02:19:07,989
For God's sake!

1475
02:19:08,158 --> 02:19:10,524
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1476
02:19:14,898 --> 02:19:16,388
Avner, tell me.

1477
02:19:16,466 --> 02:19:19,458
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1478
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:22,064
Please.

1479
02:19:23,339 --> 02:19:26,240
I can have you
court-martialed, and I might.

1480
02:19:26,976 --> 02:19:30,104
You can't.
I don't work for you.

1481
02:19:32,048 --> 02:19:33,538
I don't exist.

1482
02:19:35,885 --> 02:19:38,786
You look terrible.
I'm not good right now.

1483
02:19:41,357 --> 02:19:45,191
You don't need to tell me
anything. It's taken a lot from you.

1484
02:19:45,895 --> 02:19:49,922
I'm alive, right? And
the rest sorts itself out.

1485
02:19:51,434 --> 02:19:54,870
I'm not a fool, Avner. I
never said you were a fool.

1486
02:20:04,948 --> 02:20:08,748
Everyone in Europe died.
Most of my family.

1487
02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:11,209
A huge family.

1488
02:20:14,858 --> 02:20:17,156
I never talked
to you about it.

1489
02:20:17,393 --> 02:20:20,328
I knew. You knew? So
what was there to say?

1490
02:20:21,798 --> 02:20:24,198
I didn't die,
because I came here.

1491
02:20:24,534 --> 02:20:27,970
When I arrived, I walked up to
the top of a hill in Jerusalem...

1492
02:20:28,037 --> 02:20:30,972
and prayed for a child.

1493
02:20:31,241 --> 02:20:34,233
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

1494
02:20:34,310 --> 02:20:37,575
And I could feel every
one of them praying with me.

1495
02:20:41,117 --> 02:20:43,210
You are what we prayed for.

1496
02:20:44,354 --> 02:20:46,549
What you did,
you did for us.

1497
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:49,823
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

1498
02:20:50,193 --> 02:20:53,424
Every one of the ones
who died, died wanting this.

1499
02:20:55,064 --> 02:20:58,693
We had to take it, because no
one will ever give it to us.

1500
02:20:58,835 --> 02:21:02,066
A place to be a Jew among
Jews, subject to no one.

1501
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:06,641
I thank God for hearing
my prayer.

1502
02:21:08,812 --> 02:21:10,837
Do you want to know, Mama?

1503
02:21:12,382 --> 02:21:14,942
Do you want me to tell you
what I did?

1504
02:21:16,953 --> 02:21:17,977
No.

1505
02:21:19,455 --> 02:21:22,891
Whatever it took,
whatever it takes.

1506
02:21:24,794 --> 02:21:29,754
A place on Earth.
We have a place on Earth.

1507
02:21:31,201 --> 02:21:32,463
At last.

1508
02:21:42,345 --> 02:21:44,438
What's this?
Baklava.

1509
02:21:45,315 --> 02:21:48,512
From Rehovot? The only edible
baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

1510
02:21:48,585 --> 02:21:50,780
Eat it on the plane.
You're too thin.

1511
02:21:50,887 --> 02:21:52,912
I hope it gives you
a bellyache.

1512
02:21:54,357 --> 02:21:55,722
Listen, forget it.

1513
02:21:55,792 --> 02:21:58,488
You go see your wife, your
child, rest for a few more months.

1514
02:21:58,561 --> 02:22:00,290
Then we're gonna put you
back in the field.

1515
02:22:00,363 --> 02:22:02,126
Not Europe.
Probably Latin America.

1516
02:22:02,198 --> 02:22:05,395
You think it over. Rest,
Avner. Then you come back.

1517
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:08,694
No.

1518
02:22:35,665 --> 02:22:36,757
That's all right.

1519
02:22:36,833 --> 02:22:40,291
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

1520
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:43,533
Look at that beautiful hair.

1521
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:31,885
Nightmares?

1522
02:23:33,022 --> 02:23:34,080
Yes.

1523
02:23:37,527 --> 02:23:39,119
Come back to bed.

1524
02:23:41,698 --> 02:23:44,064
I have no idea
where I should be.

1525
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:54,900
The place is nice.
You've made it really nice.

1526
02:23:56,212 --> 02:23:58,077
The kitchen's too big.

1527
02:25:16,059 --> 02:25:18,687
Sylvie, I need to speak
to your father.

1528
02:25:20,797 --> 02:25:22,321
Is Louis there?

1529
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,730
I need to speak to your
father. Have him call me.

1530
02:25:26,803 --> 02:25:30,603
212-664-7665.

1531
02:25:31,307 --> 02:25:33,775
I'll wait. He must call me.
I'll wait.

1532
02:25:38,014 --> 02:25:39,538
Am I being hunted?

1533
02:25:40,216 --> 02:25:41,843
<i>Is my family being hunted?</i>

1534
02:25:41,918 --> 02:25:46,878
How is your father? He's
well? Your family is well?

1535
02:25:47,023 --> 02:25:50,584
I don't know. How is my
family? Are they well?

1536
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:52,025
Are they going to be okay?

1537
02:25:52,095 --> 02:25:54,791
I'm sending you a parcel
of sausage and cheese.

1538
02:25:54,931 --> 02:25:58,025
Real cheese. The kind
you can't find in America.

1539
02:25:58,167 --> 02:26:01,659
It isn't pasteurized,
so it won't taste like shit.

1540
02:26:03,005 --> 02:26:05,997
It's a real pleasure
to hear your voice again.

1541
02:26:07,143 --> 02:26:09,407
I think about you
with concern.

1542
02:26:09,879 --> 02:26:11,471
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

1543
02:26:13,516 --> 02:26:14,505
Avner?

1544
02:26:15,384 --> 02:26:17,249
You believe me, Avner?

1545
02:26:19,455 --> 02:26:21,116
You know my name?

1546
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:22,714
Of course I do.

1547
02:26:24,393 --> 02:26:26,327
Now, listen to me.
It's important.

1548
02:26:27,730 --> 02:26:30,597
No harm will come to you
from me.

1549
02:26:55,591 --> 02:26:59,118
You can't go in there, sir.
It's a restricted area. Sir?

1550
02:26:59,829 --> 02:27:01,956
I tried to stop him.
I don't know who this guy is.

1551
02:27:02,031 --> 02:27:04,591
Security!

1552
02:27:05,902 --> 02:27:07,563
If you're Mossad,
you know who I am.

1553
02:27:07,637 --> 02:27:10,504
If you don't, tell Ephraim
Avner came to see him.

1554
02:27:10,573 --> 02:27:12,006
Being in this room
is by appointment only.

1555
02:27:12,108 --> 02:27:13,598
Shut up and listen to me.

1556
02:27:13,676 --> 02:27:16,201
I won't hesitate to kill
other people's children...

1557
02:27:16,279 --> 02:27:18,304
if you hurt my child.
Understand? Do I know you, sir?

1558
02:27:18,381 --> 02:27:21,475
Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt my father.

1559
02:27:21,551 --> 02:27:23,781
I don't care.
I'll go to the newspapers.

1560
02:27:23,853 --> 02:27:26,754
I'll give every name of
everybody who was in the meetings.

1561
02:27:26,822 --> 02:27:30,519
I'll tell them everything if you
don't leave my family alone! Okay?

1562
02:31:59,562 --> 02:32:00,927
I love you.

1563
02:32:25,788 --> 02:32:26,948
Avner.

1564
02:32:32,528 --> 02:32:34,018
Phone for you.

1565
02:32:34,563 --> 02:32:36,030
He's Israeli.

1566
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:43,302
You think we'd hurt
your family?

1567
02:32:43,739 --> 02:32:46,333
I think anyone is capable
of anything.

1568
02:32:46,742 --> 02:32:49,074
I think you're losing
your mind.

1569
02:32:54,049 --> 02:32:55,812
Did I commit murder?

1570
02:32:59,021 --> 02:33:01,114
I want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed...

1571
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:02,248
had a hand in Munich.

1572
02:33:02,324 --> 02:33:04,656
I don't discuss such things
with people who don't exist.

1573
02:33:04,727 --> 02:33:07,252
You want to discuss,
come back to existence.

1574
02:33:07,329 --> 02:33:09,354
You want your daughter
to grow up in exile?

1575
02:33:09,431 --> 02:33:11,023
I want evidence.

1576
02:33:14,737 --> 02:33:18,104
Professor Hamshari with the
beautiful wife and child?

1577
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:21,739
He was implicated in a failed
assassination attempt on Ben-Gurion.

1578
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:24,142
He was recruiting
for Fatah France.

1579
02:33:24,213 --> 02:33:25,510
You stopped him.

1580
02:33:25,581 --> 02:33:27,105
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

1581
02:33:27,182 --> 02:33:29,241
And Zwaiter, your harmless
little writer in Rome?

1582
02:33:29,318 --> 02:33:32,549
He was behind the bomb
on El Al flight 76 in 1968.

1583
02:33:32,688 --> 02:33:34,485
He was working on
another bomb last August.

1584
02:33:34,557 --> 02:33:35,649
I could go on
and on with this.

1585
02:33:35,724 --> 02:33:38,284
According to evidence
nobody has seen.

1586
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:41,193
If these people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

1587
02:33:41,263 --> 02:33:42,753
Like Eichmann.

1588
02:33:43,265 --> 02:33:45,130
If these guys live,
Israelis die.

1589
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:49,136
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

1590
02:33:58,781 --> 02:34:01,045
You did well,
but you're unhappy.

1591
02:34:01,116 --> 02:34:03,482
I killed seven men.
Not Salameh.

1592
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,787
We'll get him, of course.

1593
02:34:09,058 --> 02:34:11,026
You think you were
the only team?

1594
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:14,493
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

1595
02:34:14,763 --> 02:34:16,560
Does that assuage your guilt?

1596
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:19,700
Did we accomplish
anything at all?

1597
02:34:20,102 --> 02:34:22,866
Every man we killed
has been replaced by worse.

1598
02:34:22,938 --> 02:34:25,736
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

1599
02:34:26,008 --> 02:34:28,476
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

1600
02:34:28,544 --> 02:34:29,909
or the Palestinian leadership?

1601
02:34:29,979 --> 02:34:31,674
You tell me what we've done.

1602
02:34:31,747 --> 02:34:33,476
You killed them
for the sake of a country...

1603
02:34:33,549 --> 02:34:34,777
you now choose to abandon.

1604
02:34:36,285 --> 02:34:40,187
The country your mother and father
built, that you were born into.

1605
02:34:40,255 --> 02:34:42,951
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

1606
02:34:44,793 --> 02:34:47,921
There's no peace at the end of
this, no matter what you believe.

1607
02:34:47,997 --> 02:34:51,194
You know this is true.
Here's what I know.

1608
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,391
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

1609
02:34:53,469 --> 02:34:56,666
You're a sabra. Your wife
and daughter are sabras.

1610
02:34:57,606 --> 02:34:59,801
What I came to say
is this...

1611
02:35:01,010 --> 02:35:02,341
come home.

1612
02:35:16,659 --> 02:35:18,627
Come to my house
for dinner tonight.

1613
02:35:20,462 --> 02:35:22,487
Come on. You're a
Jew, you're a stranger.

1614
02:35:22,564 --> 02:35:25,192
It's written someplace
or other that I'm meant to...

1615
02:35:25,267 --> 02:35:27,963
ask you to come
and break bread with me.

1616
02:35:28,537 --> 02:35:33,099
So break bread with me,
Ephraim.

1617
02:35:37,079 --> 02:35:38,137
No.

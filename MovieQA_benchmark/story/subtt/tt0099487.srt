1
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,000
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

2
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:15,010
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

3
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,030
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

4
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,020
- I wanna hear.
- Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.

5
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,045
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

6
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,015
Well, all right.

7
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:31,060
Let's see...

8
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,070
I guess it would have to start with... scissors!

9
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,095
Scissors?

10
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:41,035
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

11
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:46,090
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

12
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,000
- A man?
- Yes.

13
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,000
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

14
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,025
You know the mansion
on top ofthe mountain?

15
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,010
It's haunted.

16
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,060
Well...

17
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,078
A long time ago...

18
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,012
an inventor lived in that mansion.

19
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:15,012
He made many things, I suppose.

20
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,051
He also createda man.

21
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,055
He gave him insides,
a heart, a brain, everything.

22
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:34,056
Well, almost everything.

23
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:39,052
You see, the inventor was very old.

24
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,024
He diedbefore he got to fiinish
the man he invented.

25
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:48,032
So the man was leftbyhimself,

26
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,062
incomplete andall alone.

27
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,075
He didn'thave a name?

28
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:59,034
Of course he hada name.

29
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:02,009
His name was Edward.

30
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,043
Avon calling!

31
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:54,010
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

32
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,027
Today I've come to show you our exquisite
new line of softer colours, in shadows,

33
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:01,048
blushes and lipstick.

34
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:05,028
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

35
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:08,011
My changing look... That's good!

36
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,028
I also have a complete selection
of your old favourites,

37
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:16,079
those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

38
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,046
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

39
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,038
I know. Bye, Helen.

40
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:26,092
Um, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care ofthis by yourself.

41
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:29,009
I could? I don't think so.

42
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,097
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

43
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:34,051
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

44
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,097
Mm-hm...

45
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:38,006
And out she pops.

46
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,069
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

47
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,048
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realise it since they haven't made an ad.

48
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:50,061
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

49
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:53,087
And then you just screw this back on.

50
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:56,074
Oh, now who could that be?

51
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:00,008
Will you excuse me for a moment?

52
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,025
Now, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

53
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:07,030
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

54
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,097
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

55
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,068
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

56
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:21,098
Oh. Yes.

57
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,077
Don't you realise that means I'm busy?

58
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,094
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

59
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:33,024
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you,

60
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,082
or the Bahimini Bliss?

61
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,074
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

62
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:42,062
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

63
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,030
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!

64
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,006
Just not my day.

65
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,026
Oh, my goodness!

66
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,033
Oh, it's so beautiful!

67
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,097
Hello?

68
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,088
Hello?

69
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:26,010
Hello? Avon calling!

70
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,001
Oh, my!

71
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:08,014
Hello?

72
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,014
Hello?

73
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,094
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative. Hello?

74
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:34,021
I... I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but you don't have any reason to be afraid.

75
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:38,013
Ooh! This is some huge house, isn't it?

76
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,063
Thank goodness
for those aerobics... classes.

77
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:38,094
Hello? Hello?

78
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:43,019
Why are you hiding back there?

79
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,070
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.

80
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,045
I'm your local Avon representative,

81
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:55,016
and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...

82
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:57,004
Oh, my!

83
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,058
I can see that I've disturbed you.

84
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,096
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.

85
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,046
Don't go.

86
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,076
Oh, my!

87
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,039
What happened to you?

88
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:17,064
- I'm not finished.
- Ohh!

89
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,081
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...

90
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,003
Those are your hands?

91
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,099
Those are your hands!

92
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,050
What happened to you?

93
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,038
Where are your parents? Um...

94
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:46,067
Your mother?

95
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,080
Your father?

96
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,097
He didn't wake up.

97
00:14:57,035 --> 00:15:00,064
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

98
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:07,069
What happened to your face?

99
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,003
I won't hurt you.

100
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:18,025
At the very least,
let me give you a good astringent.

101
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,021
This will help to prevent infection.

102
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,030
What's your name?

103
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,031
Edward.

104
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,081
Edward...

105
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:45,031
I think you should just come home with me.

106
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,075
Ohh!

107
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:02,087
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- No. No, don't be.

108
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,067
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be excited.

109
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:12,047
Oh! You OK?

110
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,026
You OK?

111
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,029
Hello?

112
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:49,000
Hi. Yeah, it's Marge.

113
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,072
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

114
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,084
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

115
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:59,056
Did she say anything to you
about having a guest?

116
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:02,098
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.

117
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:05,069
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.

118
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:07,060
Right. Bye.

119
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,024
Oh! Damn!

120
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,088
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

121
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:32,059
You can just go right in
and make yourseIf right at home, OK?

122
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,001
We'lI have something to eat or drink, or...
Whatever you...

123
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:40,026
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Here we go. Right in here.

124
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:45,035
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy
drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.

125
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,027
He looked kinda pale.

126
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,065
On my way. Don't do anything without me.

127
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:51,061
Yes! Be right there!

128
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:59,024
Here we are.

129
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:22,005
So... um, this is the living room
and back here are the bedrooms.

130
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,077
You want to see the pictures? All right.

131
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,010
Well, this is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.

132
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,044
Do you know what bowling is?

133
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,003
Bowling?

134
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,049
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

135
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,091
I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.

136
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,004
And, um... here's my daughter Kim.

137
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,025
All dressed for the junior prom.

138
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,005
She's a senior now, ifyou can believe it!

139
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,056
She's camping in the mountains
with friends,

140
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:08,098
but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

141
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,086
Isn't she beautiful?

142
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,066
That's my family.

143
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:33,058
Come along.
I'll show you the rest ofthe house.

144
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,050
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourseIf at home.

145
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,038
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourselfto anything you want.

146
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,001
Those are grapes.
And, um... back here are the bedrooms.

147
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:48,006
Let me get you some towels
and I'lI see what we can find for you to wear.

148
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:52,064
You know what? I think I have some of
BilI's old clothes in here. This is perfect!

149
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,027
Here. These should just fit you.

150
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:59,099
- Oh! Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.

151
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,024
Now you can go in Kim's room
and put these on, and I'll be right with you.

152
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,085
No, no, scissors. No, scissors.

153
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,006
That's right. Well, he was...
born up there or... something.

154
00:21:57,056 --> 00:22:01,065
- Have you seen him before?
- No, I doubt he's ever been offthe grounds.

155
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:04,053
Then how didyou everget together with him?

156
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:08,041
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

157
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,088
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...

158
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:23,075
May I help you with this?

159
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,030
Thank you.

160
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:31,047
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.

161
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,022
Here. Let me just get this right off.

162
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,031
- Does that hurt?
- No.

163
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,098
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.

164
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,031
OK...

165
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,069
There we go. Very fine!

166
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:52,045
You look fine, just fine!

167
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,046
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.

168
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:03,071
I've got rollers in my damn hair!

169
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,023
OK...

170
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:26,015
Now, what did I do with my sciss...?

171
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:29,078
Edward, um... would you?

172
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,037
Thank you.

173
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:37,075
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

174
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:39,096
- Really?
- Yes.

175
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,067
Now, I can help with the scars...

176
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:50,038
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.

177
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,022
Kevin!

178
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,060
Kevin!

179
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:44,023
It's not polite to stare, dear.

180
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:50,053
Think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.

181
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,066
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!

182
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:58,049
Well, this must be
quite a change for you, right, Ed?

183
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:02,016
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Oh, sure.

184
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:07,067
So what have you been doin' with yourself
up there in that big old place? I bet the...

185
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:11,017
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!

186
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,038
Yes?

187
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,039
No, I... I just...

188
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:19,072
See all the way to the ocean, I bet, huh?

189
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,035
Sometimes.

190
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,031
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?

191
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:31,078
Bill, dear, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

192
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:33,094
Kevin...!

193
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,062
Kevin...!

194
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:53,009
Man, those things are cool!

195
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:57,005
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...

196
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,055
Kevin...!

197
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,056
Edward,

198
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:06,094
would you like some butter for your bread?

199
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:12,082
Great!

200
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,007
Thank you.

201
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:20,078
Hey, can I bring him to
show and tell on Monday?

202
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,087
Kevin, I've had enough.

203
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:29,075
Do you think you can sleep?

204
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:33,055
I know things feel strange,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

205
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:36,034
- Good night.
- Good night.

206
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:40,040
The light concealing cream goes on first,

207
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,024
then you blend and blend and blend.

208
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:45,028
Blending is the secret.

209
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,066
Mm-hm!

210
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,091
More concealing cream...

211
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:52,017
Your complexion is so fair!

212
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:55,050
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it...

213
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,001
Give it a try here.

214
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,072
Close enough!

215
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,097
OK, this should do the trick here.

216
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:07,081
Hmph!

217
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,006
I have another idea.

218
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:15,098
We'll cover up the scars
and start with a completely smooth surface.

219
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,004
Darn this stuff!

220
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:45,064
They stilI have 11 on the scoreboard,
and it's three to one.

221
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,081
It's through the gap to Warren.

222
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,031
Now they change it to 12 hits.

223
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,090
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!

224
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,070
Kevin!

225
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,099
- It's hammered!
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?

226
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:10,045
- No, make it louder!
- It's gone,

227
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:12,091
it's out ofhere, it's history!

228
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:19,034
Dad...

229
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,092
Look!

230
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,076
to make ita fiive-run inning
and blow this game to pieces!

231
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,051
I'll be darned.

232
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,065
They filled the whole tape!

233
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:47,082
What's going on over there, Peg?
Call me.

234
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:50,041
Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.

235
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:55,054
Oh, by the way, lhearit's pouring rain in
the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?

236
00:29:55,054 --> 00:30:00,000
Hey there, darlin'! The gals are
all in a tizzy about your secret visitor.

237
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,009
You can'tkeep him a secretfor ever!

238
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:21,082
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God,
you have the whole family in there, don't ya?

239
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:26,024
And he answers the challenge atfiirst
with a strike ofhis own.

240
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,087
Edward, come here.

241
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,033
No, no, no, that's a terrible idea, son!

242
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:44,055
Go to the garage and get the oiI can.
We don't want him rusting up on us.

243
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,051
Ohh!

244
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,068
Edward, you did us!

245
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:57,018
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

246
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:58,077
Oh, Edward!

247
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:04,073
It's not heaven he's from,
it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.

248
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:07,086
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

249
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:11,041
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.

250
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,033
Don't come near me.

251
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:20,029
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!

252
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:22,075
Edward, don't you listen to her!

253
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:26,080
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.

254
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,047
Hi!

255
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:37,047
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.

256
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,018
Hi, Joyce. Hi!

257
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,056
Shame on you,
keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.

258
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:44,094
We think that's mighty selfish ofyou.

259
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:46,069
Things have been hectic here.

260
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:49,086
That is so sweet ofyou
to wanna correct the situation.

261
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:51,082
What time does the barbecue begin?

262
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:53,032
Barbecue?

263
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,033
You intend to introduce
your guest to your friends,

264
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,050
don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.

265
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:02,096
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!

266
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:06,075
- What time was it that you said?
- Uh, what time...

267
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:08,080
- Bill!
- About five?

268
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,026
Bill!

269
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,005
He has been sent first to tempt you!

270
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:17,022
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.

271
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:21,064
Trample down the perversion of nature.

272
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:25,006
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

273
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:27,040
Why, isn't that excitin'?

274
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,070
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.

275
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:38,062
Bill! Bill?

276
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:45,088
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue
without devilled eggs.

277
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,084
They're just... the best. They make a thing.

278
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:53,043
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.

279
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,089
We're gonna be...

280
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:58,047
Oh. All right now, it's just a nick.

281
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,010
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

282
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:05,085
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of
the neighbours, they're really very nice.

283
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:10,032
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!

284
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,024
You just have to be yourself.

285
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,053
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

286
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:45,093
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.

287
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,085
Play scissors what?

288
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:51,040
I got a doctor friend
might be able to help you.

289
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:55,027
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.

290
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:59,003
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.

291
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,099
Hey, kids!

292
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:05,020
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of
a handshake you got there, Ed.

293
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:08,075
Harry! I saw you
on the goIf course last week...

294
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:14,079
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

295
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:18,001
Do you want a cracker?

296
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,055
- He's different.
- Completely different.

297
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,013
No kidding.

298
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,064
- He's so...
- Mysterious.

299
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:25,097
Yeah.

300
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,093
D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

301
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:32,069
And just think what a single snip could do.

302
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:34,015
Or undo.

303
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,028
Eddie. Eddie.

304
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:41,078
The guys and I want to invite you
to our card game Friday night.

305
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:43,066
Would you like that?

306
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:46,008
Only thing is... you can't cut!

307
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:02,022
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.

308
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:07,047
Took some shrapnel during the war,
and ever since then I can't feel a thing!

309
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,085
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

310
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:15,027
Who's handicapped? My goodness.

311
00:37:16,086 --> 00:37:20,028
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...

312
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:23,040
What do they call the... exceptional?

313
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:29,070
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you
have not tasted any ofthe ambrosia salad...

314
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:32,083
that I made especially for you.

315
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:35,004
Allow me.

316
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,063
Mmm!

317
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:42,097
Mmmm!

318
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:47,089
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?

319
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:52,031
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.

320
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,094
I want a row of angels!

321
00:37:55,094 --> 00:38:00,073
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to
come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?

322
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:05,007
-  I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!

323
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,061
Soup's on!

324
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:08,099
Azhuzhizha zhigabab.

325
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,024
- What?
- I thuzhizha zhizhgabab.

326
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,083
It is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.

327
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,058
You shouldn't take things so literally.

328
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:24,013
"Let us pretend we are in the drawing
room and the hostess is serving tea."

329
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:29,014
"Many numerous little questions
confront us."

330
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:35,023
"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup oftea?"

331
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:39,098
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"

332
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:41,052
No.

333
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,044
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"

334
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:48,053
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded...

335
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:52,033
or should the centre crease
be allowed to remain?"

336
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:55,029
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders,

337
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:58,075
but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us...

338
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,038
and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

339
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,022
Mm, yes. Boring.

340
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:14,064
Let us switch to, uh...

341
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
to some poetry, hm?

342
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:24,073
"There was an old man from the Cape,"

343
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:27,036
"Who made himseIf garments of crepe."

344
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,057
"When asked: Will they tear?"

345
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:31,078
"He replied: Here and there,"

346
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:34,037
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

347
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,016
That's right.

348
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,062
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.

349
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,084
That's right.

350
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,023
We're home.

351
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,015
Shit.

352
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:10,007
Everything's still sopping.

353
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,066
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.

354
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:16,062
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.

355
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:20,025
I told you to call them
and tell them we're coming back early.

356
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:22,092
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.

357
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:25,017
How else am I supposed to get attention?

358
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:29,030
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.

359
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,001
- Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.
- Bye.

360
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,072
- Bye.
- Bye.

361
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,001
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,010
Come on, Jim, let's go.

363
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,095
There's somebody in my room!
Go look! Look!

364
00:41:40,095 --> 00:41:44,037
He's a murderer! He's got an axe!
He tried to kill me!

365
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,075
- Everything's OK.
- Mom, go look!

366
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,079
Go back to bed, Kevin.

367
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:55,022
This way.

368
00:41:56,005 --> 00:42:00,022
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.

369
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:05,035
OK. We'lI have you set up here in a minute.

370
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:08,073
We got a full queen-size bed here,
believe it or not.

371
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,003
Oh, it's all made and everything. Good.

372
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:14,090
There you go.

373
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:17,016
What's the matter? What's wrong?

374
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,058
She get you nervous?

375
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:23,033
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

376
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:27,071
You don't know about the wonderful world
of teenage girls. They're all crazy.

377
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:32,076
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?

378
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:34,055
Lemonade.

379
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:43,043
I don't know what it is.

380
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:46,039
They reach a certain age...

381
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:50,031
They develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up...

382
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:53,003
They go crazy.

383
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:57,053
Glands?

384
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:00,020
Yeah, glands.

385
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:03,054
I try not to think about it.

386
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,093
Good, isn't it?

387
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,081
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight
and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.

388
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:30,094
Why did you have to bring him here?

389
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:34,040
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.

390
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,036
Why does he have to stay here?

391
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:40,020
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

392
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,033
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.

393
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:47,054
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

394
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,042
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.

395
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:54,029
- Goodness, you scared him halfto death!
- I scared him to death?

396
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:03,039
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

397
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,068
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.

398
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:10,077
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

399
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,036
Hi.

400
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,070
H-h-h... H-h-h...

401
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,088
Eddie!

402
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,084
Thirsty?

403
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,001
Kisses! Hush up!

404
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,035
Shh, quiet now!

405
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:50,023
Darlin', I can hardly hear myselfthink!
Momma's precious little baby girl...

406
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,098
Aah! Wouldn't you like
a nice cool glass of lemonade?

407
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:01,007
Lemonade?

408
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,067
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.

409
00:45:15,058 --> 00:45:19,030
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.

410
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:21,026
And...

411
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,028
They give me the creeps.

412
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:44,074
You should see the clown
in Miss Peters' yard.

413
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,032
Kim!

414
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,049
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

415
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,095
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!

416
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:54,071
Marge) Edward, you forgot your cookies.

417
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:59,084
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!

418
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:02,055
- Stop!
- Let's go.

419
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:11,031
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today...

420
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:14,044
and she just had
her kitchen completely redone.

421
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:17,077
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors,

422
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:21,073
a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?

423
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:25,015
Jim, didn't you just tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?

424
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,082
Yeah, my dad bought himself
a bunch of new toys.

425
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:31,004
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...

426
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:35,000
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.

427
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:38,042
They keep things locked up.

428
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:41,092
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't use it.

429
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:43,092
He won't even help me buy an old car.

430
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:48,097
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.

431
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:50,072
Dad...!

432
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:55,027
Speaking of money... I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

433
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:58,052
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.

434
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,036
Sweetheart...

435
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:04,094
You can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

436
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,091
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

437
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,037
Uh, that's true, sir, you can't.

438
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:15,037
I... I can't eat that. He used his hands.

439
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:18,021
It's... I don't think it's sanitary.

440
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,034
I'm sorry.

441
00:47:28,038 --> 00:47:31,035
Honey, you want me
to help you clean that up?

442
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:33,039
No, that's OK.

443
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:35,089
I'll be right back.

444
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,065
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!

445
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:31,032
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!

446
00:48:33,028 --> 00:48:35,049
She's gorgeous. Thank you!

447
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:40,041
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

448
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:42,050
And then it'll be fine.

449
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:57,081
I was hopin' for somethin' big
and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?

450
00:48:58,014 --> 00:49:02,073
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna
be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

451
00:49:03,015 --> 00:49:04,094
Yes, you are. Oh!

452
00:49:04,094 --> 00:49:06,036
Oh! My!

453
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,074
Oh! Ohh!

454
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:24,017
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?

455
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:27,088
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!

456
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:32,009
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?

457
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:34,001
Would you cut mine?

458
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:45,054
That was the single most thrillin' experience
of my whole life.

459
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:53,027
They're getting the head ofthe company!

460
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,032
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.

461
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:58,024
- Hi.
- Hi!

462
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,049
What did you do to your hair?

463
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:02,083
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

464
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,050
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.

465
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,058
This is such an honour.

466
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:13,009
Yes. He's right here.

467
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,075
So then you know all about it.

468
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:19,001
Uh-huh. Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

469
00:52:20,038 --> 00:52:25,022
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency... well, just a little.

470
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,014
I'll try that. Uh-huh.

471
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,098
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

472
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:38,044
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

473
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,057
No wonder she's the head ofthe company.

474
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:46,029
You know, she started out as
a sales representative just like me.

475
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:50,016
I've always wanted to talk to her,
but until now I never had a reason.

476
00:52:50,016 --> 00:52:51,092
Thanks, Edward.

477
00:52:53,017 --> 00:52:56,000
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

478
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,092
- Uh-huh!
- Mm-hm!

479
00:53:10,002 --> 00:53:11,073
I'll get that.

480
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:55,035
Edward. We're here.

481
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,044
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.

482
00:54:01,053 --> 00:54:04,024
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.

483
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:06,020
This is such a drag.

484
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:08,049
Hi!

485
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,087
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:17,038
Do you have a key?

487
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:18,063
No.

488
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:22,063
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.

489
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:28,080
Wow! Thanks!

490
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:34,069
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.

491
00:54:34,094 --> 00:54:38,002
Hey, be a pal and yell
when Peg pulls in, huh?

492
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,015
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?

493
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:46,074
Yeah? Get away over.

494
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:48,053
Stand right up.

495
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:51,074
What's been the best part
of your new life here in town?

496
00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:53,079
The friends I've made.

497
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,088
Any other questions?

498
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,071
Have you ever thought of having
corrective surgery or prosthetics?

499
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:05,097
I know a doctor
that might be able to help you.

500
00:55:06,038 --> 00:55:08,009
I'd like to meet him.

501
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:11,081
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.

502
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:14,014
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.

503
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:16,081
But then you'd be like everyone else.

504
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,085
Yes, I know.

505
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,061
I think he'd like that.

506
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:23,028
But then no one would
think you were special.

507
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,049
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.

508
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:28,057
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

509
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:36,096
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

510
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,067
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

511
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:43,075
Do you have any plans
to open your own beauty salon?

512
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:46,001
Oh, there's an idea!

513
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:51,039
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.

514
00:55:51,076 --> 00:55:54,043
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Ohhhh!

515
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,077
Sure he does. Right, Kim?

516
00:56:00,077 --> 00:56:03,077
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.

517
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:05,061
Knock it off, bubble-butt.

518
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,057
- You did it.
- So?

519
00:56:08,036 --> 00:56:11,099
How aboutit, Edward?
ls there some speciallady in yourlife?

520
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:17,066
Ooh...

521
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:47,011
Uh... everything's all right. We'll take a break
and we'll be back after these messages.

522
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,032
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

523
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:53,024
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!

524
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:57,045
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.

525
00:56:58,062 --> 00:57:01,025
Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!

526
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:05,096
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.

527
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,071
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!

528
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:12,076
Ohh! And here we are.

529
00:57:13,043 --> 00:57:16,060
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

530
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,006
And back along here, well, I think...

531
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:21,002
Eddie! Come along, doll.

532
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:25,023
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...

533
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,061
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.

534
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:34,045
And this of course
is where we wash the hair.

535
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:37,095
And here is where I stand...
when I greet the customers.

536
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,058
But back in here
is what I really wanna show you.

537
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:48,059
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.

538
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:53,001
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything,

539
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:57,026
and what I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

540
00:57:57,026 --> 00:58:00,018
Oh, honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.

541
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:03,006
Now, you just sit right down there...

542
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,077
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

543
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:11,032
Yes.

544
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:13,020
OK.

545
00:58:26,063 --> 00:58:28,042
With these hands

546
00:58:30,013 --> 00:58:32,005
I will cling to you

547
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:38,043
I'm yours for ever

548
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:40,085
Anda day

549
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:43,031
Now, this is my favourite.

550
00:58:43,077 --> 00:58:45,081
Because it's yellow...

551
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,036
And what it's for...

552
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:53,094
is to catch those itchy little
trimmings that fall down your neck.

553
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:01,062
And then there's this old purple one
that you just kinda...

554
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:04,000
drape around you like this.

555
00:59:06,017 --> 00:59:08,054
I like that one.

556
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:13,059
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.

557
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:17,063
So am I!

558
00:59:20,043 --> 00:59:23,002
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.

559
00:59:23,002 --> 00:59:24,098
And with these hands

560
00:59:26,048 --> 00:59:28,040
I'll provide for you

561
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:33,090
Should there be a stormysea

562
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:38,011
I'll turn the tide for you

563
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:42,041
And I'll never

564
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,083
Oh no, I'll never

565
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:52,025
I'll never let you go

566
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:58,022
Aagghh!

567
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:04,060
Edward!

568
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,027
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

569
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:22,020
Velcro, sweetheart.

570
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,020
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

571
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,029
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

572
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:30,050
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

573
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:33,029
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

574
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,088
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

575
01:00:35,088 --> 01:00:39,068
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

576
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,064
Great.

577
01:00:41,064 --> 01:00:45,064
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

578
01:00:45,093 --> 01:00:49,089
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

579
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:52,048
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

580
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:55,052
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

581
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:57,044
I've never done it myself,

582
01:00:57,044 --> 01:01:01,049
but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

583
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:05,045
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

584
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:06,095
The bank?

585
01:01:07,016 --> 01:01:10,012
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourseIf started.

586
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:15,088
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

587
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:18,067
Yeah.

588
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,043
No credit,

589
01:01:22,063 --> 01:01:25,014
no record ofjobs you've held,

590
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,093
no savings,

591
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:29,035
no personal investments...

592
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:33,040
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

593
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,048
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

594
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:39,099
But don't the testimonials count?

595
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:43,082
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

596
01:01:43,095 --> 01:01:45,099
We simply can't do it.

597
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:50,058
Now, get yourseIf a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourseIf a car.

598
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:55,017
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard...

599
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:57,063
and park anywhere you like.

600
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:03,001
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

601
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:07,051
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

602
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:14,048
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.

603
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:18,019
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

604
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:21,061
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

605
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:23,028
I don't want to.

606
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:27,087
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

607
01:02:27,087 --> 01:02:29,049
Why can't you do it?

608
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:32,071
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

609
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:35,008
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

610
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:38,034
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

611
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:41,080
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

612
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,059
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

613
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:48,014
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

614
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,043
Look, I've racked my brain.

615
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:53,073
Don't you want us to have our own van?

616
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:55,039
Well... yeah.

617
01:02:58,056 --> 01:03:00,044
Jim, the lights are on!

618
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:04,036
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

619
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:06,020
In case of burglars.

620
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,070
- You turned offthe alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.

621
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,058
I hate this.

622
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:14,016
Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?

623
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,037
- This person stole from you?
- Shh! Keep it down!

624
01:03:17,037 --> 01:03:19,050
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

625
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,042
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

626
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:26,059
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

627
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:28,047
Come on!

628
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,064
Come on!

629
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,060
OK, come on. Come on.

630
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,090
Come on, come on, come on! Now! Come on!

631
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:07,076
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

632
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,043
No, Jim, we can'tjust leave him here!

633
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,098
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

634
01:04:19,098 --> 01:04:22,031
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

635
01:04:22,065 --> 01:04:24,027
Put me down!

636
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:28,020
Put me down!

637
01:04:52,076 --> 01:04:54,085
We know you're in there!

638
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:59,044
We're in the process of deactivating
the system so that you can come out!

639
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:13,091
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

640
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:17,012
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

641
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:19,004
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

642
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:21,042
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

643
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,033
No. My father would prosecute.

644
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:25,059
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

645
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:28,013
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

646
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:30,059
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

647
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,018
You have to!

648
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:35,064
We wantyourhands high in the air
where we can see them!

649
01:05:41,023 --> 01:05:43,006
Put yourhands up!

650
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,011
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

651
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:52,099
Drop your weapons!

652
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:56,053
I repeat... drop your weapons!

653
01:05:56,091 --> 01:06:01,025
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.

654
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:10,034
If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.
Don't make us do that, buddy.

655
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,038
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

656
01:06:14,026 --> 01:06:15,055
Now!

657
01:06:15,064 --> 01:06:17,064
Looks like we got a psycho.

658
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:19,077
- Prepare to fire!
- Marge) No! No!

659
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:23,069
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

660
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:25,094
Please. We know him.

661
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:29,069
All right. Cuff him.

662
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:40,020
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

663
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,050
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

664
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:46,050
Oh, Edward!

665
01:06:47,013 --> 01:06:48,084
Hello, Edward.

666
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:51,092
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

667
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:55,047
What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?

668
01:06:55,047 --> 01:06:59,081
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.

669
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:02,047
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

670
01:07:02,047 --> 01:07:05,094
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow",

671
01:07:05,094 --> 01:07:07,094
but I never meant stealing.

672
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:12,040
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

673
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,024
Uh-uh. Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap ofthat.

674
01:07:16,024 --> 01:07:18,091
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

675
01:07:18,095 --> 01:07:22,029
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!

676
01:07:22,062 --> 01:07:25,021
Or did somebody put you up to this?

677
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:39,085
Will he be OK, doc?

678
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:45,006
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

679
01:07:45,052 --> 01:07:48,094
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

680
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:52,098
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth,

681
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:55,090
indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

682
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,036
character.

683
01:07:57,036 --> 01:08:01,024
His awareness ofwhat we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

684
01:08:01,062 --> 01:08:04,020
But will he be all right out there?

685
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,012
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

686
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:17,097
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

687
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:26,081
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

688
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:30,056
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

689
01:08:32,011 --> 01:08:35,069
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

690
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:39,015
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

691
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:44,033
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

692
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:02,047
Edward, you stay here.

693
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:05,072
- What do you say in your defence?
- Nothing.

694
01:09:05,072 --> 01:09:09,014
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.

695
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:12,052
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

696
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:16,015
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

697
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:18,099
Huh? What do you have to say for yourself?

698
01:09:18,099 --> 01:09:22,024
- One comment. One comment.
- Later.

699
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:26,066
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'lI see you at our Christmas party...

700
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:29,004
before I get you over for your haircut!

701
01:09:29,004 --> 01:09:33,079
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

702
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:38,009
Well!

703
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:40,092
You may think that, but you're wrong.

704
01:09:45,072 --> 01:09:47,035
You're here.

705
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:52,006
They didn't hurt you, did they?

706
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,019
Were you scared?

707
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:03,053
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

708
01:10:10,087 --> 01:10:13,071
Thank you for not telling them that we...

709
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:15,063
You're welcome.

710
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,055
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

711
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:26,051
I knew it was Jim's house.

712
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:28,081
You... you did?

713
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:31,023
Yes.

714
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,077
Well, then why'd you do it?

715
01:10:37,023 --> 01:10:39,036
Because you asked me to.

716
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:44,057
Kimba!

717
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:46,066
Kimmy! Hey!

718
01:10:55,025 --> 01:10:57,075
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

719
01:10:57,075 --> 01:11:00,009
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.

720
01:11:00,009 --> 01:11:03,059
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?

721
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:06,097
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!

722
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:10,035
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.

723
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:14,048
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

724
01:11:44,097 --> 01:11:49,014
Maybe there's a way you can
replace the drapes and the towels,

725
01:11:49,018 --> 01:11:52,085
but our confidence in you
is not gonna be so easy to replace.

726
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:54,048
Dad...

727
01:11:55,056 --> 01:12:00,036
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down
the street. You find a suitcase full of money.

728
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:05,036
There's nobody around. No human person
is in evidence. What do you do?

729
01:12:05,078 --> 01:12:07,082
A: You keep the money.

730
01:12:08,028 --> 01:12:12,012
B: You use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.

731
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,008
C: You give it to the poor.

732
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:19,000
D: You turn it in to the police.

733
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:22,029
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim...!

734
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:24,034
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

735
01:12:24,034 --> 01:12:25,076
Edward?

736
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:31,010
Hey, how about after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.

737
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,014
You're not seeing Jim tonight?

738
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:34,039
No.

739
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:37,060
We had the coolest show and tell today.

740
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:41,094
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.

741
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:46,015
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.

742
01:12:47,019 --> 01:12:49,095
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.

743
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:55,020
Give it to my loved ones?

744
01:12:58,033 --> 01:13:02,042
Oh, Edward, it does seem that
that's what you should do, but it's not.

745
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:09,068
You dope, everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

746
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:13,060
Good thinking, Kevin.

747
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,002
Well, think about it, you guys.

748
01:13:16,027 --> 01:13:19,081
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what lwould do.

749
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:24,061
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying
to make things easier, so cut the comedy.

750
01:13:25,082 --> 01:13:29,003
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

751
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:31,070
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.

752
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,016
Shut up!

753
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:38,000
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong, living in this family!

754
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:42,046
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

755
01:13:42,046 --> 01:13:46,042
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

756
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,026
I don't think so.

757
01:13:48,026 --> 01:13:51,068
He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

758
01:13:51,068 --> 01:13:53,055
It's a miracle she escaped.

759
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:55,085
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...

760
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:59,022
I know. They've got that
teenage daughter in the house.

761
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:02,023
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...

762
01:14:02,023 --> 01:14:04,002
Can you imagine?

763
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,052
What did you say about the Christmas party?

764
01:14:06,052 --> 01:14:08,065
I said I hoped we could make it.

765
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:10,024
I lied too.

766
01:14:30,055 --> 01:14:33,072
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

767
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:36,014
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

768
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:40,014
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

769
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:45,031
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

770
01:14:45,031 --> 01:14:48,044
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

771
01:14:48,044 --> 01:14:51,069
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

772
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:55,003
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

773
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:58,024
Never you mind, dear.
Just... cut away. Cut away.

774
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:06,083
I saw three ships come sailing by

775
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:09,038
On Christmas day, on Christmas day

776
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:12,013
I saw three ships come sailing by

777
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:14,084
On Christmas day in the morning

778
01:15:22,027 --> 01:15:25,064
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

779
01:15:26,002 --> 01:15:28,048
- More bells?
- More bells. OK.

780
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:32,015
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

781
01:15:32,015 --> 01:15:35,003
Of course I think
we should be having this party.

782
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:39,083
It's just what we need to calm things down,
and... everything'll go back to normal. Hm?

783
01:15:43,054 --> 01:15:46,008
Do you have any more bells, honey?

784
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,011
Hey!

785
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,086
Now you've done it.

786
01:17:39,099 --> 01:17:42,057
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.

787
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:45,070
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.

788
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,045
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!

789
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:50,037
Stay away from her. I mean it!

790
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:54,075
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?

791
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:58,071
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

792
01:17:59,034 --> 01:18:01,097
Stay right there. I'll be right back.

793
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:04,039
On Christmas day in the morning

794
01:18:07,093 --> 01:18:10,006
Get the hell outta here!

795
01:18:10,089 --> 01:18:13,019
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!

796
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:16,069
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?

797
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,082
Where is he?

798
01:18:25,095 --> 01:18:28,074
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.

799
01:18:28,074 --> 01:18:31,008
Are you nuts? I just saw him!

800
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:35,025
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!

801
01:18:36,096 --> 01:18:38,075
Are you serious?

802
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:41,042
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.

803
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:43,097
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!

804
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:54,027
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

805
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:56,090
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.

806
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:59,094
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

807
01:18:59,094 --> 01:19:02,024
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.

808
01:19:02,024 --> 01:19:04,074
I'll go find him.

809
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:23,001
Edward!

810
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:25,009
I'm calling the police!

811
01:20:12,097 --> 01:20:16,035
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.

812
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:19,048
Oh!

813
01:20:26,057 --> 01:20:29,062
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.

814
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,099
Ohh!

815
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,083
- Uh...
- He's not here. Thank you.

816
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:37,087
Oh, dear.

817
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:42,075
Marge) Helen, did you actually see him?

818
01:20:42,075 --> 01:20:44,030
Yes! Look!

819
01:20:50,005 --> 01:20:52,026
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.

820
01:20:52,026 --> 01:20:55,077
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.

821
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:59,044
All right, calm down, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

822
01:20:59,044 --> 01:21:01,011
Just go home.

823
01:21:01,036 --> 01:21:04,061
- A... a demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!

824
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:15,062
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.

825
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:17,091
What time is it?

826
01:21:18,075 --> 01:21:21,033
It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?

827
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:24,075
Mom, where are they?

828
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:29,026
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do I, honey.

829
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:38,060
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us,

830
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,086
I really didn't think things through.

831
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:47,003
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him.

832
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,082
Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.

833
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:56,049
And now I think that maybe...

834
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,046
it might be best if he goes...

835
01:22:01,058 --> 01:22:03,038
back up there.

836
01:22:04,042 --> 01:22:06,092
Because at least there he's safe.

837
01:22:08,096 --> 01:22:11,055
And we'd just... go back to normal.

838
01:22:14,022 --> 01:22:17,081
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

839
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:20,014
Let's get in the car and go look for him.

840
01:22:20,014 --> 01:22:22,023
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.

841
01:22:22,023 --> 01:22:24,015
Oh, for God's sakes!

842
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:26,090
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.

843
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:31,003
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.

844
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:11,061
Police!

845
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:50,048
Edward?

846
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:55,057
Are you OK?

847
01:23:57,003 --> 01:23:58,082
Yes. Are you OK?

848
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:04,096
Where is everybody?

849
01:24:05,054 --> 01:24:07,050
Out looking for you.

850
01:24:13,067 --> 01:24:15,013
Hold me.

851
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,086
I can't.

852
01:24:59,055 --> 01:25:03,006
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward, but...

853
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,060
I have a present for you.

854
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:09,077
Forget holding her hand.

855
01:27:09,077 --> 01:27:12,043
Picture the damage he could do other places.

856
01:27:12,043 --> 01:27:14,069
Yeah. That's sick.

857
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:23,020
Ugh! I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

858
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:25,078
Later. First, take me to her house.

859
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,074
Come on. Don't make me drive.

860
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,033
Just do it!

861
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,091
Jesus. Maybe she was right about you.

862
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:34,000
- Just drive!
- Relax!

863
01:27:38,034 --> 01:27:41,042
- Max) See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

864
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:01,069
Have they caught him yet?

865
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:05,020
- Who?
- Him! That... that cripple.

866
01:28:09,045 --> 01:28:11,062
Let me know when they do.

867
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:15,046
Let us all know, OK?

868
01:28:16,062 --> 01:28:18,042
Like a good boy.

869
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,065
Kevin.

870
01:28:45,003 --> 01:28:47,007
- Urgh!
- Are you OK?

871
01:28:47,049 --> 01:28:49,032
- It's OK.
- Ow!

872
01:28:50,007 --> 01:28:51,083
Ow! Ow!

873
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:55,041
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

874
01:28:59,058 --> 01:29:01,038
Help us!

875
01:29:03,063 --> 01:29:06,034
What are you doing? Get away from him!

876
01:29:13,076 --> 01:29:15,010
Hey...

877
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:17,006
- Let go of me!
- What?

878
01:29:17,006 --> 01:29:18,044
Kevin!

879
01:29:25,057 --> 01:29:28,053
- Get away!
- Edward, come home. Come home!

880
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:01,069
Run.

881
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:32,030
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

882
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:36,081
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

883
01:30:45,048 --> 01:30:47,007
Go on, run.

884
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:55,024
- What happened? ls he dead?
- Did you get him?

885
01:30:55,053 --> 01:30:58,074
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

886
01:30:58,074 --> 01:31:02,046
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

887
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:05,021
It is all over.

888
01:31:05,063 --> 01:31:08,013
Where is he? Where is he?

889
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:13,018
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!

890
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:21,098
Look at that! I don't believe this.

891
01:31:22,094 --> 01:31:25,002
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

892
01:31:25,002 --> 01:31:27,027
No! That's not a good idea.

893
01:32:32,055 --> 01:32:34,030
They're coming?

894
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:39,001
Did I hurt Kevin?

895
01:32:39,026 --> 01:32:42,001
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

896
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:46,094
Edward, I was so afraid.

897
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,023
I thought you were dead.

898
01:32:58,007 --> 01:32:59,057
I didn't.

899
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,067
No!

900
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:20,076
No!

901
01:33:21,026 --> 01:33:22,081
Jim, stop!

902
01:33:23,035 --> 01:33:24,060
No!

903
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,045
No!

904
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:47,033
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

905
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:56,021
Aagh!

906
01:33:58,084 --> 01:34:01,026
Hey! I said stay away from her!

907
01:35:01,074 --> 01:35:03,066
Goodbye.

908
01:35:14,088 --> 01:35:16,092
I love you.

909
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:07,001
Is he in there?

910
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:10,051
He's dead.

911
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,077
The roof caved in on him.

912
01:36:17,073 --> 01:36:19,082
They killed each other.

913
01:36:22,078 --> 01:36:25,003
You can see for yourselves.

914
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,099
See?

915
01:36:38,017 --> 01:36:40,025
I'm goin' home.

916
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:50,055
Joyce...

917
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:10,049
She never saw him again.

918
01:37:12,024 --> 01:37:14,024
Not after that night.

919
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,000
How do you know?

920
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,000
Because I was there.

921
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,000
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

922
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:33,065
No, sweetheart.

923
01:37:34,035 --> 01:37:36,035
I'm an old woman now.

924
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,045
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

925
01:38:14,065 --> 01:38:17,015
How do you know he's still alive?

926
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,030
I... don't know.

927
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:23,070
Not for sure, but...

928
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,050
I believe he is.

929
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:39,000
You see, before he came down here...

930
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,030
it neversnowed.

931
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:49,070
And afterwards...

932
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,095
it did.

933
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:57,045
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.

934
01:39:01,025 --> 01:39:04,035
Sometimes you can still catch me
dancing in it.

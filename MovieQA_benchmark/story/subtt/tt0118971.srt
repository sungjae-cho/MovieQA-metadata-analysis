1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,092
Go on, Barbara.

3
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,681
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.

4
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,851
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

5
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,689
Is that what you did
on the day in question?

6
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,818
No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,903
What happened next, Barbara?

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,740
He told me to sit in the chair
beside his desk.

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,199
Barbara.

10
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,661
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened...

11
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,872
in the next few minutes.

12
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,875
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,879
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

14
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:33,050
Then, before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

15
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,014
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

16
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,101
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

17
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,062
Then, with his hand...

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,857
he started moving back and forth...

19
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,818
farther and farther inside my skirt.

20
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,363
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

21
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,658
that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

22
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,870
I was trying to think of something to say,
but I couldn't.

23
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,789
I was confused, and he just kept on.

24
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,000
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear me.

25
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,669
He just kept on with his hand.

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,505
Then I screamed.

27
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,133
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

28
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,552
Did he try again?

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,346
Not with me.

30
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,139
But with your friends?

31
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,808
Yes.

32
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,479
And after you had told them
what he had done to you...

33
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,276
they told you what he had done to them!

34
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,362
Isn't that true?

35
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,239
Yes.

36
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,285
I have nothing further.

37
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,415
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

38
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,550
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,009
Of course.

40
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,887
This court will be in recess
for 15 minutes.

41
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,477
- Honey, what--?
- Not now, Bernice.

42
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,901
Lomax, what's wrong?

43
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,863
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,990
Why? What are you talking about?

45
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,618
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

46
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,037
Hey, you're my lawyer.

47
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,539
You're here to defend me.

48
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,418
Know what I think? Why not put you on the stand?
You can jerk off for the judge.

49
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,462
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

50
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,903
Well, hell, there you are.

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,531
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,700
Not now, Larry.

53
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:07,455
What's the game plan?
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

54
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,831
Give me a quote.

55
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,041
Fuck off.

56
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,797
Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events.

57
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,717
Speculation, however, was widespread...

58
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,888
that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories...

59
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,598
would come to an end...

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,975
in this courtroom.

61
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,815
It was a nice run, Kev.

62
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,193
Had to close out someday.

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,570
Nobody wins them all.

64
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,219
Have you had any discipline problems...

65
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,262
in math class this year?

66
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,889
No.

67
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,225
No?

68
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,521
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

69
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,148
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,650
No.

71
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,613
Have other teachers asked you
to stay after class?

72
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,073
Once or twice.

73
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,077
- Did they want to talk about your behavior?
- Objection. Immaterial.

74
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,621
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

75
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,623
You may answer the question.

76
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,792
I don't know what the other teachers wanted.

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,877
You'd have to talk to them.

78
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,425
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara?

79
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,720
Maybe a note that...

80
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,263
made fun of Mr. Gettys?

81
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,682
- No.
- No?

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,436
Never called him a disgusting pig monster?

83
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,647
Order.

84
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,608
No.

85
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,278
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.

86
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,115
Objection. We've had plenty of time
for discovery here.

87
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,951
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

88
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,496
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits...

89
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,791
you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

90
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

91
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,382
It's huge hog beast.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,469
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

93
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,763
- Yes, but--
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,058
- It's a joke.
- "He's a huge hog beast.

95
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,728
He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

96
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,066
You're writing about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,194
It was meant to be a joke.

98
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,698
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara...

99
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,408
when your parents were away?

100
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,744
Objection. Your Honor,
this is way out of line.

101
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,371
- Credibility and bias.
- Overruled.

102
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,665
Answer the question.

103
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,043
Yes.

104
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,048
Have you ever heard of a game called
"Special Places"?

105
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,010
You're under oath, Barbara.

106
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,096
A man's career...

107
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,680
his reputation...

108
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,392
his life is on the line.
This is not a joke.

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Have you ever played the game
"Special Places"?

110
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,569
Yes.

111
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,614
Is this game sexual in nature?

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,619
Is this game sexual in nature?

113
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,497
We only played it once.

114
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,208
This special party, Barbara...

115
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:44,338
this was the first time you told the story
about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

116
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,673
Yes.

117
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,260
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

118
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,429
Is there anything else
they may have told me about the party?

119
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,058
Objection. If he has other witnesses,
let him call them.

120
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,060
If I need to call
those other children, I will.

121
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,063
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

122
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,399
Rephrase your question.

123
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,489
You threatened those children, didn't you?

124
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,158
That's not the way it happened.

125
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,495
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

126
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,205
These things did happen.

127
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:23,210
If they didn't, you were going
to tell everyone about this special party.

128
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,837
They happened to me.

129
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,923
So you made up a story. A special story.

130
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,633
A story about a math teacher...

131
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,219
who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

132
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,055
A huge hog beast you didn't like!

133
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,099
That's what really happened, isn't it?

134
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,517
No.

135
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,729
I didn't want to be the only one.

136
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,691
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch--

137
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,068
You leave that girl alone, that's enough.

138
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,363
Bailiff, evict that man.

139
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,240
No further questions, Your Honor.

140
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,659
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

141
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,997
We'll be back here at 9:00 in the morning
and people will behave themselves...

142
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,665
You made me proud.

143
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,918
or find themselves in contempt.

144
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,169
Good evening.

145
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,968
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

146
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,514
- You go, Gators.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,353
In the event that we all get drunk,
let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.

148
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,772
To the best trial lawyer in Alachua County.

149
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,982
Damn straight.

150
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,526
So, Kev, off the record...

151
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,238
how's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys...

152
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,531
through the door of reasonable doubt?

153
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,991
Larry.

154
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,119
Why don't you quit being a party pooper?
Have yourself a drink.

155
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,830
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

156
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,165
Am I right?

157
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,517
I'll drink to that.

158
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,004
No shop talk.

159
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,260
- Pour me another.
- Hey, baby.

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,011
Lomax, you're wild.

161
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,597
I feel one of them nights coming on.

162
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,102
<i>I've seen the Eiffel Tower</i>

163
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>And I've seen the Taj Mahal</i>

164
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,649
<i>And I've even been to China
And I've seen the Great Wall</i>

165
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,652
<i>I've seen the Pacific Ocean
The Statue of Liberty</i>

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,529
I gotta go piss.

167
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,364
- What?
- I gotta go piss.

168
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,616
I gotta go piss!

169
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,868
Okay.

170
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,622
Hurry.

171
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,525
Hey!

172
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,627
<i>Show me your tattoo</i>

173
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,216
Mr. Lomax. Hell of a job today.

174
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,802
I don't want to disturb your party.

175
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,185
"Milton, Chadwick, Waters."

176
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,812
Never heard of it.

177
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,440
What are you going to do?
Sue me?

178
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,776
Actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

179
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,154
We've been following your progress.

180
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,573
From New York?

181
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,491
You've never lost a case.

182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,703
I've had some sympathetic juries.

183
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,164
That's exactly what we're looking for.

184
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,417
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

185
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,299
I tell you, man...

186
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,052
you're pretty damn good.

187
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,054
Your card is great.

188
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,556
And the black thing, you being black....

189
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,641
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

190
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,143
That's just brilliant.

191
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,021
I'm just not drunk enough yet
to fall for it.

192
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,856
I'll buy you a drink when I, uh....

193
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,192
You'd have to start next week.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,905
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging,
you and your wife.

195
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,576
A lump-sum payment, regardless of the verdict,
in the amount of....

196
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,870
Well, hey.

197
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,997
Take a look.

198
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>Please, baby, baby, please</i>

199
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,298
<i>Please, show me your tattoo</i>

200
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,219
<i>Baby</i>

201
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,102
In the name of Lord Jesus...

202
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,939
we refute you, Satan, and cast you out
and go forth with the zeal of the Lord.

203
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,190
Amen.

204
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,235
<i>Romans 16:19 says!</i>

205
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,447
<i>Be excellent in what is good</i>

206
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,618
<i>Be innocent of evil</i>

207
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,622
<i>And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan</i>

208
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,292
<i>God will crush him
Underneath your feet</i>

209
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,256
<i>And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan</i>

210
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,342
<i>God will crush him
Underneath your feet</i>

211
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:49,518
<i>Romans 16:19 says</i>

212
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,858
All the way to New York
just to pick a jury, huh?

213
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,985
Every dog gets his day.

214
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,906
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

215
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,786
I gotta tell you, Ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

216
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,746
Working on Sunday.

217
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,499
Working? Ma, get over it.

218
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,670
Ma. Listen to me. I love my wife.

219
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,007
Okay? I love her all the way.

220
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,508
Just like you.

221
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:26,180
- Let me tell you about New York.
- Let me guess.

222
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,098
Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

223
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,185
It has become a dwelling place of demons.

224
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,811
Revelation 18.

225
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,147
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

226
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,233
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

227
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,403
And what happened to Babylon?

228
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,241
Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgment come.

229
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,953
And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more.

230
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,790
Wish me luck.

231
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,461
Good luck.

232
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,923
I'll miss you.

233
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,219
No. Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

234
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm trying to work with you.

235
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:12,142
They'll be looking for that payment
and if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

236
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,463
Yeah.

237
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,235
Okay, I gotta go.

238
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:28,992
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

239
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,870
Okay. Make the payment.

240
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,628
- Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?
- Yep.

241
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,131
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

242
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,758
What do you say?

243
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,595
Let her sweat a little.

244
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,211
All right, Mr. Clintine,
let me ask you this:

245
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,713
Do you think, as a juror...

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,049
you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold...

247
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,594
about the savings-and-loan industry?

248
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,971
That was a question, sir.

249
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,348
What? Do I like bankers?

250
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,232
Uh, Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

251
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,567
You may.

252
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,779
Dump him.

253
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,617
Let's get rid of Number 4, 6,
and I'd say lose Number 12...

254
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,161
but the prosecutor will fuck up
and do it for us.

255
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,829
Number 6?

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,293
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

257
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,961
She's my first pass.

258
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,921
And 4?

259
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,761
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,514
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

261
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,728
Uh, look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

262
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,106
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

263
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,653
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

264
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,908
He looks like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

265
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,036
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

266
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,913
Number 6...

267
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,581
your favorite...

268
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,917
she's damaged goods.

269
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,295
She's a Catholic schoolteacher, hm?

270
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,214
Believes in human frailty....

271
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,758
No. Something's missing from her.

272
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,468
She's wrong.

273
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,595
She wants on this jury.

274
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,598
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.

275
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,852
How the hell do you know that?

276
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,979
I don't know.

277
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,652
Either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

278
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,612
Walk.

279
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,910
Here's the deal: If I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

280
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,079
Your Honor, may I continue?

281
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,749
We'd like to excuse Jurors 3, 4 and 6.

282
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,220
Hi. You're home early for a change.

283
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>I just happened to find out...</i>

284
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,683
<i>I was pregnant on the same day
that I got the show.</i>

285
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,351
Your mother called.

286
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,354
She has her bad feeling.

287
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,986
Every now and then, she gets one right.

288
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,824
You okay?

289
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,828
Something's up.

290
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,165
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

291
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,711
Kevin.

292
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,963
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

293
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,845
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

294
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,265
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.

295
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,392
Yeah.

296
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,395
Except one.

297
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,105
What?

298
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,943
Kev.

299
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,404
Not fucking guilty!

300
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,242
Oh, my God.
You lying sack of shit.

301
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,327
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury.

302
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,913
Yes!

303
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,457
Thirty-eight minutes.

304
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,752
- You did it!
- My jury. I'm too good.

305
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,258
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.

306
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,676
Sorry to keep you waiting.

307
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,137
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

308
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,473
Good morning, Caprice.

309
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,183
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

310
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,643
Your messages.

311
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,607
Not bad, huh?

312
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,693
You can play it cool if you want...

313
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,863
but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

314
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,907
Thank you.

315
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,327
This is our home office.
We have many international arrangements...

316
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,497
so Mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

317
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,500
- Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.
- Am I good cop or bad cop?

318
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,168
We may not need a good cop.

319
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,920
Oh, I love it.

320
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,133
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

321
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,303
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa....

322
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,514
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

323
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,695
Behind you.

324
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,323
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,909
Please. Kevin Lomax.

326
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,328
- John Milton.
- Nice to meet you.

327
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,669
So?

328
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,712
Have we been treating you well?

329
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,297
Very well, thank you.

330
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,466
And your wife, she had a good time?

331
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,637
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

332
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,682
That's our secret:

333
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,475
Kill you with kindness.

334
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,313
What's your secret?

335
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,482
Uh, I couldn't say.

336
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,942
You were a prosecutor.

337
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,862
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville DA's office.

338
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,617
Sixty-four straight convictions.

339
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,704
What a number.

340
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,622
I like to be in court.

341
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,833
I didn't plea out a lot.

342
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,459
What's that like?

343
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,129
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

344
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,465
Takes a little getting used to.

345
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,011
- Pays better, though, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

346
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,642
That math teacher, the Gettys case.
Now, I hear you were brilliant.

347
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,310
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

348
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,104
Really?

349
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,939
You think your guy was guilty?

350
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,190
I didn't say that.

351
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,775
What'd you say?

352
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,653
How's this:

353
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,032
I began the case with a clear conscience.

354
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,915
I was sure you had a secret.

355
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,129
The men's room.

356
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,798
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

357
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,593
There's a hole in the wall
to the next room.

358
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,220
I spent five years
listening to juries deliberate.

359
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,598
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

360
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,058
Just don't repeat it.

361
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,269
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

362
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,688
My lips are sealed.

363
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,275
You don't really want to go back
to Florida, do you?

364
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,073
Walk with me.

365
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,011
What do you think?

366
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,014
Some people can't handle it.

367
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,017
It's peaceful.

368
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,062
My sentiments exactly.

369
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,110
So fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me, uh, your father, what does he do?

370
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,905
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

371
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,491
My mother raised me.
Just the two of us.

372
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,411
- She never remarried?
- She wasn't married the first time.

373
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,624
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

374
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,252
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

375
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,505
Holy shit.

376
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,716
A little different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

377
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,802
Yes, it is.

378
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,138
Oh, my God.

379
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,722
Your mother...

380
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,641
what's she like?

381
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,853
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.

382
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,648
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

383
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,527
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out.

384
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,571
They do a lot of volunteer work.

385
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,449
Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves.

386
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,703
So they say.

387
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,288
It didn't rub off?

388
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,331
The Book? The Church?

389
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,125
No, I'm on parole.

390
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,587
Early release for time served.

391
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,050
A lot of potential clients down there.

392
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,719
Are we negotiating?

393
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,096
Always.

394
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,892
Can I ask you a question, then?

395
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,103
Why do you need a criminal department?

396
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:26,649
Our clients break the law
like anyone else.

397
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,198
I'm just tired of sending their business
across the street.

398
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,035
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

399
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,956
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

400
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,460
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

401
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,838
What thing is that?

402
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,965
Pressure.

403
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,385
It changes everything. Pressure.

404
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,931
Some people, you squeeze them, they focus.

405
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
Others fold.

406
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,562
Can you summon your talent at will?

407
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,440
Can you deliver on a deadline?

408
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,943
Can you sleep at night?

409
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,321
When do we talk about money?

410
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,530
Money?

411
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,368
Yeah.

412
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,453
That's the easy part.

413
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,623
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.

414
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,376
Got the park right across the street,
and the reservoir.

415
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,754
Best jogging in New York.
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.

416
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,090
Some excellent schools.

417
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,385
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

418
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,553
but, uh, great neighborhood for children.

419
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,014
Great building.

420
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,642
Follow the money all the way to the top.

421
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,145
You got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

422
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,774
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

423
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,404
- You must be Mary Ann.
- Yes, I am.

424
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,448
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

425
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,826
It's nice of you to come by.

426
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,161
Oh, please. We live across the hall.

427
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,539
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

428
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,666
It's just two apartments per floor?

429
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,795
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

430
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,631
Voilà.

431
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,097
Oh, my God.

432
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,309
It's what they call a Classic Eight.

433
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,312
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

434
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,691
We had them paint it white.
Let you see it naked before you pick your palette.

435
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:32,942
What am I picking?

436
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,444
Palette. Your colors.

437
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,279
Oh, yes.

438
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,241
I need to warn you about one thing.

439
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,495
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

440
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,166
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

441
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,626
You must've made quite an impression.

442
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,714
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

443
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,215
Babies.

444
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,511
It took us six years to get in here.

445
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,141
Unbelievable.

446
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,643
- Thank you very much.
- Jackie.

447
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,479
Kevin.

448
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,692
Are you really this good?

449
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,611
I sure as hell hope so.

450
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,239
They must want you pretty bad.

451
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,868
Look, Mar...

452
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,497
I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

453
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,665
If you want to go home...

454
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,542
I'm with you.

455
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,211
Sure.

456
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,714
Let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

457
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,843
You keep scrounging for clients
and I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

458
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,764
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves...

459
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:50,103
in about five years we can afford
a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

460
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,897
Are you shitting me?

461
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,862
I love you.

462
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,198
I love you too.

463
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,829
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

464
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,498
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

465
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,125
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

466
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,043
I run the Islamic subgroup.

467
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,171
Joyce Rensaleer, Mergers and Acquisitions.

468
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,841
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director...

469
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,926
and Real Estate.

470
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,096
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

471
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,391
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...

472
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,852
EC and G7.

473
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,313
There it is, Kevin.

474
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,149
The whole team.

475
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,360
Welcome to Milton, Chadwick and Waters.

476
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,488
So, what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

477
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,157
I guess it'll do.

478
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,992
Until something better comes along?

479
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,910
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

480
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,787
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

481
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,248
Pam was at the Brooklyn DA's office 14 years...

482
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,876
so she knows her way
around the local scene.

483
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,170
You'll expedite his bar application?

484
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,465
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work <i>pro hac vice.</i>

485
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,176
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

486
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,430
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

487
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,848
The Moyez case?

488
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,976
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

489
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,041
What do you think?

490
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,002
It's a health-code case
and it's a loser.

491
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,672
So, what's the point?

492
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,093
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

493
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,221
Isn't everything?

494
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,600
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

495
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,687
with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

496
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,523
Lovely, isn't it?

497
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,485
And, uh, this is about what?

498
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,237
The price?

499
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,949
Oh, it's about, uh, 2000 a panel.

500
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,494
We'll take it. At 1400.

501
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,746
You made it.

502
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,373
Hey, baby.

503
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,458
I thought you said it was impossible.

504
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,336
I thought you said it was important.

505
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,552
<i>Go get them.</i>

506
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,512
<i>Go get them, man.</i>

507
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,098
Tell him, "Cut that shit down."

508
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,185
I know what they're doing over there.
That's right.

509
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,147
Tell him, "Take all that noise
back to Africa."

510
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,536
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Philippe Moyez.

511
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,216
Look, I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.

512
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,970
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?

513
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,055
Show him your boots.

514
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,810
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

515
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,437
In the dark?

516
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,373
Where do you think I'm taking you?

517
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,619
I thought I would recognize you...

518
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,913
but I do not.

519
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,083
Mr. Moyez?

520
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,503
We've never met.

521
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

522
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,801
I'm here about the animals.

523
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,806
We have an investment in blood.

524
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,976
Think of it as spiritual currency.

525
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,314
Spiritual currency.

526
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,027
Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going
to need your help with this.

527
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,117
What is the name of the man...

528
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,995
who will prosecute us?

529
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,664
Merto.

530
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,376
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

531
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,049
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

532
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,427
With this tongue, we create silence.

533
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,137
You can go now.

534
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,056
You will have all the help...

535
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,266
I can give you...

536
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,477
against Monsieur Merto.

537
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,696
It's arbor green.
What do you think?

538
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,074
Not with your complexion.

539
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,205
New York City health codes.

540
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,792
- That's all of it?
- Not quite.

541
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,840
Thanks.

542
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,303
Caribbean green.

543
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,306
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

544
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,308
A cooler green.

545
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:26,272
Too institutional.

546
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,190
I love green.

547
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,487
I love it but it's one thing to wear it
and another to have it on your walls.

548
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,077
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

549
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,958
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

550
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,543
Good night.

551
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,817
This is the first time
since I've been 13 years old I don't have a job...

552
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,694
or two.

553
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,489
I feel like I'm floating around
in that place.

554
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,241
You know, just drifting around or something.

555
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,204
You'll settle in.

556
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,081
We had this little office in the condo....

557
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,274
Thanks.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,670
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.

559
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,758
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on....

560
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,970
If I want to see Leamon...

561
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,889
I make an appointment.

562
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,556
You're kidding, right?

563
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,903
God, how do you handle it?

564
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,364
Take a look around, honey.

565
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:01,242
Look, you've got three choices.

566
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,494
The Holy Trinity:

567
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,746
You can work...

568
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,290
you can play...

569
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,793
or you can breed.

570
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,171
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

571
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,424
USDA approved and stamped.

572
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,511
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

573
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,639
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

574
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,016
He killed a goat.

575
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
And he did it at home...

576
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,815
in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

577
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,734
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

578
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,739
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

579
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,825
It's not as common as, say...

580
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,577
circumcision.

581
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,954
It's not as common as the belief that...

582
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,207
wine transforms into blood.

583
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,545
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

584
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,256
Some people walk on fire.

585
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,216
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

586
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,051
And he did it...

587
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,180
while observing his constitutionally protected...

588
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,390
religious beliefs.

589
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,062
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats...

590
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,649
or transporting goats or goat licensing.

591
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,653
The city was less concerned
with the care of the animals...

592
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,197
than the manner with which
they were slaughtered.

593
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,657
Objection!

594
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,493
Okay. Enough, enough. I got it.

595
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,203
Let's wrap it up.

596
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,997
Your Honor...

597
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,334
the city timed this police action
to catch my client...

598
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:38,088
exercising his constitutionally protected right
to religious freedom.

599
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,716
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.

600
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,426
Exactly, Your Honor.

601
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,971
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

602
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,808
I happen to know a little bit
about kashruth law, Mr. Lomax.

603
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,644
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

604
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,272
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

605
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,232
Mr. Merto?

606
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,738
- Your Honor--
- Mr. Merto.

607
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,699
For God's sake, man....

608
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,543
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks.

609
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,381
Bravo! Bravo!

610
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,967
Pamela, you look lovely.

611
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,176
So, Philippe...

612
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,511
satisfied?

613
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,596
Always, Jean.

614
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,847
Kevin.

615
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,933
What can I say?

616
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,111
Outstanding.

617
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,439
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...

618
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,942
living in some subterranean shithole...

619
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,029
all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

620
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,614
You're kidding.

621
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,200
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

622
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,371
Tarzan, we're billing you out
at 400 an hour, my friend.

623
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,916
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

624
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,044
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.

625
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,046
Maybe I did.

626
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,591
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

627
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,636
don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

628
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,888
You've gotta keep yourself small.

629
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,181
Innocuous.

630
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,808
Be the little guy.

631
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,227
You know, the nerd, the leper...

632
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,397
the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

633
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,943
Underestimated from day one.

634
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,864
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

635
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,784
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

636
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,161
What's that?

637
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,246
It's the look.

638
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,207
That Florida stud thing. What is that?

639
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,210
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

640
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,589
Never worked a jury that didn't have a woman.

641
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,340
You know what you're missing?

642
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,593
You're missing what I have.

643
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:52,347
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday...

644
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,101
we're done, she's walking to the bathroom,
trying to walk...

645
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,353
she turns...

646
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,646
she looks...

647
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,607
it's me.

648
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,194
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

649
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,863
She gets this look on her face like:

650
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,199
"How the hell did that happen?"

651
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,412
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

652
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,998
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

653
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,125
They don't see me coming.

654
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,794
That's what you're missing.

655
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,213
- Where's the chicken?
- What?

656
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,811
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe...

657
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,772
never loses. He's famous.

658
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,934
Never loses, like you.

659
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,319
Tic-tac-toe.

660
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,655
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

661
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,699
Learn the subways, Kevin.

662
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,535
Use them.

663
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,745
Stay in the trenches.

664
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,164
Only way I travel.

665
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,168
Mar?

666
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,715
What happened to the green?

667
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,717
- I loved the green.
- Honey, you're late.

668
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,846
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

669
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,514
What's all this?

670
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,765
All what?

671
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,602
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

672
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,814
- All this?
- Oh, that.

673
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,816
It was going to be a nursery...

674
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,319
then I remembered you'd have to be home
long enough to knock me up.

675
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,698
So now I'm thinking of building a law library.

676
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,117
Oh, baby.

677
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,454
Oh, tell me I can handle this.

678
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,206
You can handle this.

679
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,834
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

680
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,799
Promise me you won't leave me alone in there.

681
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,843
I promise.

682
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,184
There you are.

683
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,603
Hi.

684
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,314
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

685
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,191
Nice to meet you, sorry we're late.

686
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,360
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

687
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,612
All hail.

688
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:15,282
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

689
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,784
Well, Kevin, here they are.

690
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,788
Top of the food chain
and dinner is served.

691
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,582
I throw these parties twice a year.

692
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,503
Stock market, real estate, politics.
They're all players, and they're all prospects.

693
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,216
Kevin, congratulations.
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

694
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,550
Congratulations.

695
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,636
Bright young lights.

696
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,389
Oh, oh, you're going to like this.
Come on.

697
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,808
Somebody I want you to meet.

698
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,604
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

699
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,231
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

700
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,567
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

701
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,320
Barzoon always overstates things.

702
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,698
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

703
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,033
Probably Mort Zuckerman.

704
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,036
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

705
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,621
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

706
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,665
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

707
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,125
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

708
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,002
Excuse me. This is important.

709
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,464
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

710
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,967
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

711
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,760
- I was married to him.
- Oh, really?

712
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,970
Kidding.

713
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,476
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

714
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,603
- He's new to the firm.
- Nice to meet you.

715
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,648
The senator cannot leave.

716
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,984
Who's that with the senator?

717
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,237
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

718
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,072
No, who is he?

719
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,533
I swear he can hear us.

720
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,618
Hell, he can smell us.

721
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,912
Mary Ann...

722
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,372
John Milton.

723
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,667
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

724
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,003
Already swimming with the sharks.

725
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,088
Careful, hon.

726
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:56,992
Harry, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

727
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,428
These parties don't come cheap.

728
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,306
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

729
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,225
Just get it on tape.

730
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,687
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

731
00:44:09,455 --> 00:44:13,150
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

732
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,360
buys a few new suits...

733
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,280
learns a few new tricks...

734
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:19,740
he's there.

735
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,450
It's you. What about you?

736
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,203
Your family, you've got to miss them. No?

737
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:31,209
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

738
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,670
I can relate.

739
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,673
I can, believe me.

740
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,843
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

741
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,851
The worst vice is advice.

742
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,148
But may I make a suggestion?

743
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,026
It's a sensitive....

744
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,238
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

745
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,824
No, go ahead.

746
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,952
- I mean, you don't like it?
- No.

747
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,789
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

748
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,832
It's just....

749
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,835
It doesn't belong to you.

750
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,088
You're too alive for a perm.

751
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,423
It's not you.

752
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,093
You should pull your hair back.

753
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,472
Do it. See what happens.

754
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,183
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

755
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,568
Is that so terrible?

756
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,521
I'd love to do it, but if I did...

757
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,732
everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us...

758
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,945
would naturally assume
we were fucking or something.

759
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,449
Please.

760
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,205
Okay.

761
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,759
It's fun to be right.

762
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,555
Excuse me.

763
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,142
It's a vision.

764
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,646
You've gotta cut your hair.

765
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,483
Are you serious?

766
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:23,697
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

767
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,575
And her neck...

768
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,162
if she's alive...

769
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,499
has all the mystery of a border town.

770
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,920
A no man's land...

771
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,090
in that battle...

772
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,510
between the mind and the body.

773
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,888
You know...

774
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,224
your natural color would really...

775
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,852
bring out your eyes.

776
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,702
Do you have this view?

777
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,078
Sorry?

778
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,456
From your terrace, do you have this view?

779
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,834
Not exactly.

780
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,378
No terrace and I'm about...

781
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,631
12 floors down.

782
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,508
What about you?

783
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,385
No, I live downtown.

784
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,471
This is a...

785
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,764
family building.

786
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,226
Sounds like fun.

787
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,729
Downtown, I mean.

788
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,398
I'm just getting to know the city.

789
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,817
Is it everything you expected?

790
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,444
More.

791
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,739
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

792
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,534
Excuse me, Jackie.

793
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,035
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

794
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,704
No. I'm sure he's around.

795
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,073
Okay, thanks.

796
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,042
Are you alone?

797
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,005
You mean, tonight?

798
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,552
Is your wife a jealous woman, Mr. Lomax?

799
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,644
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

800
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,771
No. No, really...

801
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,189
I'm fine.

802
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,941
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.

803
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,609
Bet you like to be on top.

804
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,529
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

805
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,781
Of the situation.

806
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,285
You prefer to be on top, right?

807
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,371
Depends on the view.

808
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,792
You know what I see?

809
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,379
I see the future...

810
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,339
of this law firm.

811
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,192
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

812
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,405
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

813
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,992
Bring them up to my place.
Do it quietly.

814
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,619
Quickly.

815
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,706
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

816
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,083
We'll plant a story
and destroy his credibility.

817
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,793
Pam, have you seen Kevin?

818
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,713
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

819
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,883
If he doesn't come to us,
he'll regret it.

820
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,696
Come on.

821
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,918
Is there more to it?

822
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,837
Just this room.

823
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,924
And a bedroom?

824
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,802
Nope. No bedroom.

825
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,471
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

826
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,722
Where does he fuck?

827
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,849
Everywhere.

828
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,019
What's up, John?

829
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,564
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

830
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,194
16,242.

831
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,196
What did he do now?

832
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:37,784
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

833
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,619
her stepson...

834
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,287
and a maid.

835
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,749
When did this happen?

836
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,626
Just now. Tonight.

837
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,921
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

838
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,298
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

839
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,093
They're gonna line up.
I gotta call Meisel.

840
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,221
Uh, no, no, no.
I want Kevin on this case.

841
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,516
I hope you're kidding.

842
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:10,191
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder
with, excuse me, Kevin?

843
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,527
You're dreaming.

844
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,365
You know, I've shaken hands...

845
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,952
with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

846
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,247
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

847
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,584
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

848
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:32,547
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

849
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,841
I want you on board, Eddie.

850
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:41,139
I, uh, appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

851
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,309
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

852
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,811
He's a business client.

853
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,063
We know him better than he knows himself.

854
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,232
We've got the inside track.

855
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,612
We've got the best damn trial lawyer in the city.
It's ours to lose.

856
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,822
Well.

857
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,908
Tell that to Cullen.

858
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,327
I want Kevin to tell him.

859
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,330
There's Pam.

860
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,084
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

861
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,719
Pam?

862
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,095
No, it's Kevin.

863
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,100
Hi. No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah.

864
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,769
Where are we at?

865
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,070
You left me there.

866
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,949
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

867
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,203
Three hours, you don't even call?

868
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,746
Stop.

869
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,289
Reset.

870
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:52,126
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

871
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:56,381
There's a good possibility I'm about
to catch a triple-homicide defendant...

872
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:57,924
who also happens to be...

873
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,761
one of the largest real-estate developers
in this city.

874
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,556
Mar, I had to bail on the party.

875
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,433
You bailed on me.

876
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,477
Mar.

877
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,689
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself.

878
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,357
For three whole hours.

879
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,360
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it.

880
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,028
You gotta be kidding me, right?

881
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,490
Go to hell.
And you can go to sleep on the fucking couch!

882
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,247
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

883
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,623
Look at this.

884
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,544
I'm not out 20 minutes,
and I'm being followed by the press.

885
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:35,753
They're like insects.

886
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,090
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?

887
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:45,388
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ.

888
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,390
This is my ass we're talking about, John.

889
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,600
Eddie?

890
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,645
Alex, you know how this town works.

891
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:57,775
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

892
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,445
Now, with this...

893
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,530
now that you're down...

894
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,407
I'd get ready for one of those...

895
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,002
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

896
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,203
You know what's coming.

897
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,248
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
who do you trust?

898
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,958
Who do you trust, Alex?

899
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,293
I don't know.

900
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,295
I'm gonna have to look around.

901
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,301
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

902
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:27,180
Jury selection started this morning
at every breakfast table in the city.

903
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,265
This is what people know:

904
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,601
Three dead bodies.

905
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,311
You discover the crime.

906
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:37,857
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

907
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,818
And, Mr. Cullen....

908
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,863
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

909
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,615
How do you know that?

910
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,576
There's a second print in blood.

911
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,080
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

912
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,417
I have keys. I called the cops from the house.
I touched the goddamn wall.

913
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,127
I panicked. I was panicked.

914
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,338
We need 12 people who can see
past all that.

915
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,508
- I touched the goddamn wall.
- I'd get in front of this fast.

916
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:06,469
I panicked. Is that a crime?

917
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,888
I didn't kill anybody.

918
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,183
This is a nightmare.

919
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,812
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

920
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,898
He's right, Alex.

921
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,483
People need to hear these things.

922
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,027
Christ, Eddie. Jesus.

923
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,739
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

924
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,533
We'll move over.

925
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,952
But right now, this moment...

926
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,579
you need immediate representation.

927
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,665
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

928
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,418
who I care more about
than anything in this world.

929
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,421
They wouldn't let me talk to her from downtown.

930
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,798
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out.

931
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,385
We need to issue a statement.

932
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,722
He's a winner, Alex.

933
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,473
Just like you were.

934
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,393
And they'll never see him coming.

935
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,230
Jesus Christ.

936
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,778
I've got some, uh, tough phone calls
I've got to....

937
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,616
All right.

938
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,704
My place, tomorrow.

939
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,330
Alone.

940
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:24,172
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

941
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,516
Not if they were giving it away.

942
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,811
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

943
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,855
- Andrea?
- Yes?

944
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,398
Another one of these, please.

945
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,733
Right away.

946
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,778
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes....

947
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,614
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.

948
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,784
Get another bottle of chardonnay
for Mrs. Barzoon and Mrs. Heath.

949
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,953
Oh, Lord, this is $3000.

950
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,705
You know what you should do?

951
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,665
You should buy it...

952
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,543
wear it once, and then throw it away.

953
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,504
That will loosen you up.

954
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,299
I say spend it all.

955
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,095
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

956
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,138
I swear...

957
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:18,726
if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off...

958
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,604
he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

959
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,815
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

960
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,651
he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

961
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,402
Who does it better than that?

962
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,030
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

963
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,201
Not too big....

964
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,328
Perfect.

965
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,414
Real or not?

966
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,459
They look real.

967
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,937
They must be real.

968
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,006
Feel them.

969
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,716
Oh, no, it's okay, really.

970
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,636
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

971
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,432
Feel real?

972
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,892
Yes, absolutely real.

973
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,854
Dr. Robert.

974
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,859
When you're ready.

975
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,588
Oh, God.

976
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,926
So, what do you think?

977
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,889
I don't care if they can hear me.

978
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,850
I don't care!

979
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,603
I don't like it here, Kevin.

980
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,023
And these women. My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.

981
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,317
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

982
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,985
- Calm down.
- No!

983
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,653
- Listen to me. Mar.
- No!

984
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,030
Mar!

985
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,865
First....

986
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,868
You do this radical thing to your hair.

987
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,037
Oh, you hate it.

988
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,914
Stop. I think it's fine.

989
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,876
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

990
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,714
You've got the pressure of fitting in
with new friends.

991
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,841
A new place.

992
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,844
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No.

993
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,223
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

994
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,851
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy...

995
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,186
or anything like that.

996
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:27,772
Because I know that's what
you're gonna say.

997
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,690
What about Kathy?

998
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,609
What about your sister?

999
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,779
What about her?
She's pregnant again.

1000
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,615
That's got nothing to do with this?

1001
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,454
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

1002
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:48,209
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

1003
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,710
If you can believe it...

1004
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:53,089
I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

1005
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,258
What about the apartment?

1006
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,093
Goddamn you!

1007
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,303
Why do you always change things around?

1008
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:03,307
This is not about the apartment.
I hate this stupid place!

1009
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,560
You know...

1010
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,355
you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

1011
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,731
It's a little more than that.

1012
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,401
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

1013
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:18,030
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not.

1014
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:22,368
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

1015
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,662
And God....

1016
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,172
I am so lonely.

1017
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,884
I miss you so much.

1018
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,470
I'm sorry, baby.

1019
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,640
I don't know what to do.

1020
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,061
Let's make a baby.

1021
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:54,734
Don't tease me.

1022
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,736
I wouldn't do that.

1023
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,238
Not unless you asked.

1024
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,703
Oh, baby.

1025
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,561
Do you have this view?

1026
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,844
Kevin.

1027
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,763
Make love to me.

1028
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,684
Kevin. What are you doing?

1029
01:03:21,906 --> 01:03:23,132
Stop. Stop.

1030
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,302
Oh, God.

1031
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,929
God. Where are you?

1032
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,891
I'm right here.

1033
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,768
No, you're not.

1034
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,779
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

1035
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,783
Because I need to know
and understand exactly...

1036
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,785
what happened.

1037
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,372
You're standing there, you look down...

1038
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,166
there's the gun.

1039
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,127
Uh, I don't know why I picked it up.

1040
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:03,214
Uh, it was before I saw Lucinda's body.

1041
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,175
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1042
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:11,013
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead.

1043
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,723
It's not something you plan for.

1044
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,267
Stop. Back up.

1045
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,854
Two prints by the gun.

1046
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,690
"Right hand.

1047
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,359
Right knee."

1048
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,028
Right knee.

1049
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,947
We've been over this.

1050
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:29,782
I'm trying to picture it.

1051
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,158
Your hand....

1052
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,118
Your hand came from...

1053
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,331
inside and underneath?

1054
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:43,212
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

1055
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,683
There. Did you see it?
Was it clear?

1056
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,184
You got it?

1057
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,769
Whose gun is that?

1058
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,230
- It's mine.
- Are you out of your mind?

1059
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:04,733
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun?

1060
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,236
I have had nine death threats.

1061
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,905
Give it over. Give me the gun.

1062
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,532
I gotta protect myself.

1063
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,203
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

1064
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,208
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1065
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:33,929
Okay.

1066
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,514
Let's wrap it up.

1067
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,057
So, what's next?

1068
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,644
We need to talk to your assistant, Mrs. Black.

1069
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:41,895
Call her.

1070
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,982
You feel confident she'll back you
on the time?

1071
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,527
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,447
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

1073
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,948
Okay.

1074
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,285
We're going to talk to her...

1075
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,122
and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

1076
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,042
All right?

1077
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,588
No comment.

1078
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,717
There they are.

1079
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,846
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1080
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,932
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

1081
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,478
Look over here. Are you really going
to plead Cullen not guilty?

1082
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:23,979
What is happening?

1083
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:27,399
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1084
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:31,862
Well, he always did like
to stick his nose in the camera.

1085
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,697
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

1086
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,741
Mrs. Lomax, did you have a nice dinner?

1087
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,118
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1088
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,788
Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.

1089
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,456
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

1090
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,124
Speak of the devil.

1091
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,421
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

1092
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:50,923
Really?

1093
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,175
This is your mother?

1094
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,968
Yes, Mom, this is...

1095
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,720
- John Milton.
- John Milton.

1096
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,223
Alice Lomax.

1097
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,767
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1098
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,478
How do you do?

1099
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,730
Mary Ann.

1100
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,024
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

1101
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,610
This is, uh....

1102
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,487
I believe you met Christabella.

1103
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,114
Yes, I think we did.

1104
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,782
And Gizelle.

1105
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,450
Fresh in from Paris.

1106
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:19,660
Great.

1107
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,664
Nice to meet you.

1108
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,752
Three for you and my place.

1109
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,087
Thanks for the champagne.

1110
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,631
Oh, you're very welcome, Kevin.

1111
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,053
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

1112
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,183
Yes.

1113
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,694
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

1114
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,364
And I'm sure it wasn't easy.

1115
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,743
No.

1116
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,498
- Mom, we're here.
- Yes.

1117
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,417
- Good night to you.
- Good night.

1118
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,003
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary Ann.

1119
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,797
Kevin, hang on.

1120
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,884
Oh, how about Cullen?
How's it going?

1121
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,677
Everything on beam?

1122
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,096
That's a long conversation.

1123
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,265
Want to come up and tell me?

1124
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,267
Now?

1125
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,359
Let's talk tomorrow.

1126
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,489
You sure?

1127
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:39,782
Yeah.

1128
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,125
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

1129
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:54,838
- What're you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1130
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,882
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1131
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,258
I'm going to bed.

1132
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,719
- Good night, Alice.
- Night.

1133
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,943
Oh, shit.

1134
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,113
Mom.

1135
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,573
Mom, what are you doing?

1136
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,075
I'm going home.

1137
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,035
What? What are you talking about?

1138
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,371
I don't feel right.

1139
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:30,374
Look, you just got here.

1140
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,711
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

1141
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,673
We'll talk later, okay?

1142
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,050
Okay?

1143
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,638
I have to go, Kevin.

1144
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,265
I miss my church.

1145
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,769
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.

1146
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,856
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.

1147
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,024
She is not well.

1148
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,777
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

1149
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,571
Take care of her,
if you're so concerned.

1150
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,240
Help me out.

1151
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,367
I'll take her home if you let me.

1152
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,953
This is home. Understand?

1153
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,454
This is where we live.

1154
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,748
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1155
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,834
Unbelievable.

1156
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,502
Wide is the gate...

1157
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,797
and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation.

1158
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,674
It's a little early for Scripture.

1159
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,051
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1160
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,994
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1161
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:52,581
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

1162
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,667
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

1163
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,086
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

1164
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,463
Tell you what, Melissa.

1165
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:02,966
Let's talk to her first.
See where she stands and take it from there.

1166
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:05,177
I'll make sure Melissa
gets down to the car.

1167
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:08,347
- Thanks, Pam.
- Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1168
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,725
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1169
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,394
That's why we're all working so hard.

1170
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,605
Thank you.

1171
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:20,192
Can I have the car stop at my ex-husband's?

1172
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,903
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1173
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,618
George, remember,
no shredding in the building trash.

1174
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,578
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes, sir.

1175
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,831
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?

1176
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,376
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1177
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,836
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus....

1178
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,630
Mark. No, no, no.

1179
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:45,509
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1180
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,263
I thought I was the only one working late.

1181
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,060
Well, so did we.

1182
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,355
Back to work. This is not a break.

1183
01:11:58,523 --> 01:11:59,564
Good news.

1184
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,901
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks like a great alibi.

1185
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,237
What a pleasant surprise.

1186
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,366
Looks like you've got your hands full.

1187
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,410
Oh, it's just a little, um...

1188
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,495
housekeeping.

1189
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,123
If anyone should ask...

1190
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,500
you never saw this.

1191
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,043
Who would ask?

1192
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:23,839
- Uh, Weaver.
- Who's that?

1193
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,634
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

1194
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,222
- You don't know about Weaver?
- Sorry.

1195
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,891
How nice for you.

1196
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:39,730
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

1197
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,023
Title fight.

1198
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,150
Roy Jones Jr.

1199
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,694
- I'd have to call Mary Ann.
- Do it on the way.

1200
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,698
Get my message?

1201
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,200
I did. You write beautifully.

1202
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:58,165
What's this Weaver Commission?

1203
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,669
I don't like to micro-manage.
Find the talent, then delegate.

1204
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,630
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

1205
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,842
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

1206
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:10,969
Excuse me.

1207
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,346
What the fuck are you looking at?

1208
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,349
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1209
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,060
I hear you fine.

1210
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,936
So get the fuck out of my car.

1211
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:24,232
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1212
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,984
Motherfucker, I'm telling you...

1213
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,278
- get the fuck out of my car--
- Shit.

1214
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:32,074
Get out before I cut your throat.
Fuck that.

1215
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,558
How do you know--?

1216
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,775
Enjoy yourself. You still got time.

1217
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,278
There's a train coming the, uh, other way.
You'll just catch it.

1218
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,405
You'll thank me in the morning.

1219
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,075
- You ain't right, man.
- Oh, I'm right.

1220
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,409
You'll see.

1221
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,079
Invigorating.

1222
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,124
What did you say to him?

1223
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:27,212
I told him if he didn't leave us alone,
you'd kick his ass.

1224
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:30,507
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

1225
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,261
Get some! You wanna lose?
You are on!

1226
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:38,765
No, no, no.
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now.

1227
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,318
Fixed!

1228
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:59,286
- What a beauty.
- I'm glad you could come.

1229
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:03,039
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
here: Kevin Lomax.

1230
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,625
- Kevin Lomax. How are you?
- I'm well.

1231
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,438
And say what?

1232
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,690
He's the senior partner at the--

1233
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,403
Mar, you're really starting to piss me off.

1234
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,789
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1235
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,460
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not--

1236
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,712
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1237
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,924
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1238
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,812
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

1239
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,816
The food, the heat, the rent
on that enormous apartment we live in.

1240
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,819
I live there too.

1241
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,238
Mar.

1242
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,700
Give it back to me.

1243
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,162
I play the trumpet too.

1244
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:25,997
Kevin.

1245
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,209
Babs Coleman.

1246
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:30,835
Kevin Lomax.

1247
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,922
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1248
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:37,342
There's Tiffany. New additions.
Where are you from?

1249
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,594
Don't tell me.

1250
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,097
Michigan.

1251
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:45,058
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

1252
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:46,685
How did he know?

1253
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,020
That is so good.

1254
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,911
Cheers.

1255
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,097
Kevin?

1256
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,025
Honey?

1257
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,840
Hello?

1258
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,301
Who's there?

1259
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,762
I got a knife.

1260
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,203
Oh, Jesus.

1261
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:36,544
Baby...

1262
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,005
how'd you get here?

1263
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,467
Are you okay?

1264
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,137
Oh, God.

1265
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,142
Where's your mommy?

1266
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,730
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1267
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,233
What are you playing with?

1268
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,444
What are you playing with?

1269
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,988
Oh, God!

1270
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,371
Oh, God! No! God!

1271
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,505
Baby, please.

1272
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,924
Baby, there is no blood.

1273
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,760
There is no blood. It was a dream.

1274
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,345
It was a dream.

1275
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,099
It's not a dream if it's true.

1276
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:37,147
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

1277
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,440
No.

1278
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,442
I know you.

1279
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,279
You'll leave me now for sure.

1280
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,282
No! Get away from me.

1281
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,700
Okay.

1282
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,954
Okay, I'm-- I'm confused.

1283
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,456
Why?

1284
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,791
What is it now?

1285
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,753
Did you like the green?

1286
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,922
You did, didn't you?

1287
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,591
We should go back to the green.

1288
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,385
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1289
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:09,471
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1290
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,640
What?

1291
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,018
They took my ovaries!

1292
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,312
I told you. Right here.

1293
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,899
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1294
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:28,698
My sisters have seven children between them.

1295
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,953
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

1296
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,748
You could've set a clock by my periods.

1297
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:37,999
Baby...

1298
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,877
what are you talking about?

1299
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,964
Kevin, I can't have children.

1300
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,424
What?

1301
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,301
Says who?

1302
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,264
The doctor.

1303
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,017
I was there yesterday.

1304
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,271
Non-specific ovarian failure.

1305
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:03,858
That's ridiculous.

1306
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,196
Oh, God.

1307
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,658
Did you just hear that?

1308
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,785
Listen.

1309
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,205
Can you hear that?

1310
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:21,292
No.

1311
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,715
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

1312
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,052
Mary Ann.

1313
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,221
I know you.

1314
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,390
God....

1315
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,894
No, Kevin.

1316
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,813
It's these monsters.

1317
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,233
I dreamt about this.

1318
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:47,902
Baby, I gotta take this.

1319
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,071
No, you've gotta listen to me.

1320
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:52,282
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Why do--?

1321
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:53,908
I gotta take this.

1322
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,495
It's going to be okay.

1323
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,667
Yeah.

1324
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,712
Fuck!

1325
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,298
I knew the DA was holding out on us.

1326
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,259
Get the discovery package over here, right now.

1327
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,220
I don't care. Find Cullen.

1328
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,399
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

1329
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,902
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

1330
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:32,864
You better have a good reason
for calling me out.

1331
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,117
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

1332
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:39,495
She says, and I quote:
"Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."

1333
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,539
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

1334
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:42,957
Wrong answer.

1335
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,460
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

1336
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:48,212
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1337
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,590
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1338
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,217
That's a motive, Alex.

1339
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,346
What do I need to know?

1340
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,481
Melissa, my assistant.

1341
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,359
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1342
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,402
And...

1343
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,738
on the night in question?

1344
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:25,166
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1345
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,215
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1346
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:35,760
No, forget it.
We're not telling that story.

1347
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:39,597
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1348
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,060
- Alessandra, wait.
- Alex--

1349
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,437
- Alessandra.
- Alex.

1350
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,356
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please.

1351
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,233
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

1352
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,277
- Alex.
- I can't.

1353
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,948
This isn't fair.
I had 15 more minutes.

1354
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,951
You'll just have to wait until next week.

1355
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,996
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1356
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,125
For sleep.

1357
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,502
And she can take that during the day?

1358
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,671
No, she won't be driving.

1359
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:14,674
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1360
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:19,137
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1361
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,389
I'm taking you off the case.

1362
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:22,640
What?

1363
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,517
I want you to drop this case.

1364
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,686
This case? Cullen?

1365
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:29,731
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

1366
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,858
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1367
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,276
She's sick.

1368
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:36,612
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.

1369
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,281
What about Cullen?

1370
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,324
We find somebody new.

1371
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,160
You consult.

1372
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,162
You live to fight another day.

1373
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,832
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1374
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,001
It's a disappointment.
We have them.

1375
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:55,089
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1376
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,342
Hang on.

1377
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:00,178
We've gotta talk about this.

1378
01:25:00,587 --> 01:25:03,639
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

1379
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,475
It's your wife, man.

1380
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,685
She's sick, she needs you.

1381
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:09,854
She's got to come first.

1382
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,689
All right, wait a minute.

1383
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:16,194
Do you mean the possibility of leaving this case 
has never entered your mind?

1384
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,408
You know what scares me?

1385
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:25,703
I quit the case, she gets better...

1386
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,080
and I hate her for it.

1387
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:30,708
I don't want to resent her.

1388
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:32,251
I've got a winner here.

1389
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:36,547
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1390
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,882
Then...

1391
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,509
then...

1392
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,928
put all my energy into her.

1393
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:50,436
I stand corrected.

1394
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,981
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

1395
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:58,027
She did to me, but she won't in court.

1396
01:25:58,445 --> 01:25:59,737
Convince her otherwise.

1397
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,740
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

1398
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:07,078
when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

1399
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,663
you will know...

1400
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,457
that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1401
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,751
of murdering three people...

1402
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,503
in cold blood...

1403
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:18,172
and with malice aforethought.

1404
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:19,882
Thank you.

1405
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,385
Your Honor.

1406
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:27,098
Mr. Lomax, uh, we can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1407
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,475
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

1408
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,978
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1409
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,312
Proceed.

1410
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,611
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1411
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:44,615
I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo talk.

1412
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,033
I know you're hungry.

1413
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:49,328
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

1414
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,166
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

1415
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,044
I don't think he's a nice person.

1416
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,046
I don't expect you to like him.

1417
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:03,134
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1418
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,345
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1419
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,598
He's cheated the city, his partners...

1420
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:09,849
his employees.

1421
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,686
He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars
in penalties and fines.

1422
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:16,230
I don't like him.

1423
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:20,693
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1424
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:23,696
that are going to make you like him
even less.

1425
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,699
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1426
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:28,409
It's a murder trial.

1427
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:34,498
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

1428
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,502
is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

1429
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:43,007
when these horrible crimes took place.

1430
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,676
Now, the State....

1431
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,596
The State is going all out here.

1432
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,473
They've got this whole team here...

1433
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:53,267
throwing everything but the kitchen sink
at this case.

1434
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,186
I want one thing from you.

1435
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,771
That's it.

1436
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,356
One thing.

1437
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,026
I want you to ask yourself:

1438
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,738
"Is not liking this man...

1439
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,617
reason enough...

1440
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,911
to convict him of murder?"

1441
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,374
Enjoy your lunch.

1442
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,125
We'll talk again.

1443
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:23,464
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.

1444
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,884
Listen to me like you've never
listened to anyone before in your life.

1445
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1446
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,891
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife.

1447
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:38,229
Why didn't you say something before?

1448
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,148
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

1449
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,027
Oh, you got it now?

1450
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,708
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.

1451
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,167
Saw you go in.

1452
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:01,419
What's up?

1453
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,295
Congratulations.

1454
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:07,216
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

1455
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:08,759
What are you talking about?

1456
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,263
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

1457
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:14,432
What?

1458
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,475
It looks like it's been there for years.

1459
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,395
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1460
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,566
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

1461
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,443
You want my job, take me head on.

1462
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:27,153
You backdoor me one more time...

1463
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,698
and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1464
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:34,035
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.

1465
01:29:34,544 --> 01:29:36,871
- Bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents...

1466
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,082
put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

1467
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,840
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

1468
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,677
Remember the Weaver Commission investigation?

1469
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,512
Tell your mentor...

1470
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,849
the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

1471
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,309
pick up the phone.

1472
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,524
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1473
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,276
He was going running.

1474
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,904
What the hell was he talking about?

1475
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,491
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1476
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:17,995
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1477
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,500
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1478
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,377
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1479
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,797
- Not directly, no.
- You do now.

1480
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,716
- <i>346.</i>
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1481
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,803
Uh, he may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

1482
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,180
- It's an emergency.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1483
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,474
You look like you could use a drink.

1484
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,518
Yes. Yes, thanks.

1485
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:44,022
<i>Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1486
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:49,151
<i>I nursed him through two divorces,
a cocaine rehab...</i>

1487
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,737
and a pregnant receptionist.

1488
01:30:53,339 --> 01:30:54,865
God's creature, right?

1489
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:57,284
<i>God's special creature?</i>

1490
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,412
<i>I've warned him, Kevin.</i>

1491
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,748
<i>I've warned him every step of the way.</i>

1492
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,459
<i>Watching him bounce around
like a fucking game.</i>

1493
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,044
<i>Like a wind-up toy.</i>

1494
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:08,879
<i>Like 250 pounds...</i>

1495
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,924
<i>of self-serving greed on wheels.</i>

1496
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,177
<i>The next thousand years
is right around the corner, Kevin.</i>

1497
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:16,595
<i>Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1498
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,389
- <i>Take a good look because...</i>
- Excuse me.

1499
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,434
<i>he's the poster child
for the next millennium.</i>

1500
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:26,981
<i>These people, it's no mystery
where they come from.</i>

1501
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:32,736
You sharpen the human appetite...

1502
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:36,657
to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

1503
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,535
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

1504
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,664
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

1505
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,918
Grease even the dullest dreams
with these dollar-green...

1506
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:52,131
gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

1507
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:55,092
<i>becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?</i>

1508
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,096
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you--

1509
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,681
<i>As we're scrambling...</i>

1510
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,185
from one deal to the next,
who's got his eye on the planet?

1511
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,353
<i>As the air thickens, the water sours...</i>

1512
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,857
<i>even bees' honey takes on
the metallic taste of radioactivity...</i>

1513
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:12,818
<i>and it just keeps coming,
faster and faster.</i>

1514
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,821
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!

1515
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,532
<i>There's no chance to think, to prepare.</i>

1516
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,368
<i>It's buy futures, sell futures...</i>

1517
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,454
<i>when there is no future.</i>

1518
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:25,497
<i>We got a runaway train, boy.</i>

1519
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:29,710
<i>We got a billion Eddie Barzoons
all jogging into the future.</i>

1520
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:33,631
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

1521
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,341
<i>lick their fingers clean...</i>

1522
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:39,094
<i>as they reach out toward their pristine,
cybernetic keyboards...</i>

1523
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:41,639
to tote up their fucking billable hours.

1524
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,474
<i>And then it hits home.</i>

1525
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,810
<i>You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.</i>

1526
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,813
<i>A little late in the game to buy out now.</i>

1527
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,315
Give me your watch.

1528
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:54,610
What? I like this watch.
Do you think you're just going to take it?

1529
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:59,657
<i>Your belly's too full,
your dick is sore...</i>

1530
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,244
<i>your eyes are bloodshot
and you're screaming for someone to help.</i>

1531
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,456
<i>But guess what?
There's no one there.</i>

1532
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:13,879
<i>You're all alone, Eddie.
You're God's special little creature.</i>

1533
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,714
No.

1534
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:23,847
Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

1535
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,850
Maybe he let us all down.

1536
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:39,196
You testified the defendant
called you at 4:30...

1537
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:42,866
to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

1538
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:44,118
Yes.

1539
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,163
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

1540
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,581
He's the boss.

1541
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:52,668
Yes.

1542
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,879
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

1543
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,048
Yes, I went up at 6:10.

1544
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:01,010
I knew it was 6:10 because
I heard the weather coming on the news--

1545
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,303
Okay, stop.

1546
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,723
This prosecutor is no fool.

1547
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:10,060
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

1548
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,106
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

1549
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,899
So, what do we do?

1550
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:19,903
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

1551
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,614
Exactly.

1552
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:29,747
Is it your testimony, Ms. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

1553
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:32,958
you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

1554
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,293
Yes.

1555
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:36,337
At any point during this three-hour marathon...

1556
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,505
did you lose sight of the defendant?

1557
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:41,091
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1558
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:43,218
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1559
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,436
- You understand the question?
- Yeah.

1560
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,689
So is he cut or not?

1561
01:34:55,857 --> 01:34:57,066
Yes.

1562
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,860
Which is it?

1563
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,906
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

1564
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:07,534
- You don't know if he has foreskin?
- I've had enough of your fucking game!

1565
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,121
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass?

1566
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,181
Kevin.

1567
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,682
What's happening?

1568
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:34,228
- It's Eddie Barzoon.
- What about him?

1569
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:36,522
He's dead. He was killed.

1570
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,941
- When?
- Last night. In the park.

1571
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:40,692
He was running, if you can believe it.

1572
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,569
What is wrong with people?

1573
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,863
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

1574
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,115
Who?

1575
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,700
Two old homeless crazies.

1576
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,831
Kevin. I'm sorry,
you're due in court in 30 minutes.

1577
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,667
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished here or what?

1578
01:35:56,876 --> 01:36:00,170
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

1579
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:07,636
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1580
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:10,514
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1581
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:14,726
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1582
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,729
I can't put her on the stand.

1583
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:21,066
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying.

1584
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:26,572
She's lying because she didn't answer you
fast enough? She lied to you? No.

1585
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,866
She said nothing.

1586
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,243
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1587
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:33,495
He killed those people.

1588
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,790
You really believe that?

1589
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,418
He set me up.

1590
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:42,713
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa, the whole thing.

1591
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:44,465
I know it.

1592
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,427
Gotta go with your gut.

1593
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:50,304
That's your advice?

1594
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,891
I'll back you either way.

1595
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:58,061
Maybe it's your time to lose.

1596
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,982
Think I haven't lost before?

1597
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:06,370
Kevin.

1598
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:09,453
Kevin.

1599
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,743
We talked about this, remember?

1600
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:14,453
Pressure.

1601
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:18,040
Take a big whiff.

1602
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,293
All rise.

1603
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:24,755
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1604
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:32,638
Please be seated.

1605
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:41,021
All right, Mr. Lomax,
you may present your case.

1606
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,792
Mr. Lomax.

1607
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:25,691
I call Melissa Black.

1608
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,918
Raise your right hand.

1609
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:47,963
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth...

1610
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,632
- so help you God?
- I do.

1611
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:13,905
Kevin!

1612
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:16,783
I have maintained my innocence all along,
now you see proof.

1613
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,827
Feeney, it's him.

1614
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,750
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.

1615
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:27,544
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1616
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,073
Honey.

1617
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:58,492
Mar, it's me.

1618
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:00,577
What happened?

1619
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,371
Are you okay?

1620
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:05,499
He let himself in.
You need to know that.

1621
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,210
Who let himself in?

1622
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:12,130
The bath was running or something.

1623
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,675
I didn't hear him.
I swear to you.

1624
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,843
And then we talked.

1625
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:20,055
And we talked for hours.

1626
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:22,391
And I haven't talked to anyone...

1627
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,976
really talked to anyone in so long.

1628
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,105
Did somebody hurt you?

1629
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,940
Yeah.

1630
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,275
Who?

1631
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,696
Milton.

1632
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:37,280
What?

1633
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:39,783
He, uh....

1634
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,788
He....

1635
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,915
He fucked me.

1636
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,754
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just....

1637
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,465
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

1638
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:59,636
He just wouldn't stop.

1639
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,223
When?

1640
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:06,268
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1641
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:11,898
The whole afternoon.

1642
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:15,318
I'm so ashamed.

1643
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,529
Today?

1644
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:18,947
Yeah.

1645
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:20,866
Today?

1646
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,952
Today he was in court.

1647
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,955
He was in court in my presence
all afternoon!

1648
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:28,498
- No!
- Yes!

1649
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,792
Yes! Yes!

1650
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:32,627
No.

1651
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:35,005
God, no, Kevin.

1652
01:41:35,173 --> 01:41:37,340
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1653
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,426
You have to believe me.

1654
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,016
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.

1655
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:48,143
He did this to me!

1656
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,146
No!

1657
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,231
He did this to me.

1658
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:57,444
What did you do to yourself?
What are we going to do, baby?

1659
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,655
What am I going to do?

1660
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,744
Sign there. And your relationship.

1661
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:10,499
She's calm now. This might be a good time
to say good night to her.

1662
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:21,510
I know why this is happening.

1663
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:26,556
They want you to sleep.

1664
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:29,768
It's the money.

1665
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:31,937
Blood money.

1666
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:36,024
We just drank it down, both of us.

1667
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,360
We knew it.

1668
01:42:39,946 --> 01:42:45,033
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1669
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,911
But you just kept on winning...

1670
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:50,247
every time.

1671
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,630
I can't look at myself in the mirror.

1672
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,424
I see a monster.

1673
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:08,849
Don't do this, Kevin.
Please take me home.

1674
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:11,560
Please don't do this.

1675
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:14,020
I'm not crazy.

1676
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:31,955
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

1677
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:44,175
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

1678
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:47,220
Mrs. Skylar.

1679
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:54,936
We are here today...

1680
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,147
to remember Eddie Barzoon.

1681
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:58,690
Isn't she lovely?

1682
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:03,111
We have gathered here
to seek shelter in our common grief.

1683
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,780
To draw strength toward our tested faith.

1684
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:09,284
So, what do they say?
How's Mary Ann?

1685
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,244
They don't know.

1686
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:12,913
She's....

1687
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,040
She's falling apart.

1688
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:16,625
Hallucinations.

1689
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,460
Milton....

1690
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:20,962
It's bad.

1691
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:25,842
Do you have room for one more?

1692
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,470
Beloved father. Devoted husband.

1693
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,513
Trusted friend.

1694
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,350
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.

1695
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:35,393
All of these things.

1696
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:38,521
And yet one thing more:

1697
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,274
Child of God.

1698
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:45,278
And it is to that Father
that he now returns.

1699
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:46,947
Eddie Barzoon...

1700
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,575
such a vibrant member of our community...

1701
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:53,536
has moved beyond us now.

1702
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,872
He has entered...

1703
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,041
a new communion.

1704
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,461
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.

1705
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,631
God, who is our refuge and our strength.

1706
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:09,636
God, who is that very present help...

1707
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:12,097
in time of trouble.

1708
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,225
Therefore we will not fear...

1709
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:17,227
though the Earth should change...

1710
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:20,230
though the mountains shake
in the heart of the sea...

1711
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:23,024
though its waters roar and foam...

1712
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:26,194
though the mountains tremble
with its tumult.

1713
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:28,571
We cannot fear too long...

1714
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,240
for Eddie Barzoon...

1715
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,075
has gone home.

1716
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,262
Mr. Lomax?

1717
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,681
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

1718
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,349
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1719
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:58,893
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

1720
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:00,895
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1721
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:02,230
Staking out the funeral?

1722
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,190
Looking for you, actually.

1723
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,901
I'm in a hurry.
I need to talk to my wife.

1724
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:11,281
Just wanted to ask you, off the record.
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1725
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:31,384
Milton, Chadwick, Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

1726
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,677
But I assumed you knew that.

1727
01:46:34,055 --> 01:46:36,264
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1728
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:40,060
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
Arms brokering, mostly.

1729
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,022
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1730
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:47,108
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1731
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:51,446
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1732
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:05,835
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1733
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,129
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

1734
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:11,299
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1735
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,843
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1736
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:17,347
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

1737
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,475
Now stay off my back!

1738
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,106
This is a first-time last-time offer, Kevin.

1739
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,399
I'm learning about you.

1740
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:31,444
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

1741
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:32,862
The Gettys case?

1742
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,490
Eighth grade teacher?

1743
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,410
They found him yesterday.

1744
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:44,082
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car.

1745
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:05,395
Is he all right? Get help!

1746
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,962
Hey, Marie, do you want
to go to the party?

1747
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,297
- Come on.
- No.

1748
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:33,840
Horace will be disappointed.

1749
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,301
It's a birthday party.
We can sing.

1750
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:38,511
"Or indeed, His divine power...

1751
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:42,390
has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety...

1752
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,394
through the knowledge of Him
who has called us--"

1753
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,730
Kevin?

1754
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,982
What are you doing here?

1755
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:54,652
I came this morning.

1756
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:58,698
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

1757
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,366
I need to talk to you.

1758
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,785
We got her on the first flight up this morning.

1759
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,546
Are you all right, Kevin?

1760
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,342
I just, um....

1761
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:21,679
I don't know.

1762
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:27,352
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?

1763
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,020
- Sure.
- Come on, Kevin.

1764
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,315
How you doing, sweetie?

1765
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,902
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

1766
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,403
There.

1767
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:43,368
I shouldn't have left.
I knew it.

1768
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,913
I'll never forgive myself.

1769
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:51,709
- There's nothing you could've done.
- Oh, I could've told you the truth.

1770
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:54,587
About what?

1771
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:58,591
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

1772
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:01,344
I was here in New York.

1773
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:04,847
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

1774
01:50:06,892 --> 01:50:10,561
- What are you talking about?
- I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

1775
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:14,732
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1776
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:16,192
Wait. Stop.

1777
01:50:16,402 --> 01:50:19,070
Your father was a waiter
in that restaurant.

1778
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,615
My father?

1779
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,454
Oh, this is great, Ma.

1780
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:33,042
- Honey, please listen.
- Now?

1781
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,794
You do this now?

1782
01:50:34,962 --> 01:50:37,088
Because, I mean, your timing, it's superb.

1783
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:40,341
You wait 30 years, you fly up here,
you pick today?

1784
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:41,592
Kevin, honey, just--

1785
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,595
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

1786
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:46,014
I need this--

1787
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,351
Listen to me!

1788
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,895
Kevin. Kevin.

1789
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:54,897
Kevin.

1790
01:50:55,190 --> 01:51:00,278
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

1791
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,785
Oh. Don't you look beautiful now.

1792
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,416
Take a look and see.

1793
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,377
It's all right, dear. Look.

1794
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:19,464
- No.
- Go on, take a look.

1795
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:22,133
See how beautiful you are?

1796
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,767
See?

1797
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:36,689
Get out!

1798
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:39,484
What happened?

1799
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:40,903
She attacked me.

1800
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:45,031
Mary Ann. Mary Ann.

1801
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:47,450
Open the door.

1802
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:49,035
Open the door, Mar.

1803
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:54,165
Mar? Open the door. Mar.

1804
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:57,502
Mar? Come on, Mar.

1805
01:51:57,669 --> 01:52:00,338
It's okay. Open the door!

1806
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:02,173
- No!
- Mar!

1807
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:03,925
Come on!

1808
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:06,260
Open the door!

1809
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:08,429
Mar!

1810
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,556
Open the door, Mar!

1811
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:14,769
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!

1812
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:16,354
Somebody! Help!

1813
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:19,065
No! Mar!

1814
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,650
Pam, get help!

1815
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:22,402
Go!

1816
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,077
Mar! Sweetheart!

1817
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,041
- Mar, look at me!
- I love you.

1818
01:52:40,295 --> 01:52:42,296
No, no, no!

1819
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:46,008
No!

1820
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:50,096
Oh, God, Mar, what have you done?
What have you done?

1821
01:52:51,432 --> 01:52:53,891
We need a doctor in here!

1822
01:52:54,059 --> 01:52:56,352
We need a doctor!

1823
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:01,065
Mar, Mar, Mar, please stay with me, Mar!

1824
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:03,860
Stay with me, Mar!

1825
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,112
Get Dr. Job in here now!

1826
01:53:06,447 --> 01:53:09,407
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

1827
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,617
Sir, off! Go!

1828
01:53:12,244 --> 01:53:14,620
Come on. Come on.

1829
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:18,082
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1830
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:21,085
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

1831
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:38,519
Finish the story.

1832
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:41,355
1966. You were in New York.

1833
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:43,049
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

1834
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:46,027
Finish the story.

1835
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,490
He talked to me.

1836
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:54,118
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

1837
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,998
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home,
someone takes an interest....

1838
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:02,668
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1839
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:08,257
Every meal, there he was at my ear
and I was....

1840
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:13,012
That last night he came to say goodbye...

1841
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:16,807
and I started crying.

1842
01:54:17,017 --> 01:54:19,018
And he told me:

1843
01:54:20,521 --> 01:54:24,190
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

1844
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,609
I want to hear you say it.

1845
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,114
- His face that night, I knew it was him.
- Say it.

1846
01:54:32,324 --> 01:54:36,911
You were so proud you'd just come to New York
and done this all on your own.

1847
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,705
- Say it!
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.

1848
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:42,041
- You wondered yourself. The money...
- Say it!

1849
01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:45,253
that apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere.

1850
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:47,213
Say it!

1851
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:49,215
Milton, he's your...

1852
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,925
father.

1853
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:53,302
He's your father.

1854
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:57,890
Somehow he found us.
He tracked you down.

1855
01:54:58,058 --> 01:54:59,308
- No.
- He did.

1856
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:01,727
He's always been there.

1857
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,814
I know that now.

1858
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:07,316
Watching.

1859
01:55:08,193 --> 01:55:09,235
Waiting.

1860
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:13,072
Playing us like a game.

1861
01:55:13,282 --> 01:55:14,448
What do you mean?

1862
01:55:14,616 --> 01:55:15,992
I gotta go.

1863
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:19,829
No, leave it alone.
Stay here with me.

1864
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:22,456
Forget about him. We can leave here.

1865
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:25,251
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1866
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:27,336
I can't do it.

1867
01:55:27,588 --> 01:55:29,839
You go home. You go home.

1868
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:31,299
- Kevin.
- I have to go.

1869
01:55:31,466 --> 01:55:34,135
- I have to go.
- Wait.

1870
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:36,512
I love you.

1871
01:55:45,647 --> 01:55:47,940
- There you are.
- Pam.

1872
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,610
Look at you. You're terrified.

1873
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:52,236
Not to worry.

1874
01:55:52,446 --> 01:55:54,113
He'll take away that fear.

1875
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:56,907
You don't ever have to be frightened again.

1876
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:58,242
Go on.

1877
01:55:58,452 --> 01:56:00,036
He's waiting for you.

1878
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:01,787
Go.

1879
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:16,570
<i>You were right about one thing.</i>

1880
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:20,449
<i>I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.</i>

1881
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:21,826
<i>Watching.</i>

1882
01:57:22,202 --> 01:57:23,661
<i>Waiting.</i>

1883
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:26,122
<i>Holding my breath.</i>

1884
01:57:26,665 --> 01:57:29,417
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1885
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:32,336
I don't make things happen.

1886
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:34,046
Doesn't work like that.

1887
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:36,298
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1888
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:40,094
Free will. It's like butterfly wings.

1889
01:57:40,262 --> 01:57:43,097
Once touched, they never get off the ground.

1890
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:44,432
No.

1891
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:47,351
I only set the stage.

1892
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:48,728
You pull your own strings.

1893
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,397
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1894
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:54,066
A gun? In here?

1895
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:56,902
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

1896
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,780
Well...

1897
01:58:01,241 --> 01:58:03,743
on a scale of one to 10...

1898
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:07,997
10 being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man...

1899
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:12,209
one being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomax's...

1900
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,253
I'd say, not to be immodest...

1901
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:18,340
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

1902
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,759
Fuck you!

1903
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:22,762
Oh. Oh. Oh. Got me!

1904
01:58:22,971 --> 01:58:25,382
Got me! Yes!

1905
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,018
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1906
01:58:29,186 --> 01:58:32,062
Step it up, son!
Come on! That's good!

1907
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:34,398
You got to hold on to that fury.

1908
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:36,317
That's the last thing to go.

1909
01:58:36,485 --> 01:58:40,738
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1910
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,408
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1911
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:46,076
Who are you?

1912
01:58:47,078 --> 01:58:49,288
Never lost a case.

1913
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,707
Why?

1914
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,043
Why do you think?

1915
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:56,921
Because you're so fucking good.

1916
01:58:57,088 --> 01:58:58,631
Yeah?

1917
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:00,800
But why?

1918
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:04,178
Because you're my father?

1919
01:59:04,346 --> 01:59:07,056
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1920
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:10,351
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

1921
01:59:10,519 --> 01:59:13,270
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

1922
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,523
"It was a nice run, Kev."

1923
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:17,525
"Had to close out some day."

1924
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:19,318
"Nobody wins them all."

1925
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:23,239
What are you?

1926
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:28,452
I have so many names.

1927
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:31,205
Satan.

1928
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:36,085
Call me Dad.

1929
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:40,923
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1930
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:44,468
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

1931
01:59:44,636 --> 01:59:47,429
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1932
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,682
Oh, I hope you're kidding.

1933
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:52,601
Mary Ann, you could have saved her
anytime you liked.

1934
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:54,228
All she wanted was love.

1935
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:56,438
Hey, you were too busy.

1936
01:59:56,606 --> 01:59:57,648
That's a lie.

1937
01:59:57,816 --> 01:59:59,233
Mary Ann in New York?

1938
01:59:59,401 --> 02:00:03,654
Face it, you started looking to better-deal her
the minute you got here.

1939
02:00:03,822 --> 02:00:05,531
That's not true.
You don't know what we had.

1940
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:08,158
- You don't know anything about it.
- Hey, I'm on your side.

1941
02:00:08,326 --> 02:00:11,453
- You're a liar!
- No, hey-- Kevin.

1942
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:13,998
There's nothing out there for you.

1943
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:17,251
Don't be such a fucking chump.

1944
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:20,045
Stop deluding yourself.

1945
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:23,549
I told you to take care of your wife.

1946
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:24,842
What did I say?

1947
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:28,596
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

1948
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:30,431
What did you do?

1949
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:32,975
"You know what scares me, John?

1950
02:00:33,184 --> 02:00:37,688
I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

1951
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:39,899
Remember?

1952
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:43,444
I know what you did.
You set me up.

1953
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:45,905
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Gettys?

1954
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:49,325
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

1955
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:51,994
And Moyez. The direction you took.

1956
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:56,498
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

1957
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,959
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

1958
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:00,753
It was a test! Your test!

1959
02:01:00,921 --> 02:01:04,465
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.

1960
02:01:04,633 --> 02:01:06,383
Seeing those pictures.

1961
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:10,429
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.

1962
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:13,849
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.

1963
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,684
I don't do that, Kevin!

1964
02:01:15,852 --> 02:01:18,729
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

1965
02:01:18,897 --> 02:01:21,690
What were my words to you?

1966
02:01:22,067 --> 02:01:25,778
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

1967
02:01:25,946 --> 02:01:28,280
Lose? I don't lose!

1968
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:31,241
I win!

1969
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:34,286
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.

1970
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:38,791
I rest my case.

1971
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,755
Vanity...

1972
02:01:45,256 --> 02:01:47,967
is definitely my favorite sin.

1973
02:01:49,344 --> 02:01:52,012
Kevin, it's so basic.

1974
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,764
Self-love.

1975
02:01:53,932 --> 02:01:56,225
The all-natural opiate.

1976
02:01:57,268 --> 02:02:00,771
You know, it's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

1977
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:05,693
it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

1978
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:09,071
Yourself.

1979
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,409
You're right.

1980
02:02:13,576 --> 02:02:15,160
I did it all.

1981
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:16,704
I let her go.

1982
02:02:17,171 --> 02:02:21,125
Don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

1983
02:02:21,292 --> 02:02:22,584
Believe me.

1984
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:23,836
I....

1985
02:02:24,004 --> 02:02:26,255
I left her behind and just kept going.

1986
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:28,924
You cannot keep punishing yourself, Kevin.

1987
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:32,344
It's awesome how far you've come.

1988
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,513
I didn't make it easy.

1989
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:35,973
Couldn't.

1990
02:02:36,808 --> 02:02:38,684
Not for you....

1991
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:43,397
or your sister.

1992
02:02:47,027 --> 02:02:49,278
Half-sister, to be exact.

1993
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:52,031
Surprise.

1994
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:55,492
Some scene, huh, Kevin?

1995
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,496
Don't let him scare you, eh?

1996
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:02,875
Kevin, I've had so many children.

1997
02:03:03,043 --> 02:03:06,211
I've had so many disappointments.

1998
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:08,672
Mistake after mistake.

1999
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:10,382
And then there's you.

2000
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,925
The two of you.

2001
02:03:15,096 --> 02:03:16,555
What do you want from me?

2002
02:03:16,723 --> 02:03:18,640
I want you to be yourself.

2003
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:20,434
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

2004
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:21,643
guilt...

2005
02:03:21,853 --> 02:03:24,313
it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

2006
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:26,065
All you gotta do...

2007
02:03:26,232 --> 02:03:28,442
is set it down.

2008
02:03:29,611 --> 02:03:30,944
Hey.

2009
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:33,405
I know what you're going through.

2010
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:34,823
I've been there.

2011
02:03:34,991 --> 02:03:36,909
Just come here. Come here.

2012
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:38,911
Yeah. Let it go.

2013
02:03:40,121 --> 02:03:42,664
Uh, I can't do that.

2014
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:48,712
Who are you carrying
all those bricks for anyway?

2015
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,547
God?

2016
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:52,174
Is that it?

2017
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:53,425
God?

2018
02:03:53,593 --> 02:03:54,802
I'll tell you...

2019
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:58,931
let me give you
a little inside information about God.

2020
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:01,100
God likes to watch.

2021
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:02,434
He's a prankster.

2022
02:04:02,602 --> 02:04:04,269
Think about it.

2023
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:05,854
He gives man...

2024
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:07,856
instincts.

2025
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:11,985
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does he do?

2026
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:14,947
I swear, for his own amusement...

2027
02:04:15,115 --> 02:04:20,285
his own private, cosmic gag reel...

2028
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:22,538
he sets the rules in opposition.

2029
02:04:22,747 --> 02:04:24,164
It's the goof of all time.

2030
02:04:24,374 --> 02:04:27,084
Look, but don't touch.

2031
02:04:28,336 --> 02:04:31,588
Touch, but don't taste.

2032
02:04:32,507 --> 02:04:34,508
Taste, but don't swallow.

2033
02:04:36,094 --> 02:04:40,097
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is he doing?

2034
02:04:40,265 --> 02:04:43,892
He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!

2035
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,561
He's a tightass!

2036
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:48,147
He's a sadist!

2037
02:04:48,314 --> 02:04:51,150
He's an absentee landlord!

2038
02:04:51,317 --> 02:04:54,069
Worship that? Never!

2039
02:04:54,237 --> 02:04:57,364
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven, is that it?

2040
02:04:57,574 --> 02:04:59,032
Why not?

2041
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,704
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began.

2042
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:09,293
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have.

2043
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:13,088
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him.

2044
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:17,885
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections.

2045
02:05:18,052 --> 02:05:19,720
I'm a fan of man!

2046
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:23,724
I'm a humanist.

2047
02:05:23,892 --> 02:05:25,642
Maybe the last humanist.

2048
02:05:26,519 --> 02:05:28,604
Who, in their right mind...

2049
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:30,939
Kevin, could possibly deny...

2050
02:05:31,149 --> 02:05:34,109
the 20th century was entirely mine?

2051
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:36,820
All of it, Kevin!

2052
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:38,947
All of it!

2053
02:05:39,449 --> 02:05:41,241
Mine.

2054
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:43,619
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2055
02:05:44,412 --> 02:05:46,622
It's my time now.

2056
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:49,249
It's our time.

2057
02:05:49,417 --> 02:05:51,627
Anybody want a drink?

2058
02:05:53,004 --> 02:05:55,088
I'm having a drink.

2059
02:05:57,842 --> 02:06:00,594
This is some pitch, all this.

2060
02:06:01,221 --> 02:06:03,222
You must need me pretty bad.

2061
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:04,932
What do you want?

2062
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:07,851
Eddie was right.

2063
02:06:08,519 --> 02:06:11,188
I want you to take over the firm.

2064
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,065
You...

2065
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:15,817
and your sister.

2066
02:06:19,364 --> 02:06:22,199
- Is that it?
- No.

2067
02:06:23,868 --> 02:06:25,535
She's ovulating...

2068
02:06:25,703 --> 02:06:28,205
- right now.
- What?

2069
02:06:28,373 --> 02:06:30,040
Your vanity...

2070
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:32,668
is justified, Kevin.

2071
02:06:33,962 --> 02:06:35,254
Your seed...

2072
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:37,881
is the key to a new future.

2073
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:42,010
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

2074
02:06:42,178 --> 02:06:44,888
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2075
02:06:46,224 --> 02:06:48,183
You want a child.

2076
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:50,018
I want a family.

2077
02:06:51,062 --> 02:06:53,230
The Antichrist.

2078
02:06:57,443 --> 02:06:58,652
Whatever.

2079
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:05,784
But I have to volunteer.

2080
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:10,539
Free will, it is a bitch.

2081
02:07:11,916 --> 02:07:14,543
Kevin, I need a family.

2082
02:07:14,711 --> 02:07:16,712
I need help. I'm busy.

2083
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:18,755
Millennium's coming, son.

2084
02:07:18,923 --> 02:07:21,592
Title fight. Round 20.

2085
02:07:24,178 --> 02:07:26,054
I'm ready to work.

2086
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:29,057
What do you say, kid?

2087
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:31,393
What're you offering?

2088
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,063
Are we negotiating?

2089
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:37,065
Always.

2090
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,694
Yes.

2091
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:43,488
What are you offering?

2092
02:07:43,823 --> 02:07:45,073
Everything.

2093
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:46,450
Anything.

2094
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:48,952
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2095
02:07:49,162 --> 02:07:51,740
Instant bliss. Bliss on tap.

2096
02:07:53,207 --> 02:07:56,001
Bliss any way you want it.

2097
02:07:58,129 --> 02:08:00,839
How about that first line of cocaine?

2098
02:08:01,007 --> 02:08:04,051
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

2099
02:08:05,553 --> 02:08:07,054
Familiar?

2100
02:08:07,847 --> 02:08:10,724
Oh, you're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

2101
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,351
I know.

2102
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:14,853
I'm just getting warmed up.

2103
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:18,607
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2104
02:08:18,775 --> 02:08:21,151
How about the thing you love the most?

2105
02:08:21,652 --> 02:08:23,487
A smile from a jury.

2106
02:08:23,654 --> 02:08:28,617
Whew. That cold courtroom
just giving itself over...

2107
02:08:28,785 --> 02:08:31,995
bending to your strength.

2108
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:34,289
I get that on my own.

2109
02:08:34,457 --> 02:08:36,208
Not like this.

2110
02:08:36,376 --> 02:08:38,668
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

2111
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:41,088
I give you pleasure.

2112
02:08:41,506 --> 02:08:42,798
No strings!

2113
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:44,758
Freedom, baby...

2114
02:08:44,926 --> 02:08:47,677
is never having to say you're sorry.

2115
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,639
This is revolution, Kevin.

2116
02:08:53,518 --> 02:08:58,230
<i>It happened in Monterey</i>

2117
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:01,316
<i>A long time ago</i>

2118
02:09:01,484 --> 02:09:03,026
Forget about him.

2119
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:05,195
This is about us.

2120
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:08,740
<i>In old Mexico</i>

2121
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:16,331
<i>Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine</i>

2122
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,668
You don't know how hard it's been for me
to wait for you.

2123
02:09:20,253 --> 02:09:22,087
Why the law?

2124
02:09:22,839 --> 02:09:25,582
Cut the shit, Dad. Why lawyers?
Why the law?

2125
02:09:25,884 --> 02:09:29,761
Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

2126
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:35,934
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2127
02:09:36,102 --> 02:09:38,895
Did you know there are more students
in law school...

2128
02:09:39,063 --> 02:09:40,981
than lawyers walking the Earth?

2129
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:42,858
We're coming out...

2130
02:09:43,025 --> 02:09:44,985
guns blazing!

2131
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,113
The two of you...

2132
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:52,159
all of us,
acquittal after acquittal after acquittal...

2133
02:09:52,326 --> 02:09:56,037
until the stench of it
reaches so high and far into Heaven...

2134
02:09:56,205 --> 02:09:59,624
it chokes the whole fucking lot of them.

2135
02:10:01,627 --> 02:10:03,753
In the Bible, you lose.

2136
02:10:05,047 --> 02:10:07,048
We're destined to lose, Dad.

2137
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,051
Consider the source, son.

2138
02:10:11,179 --> 02:10:12,220
Besides...

2139
02:10:12,388 --> 02:10:14,055
we'll write our own book.

2140
02:10:14,223 --> 02:10:16,558
Chapter one.

2141
02:10:17,226 --> 02:10:19,478
Right here. This altar.

2142
02:10:20,146 --> 02:10:21,646
This moment.

2143
02:10:21,814 --> 02:10:23,440
Will you stop talking?

2144
02:10:23,608 --> 02:10:25,400
You talk too much.

2145
02:10:25,568 --> 02:10:27,444
Both of you.

2146
02:10:28,196 --> 02:10:29,905
Kevin.

2147
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:31,907
Look at me.

2148
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:34,701
Just look at me.

2149
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:47,881
Oh. She is really stunning.

2150
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:54,804
Who am I?

2151
02:11:14,534 --> 02:11:17,786
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

2152
02:11:26,629 --> 02:11:29,839
The virtue of the devil is in his loins.

2153
02:11:33,511 --> 02:11:34,761
What about love?

2154
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:40,183
Overrated.

2155
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:46,314
Biochemically no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

2156
02:11:46,482 --> 02:11:51,486
Hey. In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2157
02:11:51,654 --> 02:11:53,029
Come here.

2158
02:11:54,448 --> 02:11:56,449
She's right, my son.

2159
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:07,794
It's time to step up
and take what's yours.

2160
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:13,842
You're right.

2161
02:12:15,803 --> 02:12:17,304
It's time.

2162
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:19,140
Free will, right?

2163
02:12:24,687 --> 02:12:26,062
No!

2164
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:29,941
- No!
- No!

2165
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:35,363
No!

2166
02:12:39,744 --> 02:12:43,246
Damn you!

2167
02:12:44,665 --> 02:12:46,541
Enough!

2168
02:12:48,628 --> 02:12:51,171
Haven't I given enough?

2169
02:13:55,194 --> 02:13:56,820
It was a nice run, Kev.

2170
02:13:56,987 --> 02:13:59,114
Had to close out someday.

2171
02:13:59,782 --> 02:14:01,241
Nobody wins them all.

2172
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:52,834
What are you doing, baby?

2173
02:14:54,837 --> 02:14:56,296
Are you okay?

2174
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:01,301
I am now.

2175
02:15:04,513 --> 02:15:06,097
All rise.

2176
02:15:06,515 --> 02:15:10,101
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds presiding.

2177
02:15:12,521 --> 02:15:14,522
Please be seated.

2178
02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:20,779
You're still under oath, young lady.

2179
02:15:23,908 --> 02:15:26,451
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

2180
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:38,546
Mr. Lomax?

2181
02:15:43,219 --> 02:15:44,427
Your Honor...

2182
02:15:46,222 --> 02:15:48,264
I'm terribly sorry.

2183
02:15:49,558 --> 02:15:51,976
But I can no longer represent my client.

2184
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:56,773
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2185
02:15:56,982 --> 02:16:00,109
Order. Order! Order!

2186
02:16:00,277 --> 02:16:02,320
I adjourn this court.

2187
02:16:02,488 --> 02:16:05,990
This is outrageous. Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

2188
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:07,367
I am, sir.

2189
02:16:07,535 --> 02:16:11,120
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

2190
02:16:11,288 --> 02:16:14,999
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

2191
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:17,836
I trusted you to defend me.

2192
02:16:18,003 --> 02:16:20,171
You swore you would.
You'll burn for this.

2193
02:16:20,339 --> 02:16:22,924
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life.

2194
02:16:23,968 --> 02:16:26,469
Baby, what are you doing?

2195
02:16:29,557 --> 02:16:31,349
The right thing.

2196
02:16:31,517 --> 02:16:33,810
I think the right thing.

2197
02:16:37,064 --> 02:16:38,106
Here they are.

2198
02:16:38,274 --> 02:16:40,441
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2199
02:16:40,609 --> 02:16:43,152
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

2200
02:16:43,362 --> 02:16:45,572
Ain't it better to talk to them
all at once?

2201
02:16:45,739 --> 02:16:47,282
Press conference tomorrow?

2202
02:16:47,491 --> 02:16:50,785
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2203
02:16:50,995 --> 02:16:52,245
That's it.

2204
02:16:52,454 --> 02:16:54,122
This is the story you dreamed about.

2205
02:16:54,331 --> 02:16:56,791
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2206
02:16:57,001 --> 02:17:00,336
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge.

2207
02:17:00,546 --> 02:17:04,173
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

2208
02:17:04,341 --> 02:17:08,261
- Wait a second. Can they do that?
- Not when I get through with the story.

2209
02:17:08,429 --> 02:17:10,805
You got to give me an exclusive.

2210
02:17:10,973 --> 02:17:14,642
This is wire service.
This is <i>60 Minutes.</i>

2211
02:17:14,852 --> 02:17:18,521
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

2212
02:17:18,689 --> 02:17:20,481
You're a star.

2213
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,820
Baby.

2214
02:17:27,923 --> 02:17:29,824
Call me in the morning.

2215
02:17:30,409 --> 02:17:33,661
You got it. First thing.

2216
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:36,080
Bye, Larry.

2217
02:17:42,630 --> 02:17:44,088
Vanity.

2218
02:17:44,256 --> 02:17:47,050
Definitely my favorite sin.

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,797
- What do you want?
- Why is this door locked, Andrew?

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,534
I'm getting ready for school.

6
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,702
- Open this door, Andrew.

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,873
- Listen to me.
- No, you're drunk.

8
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,437
I'm what?

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,640
Excuse me?

10
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,744
I said unlock the door.

11
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,550
Andrew?

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,185
Dad, it is 7:30 in the a.m.,
and you are drunk.

13
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,321
- Listen. You don't tell me
if I'm drunk or not, you little shit.
- Aren't you?

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,627
- What are you doing in there, huh?

15
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,693
- I'm filming this.
- Huh?

16
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,763
- What?
- I bought a camera...

17
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,674
and I'm filming everything
from here on out.

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,556
<i>And it's yours right now
for only 46. 50! Yeah!</i>

19
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,154
Mom? Mom.

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,060
- Hey.

21
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,932
Say hello to my new camera for me.

22
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:51,341
- Who's the audience?
- Just the millions of people
that are watching at home.

23
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,811
- Do I look awful?
- No, no, no, Mom.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,871
You look... You look great.

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,884
- It's a nice camera.
Well, thanks, Mom.

26
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:14,292
So, um, should I ask about the camera or...

27
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:19,270
Uh, I don't know.
I'm... I'm filming things now.

28
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,637
- I'm filming everything.
- You're filming everything?

29
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,179
God, make it stop.

31
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,200
Have you ever read any Arthur Schopenhauer?

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,068
No. What is Arthur Schopenhauer?

33
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,199
He's, um... He's this philosopher
that I'm reading at the moment.

34
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,267
- For school?
- No, no.

35
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,541
Uh, basically, human beings
have to recognize themselves...

36
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,549
- as beings of pure will, right?
- Okay.

37
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:09,247
So all emotional and physical desires
can never be fulfilled.

38
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,553
So basically you're telling me that
I should give up on life.

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,287
- Yes.
Okay.

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,194
- Come on, man!
- Oh, God.

41
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,664
- I'll see you later.
- All right, dude. Peace.

42
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,928
Learning time.

43
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,833
Get out of the way.

44
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,234
Are you not coming in?

45
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,105
I'm gonna hang back a while, okay?

46
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
Uh, you're gonna be late for first period.

47
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,910
This is my school.

48
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,816
I guess.

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,582
Vote for Steve, brah!

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,919
Okay.

51
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,256
Hey, you! Hey, guy.
Vote for Steve for senior class president.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,627
- Vote for Steve.
- Yeah, I got it.

53
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,098
This is where I eat lunch.

54
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,727
- Out here on the bleachers.

55
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,136
...four, five, six,
seven, eight. And one...

56
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,970
'Cause I don't wanna see
anybody pull up... That's right.

57
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,705
Way to your left.
There you go, Jack. That's right. Okay.

58
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,373
- A cohesive unit today.

59
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,249
- ...O-R-Y! V-l-C-T-O-R-Y!

60
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,379
I don't want to see any crap out there.
All right?

61
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,083
...T-O-R-Y!

62
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,523
- Whoo!
- Good job. All right.

63
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,288
Hi.

64
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,560
Hey.

65
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,032
Could you not videotape us, please?
It's really creepy.

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,659
Uh, no. I wasn't...

67
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,069
- Hi!
- This is the hallway where my locker is.

68
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,699
What is this?

69
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,470
- What's up, Detmer?

70
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,909
- Wow, you should be on television.
- Man, you're on a film, man.

71
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,310
Pretty on camera.

72
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,975
- Smile, man. You look pretty.
- You gonna cry? You gonna cry?

73
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,813
Sean, come on. Give it back.

74
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,820
Huh? You want your camera?
Piece of shit from, like, 2004?

75
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,220
Here you go.
Here she is. In one piece.

76
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,122
- Oh!
- Oh, guys.

77
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,159
Assholes!
- Come on!

78
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,700
- All right. You ready to bounce?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,670
There's a party tonight.

80
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,929
Okay.

81
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,739
Haven Hills.

82
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,041
Wait. I thought Haven Hills was closed.

83
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,081
It's abandoned, yeah.
What, you don't want to go?

84
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,413
No.

85
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,045
- When was the last time you went to a party?
- I don't go to parties.

86
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,555
- You're a senior. You are a senior.
- I don't go to parties.

87
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,489
- Just come.
- I'll think about it, okay?

88
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,049
Okay.

89
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,392
But when we go tonight, Andrew,
can I give you, like, a pro tip?

90
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,624
What?

91
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,031
Maybe leave your camera at home.

92
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,127
- Why?
- Because it's a little weird.

93
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,694
It serves a purpose.

94
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,139
I'm... I'm just trying to be
a good cousin here, okay?

95
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,336
This is me being your friend
and telling you...

96
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,142
you should probably
not take the camera to a party.

97
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,176
Okay.

98
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,219
This is my street.

99
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,584
And those are the official
douche bags of my street.

100
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,422
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, great.

101
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,655
Hey! What you doing? Andrew!

102
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,857
- No, I wasn't...
- Don't film me, Detmer! Don't film me.

103
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,490
- Run to your house, bitch!

104
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,899
<i>This is where I eat lunch.</i>

105
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,761
<i>Out here on the bleachers.</i>

106
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,611
What do you want?

107
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,516
When I say open that door,
you open the door. You got it?

108
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,554
Finish your goddamn homework.

109
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,518
Matt, are you sure it's here?
- Dude, it's here.

110
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,688
Calm down, okay?

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,828
Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,495
Wow. Look. A rave.

113
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,562
Oh, wow. Look. A nerd with a camera.

114
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,234
What?
- Just don't follow me around all night, okay?

115
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,937
What do you mean? I thought...
I thought you wanted me to come with you.

116
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,675
I did. I did. But just go
and do your own thing for once, okay?

117
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,381
I don't drink.

118
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,273
Hey! Hey!

119
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,813
Hey!

120
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,112
Excuse me.
Hey! Hey, what are you filming for?

121
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,620
Oh, I don't... Um...

122
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,384
- Uh...
- What?

123
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,051
- I can't hear you.
- I'm just filming.

124
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,653
- Oh. Oh, cool. Cool. I'm filming for my blog.
- Oh.

125
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,721
- Andrew. Andrew.
- You should check it out. It's actually...

126
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,892
- Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.
- Hey.

127
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,436
- How you doing?
- I'm good. I'm good.

128
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,166
This is pretty lame, right?

129
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,231
Why is it lame?

130
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,970
You know, Jung said parties are just...

131
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,808
people's way of
seeking widespread validation.

132
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,942
I'm not one to clamor to be cool, you know.

133
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:45,321
Wow. Way to put an analytical psychology
spin on this barn party, Matt.

134
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,353
That's awesome.

135
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,987
Awesome.

136
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,224
- You're awesome.
- Hey, Matt.

137
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,757
Hey, what did Jung say about glow sticks?

138
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,746
You filming my girlfriend?

139
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,983
Yes or no?

140
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,578
No, I... I'm not filming anything.

141
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,146
- I'm just filming the party.
- Okay.

142
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,749
I should break your bitch-ass nose.
You know that?

143
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,794
- No, I wasn't...
- Don't talk back to me.

144
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,796
- Bitch.
- Okay.

145
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,901
You're a party pooper!

146
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,735
- No! Come on!

147
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,072
My shoe! My shoe!

148
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,936
Let's go drink!

149
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,345
Andrew?

150
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,906
Andrew.

151
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,581
Andrew.

152
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,485
With the camera.

153
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,683
- Can we... Can we use that thing?
- What?

154
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,659
We found the craziest shit,
and we gotta get it on tape.

155
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,629
- Uh, it's not...
- What's up, man?

156
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,531
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm-I'm Andrew.

157
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,330
Okay. I'm Steve.

158
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,666
- Steve Montgomery.
- Yeah, I know.

159
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,898
Really?

160
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,771
Matt and I were just hanging out...

161
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,504
and we found this cool little...

162
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,103
- this thing.
- Wait. You're with Matt?

163
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,706
- You might want to get it on tape.
- No, I just... I don't really...

164
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,718
Dude, just come on.
Just come get it on tape. It'll be cool.

165
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,947
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

166
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,819
- All right.
- Yeah, man.

167
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,017
You know there are, like,
tons of girls around here, right?

168
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,891
And you're all by yourself next to a tree?

169
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,725
I'm just really picky.

170
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,198
- Listen. I really don't think...
- Is there a light on that thing?
Like, on the camera?

171
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,064
Uh, yeah. Here.

172
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,897
What were you guys doing out here?

173
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,238
A bunch of people were out here 'cause
we were, like, obsessed with the thing.

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,039
What thing?

175
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,974
You'll see.

176
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,949
Oh, that's... that's right! Andrew Detmer!

177
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,043
I remember you from homeroom,
freshman year.

178
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,281
You always had that gray zip-up hoodie.

179
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,119
- Garetty!
- You remember that?

180
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,787
Yeah, I got a... I got a thing for faces,
which is why I'm going into politics.

181
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,388
Ironically enough,
'cause I'm so ridiculously hi...

182
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,296
Down here!
- Ah, there we go.

183
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,994
- Garetty, what's up? I see you!
- Matt!

184
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,095
You see me?
- Yeah, where did everybody go?

185
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,640
They left! They left! Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

186
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,403
Do you see that?
- Guys, what is that?

187
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,501
- Do you see it? Is that the camera?
- Yeah, I got him!

188
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:19,843
- Do you guys know how to get back from here?
- Is it still making that sound?

189
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,370
- Do you guys know how to get back from here?
- Is it still making that sound?

190
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,643
- Yes. Did you tell Andrew?
- Andrew, it's making that sound, dude.

191
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,912
Dude, come and listen to this.
Listen to this.

192
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,088
- No, no, no, no. You gotta get in.
- Okay, okay.

193
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,056
You gotta get close,
like literally almost in the hole.

194
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,955
Okay, don't push me. Just don't push me.

195
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,687
- Check this shit out.
- We're not gonna push you in.

196
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,558
We're just trying to get it on camera.

197
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,461
- Listen. Can you hear that?
- Shh, shh.

198
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,796
- What...

199
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,494
- I think we got it.

200
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,332
Wait. How creepy is that?

201
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,999
- Is this sound coming up?
- I don't know. I mean, probably.
It's pretty loud, right?

202
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,100
Hello!
- All right, dude. We're going inside.

203
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,042
I'm going back. Come on, you guys.
- I gotta know.

204
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,013
Matt, seriously, we...
Hey, wait, wait. Steve!

205
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,106
- Steve!

206
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,946
Oh, shit. He's a ninja.

207
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,508
Matt...

208
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,781
Whoa, Matt, Matt, Matt. What are you doing?

209
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,323
Are you serious?

210
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,589
- Andrew, can you give me some light?
- Matt, don't be an idiot.

211
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,624
Whoop! Whoop!

212
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,666
Matt! Matt, you're my ride home!

213
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,098
Hello?

214
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,105
Oh!

215
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,801
Smells terrible. You guys!

216
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,537
Matt!

217
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,147
- Hello?

218
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,815
- Andrew's such a pussy.
All right. Does it go down
much deeper, or what?

219
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,488
- Yeah, man. It goes really, really far.
- Andrew, bring the light.

220
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,055
Look at the walls.
It's like a straight shot down.

221
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,568
Probably already come like 40 or 50 feet.

222
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,070
Yeah, just don't talk about it, okay?

223
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,098
You ever... You ever heard of Plato's
"Allegory of the Cave"?

224
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,236
I don't know, Matt.
Let's just get this over with.

225
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,438
Oh, shit!

226
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,108
Holy shit.

227
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,208
What the hell is that?

228
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,413
- Matt, I'm not kidding.
- I can't breathe.

229
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,820
- Come on.
- Andrew, look at this.

230
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,282
What...

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,521
Can you believe this?

232
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,256
Matt.

233
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,565
What am I looking at?

234
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,367
- Ah, shit!
- I am freaking out right now!

235
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,408
Matt! Can we get out of here, please?

236
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,307
Is it showing up on the camera like that?

237
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,970
- I don't know, man.

238
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,741
It's messing with it.
I don't really want to film...

239
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,783
Dude, I'll buy you a new one.

240
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,346
Touch one.

241
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,881
Matt!

242
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,461
- Matt, look at this!
- What?

243
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,121
Look at this!

244
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,099
Dude, what is...

245
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,169
Dude, no way!

246
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,228
- It's changing colors!
- Oh, my God.

247
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,275
Must be reacting to heat.

248
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,776
I can't hear you over that...
- This is awesome.

249
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,472
Oh! Dude, your nose!

250
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,036
- Steve, Steve!

251
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,139
- Steve!

252
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,378
- Steve!

253
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,026
Matt, dude, put your phone down.
Turn it off.

254
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,326
Okay, okay, okay.
- Steve, you too.

255
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,332
All right.
- We have to document this.

256
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,960
- Okay. Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. I'm ready.

257
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,766
All right. Here we go. Okay, Steve...
- What?

258
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,329
Can you move to your left?

259
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,069
- Here?
- Um, yeah. That's good.

260
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,407
And then, Matt...

261
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,677
can you just go right in front of Steve?

262
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,978
Um...

263
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,110
- Here?
- Yeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

264
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,882
This is the ball test.

265
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,650
You ready?
- Yep.

266
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,760
- Oh!

267
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,263
- What the shit, Steve?

268
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,699
Get off! Get off!
What are you doing? Underhand.

269
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,532
- I tried, man. I tried.

270
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,798
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- All right.

271
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,569
- All right. Wait, wait.
- We good?

272
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,474
- We said underhand, right?
- Yeah, it is underhand. Yeah.

273
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,738
Okay.

274
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,541
- Underneath.
- I'm on you. You're not gonna get me this time.

275
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,948
- You ready?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,351
- I'm on it. Yeah.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

277
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,286
Let's go.

278
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,880
- Oh!

279
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,086
Yeah! The crowd goes wild!

280
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,254
- Yeah, I'm ready. All right.
Matt, beam him. Beam him.

281
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,298
- I'm... I'm going to.
- Beam him.

282
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,894
Oh!

283
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,902
- Oh!
- No way! Shit!

284
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,733
- Wait, wait, wait. That's great!

285
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,534
- He did it!
- I did it! I did it!

286
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,336
That is crazy!
- Oh, my God!

287
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,899
- Look at it!
- Oh, my God!

288
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,842
Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.

289
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,709
Oh, my God.
Oh, dude, you're bleeding. You're bleeding.

290
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,874
Oh, man, shit.
Stop, stop, stop. Get a tissue.

291
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,851
- You did it! Yes!

292
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,183
- Put on the music.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,017
Yes.

294
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:09,497
Matt, you have... you have to pretend like
you're squeezing them together with your hands.

295
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,299
That's what I'm doing.
Look. That's what I'm doing.

296
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,643
- I can't do it, dude.
- I give up.

297
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,680
You do it. You're better at this than I am.

298
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,476
Oh, really? Am I? Really?

299
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,312
Just do it.

300
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,683
Oh.

301
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,816
- Sick.

302
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,090
Dude, I hate you! That's...

303
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,461
- I'm impressed, man. I am impressed.
- That's amazing.

304
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,022
That was awesome, dude.

305
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,830
- Oh, no!
- Come on, dude.

306
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,597
- That is not cool.
- What?

307
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,400
- That is not cool.
- My Legos.

308
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,442
You've been hanging out with
those two guys for the last three weeks.

309
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,000
- "Three weeks."
<i>- I'm not stupid.</i>

310
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,672
<i>I think you're hiding something from me.
You better call me back.</i>

311
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,409
Wow.
<i>- I love you.</i>

312
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,849
I'm gonna get a brick through my window.
I am legitimately scared.

313
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,250
I have an election coming up,
and I don't have time for this.

314
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,017
Dude, why are you asking us
for advice on girls?

315
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,183
Because we're his mistress.

316
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,523
So, what, you think
it's, like, radiation or something?

317
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,861
- Radiation from what?
- Dude, it's the government.

318
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,661
What? Matt, what are you talking about?

319
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,498
I'm feeling pretty spelunked out actually.

320
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,128
Andrew, relax.

321
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,404
That's so weird. It looks
completely different during the day.

322
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,503
Look. I don't care, okay?
I am not going in the hole again.

323
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,673
Asshole.

324
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,877
It's like sunk in or something.

325
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,651
- There goes your old camera, dude.
- Oh, shit.

326
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,358
That's weird.
I can still feel it down there.

327
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,129
I can't believe we made it out of there.

328
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,464
Well, I mean, that answers that, right?

329
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,733
Um, what does?
We still don't know what happened.

330
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,330
- No...
- Well, we're still alive.

331
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,897
- I mean, I was definitely...
- Hey!

332
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,943
- You kids can't be here, okay?

333
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,808
- You gotta move on out.
- What?

334
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,178
- The ground's unstable.
We're taping the whole place off.

335
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,714
Okay. We're going.

336
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,515
Vote for Steve!

337
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,818
New camera's working out
for you. That's good.

338
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,551
Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

339
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,991
Yeah, smaller. Does that shoot on tape?

340
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,121
No, it just...
It, like, records right onto the camera.

341
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,599
No, I just want to record
all the stuff that we can do, you know.

342
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,330
Yeah, but it's like all the time.

343
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,463
You don't feel like it's a little weird...

344
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,565
Like it puts a barrier between
you and everything else?

345
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,611
Uh, I don't know.

346
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,646
Maybe I want a barrier.

347
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:40,947
So, like, what's up with your dad?
What's his story? What does he do?

348
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,113
Um, my dad's a firefighter.

349
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:49,058
- Okay. That's cool. Oh, man,
that must have been awesome...
- Yeah, well, he was, I guess.

350
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,063
- What happened?
- Uh, I don't know. He didn't die or anything.

351
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,362
He just... He got injured on
the job, and now he, um...

352
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,426
he collects the insurance, you know.

353
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,938
Um, so he doesn't really do anything.

354
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:06,069
He just... He, um... He'll go out during
the day, but I don't know where he goes.

355
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,939
Uh, he drinks a lot.

356
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,778
I know that much.

357
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:13,118
Yes. Karen Detmer. D-E-T-M-E-R.

358
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:19,318
Yes. Karen Detmer. D-E-T-M-E-R.

359
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,851
Yes. Thank you.

360
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,632
She's in pain.

361
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,369
She needs something stronger.

362
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,533
Her breathing's worse.

363
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,145
Sir, she's suffering.

364
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,147
Please help me.

365
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,446
I'm on disability. I can't afford $700.

366
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,381
Please, don't put me on hold!
She can't breathe, okay?
I don't know what to do anymore.

367
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,954
Is it on?

368
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,296
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

369
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,358
I want to remember you like this.

370
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,370
Oh, Mom.

371
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,673
You're stronger than this.

372
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,613
Can you say that for me?

373
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,172
Please?

374
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,414
I'm stronger than this.

375
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,625
Oh, nice.

376
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,090
All right. Here. Watch this.

377
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,093
- Weak.
- Hey, Matt.

378
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,806
Yeah?

379
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,510
Do you like me?

380
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,910
Um, yeah, of course.

381
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,247
I mean, you know, I didn't...

382
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,718
- I mean, you know, I didn't always.
- What do you mean?

383
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,517
I don't know. Like, you haven't...

384
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,253
You haven't always been
super-easy to talk to, you know.

385
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,887
I mean, I'm not saying that you're not now.
I'm just...

386
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,454
You're such an asshole.

387
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,129
That's what I'm talking about, dude.
You're hostile, see?

388
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,696
- Better.

389
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,571
- Hey, Matt.
- Yeah?

390
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,543
Do you ever think about, like...

391
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,140
doing more with it?

392
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,012
What, with this?

393
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,710
Not really.

394
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,181
Why? What else is there?

395
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,779
- "Telekinesis."
Yes. Do tell.

396
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,690
"The ability to move, lift, vibrate"...

397
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,228
- That's my favorite.

398
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,992
" Spin, bend, break or impact objects...

399
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:44,900
through the direct influence of mental
power or other nonphysical means."

400
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,335
- Okay.
- Sounds familiar.

401
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,066
- It does sound familiar.
- Very familiar.

402
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,267
You want to see direct influence?

403
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,866
Andrew.

404
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,607
She's wearing black today.

405
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,548
- Hi.
- That's direct influence.

406
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,347
- ...week, in my room.
- Just listen.

407
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,447
I'm just that much stronger. Even last
night I got my whole bed off the ground.

408
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,186
- No nosebleed.
- Yeah? I've been lifting weights too.

409
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,058
This is my theory though
is that it's like a muscle.

410
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,963
Like, it's elastic. If you stretch it
too far, too quick, it'll tear.

411
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,967
Ew.

412
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,026
That's why I think we're getting stronger,
you know...

413
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,767
because we're working it out,
getting buff.

414
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,741
Buff.

415
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,744
How about this for a workout?

416
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,947
Holy shit!

417
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,576
That was awesome.

418
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,084
- Classy.

419
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,620
Mm-hmm. Attractive.

420
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,452
I think it's time we took this
out of the backyard.

421
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,485
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Right here. This is perfect.

422
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,053
Really?
- This is it.

423
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,292
Matt. Yah!

424
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,335
Let's get this one.

425
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,906
Whoa! Hey! Hello!

426
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,507
- Hey, what...
- Andrew.

427
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,742
Help! Somebody grab that!

428
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,943
- Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

429
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,621
- Okay, I'll get the top. I'll get the top.
- Got it. Got it.

430
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,521
- Let's get the legs.
- Okay. Wait.

431
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,685
I'm flying!

432
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,752
- She's just looking at it.

433
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,763
What you looking at, girl? Stay in school!

434
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,767
Okay, see the guy chewing the gum? I'm gonna get
the gum and pull it right out of his mouth.

435
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,530
Okay, I got him.

436
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,135
Oh!

437
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,172
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why are we running? We don't need to run.

438
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,772
Five...
- I don't want to do it.

439
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,373
- Four...
- Dude, I don't want to do it.

440
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,749
- You're creating a scene. I don't want to do it.
- Come on, Matt.

441
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,618
Don't be a bitch about it.
Just do it. Put your hand on the table.

442
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,782
Okay. Are you ready? Do it.
- Give me a countdown.

443
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,723
- I will. I promi...
- Ow!

444
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,352
Oh, snap!

445
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,420
- Like I said...
- You gotta pay for that now.

446
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,987
Like I said. See?

447
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,226
- Holy crap.

448
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,236
Man!
- Just pretend there's a barrier
over your hand, right? Then...

449
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,898
Mm-hmm.
- When things are gonna hit you, as long as you're ready...

450
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,942
- they will not hurt you because of the barrier.
- That's so sick.

451
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,807
That's me right there. I need that.

452
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,981
Steve, Steve, you have to try this, dude.
Give me your hand.

453
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,381
- That is disgusting.
- But do you guys share cups on the team?

454
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,578
- No, we don't share cups, man.

455
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,416
You see that car though?

456
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,820
- The red one.
- Yeah.

457
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,188
All right. The gum was cool.

458
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,888
All right. You tried.
It was a failed attempt though.

459
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,397
Watch this.

460
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,933
- What are you doing?
- Watch.

461
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,524
Go, go, go.

462
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,934
What?

463
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,941
No way!

464
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,240
Holy shit!

465
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,248
Dude! Holy crap!

466
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,744
What? What?

467
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,550
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Did anybody see?

468
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,454
Steve Montgomery for president!

469
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,858
- I'm having, like, a face period.
- Oh, man.

470
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,259
Pause.

471
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,026
- You guys. You guys, here she comes.

472
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,499
- Here she comes!
- Oh...

473
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,298
Don't look. Don't look, don't look.

474
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,929
Steve, don't look.

475
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,271
She can't find... She thinks it's stolen.

476
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,870
- She has no idea. Yes,
it was the black guy this time.

477
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,248
"I could have sworn
I parked it right here. Where is my car?"'

478
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,808
Ignore us.

479
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,151
We're just... Mormons.

480
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,123
What does that mean?

481
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,286
What does that mean?

482
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,626
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

483
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,029
Garetty's... Garetty's having a giggle fit.

484
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:35,367
- That was so... It was amazing.

485
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:39,133
- That was so... It was amazing.

486
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,468
I know.
Just take it easy with the merchandise.

487
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,270
How did nobody see that?
It was out in the open.

488
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,334
Her face! I cannot get her face
out of my mind!

489
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,845
That was awesome.

490
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,245
Who is this?

491
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,907
So many ideas of stuff that we can do!

492
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,315
- Go around.
- That's just some redneck asshole.

493
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,876
- Go around.
- Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.

494
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,421
Take the camera. Take the camera.

495
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,923
All right.
Just make sure it's zoomed out all the way.

496
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,118
- Got ya. I can see you.
- Okay, buddy.

497
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,024
- What you gonna do?

498
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,325
What the hell is this guy's problem?

499
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,161
What are you doing?

500
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,064
Abracadabra!

501
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,228
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Andrew, shit!

502
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,034
What the hell did you just do?
Matt, stop the car! Stop! Stop!

503
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,802
Are you crazy?
- Pull down the road.
We gotta go down there right now.

504
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,241
Guys, I'm sorry!

505
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,711
What did you do? Why did you do that?

506
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,577
I didn't mean to. I didn't...

507
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,775
Shit! What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at this!

508
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,977
Will you just calm down!
- The guy's probably still in there!

509
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,714
I'm sorry, okay?

510
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,120
- Andrew, stop, stop!
- But I can... I can help!

511
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,421
- I can get him out.
- Stop doing things!

512
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,893
Steve! Steve!

513
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,964
Steve, be careful!

514
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,801
Shit! Shit!

515
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,669
Oh, my God, Andrew. Are you kidding me?

516
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,141
- Steve!

517
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,077
Oh, God. Oh, God.

518
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,171
Goddamn it!

519
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,772
Steve!

520
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,516
- Andrew! Oh...

521
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,680
Shit!

522
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,423
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

523
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,086
Oh, Matt, he's got him!
He's got him. He's got...

524
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,755
Help me.

525
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,139
I'll get in back of him.

526
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,141
Get him up.

527
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,841
Hang on. Steve, stay with him.
I'm gonna go get some help.

528
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,317
- Are you calling the cops?
- Yeah, yeah.

529
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,480
- Will you stop? I can't hear them.
- Will you hang up the phone?

530
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,785
- Yeah. It's just down past,
uh, White Crescent Bridge.
- Matt, he's fine.

531
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,587
- Matt, he's fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,252
- Fine, Matt!
- Stop! Stop! I can't hear...

533
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,455
- Hey!

534
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,260
- Hey! Hey! Over here!

535
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,133
-... peeled off the road
and went straight through the guardrail.
- Hey, is that on?

536
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,366
-...this is a game or something?
- I don't understand how
you guys can be so angry.

537
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,907
You don't understand how we can be angry?

538
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,842
Andrew, you... you put somebody
in the hospital tonight, okay?

539
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,344
Do you understand that?

540
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,246
Andrew, look at me.
You put a guy in the hospital!

541
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,216
How do you feel about that?
You hurt somebody!

542
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,887
Shit.
- We need rules, okay?

543
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,185
No using it on living things.

544
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,421
You can't use it
when you're angry. That's it.

545
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:20,294
I don't think we should be using it in
public or telling anybody about it.

546
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,129
- Look, you can't just declare rules, okay?
- I will declare rules...

547
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,795
- You're the one that said that nothing matters.
- I will declare rules.

548
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,839
If we're gonna keep going,
and we're getting stronger, we need rules.

549
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,397
We need rules, right?

550
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,400
Matt's right. We need rules.

551
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,059
Andrew! Answer the goddamn phone!

552
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,024
- Andrew!

553
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,033
Matt, what did he say?

554
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,297
Are you still mad at me?

555
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,534
- No, I'm not mad.
- Well, you seem mad.

556
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,304
I'm not mad. I just...

557
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,609
I just think that we need to be more
careful now, you know? We can't...

558
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:15,745
We have to think a little bit more. We can't just do things.
We have to think first, okay?

559
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,457
- I understand.
- Okay.

560
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,120
Why is Steve out in the boonies?

561
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,684
Where are we?

562
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,752
Steve?

563
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,327
His car's right there.

564
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,991
Yeah. Steve, where you at?

565
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,866
Steve!

566
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,930
"Look up."

567
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,902
Hello, boys.

568
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,569
What?

569
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,442
- What is up?
- No. No.

570
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,539
Wait, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
Check me out. Hear me out.

571
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,311
- You're flying!
- Holy shit!

572
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,251
- Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out. Hear me out.
- No way! No way!

573
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,912
What are you doing?

574
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,618
It's much easier than it looks. I swear.
It's much easier than it looks.

575
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,250
Oh, my God, dude.

576
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,988
Make sure you catch yourself.
Don't try and jump...

577
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,996
- or you'll just flip yourself.
- I got it. I got it.

578
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,554
Come on, Matt. Come on.
- All right.

579
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,760
- Oh, shit!

580
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,530
Oh, man!

581
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,127
- Eating dirt, man.
- Why don't you get behind me?

582
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,298
- You were in my way.
- What do you mean?

583
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,934
Think Harrier jet. Think Harrier jet.

584
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,344
Oh, man.

585
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,211
- Goddamn it!
- Are you okay?

586
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,773
I'm watching.
- Just let me concentrate.

587
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,876
Focus! Focus!
- Okay! Hold on.

588
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,844
Is that your focus face?

589
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,413
Oh, my God, dude.

590
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,153
- Whoo!
- Bullshit!

591
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,525
- I'm up! I'm up!
- Are you kidding me?

592
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,393
- Holy crap!
- Hold it! Hold it!

593
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,433
- Oh, my God, dude. I am doing it.
- Holy crap, dude.

594
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,469
- Yeah!
- That's it, man. You're doing it.

595
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,028
Whoo-hoo!

596
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,041
- Okay. Okay.
Andrew, don't fart.
We'll never find you again.

597
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,009
Steve, stop me. Stop me, stop me.

598
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,636
Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa.

599
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,147
- You are flying now.
- You guys look so cute together.

600
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,152
- Whoa!
- I'm coming up. I'm bringing the camera, okay?

601
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,915
- All right.

602
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,021
All right. How do we get down?

603
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,993
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

604
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,559
Andrew! It's freezing up here!

605
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,399
- I can't hear you.

606
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,063
Activate hyperdrive!

607
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,732
Whoo!

608
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,644
- Where the hell are we?

609
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,205
- Catch up! Let's go!
- What?

610
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:30,744
Whoo! This is insane!

611
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,346
Whoo-hoo!

612
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,254
Dude!
- All right, Andrew!

613
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,223
Whoo!

614
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,161
- Tag, you're it!
- Watch out.

615
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,132
Pump the brakes!
- Whoa! Aah!

616
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:47,433
Hey, Matt! You're
finally good at something!

617
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,167
It's so easy! Yeah!

618
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,541
- Aah!
- Yeah!

619
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,904
Whoo!

620
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,180
Whoa!

621
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,649
Got it!

622
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,281
Tebow time, baby!

623
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,013
Yeah!

624
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,026
- Oh!
- Nice hands, Steve!

625
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,654
Touchdown!
- Throw it back to Daddy!

626
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,932
Oh, dude.
Nice catch, man! Yes!

627
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,136
- Steve! Go deep!
- Hey, Matt!

628
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,335
- Do you hear that?

629
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,405
What is that?

630
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,709
Steve!

631
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,876
Oh, shit. Almost died, dude.
Holy shit. Holy shit.

632
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,751
Almost died, man! Almost...

633
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,950
Andrew, you saved my life!

634
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,720
Oh, my God. You saved my life!

635
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,988
- Oh, God, you saved my life!

636
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,587
Oh, my God!

637
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,565
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

638
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,158
Is that the camera?
You saved me and the camera?

639
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,227
Please tell me you got that on tape!
You have to...

640
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,204
- Ah, shit.

641
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,300
- What the hell...
We're alive!

642
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,903
- What the hell happened?
- You didn't see what happened?

643
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,041
Oh, shit! Andrew! Andrew! You're a genius!

644
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,052
We got to see this! Holy...

645
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,145
All right. Oh. Holy shit.

646
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,953
Wait. Oh, God! We're on the ground. Yes!

647
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,584
- Whoo!

648
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,957
We have broken history!

649
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,997
I mean, I'm talking about
since the caveman times.

650
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,794
Uh, the Egyptians, the Wright brothers.

651
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,301
Come here, Matt. Come here.
Get in here. Get in.

652
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,666
Say it. "I can fly."

653
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,398
- I can fly.
- I can fly!

654
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,099
Oh, come on.
- Say it with your chest!

655
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,664
- I can fly!
- Say it, Matt.

656
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,972
- Shout it out!
- I can fly!

657
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,842
I can fly! I can fly!

658
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,211
I tried to save you, man.
Andrew was just quicker.

659
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:11,044
I tried to save you, man.
Andrew was just quicker.

660
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,275
How does that go again?

661
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,318
We almost died.

662
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,876
- Oh, please.
- Gestures...

663
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,979
How does she not notice though?

664
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,957
Come on. Let's be serious, guys.

665
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,653
She definitely noticed
that it's gotten better.

666
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,525
- You just gotta be, you know...
- Yeah?

667
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,086
You just gotta be subtle.

668
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,099
That is so cool.

669
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,170
Dude. And I haven't had sex since summer.

670
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,070
I haven't had sex since ever.

671
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,573
- Really?
- Really?

672
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,133
- That is completely unacceptable.
- Well...

673
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,271
How are you guys so cool?
How are you guys so cool, man?

674
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,941
- Liquid nitrogen.

675
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,826
Hey, guys?

676
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,634
- Guys? You guys up?

677
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,470
Yeah.

678
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,541
Hey, uh... Today was like...

679
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,914
It was like, I think,
the best day of my life.

680
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,387
Like, I mean...

681
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,724
I'm thinking about it,
and I can't think of any day...

682
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,890
that I liked better than today, you know?

683
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,660
I really... I think it was.

684
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,139
Yeah.

685
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,381
Unanimous.

686
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,712
Yes.

687
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,252
Okay. Good.

688
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,279
Okay, check this out. Say what you want...

689
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,292
but I'm thinking about
booking it to Maui for the weekend.

690
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,657
- What's up with that?
- Seriously?

691
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,356
Well, we could do it. I mean,
I was thinking the same thing...

692
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,455
except I've always wanted to go to Tibet.

693
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,590
- Why Tibet?
- Tibet?

694
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,158
Yeah. I don't know.

695
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,067
It seems really beautiful,
you know, with all the...

696
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,606
Will you shut up? Shut...

697
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,770
- The monuments and mountains, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,374
I don't know. And the monks have achieved
such a high level of enlightenment...

699
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,180
that they can, like,
float and shit, you know?

700
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,916
- So we would fit right in.
- We could really mess with their heads as well.

701
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,917
Yeah, but, like, seriously,
I think we should go.

702
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:43,192
It would be really cool. Peaceful.

703
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,725
No, I think it's a really good idea.
I actually would like to go.

704
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,635
I'm down. You down, Steve?

705
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,503
What... I-I don't know, man.

706
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,807
There's no bikinis in Tibet.
So I don't know if I'm down with that.

707
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,017
Oh, hey. Sorry, I just...

708
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,519
Hi.

709
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,050
Do you mind if I film you?

710
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,423
Uh, a little bit. I don't really like
being on camera actually.

711
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,429
Well, maybe it's, like, exposure therapy.

712
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,125
Yeah. No, I just came by
to give you something actually.

713
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,867
- You did?
- Yeah.

714
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,360
What?

715
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,168
I was watching your, um...

716
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,840
your-your... you know, your blog?

717
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,539
There's a drought in
the Central African Republic, right?

718
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,674
Yeah. So I saw that and I thought it seems
pretty cool, and it's cheap too...

719
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,240
so I thought why not?

720
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,180
- Totally.
- Yeah.

721
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,215
- Yeah, I can tell that you're
really global and big picture...

722
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,853
- concerned about that kind of stuff.
- Yeah.

723
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,390
You know, Matt,
you can just mail this yourself.

724
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,332
I'm not your mom.

725
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,699
Okay. I mean, I just...

726
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,137
What is this?
Is this, like, the new you?

727
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,142
You got too smart
to have fun in eighth grade. So now what?

728
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,234
No.

729
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,778
Casey, Casey, Casey, Casey, Casey, Casey.

730
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,407
Listen, listen. Can I just
talk to you for a second?

731
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,383
- Can I just tell you something?
- Mm-hmm.

732
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,249
I just... I-l...

733
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,085
I just want you to know I'm not, you know,
who I was... now.

734
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,923
- You know, I'm cool. I'm just...
- You're cool?

735
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,555
High school popularity just seemed like
this weird backward contest...

736
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,531
and I thought
since I knew that, I could just...

737
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,625
That made you better than everybody else.

738
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,101
No. No, no, no.

739
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,400
- I know what you mean.
- I would separate myself from that.

740
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,769
- I get it.
- You get it?

741
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,137
Mm-hmm.

742
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,075
I know it sounds weird.
I just wanted you to know that.

743
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,772
To know that you're cool.

744
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,541
Wow, I really screwed this up.

745
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,181
Not as much as you might think.

746
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,481
- Really?
- Good-bye.

747
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,953
- Casey...
- I gotta go. Bye.

748
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,826
Come on.

749
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,623
Dude! When did you start doing this?

750
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,062
- Like, since when?
- What, with the camera?

751
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,598
- Yes, with the camera.
- Um...

752
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,497
I don't know. It's been
a little while, I guess.

753
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,365
See... Oh. I can't do that.

754
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,632
I can't do stuff that requires finesse.

755
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,834
I tried to type my name out yesterday,
and I cracked my keyboard in half.

756
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,073
No, dude. It's really easy. You just...
You think that you're holding it.

757
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,216
- Whoo!

758
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,113
See, it's different,
'cause you've always had friends...

759
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,556
and people want to talk to you
and be around you.

760
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,594
I never had any of that.
I mean, before this...

761
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,291
- I barely even hung out with Matt,
and he's my cousin.

762
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,163
We were close when we were little, but...

763
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,464
I don't know.
In high school, everything changed.

764
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,033
You know, I've been meaning to ask you.

765
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,805
Winter break is coming up.

766
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,778
You should do the talent show with me.

767
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,445
No way.

768
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,711
Why not? It'd be good for you
to get out there, you know.

769
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,084
- Meet some people, meet some girls.
- Dude, I'm not... It's just not...

770
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,415
- What?
- Look, I'm just really shy, okay?

771
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:59,054
And I don't...
I don't even have any talents, so...

772
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,156
What are you talking about,
you don't have... You have talent.

773
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,695
You've got talent.

774
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,496
Oh, dude, no way.

775
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,098
You look handsome.

776
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,236
- Thanks, yes. Steve...

777
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,974
- Let me borrow some of his clothes...

778
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,449
to make me look cool or whatever.

779
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,250
I'm glad you're spending
so much time with your friends.

780
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,621
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

781
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,970
Hey.
- What?

782
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,432
How are you getting to school?

783
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,513
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't bullshit me, you idiot.

784
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,643
Matt doesn't come. He doesn't drive up.

785
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,916
You leave the house.
Who the hell's giving you rides to school?

786
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,084
- M-Matt.
- All right. You know what?

787
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,320
You're lying.

788
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,158
You're up to something,
and you can't hide it.

789
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,897
You think you can just slink, hmm?

790
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,201
Sneak in, sneak around my house, smiling?

791
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,399
I'm onto your shit.

792
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:22,146
How do you even work
this stupid thing?

793
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,808
How do you even work
this stupid thing?

794
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,645
- Ah! And we're in business.

795
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,332
Boo!

796
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,543
- Hey.
- Hi.

797
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,411
Um, what are you doing here?

798
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,714
I'm filming for the talent show.

799
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,517
- Matt Garetty is filming for the talent show.
- Yes, I am.

800
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,921
Wow.

801
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,694
What is this, some kind of
newfound school spirit?

802
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,594
- How do you like it, huh? Being on camera?

803
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,633
- I actually don't mind being on camera.
- Oh. Here we go.

804
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,361
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
now coming to the stage...</i>

805
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,565
- What? No philosophical comeback for me?
<i>- Steve Montgomery.</i>

806
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,471
You're probably gonna
want to get this on camera.

807
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,340
All my underclassmen, come on.
Make some noise. That's not loud enough.

808
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,949
How about my upperclassmen?
Come on. Make some noise!

809
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,545
Yeah, Steve!

810
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:42,251
- Let me hear it from my seniors,
class of 2012!

811
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,688
Yeah. Shh.

812
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:51,599
Now I want you guys to give it up for the
young and very talented Mr. Andrew Detmer.

813
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,396
- And you're on.
- Come on, y'all.

814
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,703
- What are you guys doing?
- Let's go, let's go!

815
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,803
Are you playing a prank on your cousin?

816
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,871
That's mean, Matt.

817
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,109
Just watch.

818
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,713
Really?

819
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,122
- Good luck!
- What's he doing?

820
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,627
Show us some talent!

821
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,233
Nice, Matt.

822
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,871
Fifty-two Pickup! Pick 'em up!

823
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:36,244
No way!

824
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,485
Yeah!

825
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,111
Whoo!

826
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,419
Go, Andrew!

827
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,583
What? What?

828
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,298
- Are they gonna walk on that?
- What do you think?

829
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,006
- Whoa. He's got it.
- He's got it. He's got it.

830
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,275
Easy.

831
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,839
Yeah, you got it.

832
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,151
Holy crap!

833
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,190
Yeah! Cakewalk!

834
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,784
Give it up, give it up, give it up!

835
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:27,695
Oh, my God. Andrew is so amazing.

836
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,962
Whoa!

837
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,065
- Give it up! Let's go!

838
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,168
- Seriously, how are they doing this?
- I don't know.

839
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,707
Magic.

840
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,542
- Whoo!

841
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,247
That was amazing!
- Yeah!

842
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:55,815
Whoo! Whoo!
- Andrew!

843
00:44:55,893 --> 00:45:01,126
- Oh, my God. I can see your head
is, like, exploding right now.
What?

844
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,861
This is the beginning of your downfall.
Hubris. Right there.

845
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,870
- What's hubris?
- Ha, ha, ha.

846
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,066
- No, what does "hubris" mean, Matt?
- Seriously?

847
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,577
- What does "seriously" mean?
- What? I'm...

848
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,340
- Get in there.
- Don't push me, dude. I'm going.

849
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,438
Your fans await. You're
the man of the hour.

850
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,779
- Look at this house!
- Oh, sick!

851
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,149
- Dude, this place looks huge.
- I know.

852
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,346
- It's enormous.
- Dude.

853
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,945
Matt! Andrew!

854
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,684
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Steve! Oh, my God!

855
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,420
- Everybody's freaking out.
- Come on, man.
Everybody's been waiting for you.

856
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,594
V. I. P. coming through. Coming through!

857
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,655
Andrew Copperfield coming through!

858
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,758
Make way, make way.

859
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,100
Matt, come this way. Drew, over here.

860
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,107
Andrew Detmer's in the house!

861
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:52,504
How are you feeling?
- I'm-I'm... I'm doing good.

862
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,245
- Yeah? Are you sure? Are you sure?
- Hey. Hey.

863
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,308
- Hello.
- Andrew.

864
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,980
- Magic is so hot.
- Oh, wow. Thanks.

865
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,220
- So, do you not remember me at all?
- Um...

866
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,056
- Monica, right? Monica.
- Yes!

867
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,962
...setting the camera down.
I'm setting the camera down.

868
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,020
- What...
- Oh.

869
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,124
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

870
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,692
- Have you ever played that, over there?

871
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,331
Uh, no. I have never
played that, over there.

872
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,033
- No?
- Never.

873
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,338
- I bet you're good at it.
- Uh...

874
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,935
- What, you just throw the ball into the cups?
- Yep. Yep.

875
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:27,040
- I actually could be good at that right now.
- Yeah?

876
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,448
- Maybe.
- Let's find out.

877
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,781
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on!

878
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:31,320
- What?
- Come on.

879
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,753
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

880
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,983
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

881
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,821
There you are.

882
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,790
Amazing.

883
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,832
That's what I'm talking about.

884
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,907
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

885
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,542
Hey, where is Andrew anyway?

886
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,087
Oh.

887
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,249
Andrew's upstairs with the girl
with the pink hair.

888
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,054
What, like, they went together?

889
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,290
That's my boy. Of course they went together.
What are you talking 'bout?

890
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,627
Hey, Andrew. I hope you're seeing this.

891
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,860
Congratulations, sir.

892
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,766
I just wanted you to know, dude...

893
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,534
I was really worried about you
before all this, you know?

894
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:27,236
But, dude, things are gonna get
so much better for you now.

895
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,871
I really, really feel that.

896
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,814
And I want you to know
I love you, you know?

897
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,545
I love you, man. It's you and me.

898
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,385
It's Detmer and Garetty,
extended family for life.

899
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,889
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- No, man. Excuse yourself.

900
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,025
Oh, man.

901
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:52,432
- When did I become the one
who's out here filming myself?
- Hey, Matt.

902
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,596
Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.

903
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,503
So what are you filming?

904
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,405
Uh, it's just a thing.

905
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:02,070
It's not like
eye of the storm or anything.

906
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:05,478
Hey, I wanted to... I wanted to tell you...

907
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,983
I've really been...
It's been making me think a lot.

908
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,383
I've been kind of thinking
about it in my...

909
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,388
No, I have. Like, in my life.

910
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,981
I've been thinking,
if I applied myself, what I could do.

911
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,253
I could really... I could change the world.

912
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,955
- I mean, it's really been...
- You're drunk.

913
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,657
What?

914
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,860
- Hey, Casey?

915
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:28,803
I've basically been stalking you since,
like, sophomore year.

916
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,067
Sorry, use of the word "stalking."
I shouldn't have said...

917
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,768
You want to get out of here?

918
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,306
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

919
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,869
Yes. Yes, definitely.

920
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:40,110
Uh, I have to drop off
the camera first though.

921
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,879
Okay, you guys are getting ready
to witness history, all right?

922
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,858
I'm like a proud dad right now
because behind these doors...

923
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,361
Andrew Detmer becomes a man.

924
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,630
He's a little boy behind there.
He's scared.

925
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,327
He's like a butterfly,
getting ready to emerge...

926
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,700
Oh, God!
- From a cocoon or some shit like that.

927
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,830
Disgusting weirdo!

928
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,965
- Wait. What happened?
- Ha-ha. Okay...

929
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,839
- Is that...
- Out of my way now!

930
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,174
- Oh, man.
- Monica, what happened?

931
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,238
Drew! Drew!
It's okay, man. Don't worry about it.

932
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,147
- Look, it happens to the best of us, okay?
- Dude!

933
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,775
You had a little too much to drink...

934
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,821
- You...
- Oh. Oh. Whoa, buddy.

935
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,686
- The hell's going on, dude?
- Why are you laughing?

936
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,349
Aw, man. All over my jacket.

937
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,792
- Stop. Stop laughing.
- What are you talking about?

938
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,921
- It's cool, man.
- No, it's not cool, Steve. Stop.

939
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,899
- Stop what? It's cool, man.
- Will you just get out of here?

940
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,629
- Get out! What's your problem?
- Drew, Drew!

941
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,295
- You think this is funny?
- No, I'm not laughing...

942
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,303
Get out!

943
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,607
- Dad!

944
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:16,476
Andrew! Please! I need my medicine.

945
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:20,209
Mom's in pain, all right?
She needs her pills! Where are you?

946
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:28,251
Where are you?

947
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,928
Dad!

948
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:38,798
Hoarding a $500 camera while your mom dies
in there? I mean, how selfish can you be?

949
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,530
I went through your camera.

950
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,433
What did you see?

951
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,937
Just you being a loser.

952
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,274
You think that those people
are your friends?

953
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,584
Huh? They're not.

954
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,123
You're an embarrassment.

955
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,217
You're running around this town,
spending my money.

956
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,852
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

957
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,124
I didn't spend any of your money, Richard.

958
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,190
'Cause I don't have a dime to spend.

959
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,828
Every last cent... Look at me!

960
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,395
- Every last cent goes to school for you...
- School?

961
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,600
- and medication for your mother.
- I go to a public school!

962
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,667
- I can't even pay for a goddamn...
- You don't pay for a public school, you idiot!

963
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,142
What did you call me?

964
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,910
Did you call me an idiot, you shit?

965
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,110
Did you call me an idiot? Huh?

966
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,814
You piece of shit!

967
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:35,016
Get up. I said get up!

968
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,354
Get up!

969
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,827
- I could crush you, you know that?
- Stop it!

970
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,423
- Crush you!
- Get...

971
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,558
Smile, Matt.

972
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,427
- Oh, my God, Matt.
- Oh.

973
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,297
Can we not do the camera thing
right now, please?

974
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,563
- What happened?

975
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,970
Uh... It just started out of nowhere.

976
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,304
- Are you okay?

977
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,105
My head hurts really bad.

978
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,008
That's probably Steve
calling your cell again.

979
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,572
I'll call him back later.

980
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,447
- I think it's time to take...

981
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,223
Hey! Hey, asshole!

982
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,695
What are you doing up here?

983
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,425
Just leave me alone, Steve!

984
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,899
You can't be up here, dude.
This isn't safe.

985
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,595
I don't want to talk to anyone.

986
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,831
Bro, what are you doing up here?

987
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,498
Leave me alone!

988
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,875
- How did you find me?

989
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,412
I don't know, man. My nose was bleeding.

990
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,038
I heard your voice or something like...

991
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,946
What the hell happened to your face?

992
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,882
Nothing, man. Just leave me alone.

993
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,580
Well, that's not nothing. That... Your dad!

994
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,249
Your dad beat the shit out of you.
He can't do that to you now.

995
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,588
Will you stop acting like you give a shit?

996
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,152
Dude. Why are you talking to me like this?
I'm your best friend.

997
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,027
I don't have any friends!

998
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,123
You were never my friend
before any of this.

999
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,965
I hang out with you and Matt,
like, every day!

1000
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,030
We're supposed to fly around the world together.
Don't you... Do you remember that?

1001
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,575
- You think I'm...
- Stop! Just stop talking to me!

1002
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,873
- Why won't you just leave me alone?
- Come on, man.

1003
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,540
Steve, I'm telling you, get away from me!

1004
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,516
Get away from me now! Please!

1005
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,985
...who, by the power of God,
are safeguarded in faith.

1006
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,854
- Even though you do not see him now...

1007
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,123
you rejoice with an indescribable
and glorious joy...

1008
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,495
as you attain the goal of your faith...

1009
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,466
the salvation of your soul.

1010
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,537
What are you doing? You filming graves?

1011
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,564
- I don't get it.
- What do you care?

1012
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,737
You haven't been returning my calls.
Why aren't you returning my calls?

1013
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,541
- I've been busy.
- No, you haven't.

1014
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,104
Why aren't you returning my calls?

1015
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,706
I just don't feel like talking.

1016
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,775
- Turn off the camera.
- No.

1017
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,946
Andrew. Andrew, turn off the camera.

1018
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,454
Andrew?
How did he get struck by lightning...

1019
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,755
during a storm with no
recorded lightning strikes?

1020
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,289
How?

1021
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,354
And they found Steve
out in the middle of a field.

1022
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,458
Why would Steve go out in the middle of
a field during a lightning storm, Andrew?

1023
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,695
- I don't know.
- Why? What?

1024
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,431
I don't know what happened, Matt!

1025
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,166
I don't believe you, okay?
I don't believe you.

1026
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,538
- I want you to turn off
the camera and talk to me.
- Why?

1027
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,271
- 'Cause I want to have a conversation with you.
- Don't tell me what to do, Matt.

1028
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,575
You can't tell me what to do!
Don't ever tell...

1029
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,774
- Give me... Shut it off!
- Get off of me!

1030
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,783
Andrew... Are you joking right now?

1031
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,722
Is this a joke to you? I...

1032
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,355
What did you do, Andrew?

1033
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,094
What did you do?

1034
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,796
Who am I supposed to tell about this?

1035
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,862
Who do I talk to?
Who do I talk to about this?

1036
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,932
Why won't you just tell me
what happened, Andrew?

1037
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,188
Please believe me, Steve.

1038
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,386
Please, it's just I...

1039
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,327
I don't know what I did. I...

1040
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,264
I lost control, and...

1041
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,233
and I'm so sorry.

1042
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:17,203
This thing is just becoming
a part of me now...

1043
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,934
and I don't...

1044
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,633
I miss you, Steve.

1045
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,280
...all the drills. Good.
We're all pretty good, right?

1046
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,782
Get ready. Go!

1047
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,254
You guys? Do not hesitate.

1048
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,549
Did you hear who worked?

1049
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,960
- He was like...

1050
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:47,264
Oh! Oh, Andrew!

1051
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,168
- Dry off!

1052
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,036
Totally.

1053
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,936
Hey, Wayne!

1054
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,443
Okay, so, see this one here?

1055
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,514
This one I got really clean
'cause I did this little, like...

1056
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,651
lasso thing around the root, you know?

1057
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,855
But then these two...

1058
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,093
these, I did not get as good.

1059
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,192
See how they're broken?

1060
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,568
I think it's because I got them from
the middle, you know, instead of the root.

1061
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,664
- Oh. Oh.

1062
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,336
Oh. Sloppy.

1063
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,209
I've been doing a lot of reading, you know,
like, online about, like...

1064
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,444
just like evolution and, like...
and natural selection...

1065
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,815
and how, like, there's this thing, right?

1066
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,548
It is called the apex predator, right?

1067
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:44,355
And basically what this is is the strongest
animal in the ecosystem, right?

1068
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,793
And as human beings...

1069
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,161
we are... we're considered
the apex predator...

1070
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,497
but only because,
like, smaller animals can't feed on us...

1071
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,332
because of weapons and stuff, right?

1072
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:59,068
The lion does not feel guilty
when it kills a gazelle. Right?

1073
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,838
You do not feel guilty
when you squash a fly.

1074
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,871
And I think that means something.

1075
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,545
- I just think that really means something.

1076
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,522
<i>This one I got really clean
'cause I did this little, like...</i>

1077
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,090
<i>lasso thing.</i>

1078
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,437
- Andrew, what happened at school? Huh?

1079
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,001
- I need to go and pick up
my mom's medication!
- Oh, yeah?

1080
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,673
You're gonna break the rules again?
We're too strong for that now, Andrew!

1081
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,216
- If you did that, you know what I'd have to do!
- You'd have to what?

1082
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,343
- You have to start thinking.
- What would you have to do, Matt?

1083
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,182
There are consequences to what you do!

1084
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,917
- You could not do anything to me
because I am stronger than you.
- Stop that bullshit!

1085
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,050
I know what you did.
I'm not gonna let you do it again!

1086
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,560
I am not going to break
your stupid rules! Okay?

1087
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:56,292
So just screw off and stay out of my life!

1088
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,161
I can't breathe.

1089
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,026
Thank you.

1090
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,172
Karen Detmer.
- Just one moment.

1091
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,642
We're gonna need a next-day delivery.

1092
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,673
Co-pay on that is $750.83.

1093
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,050
Well, I don't have all that.
- Son, I told your dad, and I'll tell you.

1094
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,885
You can pay up front,
and we can order next-day delivery.

1095
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,594
- Other than that, I can't help you.
- Prick.

1096
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,159
<i>Oh!</i>

1097
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,271
Hey.

1098
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,010
Hey!

1099
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,848
- Give me all your money.
- Uh, what? Who is that?

1100
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,151
Doesn't matter who it is.
Just give me all your money or else.

1101
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,590
- Or else? Shit, man.

1102
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,551
Shit, man. Is that Andrew?

1103
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,995
It sounds kind of
like Andrew under there.

1104
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,966
And you got Andrew's broke-ass backpack on.

1105
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,970
- Oh, you got a gat?
- I got a gat too, bitch.

1106
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,397
Dude!

1107
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,514
Whoa, dude!

1108
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,310
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

1109
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,182
Come on, come on, come on!

1110
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,162
- Hey!

1111
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,788
The camera needs to stay on
for our investigation.

1112
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,625
Jesus Christ.

1113
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:22,255
Can I have a moment alone with my son?

1114
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,731
If he regains consciousness,
notify the officer outside.

1115
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,927
Yeah, yeah.

1116
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,528
Oh!

1117
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,784
Your mother's dead.

1118
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,749
She died last night
while I was out looking for you.

1119
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,096
I came home, and, uh...

1120
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,104
she was there in her bed.

1121
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,664
If I just could have been there for her.

1122
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,170
I was always there for her
when you were out screwing around.

1123
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,283
And this one time...

1124
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:52,512
this... one time...

1125
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:55,989
that she needed me, and you took me away!

1126
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,390
I want you to apologize to me.

1127
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,892
I know you can hear me,
so I want you to sit up right now...

1128
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,629
and apologize to me.

1129
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,369
You selfish, selfish asshole!

1130
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,071
This is your fault!

1131
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,133
You...

1132
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,944
Do you hear me?

1133
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,420
Your mother is dead, and it is your fault!

1134
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,555
- Happy birthday!

1135
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,255
Pound it? Pound it?

1136
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,662
Go and get a present.
Go and get a present. Yeah.

1137
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:40,293
- Yes, the big one.
- Oh, my God. Matt.

1138
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,360
Matt, your nose again.

1139
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,169
Are you okay?

1140
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,802
- Oh, shit!
- Baby, you're really bleeding.

1141
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,040
- Matt, your nose! Oh, my God.

1142
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,912
Did you hear that?
How can you not hear that?

1143
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,747
- Hear what? What are you hearing?
- It's so...

1144
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,480
- Something's wrong with Andrew.
- Casey, come in here!

1145
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,856
<i>We apologize for the delay,
but as of right now...</i>

1146
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,052
<i>- every news helicopter in Greater King County...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1147
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,719
<i>Is headed to Seattle.</i>

1148
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,060
<i>Again, right now,
we have very little information...</i>

1149
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:12,862
<i>but it appears a bomb has gone off
at Ballard Community Hospital.</i>

1150
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,960
Casey, come here. Come here.
Come here. Please. Please.

1151
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,232
- What? No, Matt. Are you seeing this?
- Where are your keys at?

1152
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,240
- What? Matt...
- Just stay here. I'll be back.

1153
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,471
- I just have to drive there, okay?
- Please, wait! Matt, please!

1154
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,605
- Listen, Andrew's in trouble, okay?
- Andrew's what?

1155
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,047
- I'm sure that Andrew is fine.

1156
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,320
- Andrew needs me! I need to get to the city.
- Tell me what's going on.

1157
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,549
Shit. I gotta get... Is that a roadblock?

1158
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,682
Nobody else is driving this way!
Talk to me!

1159
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,989
- Casey, I need to think, okay?
- Stop!

1160
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,790
I gotta find another way downtown.
Shit!

1161
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,421
Go back and take the Madison exit.

1162
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,092
- Come on.

1163
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,336
- Stay here, Casey. Stay here.
- Wait!

1164
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:52,897
Matt, wait for me!

1165
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,000
<i>All units,
report to Ballard Community Hospital.</i>

1166
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,210
Excuse me.

1167
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:00,771
Sir, excuse me.

1168
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,909
Matt! What are we doing here?

1169
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,224
Oh, my God!

1170
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,254
You gotta put me down! Please! Stop!

1171
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,958
You did this to me!

1172
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,135
Matt! Oh, my God!

1173
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,271
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1174
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,643
- Matt!
- Casey, we gotta go! We gotta go right now!

1175
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,807
Get in the car! Let's go.

1176
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,680
- Andrew's out of control.
- What are you talking about?

1177
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,276
- I'm so sorry. I wanted to tell you. I...

1178
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,279
Oh, my God, Matt! Stop the car!

1179
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,019
It's gonna crash. Holy shit!

1180
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,924
- Oh, shit!

1181
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,589
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off the road now!

1182
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,998
Oh, my God!

1183
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,060
Hold on to me!

1184
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,628
- It's not me, it's Andrew!

1185
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,206
- Hold on!

1186
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:07,113
I can't stop it! I can't control the car!
I can't control it.

1187
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,844
Shit!

1188
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,148
Andrew! Oh, God, hold on!

1189
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,381
- Hold on to me!

1190
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,251
I can't get the door open!

1191
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,166
Oh, my God!
- Andrew! Andrew, stop!

1192
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,365
- Casey!
- Matt!

1193
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,432
- Matt!

1194
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,109
Help me!

1195
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,718
- Casey, hold on!

1196
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,987
Matt.

1197
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,688
Stay here. Okay?
You have to stay here. Okay?

1198
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,966
Matt, please don't go! Matt!

1199
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,864
<i>We got a car on fire
under the Needle. Possible casualties.</i>

1200
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,995
<i>We need emergency response now.</i>

1201
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,233
<i>I don't know how to describe this.</i>

1202
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,844
<i>That is the Needle we're looking
at, and as you can see, there are...</i>

1203
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,074
- You're not gonna believe this.

1204
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,140
Are you seeing this?

1205
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,749
Back away from the window!

1206
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,018
<i>What the hell are they doing up there?</i>

1207
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,583
- Get down!

1208
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,893
<i>Seventeen, beware.</i>

1209
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,766
<i>You're gonna have to divert.</i>

1210
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,739
Andrew! Andrew, look at me!

1211
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:42,243
This has to stop right now, okay?
This is really, really bad!

1212
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,938
Why did you catch him?

1213
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,244
- Listen! Just focus, okay?
- I dropped him!

1214
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,375
- Why did you catch him?
- Andrew, this is not a game!

1215
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,919
Do you understand? You're hurting people.

1216
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,455
You're weak, Matt! You're all weak!

1217
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,684
- Andrew...
- I'm stronger than all of this!

1218
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,227
Andrew, listen to me, okay?
Just-Just... I need you to listen.

1219
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,024
Just focus for a second.

1220
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,564
Do not tell me what to do!

1221
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:06,760
<i>I'm try.ing to explain.
I got two individuals.</i>

1222
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:09,736
- They can't stop us. It's not too late for us to go.
- It is too late!

1223
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,501
I'm done! It's over!

1224
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,669
You treated me like shit!
You left me alone!

1225
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,804
Andrew, you're not alone up here!
I'm here with you!

1226
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,543
I should have been with you all along!
But I'm here now!

1227
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,677
And we can stop this right now, you and me!

1228
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:29,355
Andrew, we can just fly away.
We can get out of here.

1229
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,552
We can be family.

1230
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,619
Andrew. Andrew, look at yourself.

1231
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,825
- This isn't who you are.
I'm an apex predator.

1232
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,231
What?

1233
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,569
I'm an apex predator.

1234
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,536
No! No!

1235
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,415
Oh, my gosh! Call the police!

1236
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,989
- Andrew, no!

1237
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,835
- Oh! Whoa!

1238
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,368
Paul! Paul, stay away from the window!
- Okay, okay!

1239
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:27,245
- Paul! Don't stand at the window!
- Are you seeing this? Hey!

1240
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,983
Stay down, babe! Stay down!

1241
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,367
Andrew!

1242
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,070
<i>Two subjects down. One injured, one mobile.</i>

1243
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,409
- Andrew? Andrew, look at me.

1244
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,381
This is all gonna be fine.
You're gonna be all right, okay?

1245
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,948
I'm gonna get you help, okay?

1246
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,352
<i>All units, respond Code 4 to Denny Way.</i>

1247
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,915
Get out of here! It's not safe!

1248
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:15,260
Andrew? Andrew?

1249
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:20,200
Are you getting this?
- Don't move!

1250
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,100
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1251
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,073
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need help! I need help!

1252
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,802
<i>He appears
to be held at gunpoint, but...</i>

1253
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:28,865
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1254
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,434
Arms up in the air!

1255
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,241
Don't shoot, please!

1256
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,077
He's hurt!

1257
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,742
- Get on the ground!
- Wait! Wait!

1258
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,151
- Do what he says!
- Now, get down!

1259
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,452
- Do not get up!
- Get on the ground!

1260
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,492
Please don't shoot!
- We will shoot you!

1261
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,121
- I'm not gonna do anything!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! The glass!

1262
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,791
- Take him out!

1263
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,133
Leave me alone!

1264
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,045
Shit!

1265
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,846
Whoa! Whoa! Wow!

1266
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,565
<i>We have multiple explosions.</i>

1267
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,762
- Get in position!
- We have 'em in our sights!

1268
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,431
- We're covered! Hold it right there!

1269
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,835
No! Stop!

1270
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,441
We have you surrounded!

1271
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,646
- No!
- Hands where we can see 'em!

1272
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,844
Stay down! Stay down!

1273
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,752
- Stay down!
- I repeat, do not move!

1274
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,185
Additional units on the far side!

1275
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,830
Yo, stay down!

1276
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,335
Stay down! Don't move!

1277
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:04,133
Andrew! Andrew!

1278
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,197
Stop! Don't hurt them!

1279
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,139
Andrew!

1280
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,052
Andrew!

1281
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:28,995
Andrew! Andrew, stop!

1282
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,656
Please, stop!

1283
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,834
Andrew!

1284
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,568
Don't make me do this!

1285
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:43,606
Stop!

1286
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,825
<i>...reports of casualties.</i>

1287
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,733
<i>At least two structures
have been destroyed.</i>

1288
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:10,738
I think they're both down!

1289
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,296
<i>Two men out.</i>

1290
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,638
<i>Show me right now eastbound on...</i>

1291
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,474
<i>Yes, sir.
I'm about two blocks away. I see it.</i>

1292
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,837
Move up.

1293
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,123
Hey! Oh! What are you doing?

1294
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,827
Hey, Andrew.

1295
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,503
I just wanted to say that...

1296
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,812
I'm sorry and, uh...

1297
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,618
I... I hope...

1298
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,787
that you know that I did what I had to do.

1299
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,598
You're not a bad person. I know that.

1300
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,592
That's all that matters.

1301
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,504
And, uh, I want you to know...

1302
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,700
that I'm gonna be better from now on.

1303
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,107
I'm gonna help people.

1304
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,544
I'm gonna find out
what happened to us down there.

1305
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,605
I don't care how long it takes.

1306
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:03,480
I'm gonna get answers.

1307
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,817
I'm gonna do it for you,
and I'm gonna do it for Steve.

1308
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,583
And...

1309
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,249
I just...

1310
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,956
I love you, man.

1311
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,795
I didn't ever get a chance to tell you...

1312
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,801
but I love you.

1313
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,837
And guess what.

1314
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,383
You made it.

1315
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,587
Whoo-hoo!

1316
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,155
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1317
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,035
Isn't it beautiful?

1318
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,107
Good-bye, Andrew.

1
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,810
- Is it a girl?
- Yes.

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,605
Show me its arm.

3
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,442
- She bears the mark.
- No!

4
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,781
The omen is true.
I must tell my mother.

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,286
- Please help me!
- I can't.

6
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,164
They're going to kill her.

7
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:29,005
Please! Please!

8
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,634
Oh, thank you, Ethna. Thank you.

9
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,687
Stand aside for Queen Bavmorda!

10
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:11,547
You cannot stop the prophecy!

11
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,550
This child will have no power over me.
Start the ritual.

12
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,212
No. No!

13
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,283
Where's the baby?

14
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:21,786
- The midwife.
- Find that baby, Sorsha.

15
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,436
Use the dogs. Bring her back to me alive!

16
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,647
Your reign of terror is at an end!

17
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,634
She will come back,
and she will finish you!

18
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:31,548
- Silence, wench.
- My baby will finish you!

19
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,507
Kill her.

20
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,778
Dada! Dada!

21
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,452
Dada! Dada!

22
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,956
Dada! Dada!
We found something in the river.

23
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,668
I can't run off and play
with you now, Ranon.

24
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,966
- I've got work to do.
- You gotta come. Hurry!

25
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,801
Come on.

26
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,265
Don't go near it.
We don't know where it's been.

27
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,185
But, Dada, it's a baby.

28
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:39,106
It's not like us.
No. It's not a Nelwyn.

29
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,735
- It looks like a Daikini baby.
- What's a Daikini?

30
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
Daikinis are big.

31
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,365
Giants who live far away.

32
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,659
Oh, she's so cute.

33
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,829
- Can't we keep it, Dada?
- No!

34
00:06:55,575 --> 00:07:00,127
We'll push it downstream and forget
we ever saw it. Come on.

35
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,129
Ufgood! Willow Ufgood!

36
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:06,425
Shh! It's the prefect. That's all I need.

37
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,845
Keep it quiet. Don't touch it.

38
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,749
Mr. Burglekutt,
my husband hasn't stolen anything!

39
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,311
Baaa!

40
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:24,276
Ufgood, you still haven't
paid your debts to me.

41
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,362
Where did you get these seeds?

42
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,156
Well, maybe I used magic.

43
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:33,202
You're no sorcerer, Ufgood.
You're a clown.

44
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,128
I sell the planting seeds around here.
Now tell me where you got them.

45
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:40,376
My family's been gathering them
in the forest since last fall.

46
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,462
There's no law against
that, Mr. Burglekutt.

47
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,007
Willow, you didn't leave them
alone by the river?

48
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,961
Magic? You'll need magic...

49
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,497
if you expect to get your planting
done before the rains start.

50
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
I will have this land, Ufgood.

51
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,147
And you're gonna end up
working in the mines.

52
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,027
Baaa...

53
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, you're lovely.

54
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,286
Yes, you are.

55
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,356
Kiaya!

56
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,748
Oh, Willow!

57
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,364
Good girl. Good girl.

58
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,862
Absolutely under no
condition whatsoever...

59
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,590
is anyone in this family
to fall in love with that baby.

60
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,386
Yes, you are. Come on, Mims.
Come on. Come on.

61
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,212
There we are. Come on.

62
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,926
Hey, I will not be ignored!

63
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,134
Mims? Ranon?

64
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,116
You're gonna be all clean.

65
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:04,084
Willow, do you think we should
take her to the village council?

66
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,516
No. No. They'll think it's a bad omen.

67
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,715
There'll be a flood or a drought,
and everyone will blame me for it.

68
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,226
"Willow Ufgood brought around
that Daikini, didn't he?"

69
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:15,721
"That's right. And he's that
lousy farmer too. Let's get him!"

70
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,892
- Willow, calm down.
- Calm down?

71
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,019
Kiaya, tomorrow's my big day.

72
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,814
Love, the High Aldwin hasn't
picked a new apprentice in years.

73
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,151
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
I just know he's gonna pick me.

74
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:35,329
- Here. Hold her.
- Hey, no. I don't want her, Kiaya.

75
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,163
- Hold her while I get some milk.
- No, no.

76
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,505
Dada, she likes you.

77
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,473
Bye.

78
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,853
Come on, kids. Let's go.

79
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,488
I will now magically join the rings!

80
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,228
Thank you, son.

81
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:51,275
If you're easily shocked,
please turn away.

82
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,751
Give me a ripe one. Good.

83
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:19,265
And now, for my final amazing feat,

84
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:24,175
I will make this entire pig disappear!

85
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:37,571
- Mims, see?
- Please, watch very closely.

86
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:43,285
Wuppity bairn, deru, deru!

87
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,783
- Well...
- What happened to your pig?

88
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,670
No! Hey, come here, you!

89
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,512
I seen enough.

90
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,905
Attention! The High Aldwin...

91
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,950
will now make his choice for his new apprentice!
You'll be all right.

92
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,495
Bring forth the hopefuls.

93
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,956
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Dada.

94
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,793
Willow Ufgood, a hopeful?
How did he get picked?

95
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,963
- Is this a joke?
- Willow?

96
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:47,808
Magic is the bloodstream of the universe!

97
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,438
Forget all you know... or think you know.

98
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:56,751
All that you require is your intuition.

99
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,060
Now, the power to control the world...

100
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,381
is in which finger?

101
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,830
No apprentice this year!

102
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,604
- Where's Mims?
- I don't know. She was right here!

103
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,721
Take Ranon in there, quick!

104
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,450
Mims!

105
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,162
Mims!

106
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,968
- Mims!
- Dada...

107
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,305
I'm scared, Dada!

108
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,235
Come on!

109
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,880
Vohnkar!

110
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,310
Check to make sure it's not still alive.
It's dead!

111
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:40,620
Dada! Dada!

112
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,028
It was looking for somebody's baby!

113
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:52,826
- Mommy.
- Kiaya!

114
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,587
Kiaya! Kiaya!

115
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,673
I'm here.

116
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:14,389
Oh, Kiaya.

117
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,642
We can't keep the baby, Kiaya.

118
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,561
We have to take her
to the village council.

119
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,996
Silence! One beast we can kill,
but there may be more.

120
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,499
And you can be assured
that they won't give up...

121
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,459
until they find what they're looking for!

122
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,837
- It's a sign!
- Who's to blame for this?

123
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,382
We must find the culprit
and throw him in the pit!

124
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:52,083
In the pit! In the pit!

125
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:54,512
In the pit! In the pit!

126
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,794
In the pit! In the pit!

127
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,193
- In the pit! In the pit!
- Willow.

128
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,605
Willow Ufgood.

129
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,149
Come forward.

130
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,077
My children found this baby
alone by the river, High Aldwin.

131
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,723
A Daikini child.

132
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:27,729
That's what the beasts want.
Let's give it back to them!

133
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,127
Yeah!

134
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:33,114
- They'll kill her! You can't!
- It isn't one of us.

135
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,805
This child is special!

136
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,850
This child must be taken beyond
the boundaries of our village.

137
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,978
All the way across the great river...

138
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,147
to the Daikini crossroads.

139
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,943
- Well, who'll do that?
- It seems only fair...

140
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,238
that the man to take
this baby to the crossroads...

141
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:56,691
be the very man who
plucked it out of the river.

142
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,579
I nominate Willow Ufgood.

143
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,920
No!

144
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:06,519
I will consult the bones!

145
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:19,723
The bones tell me... nothing.

146
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:25,553
Do you have any love for this child?

147
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:38,158
Yes. Yes, I do.

148
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:42,662
The bones have spoken!

149
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,708
Willow Ufgood, the safety
of this village depends upon you.

150
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,879
- Praise the bones!
- Praise the bones!

151
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,465
But you will need help.

152
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,845
Who has the courage to protect
our brave fellow on his journey?

153
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:05,018
- I'll go with him.
- Meegosh.

154
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,322
- Excellent choice.
- I'll go!

155
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,485
Vohnkar! Vohnkar!

156
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,212
No! Not Vohnkar!
He's the best warrior in the village!

157
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,380
We need him here! Vohnkar, step back!

158
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,582
All this expedition needs is a leader.

159
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:31,044
And according to the bones,

160
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:34,089
that leader is...

161
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,008
you, Burglekutt!

162
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,719
Vohnkar!

163
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,766
- What's your problem, son?
- How do you mean?

164
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:50,146
When I held up my fingers,
what was your first impulse?

165
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:54,067
- Well, it was stupid.
- Just tell me.

166
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,655
- To pick my own finger.
- That was the correct answer.

167
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,451
You lack faith in yourself.
More than anyone in the village,

168
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,162
you have the potential
to be a great sorcerer.

169
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:11,001
Now, when you're out there,
listen to your own heart.

170
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,380
These will protect you.

171
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,049
- Acorns?
- They're magic!

172
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,478
Anything you throw them at
turns to stone.

173
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,435
You have much to learn, young Ufgood.

174
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,827
- Are you scared, Dada?
- No!

175
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,646
Even with fairies in the woods...

176
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,123
that'll put you to sleep
for a hundred years?

177
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,252
- Doesn't bother me.
- Brownies?

178
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,255
- Dragons?
- Trolls?

179
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,800
Trolls that'll skin you alive
and take your face off?

180
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,471
Ranon! You know I hate trolls.

181
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,314
I can be your guard and carry your spear.

182
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:09,392
Me too. Me too, Dada.

183
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:16,191
What a lucky father I am.
I wish I could take you bobbins with me.

184
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,905
Good-bye, Dada.

185
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:26,557
Go play! Go on.

186
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,339
We've never been apart.

187
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,756
I miss you already.

188
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,636
Don't worry, Kiaya. I'll be fine.

189
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,554
I'll be back before you know it.

190
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,317
Well, remember to keep her warm.

191
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,272
And... here.

192
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,277
This will bring you luck.

193
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,251
Good brave people!

194
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,698
The outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.

195
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,091
Give the baby
to the first Daikini you see,

196
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,344
then hurry home.

197
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,268
Tuatha... lokwathrak... tuatha!

198
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:36,896
Go in the direction the bird is flying!

199
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:43,778
It's going back to the village!

200
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,615
Ignore the bird. Follow the river.

201
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,342
Move out!

202
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,395
- Hold on, Meegosh.
- What's wrong?

203
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,441
- We have to stop.
- Stop? Why?

204
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,943
The baby's sick.

205
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,117
She's not sick! Let me see.

206
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:36,567
Take her! Take her!

207
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,503
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

208
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,318
Clean me up.

209
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:52,388
I didn't ask you
to bring me a dead nursemaid.

210
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:56,045
Sorsha, you're useless!
I'm backtracking the nursemaid's trail.

211
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,263
I'll find where she hid the baby.

212
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,899
Ah, General Kael, at last.

213
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:07,695
My queen, I have destroyed
the castle at Galladoorn.

214
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,449
Well done. But now I have
another task for you.

215
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:16,996
Help my daughter to find
that tiny, helpless baby...

216
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,040
that continues somehow to elude her.

217
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,961
The baby of the prophecy?

218
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,464
- The one that would destroy you?
- I need that baby alive.

219
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,470
I must perform the ritual that will exile
the child's spirit into oblivion.

220
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,223
- Find her!
- I don't need his help, Mother.

221
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,350
You'll do as I say, child.

222
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,693
I read the signs.

223
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,939
One day, I fear,
your daughter will betray you.

224
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:53,491
I trust her loyalty
more than I trust yours.

225
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:12,110
Move!

226
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,238
Into the bush. Come on. Move!

227
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,193
Come on!

228
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:34,220
The Nelwyns have got the baby.
We've searched the village.

229
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,400
But a group of them
are on the road somewhere.

230
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,229
They couldn't have gone far!

231
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:41,985
Widen the search and report to Sorsha!

232
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,424
Come. We'll keep to the woods.

233
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,385
That's it! It's the crossroads!

234
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,266
Keep this fire high.
We don't know what's out there.

235
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,126
What was that?

236
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,874
Get the spears!

237
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,214
Give me some water, peck, or you die.

238
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,732
Do you understand?

239
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,896
- Water.
- Yeah.

240
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:37,780
Hurry up!

241
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:45,199
Get me some water,
you measly little pecks.

242
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:48,603
It's a Daikini. We're in luck.

243
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,793
We can't give her to him!

244
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,839
- Somebody put him there for a reason.
- We've got to get rid of her.

245
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,508
Those soldiers are after us.

246
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,428
He's looking right at us.

247
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,522
We've got to give that baby to somebody.

248
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:09,269
I'm somebody.

249
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:13,648
- Let me out of here.
- I'll take care of the baby.

250
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:20,156
I trust him completely.
But he tried to strangle me.

251
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:23,889
- I want to go home!
- No, Burglekutt!

252
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:27,580
- We should wait!
- Are you challenging my authority?

253
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,000
As far as this baby is concerned, yes.

254
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:34,448
Don't listen to him, Burglekutt.

255
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,300
Fine. You stay here alone,
but we're going.

256
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,524
That's a bad idea. Very bad.

257
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:45,056
- Dangerous out there.
- Get the gear, men.

258
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,077
- Vohnkar...
- It's not his decision!

259
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:52,730
Burglekutt, you're troll dung.

260
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,482
Don't let him talk to you
that way, Burglekutt.

261
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,651
Listen here, runt.

262
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,696
While you're wasting time here,
your fields aren't getting planted.

263
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:05,076
- Think about it!
- Burglekutt, I'm gonna...

264
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,538
You're gonna what?

265
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,002
Someday, Burglekutt. Someday.

266
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,046
Vohnkar, let's go!

267
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,261
Meegosh, are you coming?

268
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,350
- I'm staying.
- Come on, men.

269
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,970
Burglekutt, let me out of here.
I'll take care of the baby. I swear.

270
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:36,357
Just let me out of here. Please!

271
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,944
Vohnkar, let me borrow that spear...
just for a minute.

272
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,280
Well, at least get me some water!

273
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:47,243
Burglekutt, don't leave me alone
with these two!

274
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,123
What'll we do now, Willow?

275
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,834
Well, that was really stupid, peck.

276
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,477
- Don't call me a peck.
- Oh, I'm sorry... peck.

277
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:03,379
- Peck, peck, peck, peck.
- You be careful!

278
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:07,346
I'm a powerful sorcerer. See this acorn?

279
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,149
I'll throw it and turn you to stone.

280
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:15,354
I'm really scared.

281
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,954
No, don't! Don't!

282
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,152
There's a peck here
with an acorn pointed at me!

283
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:23,905
Oh, I wouldn't want to waste it.

284
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:27,241
Peck! Peck, peck, peck, peck,

285
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,869
peck, peck, peck, peck, peck!

286
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,317
What was that?

287
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:08,449
Mornin', boys.

288
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,670
Rough night last night, wasn't it?

289
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:16,082
I don't think I introduced
myself yesterday.

290
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,627
My name is Madmartigan,
and you are...

291
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,713
No, Meegosh. Don't go near him.

292
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,133
- He's dangerous.
- I am not.

293
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:28,650
Good.

294
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,434
Stop! Wait!

295
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,948
- What's going on?
- Smells like a battle.

296
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:52,535
I suppose you're a warrior.

297
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:55,316
I am the greatest swordsman
that ever lived.

298
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:01,794
Say...
Could I have some of that water?

299
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:16,309
I don't know why I try.

300
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,358
I guess I am gonna die here.
Who cares?

301
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,319
- Here.
- Thanks, friend.

302
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,607
What's that?

303
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,867
I'd say two or three hundred horses,

304
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,912
five or six wagons
and about a thousand fools.

305
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:43,419
- Thank you.
- Come on, Meegosh.

306
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,510
It's gonna be all right, little bobbin.

307
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,816
Everything's gonna be all right.

308
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:08,055
- Excuse me, sir.
- Out of the way, peck!

309
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:11,936
Pardon me.

310
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:25,169
Excuse me, sir. We found one
of your babies in our village.

311
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,130
Will you please take care of her?

312
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:32,592
We're going into battle, little ones.
Find a woman to take care of her.

313
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:37,072
They thought you were a woman, Airk.

314
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,527
Well...

315
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,122
Madmartigan! What did you do this time?

316
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,355
Nothing you wouldn't
have done in my place.

317
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,774
I always knew
you'd end up in a crow's cage.

318
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,693
At least I'm not down there
herding sheep.

319
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,277
What are you doing this far north?

320
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,364
The Nockmaar army
destroyed Galladoorn.

321
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,074
The castle?

322
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,201
Bavmorda's troops are
crushing everything in sight.

323
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,203
Come on. Let me out of here, Airk.

324
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,497
Give me a sword.
I'll win this war for you.

325
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:06,001
Madmartigan. I still serve Galladoorn.

326
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,045
You serve no one.

327
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,381
Remember?

328
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,676
Sit in your coffin and rot.

329
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:16,804
Wait, Airk. You need me!

330
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,306
I'll be around long after you're dead!

331
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,017
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna cut your head off...

332
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,186
and stick it on a pig pole!

333
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:46,459
I miss Kiaya and the bobbins.

334
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,882
We're running out of food.

335
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,928
Nobody's gonna take care of that baby.

336
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,890
You know why? Nobody cares.

337
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,978
Except me.

338
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,692
You want to go back to your families.
I want out of this cage.

339
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,738
Let me take care of that baby.
I'll look after her like she was my own.

340
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,783
I believe he would, Willow.

341
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,410
He doesn't know anything about babies.

342
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,707
Right. But I know a lot of women who do.

343
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:30,436
If I had somebody in my life,

344
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:33,713
a little daughter, perhaps,

345
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:37,037
I might have a reason to go on living.

346
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:43,119
You can't leave me in here to die.

347
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,377
Not when all I want to do is protect her.

348
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,858
I feel better!

349
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:06,577
You've done the right thing!
Okay. All right. All right.

350
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:11,502
- You gotta promise to feed her.
- Come to Daddy, little darlin'.

351
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:14,941
- And keep her clean.
- Absolutely.

352
00:36:25,072 --> 00:36:27,240
She likes me.

353
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:31,438
Here are her changing rags.

354
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,732
- And her milk bladder.
- Any milk in there?

355
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,987
- It's for her!
- I wouldn't steal from a baby.

356
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:43,367
You worry too much, peck.

357
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,579
- It's Willow.
- I mean Willow.

358
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:53,210
Now listen, boys... Willow.
You've done the right thing.

359
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,589
Now I want you to get home
and bring your crop in.

360
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,055
Good-bye, little one.

361
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,319
Please take good care of her.

362
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,948
I give you my word of honour!

363
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,373
- Meegosh, slow down!
- Oh, come on!

364
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:37,653
If we hurry, we can be home by
tomorrow morning. We'll be heroes.

365
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,339
- Do you really think so?
- Sure.

366
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,630
"Look, there's Willow and Meegosh.

367
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:45,904
"The heroes have come home."

368
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:49,266
"Welcome back, boys.
You deserve medals!"

369
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,604
Yeah. Medals.

370
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,941
Meegosh...

371
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,273
- Did we do the right thing?
- Absolutely.

372
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:07,505
There's nothing to worry about.

373
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:18,379
I stole a baby! I stole a baby!

374
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:22,438
That's my baby!

375
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,149
Stop! Wait! Come back!

376
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:27,288
Left, you stupid bird. Left!

377
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,356
Brownies! Let's get out of here!

378
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:41,036
Come on, Meegosh!

379
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,784
We'll outrun 'em!

380
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,917
Hey, ugly, wake up!

381
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:05,600
Stand your ground. He's our prisoner.

382
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,420
Meegosh, where's the baby?

383
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:10,180
<i>Bring the Nelwyns to me.</i>

384
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,682
All right, you heard her!

385
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,519
- What's going on?
- Shut up, or I'll break your nose.

386
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,022
You are mine to toy with.

387
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:21,567
Forward!

388
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:25,446
Gimme the rope.

389
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,533
Where... Where...

390
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,869
did you get that baby?

391
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,665
I stole it from a stupid Daikini.

392
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:40,667
<i>Franjean, release the Nelwyns.</i>

393
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,381
<i>And stop pestering them.</i>

394
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,804
Yaah!

395
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,648
<i>Welcome to my kingdom.</i>

396
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,078
- I'm so happy to meet you, Willow Ufgood.
- How do you know my name?

397
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,216
Elora Danan told me.

398
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:20,709
Elora? Elora, Willow is here.

399
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:29,134
- But she's just a baby.
- She's very special.

400
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,556
My Brownies have been searching for her
ever since we heard she was born.

401
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:39,420
Elora Danan has chosen you
to be her guardian.

402
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:44,691
- Me?
- Yes. She likes you.

403
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,781
And Elora Danan knows
you have the courage to help us.

404
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:54,240
Take my wand to the sorceress
Fin Raziel.

405
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:58,577
She will guide you and Elora Danan
to the kingdom of Tir Asleen...

406
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,959
where a good king and queen
will look after her.

407
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,754
You need a warrior for a job like this.
I'm a nobody.

408
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,216
Elora, you don't want me.

409
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,011
Tell her. I'm short, even for a Nelwyn.

410
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,309
Hello?

411
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,068
Elora Danan must survive!

412
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:34,041
She must fulfil her destiny and bring
about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda,

413
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,161
whose powers are growing
like an evil plague.

414
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,522
Unless she is stopped,
Bavmorda will control the lives...

415
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:46,097
of your village, your children, everyone.

416
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,678
All creatures of good heart
need your help, Willow.

417
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,307
The choice is yours.

418
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,543
Hey, Meegosh. Wake up.

419
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,839
- It's time to go home.
- Home?

420
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:38,138
Listen, Meegosh. Tell Kiaya I love her.

421
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:41,600
- And I think of her every day.
- Willow...

422
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,145
And tell her I'm not going to let
anything happen to the baby.

423
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,856
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

424
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,236
I hope so.

425
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,488
Listen, be careful.

426
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:04,998
- I know the way, Franjean.
- You always think you know the way.

427
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,638
I am the leader!

428
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:09,586
- How long will it take to find this Raziel?
- Not long.

429
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,257
She's been exiled to an island
just over those hills.

430
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,182
- She's what?
- Exiled...

431
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:20,104
by the evil Queen Bavmorda.

432
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:22,901
Rool, you fool. He does not need
to know everything.

433
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,222
I didn't tell him everything.

434
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:25,921
- You told him enough.
- What did I say?

435
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:28,105
- You mentioned the island, you mentioned the queen.
- Wait a minute.

436
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:30,335
So?

437
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,569
What do you mean?
What are you saying, mysterious island?

438
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,249
Don't play with that wand.

439
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:38,844
Cherlindrea told you it holds vast powers.

440
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,391
Only a great sorcerer can use it,

441
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,413
not a stupid peck like you.

442
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,624
- This way.
- No. No. No. I don't think so.

443
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,002
- All right, then this way.
- Nope.

444
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,440
- This way.
- This way?

445
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:56,229
- That's what I said.
- This way.

446
00:43:56,714 --> 00:43:59,784
- Are you sure you know where you're going?
- Of course.

447
00:43:59,827 --> 00:44:02,496
With us as your guides,
no harm will befall you.

448
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,279
Take it up!

449
00:44:19,471 --> 00:44:23,076
We are not going in there!
But Elora needs fresh milk.

450
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,584
And we are drenched.

451
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,023
You are not in command
here, shorty. I am!

452
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:31,710
You hear me?

453
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,917
Excuse me? Excuse me.

454
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:14,961
Could you spare some milk
for this poor hungry baby?

455
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:19,341
- Get out of here, peck!
- Get outta here or we'll cook ya!

456
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,608
Look at her!

457
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,385
I could use a love potion on her!

458
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:42,705
Franjean! Hey!
Give me that dust of broken heart.

459
00:45:42,768 --> 00:45:44,658
Come on! Give it to me!

460
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:48,078
It's very dangerous.
It belongs to the fairies!

461
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,334
Hey, quiet! You want to get us killed?

462
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,970
Oh, Rool! Always playing
with those fairy love potions.

463
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:12,394
You are so beautiful!

464
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,106
Your eyes! Your whiskers!

465
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,043
- I have to kiss you!
- Rool!

466
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:20,865
That dust of broken heart!

467
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,752
Beer!

468
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,008
These people are crazy!
This could be bad!

469
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,598
Hurry! Hurry!

470
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,277
My husband's coming!

471
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,392
If he catches you here,
he'll kill us both!

472
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:56,654
- How do I look?
- Not you!

473
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,483
Where the hell did you come from?

474
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,818
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

475
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:05,614
- Don't I know you?
- I stole the baby from you, Daikini,

476
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,949
while you were taking a pee-pee!
Cover your face!

477
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,703
- You are crawling with Brownies.
- I hate Brownies!

478
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,209
- Where is he? Where?
- Hello, dear.

479
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:19,420
There's nobody here
but me and my...

480
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:22,522
- I'll kill him!
- ...my cousin, Hilda.

481
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,466
- Hilda?
- Hilda.

482
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:26,676
- Hilda!
- This is my husband, Llug.

483
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,912
- Big husband.
- Yes.

484
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:30,785
How do you do?

485
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,654
Hilda!

486
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,739
Come on, girly. Don't be shy.

487
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:38,772
Hey! Give her back!

488
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,274
- Pecks make such terrible nursemaids.
- Nursemaid?

489
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,236
They get too excited.

490
00:47:44,484 --> 00:47:46,947
Excuse me! Are we having a party?

491
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:50,179
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

492
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,787
Stop, please.

493
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,705
Come on. Fight like a man!

494
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,469
Want to breed?

495
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:02,747
Tempting, but no.

496
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:07,222
Thank you. Time to leave.

497
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,759
- Bye, Hilda!
- Take them out.

498
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,222
Hey! Come along!

499
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:14,683
- Careful, you lout!
- Move along!

500
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,218
Gather up all these babies.

501
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,532
That baby over there.
Let me see its arm.

502
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,694
That's not the one.

503
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,117
You! Are you the mother of that child?

504
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,828
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Let me see it.

505
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,496
No! Don't let her!

506
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:41,069
I gave you an order, woman!

507
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,763
You... You're... beautiful.

508
00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:57,459
- And you're very strong.
- Thank you.

509
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:02,584
You're no woman!

510
00:49:02,668 --> 00:49:05,004
- Now, honey, take it easy.
- Not a woman?

511
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:07,151
- Gentlemen.
- Not a woman?

512
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,030
Meet Llug.

513
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,366
- After them!
- Out of the way!

514
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,874
To the horses!

515
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:37,349
Madmartigan! Madmartigan! Wait!

516
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,563
He's not a woman!

517
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,068
Don't let them get away!

518
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:53,239
Madmartigan, stop!

519
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,987
Madmartigan, I'm warning you...

520
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:20,433
Prepare to die!

521
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,581
Madmartigan! Stop!

522
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,353
No... more... beer!

523
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:18,324
Franjean, help me!

524
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,577
- Rool!
- Help!

525
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:27,774
Rool! Rool.

526
00:51:29,475 --> 00:51:32,964
- Rool! What are you doing?
- Help me!

527
00:51:38,608 --> 00:51:39,702
- Come on.
- Pull me in.

528
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,053
- I am.
- Yeah, pull!

529
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,221
Rool, this isn't funny!
Help me cut the rope!

530
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,153
Whoa!

531
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,261
Willow, stay down!

532
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:06,798
Whoa!

533
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,312
Have you gone crazy?

534
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,523
You can't chase around
with Elora like this.

535
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,025
We're getting off!

536
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,517
Whoa! Whoa!

537
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,559
Oh, Rool.

538
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:52,312
Now we stop, peck.

539
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:58,693
Stupid Daikini.
Ask him to stop the wagon.

540
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,989
Madmartigan! You never, ever
drive that fast with an infant!

541
00:54:05,165 --> 00:54:06,993
I just saved that infant's life!

542
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,749
Gather your wits. Come on.

543
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,877
- Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
- Come on!

544
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:19,130
Get down!

545
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:21,633
Where am I?

546
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,595
Rool, you fool, get out of the road!

547
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,656
- Franjean!
- You better clear out, Willow.

548
00:54:45,168 --> 00:54:46,341
Before those troops come back.

549
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:49,744
- My head!
- We don't need him, Elora.

550
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,213
Madmartigan, wait!

551
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,633
Go home, Willow! It's a dangerous world.

552
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,677
Yeah, and that's why
we need your help.

553
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,972
My help?
What do you need my help for?

554
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,182
You're a sorcerer!

555
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,519
You're a great warrior
and a swordsman.

556
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:18,040
And you're ten times
bigger than I am, stupid!

557
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,571
Are you trying to make my life
more difficult than it already is?

558
00:55:26,597 --> 00:55:28,992
Hurry! Big dogs!

559
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:33,329
Look. I'm sorry I got angry.

560
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:35,373
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

561
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,390
Well, don't expect me to help you again.

562
00:55:54,038 --> 00:55:57,665
Good! Then we go that way!
To the lake!

563
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:01,691
That way.

564
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:05,603
You are drunk, and when
you are drunk, you forget that...

565
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:07,363
- I am in charge!
- You are in charge.

566
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:09,656
Fine. Then which way do we go?

567
00:56:11,054 --> 00:56:12,726
That way!

568
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:19,333
Oh, no! That's the way I'm going.

569
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:22,378
All right, all right.
You can follow me as far as the lake.

570
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,630
But that's it!

571
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,509
- You're not going south, are you?
- No no, just as far as the lake.

572
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:33,723
Good. Mumbo. Jumbo. I am hungry.
Go get me some eggs or something.

573
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,434
- We are not afraid of you!
- Now!

574
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,820
Kael, have you found the child?

575
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,655
The search goes on, my queen.

576
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,742
Why, with my powers,

577
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,613
with the strength of my great army,

578
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,476
can you not find one little child?

579
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,261
We look even now. It won't be long.

580
00:57:02,347 --> 00:57:05,379
Find the child. Find the child!

581
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,048
Time is running out.

582
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,392
- Good night.
- She is kinda cute.

583
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,854
When she's quiet.

584
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:25,714
She's really a princess.

585
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:29,761
Really? And you're a great sorcerer.

586
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:31,733
And I'm the king of Kashmir.

587
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:35,159
Go to sleep, Willow.

588
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,745
Good night, Madmartigan.

589
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,822
Rats! Big rats! Rats!

590
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:44,168
Rats?! Ra...

591
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:49,173
Oh, Rool, you and that
stupid rat dream! Ha!

592
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,685
Tuatha...

593
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,895
Lawkathok...

594
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,939
Tuatha!

595
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,733
Willow?

596
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:10,945
Willow?

597
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,158
Oh. There you are.

598
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,201
Madmartigan!

599
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,621
Night, Willow.

600
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,760
This way! This way!

601
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,399
What are you doing?

602
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,860
I found some black root.
She loves it!

603
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,863
Black root?
I am the father of two children,

604
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,990
and you never, ever
give a baby black root.

605
00:58:56,378 --> 00:58:59,202
Well, my mother raised us on black root.

606
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:01,828
It's good for ya!
It puts hair on your chest.

607
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,624
- Doesn't it, Sticks?
- Her name is not Sticks.

608
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,627
She's Elora Danan,
the future empress of Tir Asleen.

609
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,046
And the last thing she's gonna want
is a hairy chest!

610
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,219
Did you see what he did?

611
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,597
He stole our black root.
I'll get some more. Don't worry about it.

612
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,813
There it is! The island!

613
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:32,685
We made it.

614
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,530
We have led you to the island
of the sorceress Fin Raziel.

615
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:41,123
- We'll get a boat in that village.
- A big boat.

616
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,972
Well, looks like I got you here.

617
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,432
You! What did you do?

618
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,602
All you did was hang around
and eat our eggs!

619
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:09,075
I found a boat. We're all set.

620
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,608
Good. Take these two lizards
out and drown them.

621
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:15,987
Lizards!
Who are you calling lizards?

622
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,783
Your mother was a lizard!

623
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,372
Good-bye, Sticks.

624
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:33,296
If you really are a princess,
take care of him.

625
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:44,598
- Madmartigan!
- What?

626
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:46,815
Thanks.

627
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,612
Hey!

628
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:01,991
- Keep walkin', hero!
- Don't even turn around!

629
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,203
It's all right, Elora.

630
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,430
Go to sleep.

631
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:12,502
Nobody'll find you here.
I'll be back with Fin Raziel very soon.

632
01:01:13,065 --> 01:01:16,400
We will guard her with our meagre lives.

633
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,286
Raziel!

634
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:51,207
Fin Raziel! I have to talk to you, please!

635
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,713
Raziel!

636
01:02:03,075 --> 01:02:06,222
She's not here.

637
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:14,772
Get back! Who are you?

638
01:02:16,414 --> 01:02:18,818
Who are you?

639
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,281
- I'm Willow Ufgood.
- What are you doing here?

640
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:28,035
I've come to find
the great sorceress, Fin Raziel.

641
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,704
That's me! I'm Raziel!

642
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,667
This can't be right!

643
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:38,498
One of Bavmorda's spells
transformed me.

644
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,134
Believe me, it could have been worse!

645
01:02:44,616 --> 01:02:49,014
Well, this wand is for you.
It's from Cherlindrea.

646
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:53,602
Then the prophecy is true.
The princess has been born.

647
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:55,817
Take me to her.

648
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,943
It is Elora Danan.

649
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,946
Isn't she beautiful?

650
01:03:04,003 --> 01:03:06,991
Isn't she beautiful?

651
01:03:07,285 --> 01:03:10,489
- That's Raziel?
- I don't know. I...

652
01:03:10,535 --> 01:03:13,129
I expected something more grand.
Less...

653
01:03:13,176 --> 01:03:14,915
- Fuzzy.
- Fuzzy!

654
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,794
You must use the wand.
Turn me back into my human form.

655
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:22,214
- What do I do?
- You mean you're not a sorcerer?

656
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,926
Yes. Sorta.

657
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,596
I'm a farmer.

658
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,556
But I do know a few tricks.

659
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,895
Tricks? Cherlindrea sent you?
You must learn real magic.

660
01:03:37,893 --> 01:03:40,149
- Horses!
- Horses!

661
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,735
Quick! Take her! Hurry! Hurry!

662
01:03:52,101 --> 01:03:54,580
I knew he was a traitor!

663
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,752
- Sorry about this, peck.
- Keep your mouth shut!

664
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,672
Told you we'd find him without your help.

665
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,716
- Give me that baby.
- No!

666
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,140
- Give her back!
- Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

667
01:04:19,368 --> 01:04:20,940
This is the one we're looking for.

668
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,443
We must take it back to Nockmaar.

669
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:29,368
Lose your skirt?

670
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:38,707
I've still got what counts.

671
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:41,126
Not for long.

672
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,511
- Bring him.
- Over here!

673
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:11,160
We'll never keep up with those horses.

674
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:14,762
- Then we will have to track them.
- That would take forever.

675
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:17,573
Besides, even if we find them,
they'll catch us,

676
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:20,499
stick us in cages, torture us
and finally devour us.

677
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,501
Are you suggesting we go home?

678
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:25,472
- Nah. This is more fun!
- All right.

679
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,548
Fine, then. Come on!

680
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,773
I'm worried about Elora.
She doesn't sound good.

681
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,610
Hurry! Practice the chant I taught you!

682
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:53,490
Tanna... looatha...
Oh, I can't remember the middle part.

683
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,618
Locktwaar!

684
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,704
That's the word that pleads for change.

685
01:05:59,311 --> 01:06:01,187
Locktwaar.

686
01:06:04,611 --> 01:06:07,738
Elora's cold and hungry. She knows me.

687
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:09,548
Please, let me take care of her.

688
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,759
I don't need help from a peck.

689
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,516
- What are you staring at?
- Your leg.

690
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,614
I'd like to break it.

691
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:24,688
You may find that difficult, slave,

692
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,940
while I'm up here and you're down there.

693
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,279
I hate that woman.

694
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,612
I found it, Kael.

695
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:17,783
That should make my mother happy.

696
01:07:18,429 --> 01:07:20,869
What are they gonna do to her?

697
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,093
Hither walha...

698
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:39,680
bairn deru bordak...

699
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,724
bellanockt.

700
01:07:42,815 --> 01:07:44,601
That's magic? Smells terrible.

701
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,938
- It's the life spark. It forms after...
- Well, it stinks!

702
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,233
- This whole thing stinks!
- Ignore him, Willow.

703
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:54,236
- He's a fool!
- If only I had a sword!

704
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,489
If only you'd quit talking about it.

705
01:07:57,768 --> 01:08:00,908
Willow, you must transform me
to my human self.

706
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:03,829
But, Raziel, I'm not ready yet.

707
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,124
You'd better be. Get me down.

708
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,839
Why don't you help me get out of here
instead of chattering with that muskrat?

709
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,337
Muskrat! When I change back...

710
01:08:21,376 --> 01:08:24,970
to my former self, I
will crush this army...

711
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:28,395
and take Elora Danan to Tir Asleen...

712
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,064
where she will be safe.

713
01:08:33,744 --> 01:08:35,486
What'd you bite me for?

714
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,864
You need three drops
of your blood to put in the potion.

715
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:42,233
Well, you could've warned me.

716
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,745
For beginners, there's some pain,

717
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:49,917
but don't let anything
break your concentration.

718
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,883
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

719
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,762
- Hello, everybody! We have arrived!
- You are saved.

720
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,681
Shh! Don't interrupt.

721
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,269
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

722
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:12,189
What are you gonna look like
if this works?

723
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,733
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

724
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,777
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

725
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,155
I am a young, beautiful woman.

726
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,032
Concentrate, Willow.

727
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:24,655
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

728
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,616
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

729
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,914
No! You're losing me!

730
01:09:30,108 --> 01:09:32,459
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

731
01:09:35,913 --> 01:09:37,827
Hither greenan bairn claideb...

732
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,885
You all right? Nice try, Willow.

733
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:52,697
Farmers! Cherlindrea sends me farmers!

734
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,024
The Nelwyn really butchered that one.

735
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,943
I'm sorry, Raziel.

736
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:02,364
- You want out?
- Easy. We can pick a lock. Come on.

737
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,366
No. No, no. Like this!

738
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,912
I know what I'm doing.
It's my spear. Leave it alone.

739
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,372
Let me do it. Out of the way, rodents.

740
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,250
Take your hand off that.

741
01:10:13,678 --> 01:10:17,754
You leave that alone,
you stupid, fat Daikini!

742
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,161
Dust of broken hearts.

743
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,030
There. You are free!

744
01:10:36,085 --> 01:10:39,526
Come on, Madmartigan.
Let's get Elora Danan out of here.

745
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:43,822
- Yeah. It'll be fun.
- Come on!

746
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,504
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

747
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,673
I feel... good.

748
01:11:01,853 --> 01:11:05,344
The dust of broken hearts.

749
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,971
Hey, come on!

750
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:15,506
- Let me see!
- Let me see.

751
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,701
You always see.

752
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:19,222
There's Elora, right there, on those furs.

753
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,612
Hey, wait! Leave this to us.

754
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,448
- It's too dangerous for you.
- Only one of us should go in there.

755
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,368
I've had experience in this sort of thing.
I know what I'm doing.

756
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:03,568
Wait. No! No!

757
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,873
- I love you.
- Madmartigan!

758
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,830
- What are you doing?
- Take the baby and go! Come on!

759
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:21,789
Come on!

760
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,224
Sorsha.

761
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,979
Wake from this hateful sleep.

762
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,440
It deprives me of your beauty.

763
01:12:42,515 --> 01:12:46,280
- The beauty of your eyes...
- One move, jackass,

764
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,077
and you really will be a woman.

765
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:53,243
You are my sun! My moon!

766
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,748
My starlit sky.
Without you, I dwell in darkness.

767
01:12:58,561 --> 01:13:01,960
I love you.
What are you doing here?

768
01:13:02,366 --> 01:13:05,380
Your power has enchanted me.
I stand helpless against it.

769
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,382
Come to me, now.

770
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,885
Tonight, let me worship you
in my arms.

771
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,721
- Get away from me!
- I love you!

772
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,265
Stop saying that!

773
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:19,561
How can I stop the beating of my heart?
It pounds like never before.

774
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,272
- Out of fear.
- Out of love!

775
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,858
I can stop it. I'll kill you.

776
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,861
Death, next to love, is a trivial thing.

777
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,158
Your touch is worth 100,000 deaths.

778
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,707
What goes on here?

779
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:46,713
Deceiver!

780
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,175
Stop him!

781
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:01,728
Captain, get up!

782
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:16,785
You are great.

783
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:19,746
Get on that shield!

784
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,718
Sorsha!

785
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,390
After them!

786
01:14:46,668 --> 01:14:47,801
Hey!

787
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,239
They're getting away!

788
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,574
- Follow me, Rool.
- Where are you?

789
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:06,121
I don't know.

790
01:15:07,785 --> 01:15:09,587
Oh no, where did everybody go?

791
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,631
Maybe it was something we said.

792
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:32,003
Madmartigan!

793
01:16:49,289 --> 01:16:53,024
- Madmartigan!
- What the hell happened up there?

794
01:16:53,672 --> 01:16:55,906
You started spouting poetry.

795
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,195
- Poetry?
- Yeah.

796
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,491
"I love you, Sorsha.
I worship you, Sorsha."

797
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,535
You almost got us killed!

798
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,495
"I love you, Sorsha"?

799
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,998
I don't love her.
She kicked me in the face.

800
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,501
I hate her! Don't I?

801
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,131
Kael! Kael!

802
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,148
Nockmaar soldiers!

803
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,347
Hide! Get the children! Come on!

804
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:29,217
- Get the children!
- They're after us! We need a place to hide.

805
01:17:29,272 --> 01:17:32,230
Come on. Follow me.
Quick! Come on! Move!

806
01:17:48,948 --> 01:17:51,700
I knew you'd get out of that rat trap.

807
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,004
You left me to die, Airk.

808
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,341
I probably saved your life.
We were slaughtered, and I lost a lot...

809
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,760
Shh! Quiet!

810
01:18:03,235 --> 01:18:04,804
Tear this village apart!

811
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:09,267
Look everywhere! Find the child!

812
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:47,799
Tell Sorsha I search the north bank!

813
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,778
Yes, General.

814
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,323
Quiet.

815
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,679
- Sorsha!
- Back.

816
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:29,864
Back!

817
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:37,215
Back.

818
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:43,027
- Keep the baby quiet.
- She needs to be changed.

819
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,863
- Nockmaar scum!
- You'll never defeat us.

820
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:47,153
- Give up the baby!
- Shut up!

821
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:50,815
What does Bavmorda want
with this baby, anyway?

822
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:52,245
She's a princess.

823
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,784
- We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
- Tir Asleen?

824
01:19:55,236 --> 01:19:57,166
Even if you could find it, peck,

825
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,627
she's right. You'd never
get past the Nockmaar army.

826
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,172
There's an even bigger army
at Tir Asleen.

827
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:04,757
If we can just get there...

828
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:11,343
I've lost more than half my men
fighting Bavmorda.

829
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,558
Now you and this peck
are gonna take her on?

830
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:16,895
You always told me you served
no one, Madmartigan.

831
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,938
Since when are you a crusader?

832
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,486
He's not gonna help you, peck.

833
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,571
He's a worthless thief.

834
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,408
I'm not a thief, Airk.

835
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,453
He's not a thief.

836
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:36,568
Are you?

837
01:20:50,577 --> 01:20:54,140
I serve the Nelwyn, Airk.

838
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,439
- You want to come with us?
- You'll never make it, Madmartigan.

839
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,318
Then once again we say goodbye.

840
01:21:19,553 --> 01:21:22,544
- Over here!
- Sorsha!

841
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:26,176
Weapons down or she's dead!

842
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,479
Get to your horses! After 'em!

843
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,153
This way! This way!

844
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,947
As the crow flies, you fools!

845
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,665
- You're holding me too tight!
- I don't want you to get away.

846
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:47,587
Why? Because I'm your sun,
your moon, your starlit sky?

847
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,424
Get your hair out of my face,
or I'll chop it off.

848
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:59,182
Did I really... Did I really
say those things last night?

849
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:02,393
- In your tent?
- You said you loved me.

850
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,979
- I don't remember that.
- You lied to me!

851
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,482
No, I...

852
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,984
I just wasn't myself last night.

853
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:14,364
I suppose my power enchanted you,
and you were helpless against it.

854
01:23:15,276 --> 01:23:17,408
- Sort of.
- Then what?

855
01:23:18,455 --> 01:23:20,252
It went away.

856
01:23:20,307 --> 01:23:23,331
"It went away?"
"I dwell in darkness without you,"

857
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,500
- and it went away?
- Yeah.

858
01:23:48,384 --> 01:23:50,376
Hurry! Kael's coming!

859
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,823
Madmartigan, come on! Now!

860
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:08,418
Madmartigan, come on!

861
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,295
They're coming! Away!

862
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,631
Go on!

863
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:33,776
Whoa!

864
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,028
This way!

865
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:45,371
Tir Asleen! At last, Tir Asleen!

866
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,176
Hello?

867
01:24:59,672 --> 01:25:00,803
Hello?

868
01:25:05,378 --> 01:25:06,917
Hello?

869
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,813
Why did I listen to you, peck?

870
01:25:11,499 --> 01:25:14,817
"Everything will be all right
once we get to Tir Asleen."

871
01:25:15,725 --> 01:25:17,006
The only army around here...

872
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,531
is the one that's about to ride
across this valley and wipe us out!

873
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:23,659
But Cherlindrea said we'd be safe here.

874
01:25:24,337 --> 01:25:27,121
Safe? Look at these people.

875
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:31,712
This place is cursed, peck.
It's falling apart. Open your eyes!

876
01:25:31,783 --> 01:25:33,181
And it...

877
01:25:35,906 --> 01:25:37,381
Trolls.

878
01:25:40,531 --> 01:25:42,094
I hate trolls.

879
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:45,598
This is the work of Bavmorda.

880
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:57,023
Willow? The wand.

881
01:25:57,147 --> 01:26:00,566
- Turn me back into my human form.
- Are you sure?

882
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,169
Yeah.

883
01:26:19,364 --> 01:26:21,133
Good.

884
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,851
Hurry, Willow. Transform me.

885
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,895
I can't do it. I'm just not a sorcerer.

886
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,690
But you can be. Speak...

887
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:39,011
and be one with the words.

888
01:26:39,066 --> 01:26:42,417
Avalorium, greenan...

889
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,533
luatha, tye...

890
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:49,579
Oh, Willow, you're losing me.

891
01:26:52,735 --> 01:26:54,946
Madmartigan, Kael's coming!

892
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:58,004
Willow, you idiot.

893
01:26:58,402 --> 01:26:59,669
Raziel?

894
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:03,211
Willow, arm that catapult up there.

895
01:27:24,726 --> 01:27:29,952
- Good work, Madmartigan.
- What the hell happened to you?

896
01:27:30,264 --> 01:27:32,890
Assault! Sorsha, battering ram!

897
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:39,968
Cut it down!

898
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:52,638
Faster!

899
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:11,202
Forward! Break it down!

900
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,391
Again! Again!

901
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,439
Willow, use the wand on that troll.

902
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:46,070
Bellalockt!

903
01:28:57,828 --> 01:28:59,709
Ewww!

904
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,761
Break it down! Forward!

905
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,392
Whoa!

906
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,352
Get him!

907
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,834
The other side!

908
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,889
Destroy the beast! Find the baby!

909
01:30:40,945 --> 01:30:43,614
Baaa! Take tha-a-a-at!

910
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,095
Willow!

911
01:32:20,205 --> 01:32:22,453
Madmartigan, help!

912
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,665
Willow!

913
01:32:34,324 --> 01:32:37,551
Get him, Madmartigan!

914
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:47,311
Here.

915
01:33:03,468 --> 01:33:05,162
The baby!

916
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,185
Airk's army. Get Kael!

917
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,688
Airk's army!

918
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:17,475
- We are here!
- You are rescued!

919
01:34:17,534 --> 01:34:20,494
- Charge!
- Charge!

920
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,673
No mercy!

921
01:34:53,095 --> 01:34:54,938
Elora!

922
01:34:56,228 --> 01:34:57,441
Willow!

923
01:35:03,773 --> 01:35:06,867
- Elora's gone.
- Willow.

924
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:10,204
They've taken her.
There were too many of them.

925
01:35:11,634 --> 01:35:12,706
Willow.

926
01:35:15,508 --> 01:35:17,419
Can you ride?

927
01:35:20,654 --> 01:35:22,007
Let's ride.

928
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,814
I have the child!

929
01:36:01,513 --> 01:36:03,848
We need towers and a battering ram!

930
01:36:03,887 --> 01:36:06,593
Break out the tents! Make camp!

931
01:36:06,873 --> 01:36:09,092
Make camp!

932
01:36:09,183 --> 01:36:11,017
We'll assault at first light.

933
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,013
Where's Sorsha?

934
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:29,732
She has turned against us,
Your Highness.

935
01:36:34,725 --> 01:36:37,608
Turned against me?

936
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,754
Prepare for the ritual!

937
01:37:06,703 --> 01:37:09,781
This is not an army.

938
01:37:10,985 --> 01:37:14,536
Willow, quick, hide.

939
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,419
Use the shelter chant. Protect yourself.

940
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,546
- Why?
- Just do it.

941
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:34,598
- We've come for Elora Danan.
- You dare to challenge me?

942
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:36,975
You're not warriors.

943
01:37:38,778 --> 01:37:40,184
You're pigs!

944
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:44,996
Locknath bat!

945
01:37:46,113 --> 01:37:48,195
Nocklith! Vohkbar!

946
01:37:56,116 --> 01:37:59,539
You're all pigs! Pigs!

947
01:37:59,827 --> 01:38:03,413
Pigs!

948
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:10,613
Avaggdu luatha bairn off haefermore.

949
01:38:19,056 --> 01:38:22,197
Sorsha!

950
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:25,148
Mother, no!

951
01:38:27,332 --> 01:38:28,567
Kothon!

952
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:53,807
Avaggdu luatha bairn off haefermore.

953
01:38:53,947 --> 01:38:57,456
Avaggdu luatha bairn off haefermore.

954
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:09,735
Begin the ritual.

955
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:12,654
This baby will not destroy me.

956
01:39:17,307 --> 01:39:20,037
Come, thunder!

957
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,914
Come, lightning!

958
01:39:23,853 --> 01:39:27,419
Touch this altar with your powers.

959
01:39:50,758 --> 01:39:54,078
We've come all this way
and now Elora Danan's gonna die!

960
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:56,948
No, we can still defeat Bavmorda.

961
01:39:57,314 --> 01:39:59,159
She's too powerful, Raziel.

962
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:02,412
Transform me and I will destroy her.

963
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:12,624
Elements of eternity, above and below.

964
01:40:12,686 --> 01:40:16,426
Balance of essence, fire begets snow.

965
01:40:18,046 --> 01:40:21,056
- Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...
- Willow,

966
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:25,389
- believe in the words. Concentrate.
- Tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.

967
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,506
Locktwaar danalora...

968
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:31,772
- luatha danu tuatha, tuatha.
- Oh, no!

969
01:40:31,795 --> 01:40:34,194
Locktwaar danalora.

970
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:37,904
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...

971
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,909
- tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.
- Don't give up,

972
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,662
Willow!

973
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:48,540
- Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...
- Oh, Willow!

974
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:52,546
Tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.

975
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:56,758
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu tuath...

976
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:00,137
tuatha chnox... danu.

977
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:15,794
Raziel.

978
01:41:24,943 --> 01:41:28,832
- Has it been so long?
- I'm sorry.

979
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:35,088
Willow, we have work to do.

980
01:41:36,077 --> 01:41:38,091
Give me the wand.

981
01:41:38,569 --> 01:41:41,970
We must undo Bavmorda's sorcery.

982
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:47,196
Let them in now.

983
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:55,150
Tuatha grin chnox, y foel famau.

984
01:42:09,115 --> 01:42:12,158
Black fires forever kindled within,

985
01:42:12,309 --> 01:42:15,090
let the second rite begin.

986
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:34,476
Quick, inside.

987
01:42:34,546 --> 01:42:36,772
That won't reach the wall.
We can't get inside.

988
01:42:36,846 --> 01:42:39,765
- Elora Danan will die.
- Unless we save her.

989
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:43,242
- Bavmorda's too powerful.
- No!

990
01:42:43,305 --> 01:42:47,953
She cannot transform you again.
My spell is protecting this camp.

991
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:50,417
But can your magic
get us inside the fortress?

992
01:42:52,762 --> 01:42:54,442
We can't do it.

993
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:58,747
Wait. Back home in my village,
we have a lot of gophers.

994
01:42:58,888 --> 01:43:01,575
- Willow, this is war, not agriculture.
- I know, I know.

995
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:05,159
But I've an idea
how to get inside the castle.

996
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:12,394
Ocht veth bordak stira.

997
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:17,368
Ocht veth bordak stira.
Ocht veth bordak stira.

998
01:43:17,392 --> 01:43:20,443
Ocht veth bordak stira.

999
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,564
Ocht veth bordak stira.

1000
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:25,290
Come on, Madmartigan,
you and I are soldiers.

1001
01:43:25,353 --> 01:43:28,034
You and I know the peck's plan
will never work.

1002
01:43:28,338 --> 01:43:31,548
If the baby dies,
all hope for the future is lost.

1003
01:43:34,188 --> 01:43:36,258
I'm going to fight.

1004
01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:40,964
Me too.

1005
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:51,266
All right, we've got to decide
who's gonna go and who's gonna stay.

1006
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,191
Raziel.

1007
01:44:41,582 --> 01:44:46,196
Willow, all these years
I have waited to face Bavmorda.

1008
01:44:46,428 --> 01:44:49,532
It is you that has made this possible.

1009
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:54,412
Whatever happens,
I shall always admire you.

1010
01:45:05,497 --> 01:45:07,723
Your children...

1011
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:10,485
will come to remember this day.

1012
01:45:20,832 --> 01:45:23,775
We call upon you to surrender!

1013
01:45:25,923 --> 01:45:28,329
We are all-powerful sorcerers.

1014
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:30,673
Give us the baby,

1015
01:45:30,738 --> 01:45:32,906
or we'll destroy you!

1016
01:45:39,176 --> 01:45:41,251
Kill them!

1017
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:02,147
Patience, Willow.

1018
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:05,734
Courage, Willow.

1019
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,878
Back to the castle!

1020
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:52,697
Ocht veth nockthirth bordak!

1021
01:46:53,132 --> 01:46:57,785
Exile the child to the 13th night.

1022
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,877
This way!

1023
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:51,548
Nockthirth plankton
firth foreth forewar.

1024
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:53,883
Ocht veth nock!

1025
01:47:54,396 --> 01:47:56,347
It's all right, Willow.

1026
01:47:56,913 --> 01:47:58,304
You don't have to go.

1027
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:01,474
Light the 13th candle!

1028
01:48:16,446 --> 01:48:18,423
Raziel.

1029
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:19,658
Mother!

1030
01:48:21,674 --> 01:48:23,705
I...

1031
01:48:24,104 --> 01:48:28,293
Traitor child. I must despise you now.

1032
01:48:58,745 --> 01:49:01,743
- I won't let you kill that child.
- Away!

1033
01:49:02,402 --> 01:49:04,078
Avaggdu...

1034
01:49:04,581 --> 01:49:06,789
strokt!

1035
01:49:23,421 --> 01:49:26,768
Your powers have gained
in strength, Raziel.

1036
01:49:27,117 --> 01:49:32,023
I have Cherlindrea's wand, Bavmorda.

1037
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:38,112
Elora Danan will be queen.

1038
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:53,207
Now you die!

1039
01:49:57,019 --> 01:50:00,009
Furrochk flarem!

1040
01:50:30,436 --> 01:50:32,795
Claideb cla-

1041
01:50:34,147 --> 01:50:39,340
Clai main! Lunano ocht!

1042
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:42,302
Bachktu inno!

1043
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:49,600
Wanu!

1044
01:51:51,942 --> 01:51:54,499
Yikes!

1045
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,534
Airk!

1046
01:52:34,442 --> 01:52:35,504
Airk.

1047
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:40,503
Win this war for me.

1048
01:53:19,647 --> 01:53:22,139
Die!

1049
01:55:17,219 --> 01:55:19,161
Beah!

1050
01:55:20,743 --> 01:55:23,583
Bring back that child, peck.

1051
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:30,715
Who are you?

1052
01:55:33,011 --> 01:55:34,677
I'm Willow Ufgood.

1053
01:55:40,438 --> 01:55:42,532
I'm a great sorcerer.

1054
01:55:43,829 --> 01:55:45,104
Greater than Raziel.

1055
01:55:46,234 --> 01:55:48,399
Greater than you even.

1056
01:55:49,604 --> 01:55:51,402
I'm the greatest sorcerer!

1057
01:56:11,412 --> 01:56:14,670
Is that the extent
of your powers, little one?

1058
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:22,975
Now you will watch me draw
upon the power of the universe...

1059
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:25,394
to send that child into the netherworld.

1060
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,188
Now place it on the altar!

1061
01:56:38,809 --> 01:56:40,192
No!

1062
01:56:41,442 --> 01:56:42,620
No?

1063
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:45,330
You stupid hag!

1064
01:56:45,825 --> 01:56:48,876
With my magic, I'll send her into the...

1065
01:56:50,131 --> 01:56:51,045
Into a...

1066
01:56:52,191 --> 01:56:53,923
You're no sorcerer.

1067
01:56:54,613 --> 01:56:58,344
- Into a realm where evil cannot touch her.
- Impossible!

1068
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:02,640
- There's no such place!
- Helgafel swath ben helgafel.

1069
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:08,145
You're a fool! I shall destroy you
and the child with you.

1070
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:11,106
- You're a fool!
- Bairn off danu famoww.

1071
01:57:11,935 --> 01:57:13,150
Good-bye, Elora.

1072
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:16,320
Bohi bakstiy.

1073
01:57:16,662 --> 01:57:20,366
Helgafel!

1074
01:57:24,371 --> 01:57:29,458
Im... possible!

1075
01:57:33,919 --> 01:57:35,631
You...

1076
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:19,749
Willow, where's the baby?

1077
01:58:22,061 --> 01:58:24,847
It was just my old disappearing-pig trick.

1078
01:58:28,437 --> 01:58:30,978
Oh, well done!

1079
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:37,109
Willow Ufgood,
receive this book of magic.

1080
01:58:37,739 --> 01:58:42,364
You are on your way
to becoming a great sorcerer.

1081
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:47,411
- Willow the Sorcerer!
- You make us proud!

1082
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:56,474
Good-bye, Elora Danan.

1083
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:05,234
Hey.

1084
01:59:15,074 --> 01:59:16,934
Good-bye, Willow!

1085
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:18,481
Farewell!

1086
01:59:34,112 --> 01:59:36,418
- Willow! Willow!
- Hello, Regan. Hello.

1087
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:39,213
Willow's back! Willow's back!

1088
01:59:39,526 --> 01:59:42,132
Willow! Willow!

1089
01:59:43,185 --> 01:59:45,553
Willow! Willow Ufgood!

1090
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:50,766
- Willow!
- Hey, Meegosh!

1091
02:00:05,437 --> 02:00:07,700
It's a bird! He made a bird!

1092
02:00:08,632 --> 02:00:10,160
Aaaaaagh!

1093
02:00:17,908 --> 02:00:19,205
Kiaya!

1094
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:23,392
Willow?

1095
02:00:24,993 --> 02:00:26,102
Kiaya.

1096
02:00:26,548 --> 02:00:28,829
Willow! Willow!

1097
02:00:28,882 --> 02:00:30,126
Kiaya!

1098
02:00:31,034 --> 02:00:32,456
Kiaya!

1099
02:00:32,503 --> 02:00:34,527
- Dada! Dada!
- Dada, I missed you!

1100
02:00:34,573 --> 02:00:37,688
Oh, I missed you.

1
00:00:53,116 --> 00:01:00,115
The Hobbit

2
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:14,420
Bree - On the borders of the Shire

3
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,915
The Prancing Pony

4
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:56,272
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

5
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,813
- Here you are.
Thank you kindly.

6
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,241
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

7
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:08,871
- There you are.
- Thank you.

8
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,532
Master Stadle.

9
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,053
Mind if I join you?

10
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,017
I'll have the same.

11
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,363
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

12
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:02,081
Gandalf the Grey.

13
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,334
I know who you are.

14
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:07,834
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

15
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,711
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

16
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,258
I received word that my father...

17
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,040
...had been seen wandering...

18
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,247
...the Wilds near Dunland.

19
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,172
I went looking.

20
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:27,421
I found no sign of him.

21
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,810
Thorin, it's been a long time...

22
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,946
...since anything but rumor was heard...

23
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,054
...of Thrain.

24
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,815
He still lives.

25
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,611
I am sure of it.

26
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:42,981
My father came to see you
before he went missing.

27
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,026
What did you say to him?

28
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:49,696
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

29
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,797
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

30
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,967
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

31
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,837
...the Lonely Mountain.

32
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,011
And I would say the same to you.

33
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:01,266
Take back your homeland.

34
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,253
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

35
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,427
No.

36
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:12,733
It is not.

37
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,687
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

38
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:18,590
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

39
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,888
Sooner or later...

40
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,144
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

41
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,162
I ran into some unsavory characters...

42
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,699
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

43
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,700
They mistook me for a vagabond.

44
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,167
I imagine they regretted that.

45
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,828
One of them was carrying a message.

46
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,614
It is Black Speech.

47
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:44,536
A promise of payment.

48
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:45,996
For what?

49
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,872
Your head.

50
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,041
Someone wants you dead.

51
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,523
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

52
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:59,425
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

53
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,106
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

54
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:04,464
Together, you have the might and power...

55
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,643
...to retake Erebor.

56
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:09,135
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

57
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:11,092
Demand they stand by their oath.

58
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:15,271
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

59
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:16,560
The Arkenstone.

60
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:18,405
It is the only thing that will...

61
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,209
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

62
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,712
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

63
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,625
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

64
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,412
How?

65
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,722
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

66
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:38,462
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

67
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,881
Yes, it does.

68
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,804
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

69
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:49,904
12 Months Later ...

70
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,264


71
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:39,940
The Desolation of Smaug

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,685
How close is the pack?

73
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,480
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

74
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,233
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
Not yet. But they will do.

75
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,819
- We have another problem.
Did they see you?

76
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:55,653
They saw you.

77
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:56,571
No, that's not it.

78
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:57,905
What did I tell you?

79
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:59,448
Quiet as a mouse.

80
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,742
Excellent burglar material.

81
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:03,202
Will you listen? Will you just...

82
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:04,620
...listen?

83
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,914
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

84
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,544
What form did it take'?

85
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,254
Like a bear?

86
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:16,173
Ye- Yes, but bigger.

87
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:17,509
Much bigger.

88
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,595
You knew about this beast?

89
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:22,639
I say we double back.

90
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,975
And be run down by a pack of Ores?

91
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,935
There is a house...

92
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,649
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

93
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,151
Whose house?

94
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,611
Are they friend or foe?

95
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,155
Neither.

96
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,116
He will help us or...

97
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,243
...he Will kill us.

98
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:45,746
What choice do we have?

99
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,459
None.

100
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,221
Come on!

101
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,293
This way! Quickly!

102
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,173
Run!

103
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,155
Bombur, come on!

104
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,403
To the house!

105
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,023
Run!

106
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,870
Come on, get inside.

107
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,590
Open the door!

108
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:49,969
Quickly!

109
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:01,015
Push!
Push!

110
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:05,508
Dwalin!

111
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,344
Come on, lads!

112
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:12,247
What is...

113
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,244
...that?

114
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,825
That is our host.

115
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,578
His name is Beorn.

116
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:26,957
And he's a skin-changer.

117
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:30,583
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

118
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,377
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

119
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,712
The bear is unpredictable...

120
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:38,171
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

121
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:41,631
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

122
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,801
He's leaving.

123
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,010
Come away from there.

124
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,720
It's not natural. None of it.

125
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,929
It's obvious. He's under some...

126
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,097
...dark spell.

127
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:55,347
Don't be a fool.

128
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,974
He's under no enchantment but his own.

129
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:01,435
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

130
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,019
You'll be safe here tonight.

131
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,857
I hope.

132
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,056
Attack them now.

133
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:32,176
Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.

134
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:34,177
No.

135
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:39,877
The Beast stands guard.

136
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,877
We will kill them on the road.

137
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:02,977
They are gathering in Dol Guldur.

138
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:07,181
The Master has summoned you!

139
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:04,215
<i>one ring to rule them all ...</i>

140
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:08,426
<i>one ring to find them ...</i>

141
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:17,616
<i>one ring to bring them,
and in the darkness bind them.</i>

142
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,272
We grow in number.

143
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:57,173
We grow in strenght.

144
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,051
You will lead my armies.

145
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,148
What of Oakenshield?

146
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:08,253
War is coming.

147
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,154
You promised me his head.

148
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,056
Death will come to all.

149
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:22,060
Do we call off the hunt?

150
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,263
Bolg!

151
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,273
I have a task for you.

152
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:48,276
Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?

153
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:55,066
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

154
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,068
Tell me...

155
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:58,651
...why is Azog...

156
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,867
...the Defiler hunting you?

157
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,908
You know of Azog?

158
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:04,718
How?

159
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,965
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

160
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:11,929
...before the Ores came down
from the North.

161
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,273
The Defiler killed most of my family.

162
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:16,770
But some he...

163
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,103
...enslaved.

164
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,271
Not for work, you understand...

165
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,944
...but for sport.

166
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,347
Caging skin-changers...

167
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,394
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

168
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,449
There are others like you?

169
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,543
Once there were many.

170
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,334
And now'?

171
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,824
Now there is only one.

172
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,587
You need to reach...

173
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:48,495
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

174
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:49,864
Before Durin's Day falls.

175
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,073
Yes.

176
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,160
You are running out of time.

177
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,622
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

178
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:58,670
A darkness lies upon that forest.

179
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,925
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

180
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:05,766
There is an alliance
between the Ores of Moria...

181
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:08,897
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

182
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,066
I would not venture there...

183
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,362
...except in great need.

184
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,283
We will take the Elven Road.

185
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,619
That path is still safe.

186
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:17,828
"Safe"?

187
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,622
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

188
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:20,831
...are not like their kin.

189
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:22,916
They're less wise...

190
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,043
...and more dangerous.

191
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,088
But it matters not.

192
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,091
What do you mean?

193
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:34,092
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

194
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:37,554
Their numbers are growing.

195
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,264
And you are on foot.

196
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:41,141
You will never reach...

197
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,435
...the forest alive.

198
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:50,233
I don't like Dwarves.

199
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,896
They're greedy...

200
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:54,604
...and blind.

201
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:57,988
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

202
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,696
...lesser than their own.

203
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,577
But Ores I hate more.

204
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,081
What do you need?

205
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:21,151
<i>BEORN".
Go now. While you have the light.</i>

206
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,987
<i>Your hunters are not far behind.</i>

207
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,355
The Elven Gate.

208
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,870
Here lies our path...

209
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,623
...through Mirkwood.

210
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,994
No sign of the Ores.
We have luck on our side.

211
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,372
Set the ponies loose.

212
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,456
Let them return to their master.

213
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,290
This forest...

214
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,952
...feels...

215
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:16,661
...sick.

216
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,334
As if a disease lies upon it.

217
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,471
Is there no way around?

218
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:26,187
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

219
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,526
Or twice that distance...

220
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,780
...south.

221
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,056
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

222
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,892
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

223
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,938
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

224
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,523
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

225
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,151
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

226
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:22,158
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

227
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:26,286
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

228
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:29,200
The High Fells.

229
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,612
So be it.

230
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:39,532
Not my horse!

231
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:40,367
Ineediï¬‚

232
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:43,994
You're not leaving us?

233
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:45,996
I would not do this unless I had to.

234
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,919
You've changed...

235
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:55,921
...Bilbo Baggins.

236
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,341
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

237
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:04,803
I was going to tell you.

238
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,557
I...

239
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,520
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

240
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,105
Found what?

241
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,693
What did you find?

242
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,406
My courage.

243
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,243
Good. Well, that's good.

244
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,913
You'll need it.

245
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,790
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

246
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,166
...the slopes of Erebor.

247
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,794
Keep the map and key safe.

248
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:47,005
Do not enter that mountain without me.

249
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:56,179
This is not the Greenwood of old.

250
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:59,724
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

251
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,684
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

252
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:04,853
"Lead us astray"?

253
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,646
What does that mean?

254
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:10,149
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

255
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,609
If you do, you'll never...

256
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,152
...find it again.

257
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,363
No matter what may come, stay on...

258
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:18,281
...the path!

259
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,700
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

260
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,951
Durin's Day?
Let's go.

261
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,703
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

262
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,088
The path turns this way.

263
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,319
This way.

264
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,079
Air. I need air.

265
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,372
My head, it's swimming!

266
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:20,707
What's happening?

267
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:22,374
Keep moving.

268
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,841
Nori...

269
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,214
...why have we stopped?

270
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:27,379
The path...

271
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,312
...it's disappeared.

272
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,596
What's going on?

273
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,383
We've lost the path!

274
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:34,724
Find it.

275
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:38,019
All of you, look. Look for the path!

276
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,463
I don't remember this bit.

277
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,334
None of it's familiar.

278
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,341
It's got to be here.

279
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:55,471
What hour is it?

280
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:59,203
I do not know. I do not even know
what day it is.

281
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:02,371
Is there no end to this accursed forest?!

282
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,190
Attercop.

283
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,058
Look.

284
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:48,934
A tobacco pouch.

285
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,603
There's Dwarves in these woods.

286
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:54,480
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

287
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,398
This is exactly the same as mine.

288
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,317
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

289
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,360
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

290
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,653
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

291
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:06,530
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

292
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,157
I thought you were the expert.

293
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,283
The sun.

294
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,785
We have to find...

295
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,286
...the sun.

296
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,288
Up there.

297
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,372
We need to...

298
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,124
...get above the canopy.

299
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,045
What was that?

300
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:30,131
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

301
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,842
We're being watched.

302
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,003
I can see a lake!

303
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:27,005
And a river.

304
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:30,341
And the Lonely Mountain.

305
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,593
We're almost there!

306
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,845
Can you hear me?

307
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:39,265
I know which way to go!

308
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,727
Hello?

309
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:54,285
Hello.

310
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh, no.

311
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:08,389
Oh, come on.

312
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:50,227
Kill them! Kill them.

313
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,502
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

314
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,267
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

315
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,138
Stick it again.

316
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,429
Stick it again. Finish it off.

317
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,307
The meat's alive and kicking!

318
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,140
Kill him.

319
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,140
Kill him now.

320
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,976
Let us feast.

321
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,444
Feast! Feast!

322
00:28:07,696 --> 00:28:09,787
Feast! Feast!

323
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,582
Eat them alive!

324
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,871
Feast!

325
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:23,071
What is it?
What is it?

326
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,157
Eat them alive!

327
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:32,538
Fat and juicy.

328
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,002
Just a...

329
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:38,338
...little taste.

330
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,349
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

331
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:53,852
Here.

332
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,728
Ah! It stings!

333
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:57,855
It stings!

334
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,111
Sting.

335
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,363
That's a good name.

336
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:10,283
Sting.

337
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:30,383
You all right there, Bofur?

338
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,968
I'm all right!
Get it off me!

339
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,303
Where's Bilbo?

340
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:34,511
I'm up here!

341
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:07,499
Grab the legs!

342
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,667
Pull!

343
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,669
Pull!

344
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:18,050
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

345
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:19,926
Where is it?

346
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,820
No!

347
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:44,739
No! No!

348
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:46,950
Thorin! Get them!

349
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,117
Come on!

350
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:53,372
Look out, brother!

351
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:56,791
Fili!

352
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,896
Mine.

353
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:57,886
Come on...

354
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,304
...keep up!

355
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,180
We're clear!

356
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:24,492
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

357
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,410
It would be my pleasure.

358
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,708
- Help!
- Kili!

359
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,891
Throw me a dagger!

360
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:53,809
Quick!

361
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:55,144
If you think I'm giving you...

362
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:56,436
...a weapon, Dwarf...

363
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:57,771
...you're mistaken!

364
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,277
Search them.

365
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,909
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

366
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,327
Who is this?

367
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,079
- Your brother?
- That is...

368
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,622
...my Wife!

369
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,957
And what is this horrid creature?

370
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,375
A Goblin-mutant?

371
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,543
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

372
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:31,763
Are the Spiders dead?

373
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:34,563
Yes, But more will come.

374
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,674
They're growing bolder.

375
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,678
This is an ancient Elvish blade.

376
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:52,291
Forged by my kin.

377
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:56,780
Where did you get this?

378
00:33:57,197 --> 00:33:58,407
It was given to me.

379
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:05,246
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

380
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,543
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

381
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,472
Close the gate.

382
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,225
Unh! This is not the end of it!

383
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,770
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

384
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,563
Get off me!

385
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:30,945
Aren't you going to search me?

386
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:34,782
I could have anything down my trousers.

387
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:37,201
Or nothing.

388
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,400
Why does the dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?

389
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:50,211
Who can say?

390
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:54,012
He's quite tall for a Dwarf.

391
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:58,512
- Do you not think?
- Taller than some...

392
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,943
...but no less ugly.

393
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:13,440
- Ah! Again!
- Leave it!

394
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,026
There's no way out!

395
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,277
This is no Orc dungeon.

396
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:21,030
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

397
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:25,118
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

398
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,332
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

399
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,836
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

400
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:38,838
...and slay a dragon.

401
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:44,217
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

402
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:46,761
Attempted burglary.

403
00:36:47,512 --> 00:36:49,763
Or something of that ilk.

404
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:53,684
You have found...

405
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:54,935
...a way in.

406
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,143
You seek that which would...

407
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,397
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

408
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,941
The King's Jewel.

409
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:04,359
The Arkenstone.

410
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,948
It is precious to you beyond measure.

411
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:12,658
I understand that.

412
00:37:13,617 --> 00:37:17,246
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

413
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,581
White gems...

414
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,875
...of pure starlight.

415
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,169
I offer you my help.

416
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,756
I am listening.

417
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,633
I will let you go...

418
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:35,303
...if you but return what is mine.

419
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:39,807
A favor for a favor.

420
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,016
You have my word.

421
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,936
One king to another.

422
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:52,318
I would not trust Thranduil...

423
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,320
...the great king...

424
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,737
...to honor his word...

425
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:58,489
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

426
00:37:59,115 --> 00:37:59,708
You...

427
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:01,170
...who lack all...

428
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:02,427
...honor.

429
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,557
I have seen how you treat your friends.

430
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,843
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

431
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:11,551
...seeking your help.

432
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,470
But you turned your back!

433
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:18,388
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

434
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,598
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

435
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,433
May you die in dragon fire!

436
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:25,309
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

437
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:26,352
I know...

438
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:28,853
...its wrath and ruin.

439
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,230
I have faced...

440
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,233
...the great serpents of the North.

441
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,068
I warned your...

442
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,612
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

443
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,074
But he would not listen.

444
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,704
You are just like him.

445
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:57,916
Stay here if you will...

446
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,709
...and rot.

447
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,879
A hundred years is a mere blink...

448
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,131
...in the life of an Elf.

449
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:06,050
I'm patient.

450
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:09,096
I can wait.

451
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,647
Did he offer you a deal?

452
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,065
He did.

453
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,112
<i>I told him he could go
May you die in dragon fire!</i>

454
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:25,698
Him and all his kin!

455
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,494
Well, that's that, then.

456
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,708
A deal was our only hope.

457
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,880
Not our only hope.

458
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:47,181
I know you're there.

459
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:51,979
Why do you linger in the shadows?

460
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:55,357
I was coming to report to you.

461
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:59,904
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

462
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:00,811
We cleared...

463
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:03,540
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

464
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:04,876
...coming up from the South.

465
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:05,746
They are spawning in...

466
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:08,246
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

467
00:40:08,663 --> 00:40:10,713
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

468
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:13,752
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

469
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,620
And when we drive them off, what then?

470
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,469
Will they not spread to other lands?

471
00:40:18,805 --> 00:40:20,590
Other lands are not my concern.

472
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:23,625
The fortunes of the world...

473
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:24,960
...will rise and fall.

474
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,128
But here in this...

475
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:27,421
...kingdom, we will endure.

476
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,344
Legolas said you fought well today.

477
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:41,433
He has grown very fond of you.

478
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:46,103
I assure you, my lord...

479
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:49,315
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

480
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,399
Perhaps he did once.

481
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:54,944
Now I am not so sure.

482
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,824
I do not think you would allow your son...

483
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,535
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

484
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:06,371
No, you are right. I would not.

485
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:09,415
Still, he cares about you.

486
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:12,752
Do not give him hope where there is none.

487
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,093
The gates are guarded.

488
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:25,286
Not all of them ... follow me!

489
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,204
The stone in your hand, what is it?

490
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,166
It is a talisman.

491
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,003
A powerful spell lies upon it.

492
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,965
If any but a
reads the runes on this stone...

493
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:08,049
...they will be forever cursed.

494
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,056
Or not.

495
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:19,935
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

496
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:24,188
A rune stone.

497
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:26,941
My mother...

498
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:29,110
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

499
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:32,237
What promise?

500
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:34,114
That I would come back to her.

501
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:38,284
She worries.

502
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:41,287
She thinks I'm reckless.

503
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,126
Are you?

504
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:45,801
Nah.

505
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:58,629
Sounds like quite a party...

506
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:00,266
...you're having up there.

507
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,935
<i>It is Mereth en Gilith...</i>

508
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,397
...the Feast of Starlight.

509
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:09,030
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

510
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:13,075
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

511
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:15,244
I always thought it is a cold light.

512
00:43:17,412 --> 00:43:19,623
Remote and far away.

513
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:22,709
It is memory...

514
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,629
...precious and pure.

515
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,635
Like your promise.

516
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:42,937
I have walked there sometimes.

517
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:44,855
Beyond the forest...

518
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:46,649
...and up into the night.

519
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:51,237
I have seen the world fall away...

520
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:55,281
...and the white light of forever fill the air.

521
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,536
I saw a fire moon once.

522
00:44:02,455 --> 00:44:05,124
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

523
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,961
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

524
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:12,756
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

525
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:16,134
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

526
00:44:16,718 --> 00:44:18,679
...keeping the mountain to our left.

527
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:20,639
And then it appeared.

528
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,891
This huge fire moon...

529
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,977
...lighting our path.

530
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,520
I wish I could show you the caverns.

531
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:31,440
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

532
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:35,069
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

533
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,363
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

534
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:38,698
Say what you like about our...

535
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:42,285
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

536
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:44,787
Come, Elros, try it.

537
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:46,329
I have the Dwarves...

538
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:47,581
...in my charge.

539
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:50,917
They're locked up. Where can they go? Ha, ha.

540
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:56,548
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

541
00:44:56,798 --> 00:44:58,508
Must be nearly dawn.

542
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:01,052
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

543
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,098
Not stuck in here, you're not.

544
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:12,682
Bilbo!

545
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:13,808
What?

546
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:18,319
Shh! There are guards nearby!

547
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:24,990
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

548
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,405
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

549
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:39,702
Up the stairs.
You first.

550
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:40,537
Ori.

551
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:42,205
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

552
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:44,445
Go.

553
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:46,193
Easy, now.

554
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:02,385
This way.

555
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:06,259
Come on.

556
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:08,094
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

557
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:10,095
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

558
00:46:10,346 --> 00:46:11,062
I know what I'm doing!

559
00:46:11,314 --> 00:46:12,144
Shh!

560
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:14,272
This way! This way!

561
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:19,908
Everyone...

562
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,407
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

563
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:24,283
- They'll find us.
No, no.

564
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:25,576
They won't, I promise you.

565
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:29,330
Please, please. You must trust me.

566
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,292
Do as he says.

567
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,502
Move your big ginger head.

568
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,421
Bifur, get in...

569
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,590
...the barrel! Move!

570
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:49,971
Everyone's in.

571
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,017
What do we do now?

572
00:46:55,768 --> 00:46:56,769
Hold your breath.

573
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:57,895
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

574
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:26,210
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

575
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:54,568
Well done, Master Baggins.

576
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:57,279
Go! Come on, let's go!

577
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:08,913
Hold on!

578
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,467
Bilbo!

579
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:29,305
Hang on!

580
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:33,225
- Help!
- Ori!

581
00:48:37,425 --> 00:48:39,225
Shut the gate!

582
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:58,538
No!

583
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,051
Watch out! There's Ores!

584
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,089
Slay them all!

585
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:34,527
Get under the bridge!

586
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:48,288
Kili!

587
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,263
Kili!

588
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:21,952
Kili.

589
00:50:36,794 --> 00:50:39,763
Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!

590
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,965
After them!

591
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:16,716
Kili!

592
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:42,081
Nori!

593
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:55,954
Cut the log!

594
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:04,921
Bombur!

595
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,502
Tauriel.
Wait!

596
00:54:44,123 --> 00:54:48,203
This one we keep alive.

597
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,171
After them! Cut them off!

598
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:40,367
Oh, it's you!

599
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,202
Why am I here, Gandalf?

600
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:43,662
Trust me, Radagast.

601
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:46,874
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

602
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,964
This is not a nice place to meet.

603
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:55,331
No.

604
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:57,743
It is not.

605
00:56:58,828 --> 00:57:01,375
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

606
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,340
Old and full of hate.

607
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,927
Who's buried here?

608
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:09,643
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

609
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,980
He would have been known only...

610
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:14,527
...as a servant of evil.

611
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,072
One of a number.

612
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,108
One of nine.

613
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,293
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

614
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:31,129
The Ringwraiths...

615
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,172
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

616
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:35,382
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

617
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:39,133
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

618
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:41,343
Who said it was human?

619
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:46,638
The Nine only answer to one master.

620
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:49,473
We've been blind, Radagast.

621
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:51,807
And in our blindness...

622
00:57:52,057 --> 00:57:54,183
...the Enemy has returned.

623
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,811
He is summoning his servants.

624
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:01,187
Azog the Defiler...

625
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,438
...is no ordinary hunter.

626
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,022
He is a commander.

627
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,816
A commander of legions.

628
00:58:08,357 --> 00:58:12,234
The Enemy is preparing for war.

629
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:14,610
It will begin in the East.

630
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:17,653
His mind is set upon that mountain.

631
00:58:17,903 --> 00:58:19,737
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

632
00:58:19,988 --> 00:58:20,947
Gandalf.

633
00:58:22,116 --> 00:58:24,868
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

634
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,038
They are in grave danger.

635
00:58:27,288 --> 00:58:28,540
If what you say is true...

636
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,502
...the world is in grave danger.

637
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:36,216
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

638
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:40,639
You want me to cast my friends aside?

639
00:58:43,642 --> 00:58:45,979
Anything behind us?
Not that I can see.

640
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,989
- I think we've outrun the Ores.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

641
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,409
Bombur's half drowned.

642
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,745
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

643
00:58:58,996 --> 00:58:59,913
Come on, let's go!

644
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:01,957
Gloin, help me, my brother.

645
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,164
Come on, lift yourself.

646
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:07,746
Come on!

647
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:10,455
Come on, you big lump, you!

648
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:22,247
I'm fine. It's nothing.

649
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:23,414
On your feet.

650
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:25,706
KiIt's wounded. His leg needs binding.

651
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:28,332
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

652
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:29,499
To where?

653
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,669
To the mountain. We're so close.

654
00:59:32,253 --> 00:59:35,133
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

655
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,678
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

656
00:59:37,928 --> 00:59:40,891
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

657
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:43,227
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

658
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:45,147
Bind his leg, quickly.

659
00:59:45,731 --> 00:59:47,232
You have two minutes.

660
01:00:07,549 --> 01:00:08,462
Do it again...

661
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,337
...and you're dead.

662
01:00:13,054 --> 01:00:14,270
Excuse me...

663
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:17,650
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

664
01:00:18,608 --> 01:00:21,110
That barge over there...

665
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,654
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

666
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:28,405
What makes you think I would help you?

667
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:30,490
Those boots have seen better days.

668
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:32,616
As has that coat.

669
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,660
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

670
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:38,203
How many bairns?

671
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:40,746
A boy and two girls.

672
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:44,290
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

673
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:46,661
Aye.

674
01:00:47,118 --> 01:00:48,162
She was.

675
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:52,909
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

676
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:55,005
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

677
01:00:56,727 --> 01:00:57,846
What's your hurry?

678
01:00:58,094 --> 01:00:59,297
What's it to you?

679
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:01,213
I would like to know who you are...

680
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:03,559
...and what you are doing in these lands.

681
01:01:04,232 --> 01:01:06,728
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

682
01:01:07,103 --> 01:01:08,555
...journeying to see our kin...

683
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:10,393
...in the Iron Hills.

684
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:13,724
Simple merchants, you say?

685
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,322
We need food...

686
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:17,535
...supplies, weapons.

687
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:18,952
Can you help us?

688
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:24,121
I know where these...

689
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:25,746
...barrels came from.

690
01:01:26,497 --> 01:01:27,747
What of it'?

691
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:30,416
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

692
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:32,666
...but I don't think it ended well.

693
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:35,001
No one enters Lake-town...

694
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:37,210
...but by leave of the Master.

695
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,628
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

696
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:43,671
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

697
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:46,548
Offer him more.

698
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:50,133
I'll wager there are...

699
01:01:50,383 --> 01:01:52,300
...ways to enter that town unseen.

700
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,268
Aye.

701
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:56,850
But for that...

702
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,424
...you would need a smuggler.

703
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,594
For which we would pay double.

704
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:13,775
<i>Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...</i>

705
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,612
...the vast ignorance of the world...

706
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,156
...it festers and spreads.

707
01:02:18,406 --> 01:02:21,118
A shadow that grows in the dark.

708
01:02:21,744 --> 01:02:23,455
A sleepless malice as black...

709
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:26,625
...as the oncoming wall of night.

710
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:29,503
So it ever was.

711
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:32,299
So will it always be.

712
01:02:33,592 --> 01:02:37,263
In time, all foul things come forth.

713
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:40,434
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

714
01:02:40,684 --> 01:02:41,638
Why?

715
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:43,233
Not 13.

716
01:02:43,654 --> 01:02:45,029
Not anymore.

717
01:02:45,738 --> 01:02:46,656
The young one...

718
01:02:47,323 --> 01:02:49,241
...the black-haired archer...

719
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,700
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

720
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:56,495
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

721
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:57,788
...choking on it soon.

722
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,373
Answer the question, filth.

723
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:03,533
I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!

724
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:07,502
I would not antagonize her.

725
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:09,878
You like killing things, Orc?

726
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:12,588
You like death?

727
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:14,631
Then let me give it to you.

728
01:03:15,799 --> 01:03:16,508
enough!

729
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:19,008
Tauriel, leave!

730
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:20,508
Now go.

731
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,434
I do not care about one...

732
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,353
...dead . Answer the question.

733
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:38,938
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

734
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:41,690
...what you know
and I will set you free.

735
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,650
You had orders to kill them. Why?

736
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,068
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

737
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:50,195
The  runt will never be king.

738
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:51,362
King?

739
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:54,654
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

740
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:57,196
None would dare enter Erebor...

741
01:03:57,446 --> 01:03:58,446
...whilst the dragon lives.

742
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:00,364
You know nothing.

743
01:04:00,613 --> 01:04:03,239
Your world will burn.

744
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:05,123
What are you talking about?

745
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,836
Speak!

746
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:10,092
Our time has come again.

747
01:04:10,718 --> 01:04:14,016
My master serves the One.

748
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,940
Do you understand now, Elfling?

749
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,028
Death is upon you.

750
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:22,490
The flames of war...

751
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:24,367
...are upon you.

752
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:28,496
Why did you do that?

753
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:30,832
You promised to set him free.

754
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:32,208
And I did.

755
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:36,503
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

756
01:04:38,088 --> 01:04:38,672
There was more...

757
01:04:38,922 --> 01:04:40,673
...the Orc could tell us.

758
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,383
There was nothing more he could tell me.

759
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:46,802
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

760
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,763
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

761
01:04:50,013 --> 01:04:52,181
...it will destroy all before it.

762
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:56,225
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

763
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,226
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

764
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,019
No one enters this kingdom.

765
01:05:01,145 --> 01:05:02,688
And no one leaves it.

766
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:07,608
Close the gate!

767
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,008
Keep it sealed by order of the King.

768
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,986
What about Tauriel?

769
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:17,215
What about her?

770
01:05:17,405 --> 01:05:18,873
She went into the forest...

771
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,473
...armed with her bow and blade.

772
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:23,113
She has not returned.

773
01:05:46,606 --> 01:05:48,705
blood!

774
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:50,705
They were here!

775
01:05:51,106 --> 01:05:54,005
There is another scent ...

776
01:05:57,805 --> 01:05:59,519
Man flesh!

777
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:08,723
They have found a way to cross the lake.

778
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:28,702
Watch out!

779
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:38,584
What are you trying...

780
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,524
...to do, drown us?

781
01:06:40,773 --> 01:06:43,351
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master .

782
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,972
If I wanted to drown you...

783
01:06:45,222 --> 01:06:46,802
...I would not do it here.

784
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:51,292
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

785
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,286
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

786
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:56,988
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

787
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,984
Uh, I asked him.

788
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:01,811
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

789
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,600
We do not have to like him.

790
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:05,471
We simply have to pay him.

791
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:07,507
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

792
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:08,714
...your pockets.

793
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,541
How do we know he won't betray us?

794
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:12,999
We don't.

795
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:14,547
There's...

796
01:07:15,093 --> 01:07:16,048
...just a wee problem.

797
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:18,718
We're 10 coins short.

798
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:21,557
Gloin.

799
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:23,750
Come on.

800
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,144
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

801
01:07:27,236 --> 01:07:29,558
I have been bled dry...

802
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:30,903
...by this venture.

803
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,193
What have I seen...

804
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:33,734
...for my investment?

805
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:36,320
Naught but misery and...

806
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:37,445
...grief and...

807
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:47,787
Bless my beard.

808
01:07:48,622 --> 01:07:49,790
Take it.

809
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,292
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

810
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:57,254
The money, quick. Give it to me.

811
01:07:57,505 --> 01:07:58,214
We will pay you when we...

812
01:07:58,464 --> 01:08:00,174
...get our provisions but not before.

813
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:02,884
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

814
01:08:03,343 --> 01:08:04,594
There are guards ahead.

815
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:24,529
What's he doing?

816
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:26,071
He's talking to someone.

817
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,825
He's pointing right at us.

818
01:08:33,202 --> 01:08:33,786
Now they're...

819
01:08:34,036 --> 01:08:34,620
...shaking hands.

820
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,330
- What?
- The villain.

821
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,873
He's selling us out.

822
01:09:00,893 --> 01:09:01,811
Quiet.

823
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:06,314
We're approaching the tollgate.

824
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,540
Halt!

825
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:20,158
Goods inspection!

826
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:22,743
Papers, please!

827
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:24,746
Oh, it's you, Bard.

828
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:26,037
Morning, Percy.

829
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:27,496
Anything to declare?

830
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:30,495
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

831
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:31,787
...and ready for home.

832
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:33,287
You and me both.

833
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,786
There we are.

834
01:09:39,036 --> 01:09:39,870
All in order.

835
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,974
Not so fast.

836
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:47,432
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm. "

837
01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:49,635
Only...

838
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:53,429
...they're not empty...

839
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:55,474
...are they, Bard?

840
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:56,683
If I recall correctly...

841
01:09:56,933 --> 01:09:59,225
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

842
01:10:00,183 --> 01:10:01,100
Not...

843
01:10:02,642 --> 01:10:03,851
...a fisherman.

844
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:05,602
That's none of your business.

845
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,269
Wrong.

846
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:10,940
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

847
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,736
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

848
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:16,239
These fish are illegal.

849
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:17,616
Empty the barrels...

850
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:20,077
- ... over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

851
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:24,124
Come on. Get a move on.

852
01:10:24,374 --> 01:10:26,169
Folk in this town are struggling.

853
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:27,921
Times are hard.

854
01:10:28,172 --> 01:10:29,131
Food is scarce.

855
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:30,507
That's not my problem.

856
01:10:30,841 --> 01:10:32,802
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

857
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:34,639
...back in the lake...

858
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,766
...when the rioting starts...

859
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,937
...will it be your problem then?

860
01:10:45,945 --> 01:10:47,026
Stop.

861
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,530
Ever the people's champion...

862
01:10:51,783 --> 01:10:53,868
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

863
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:54,911
...the common folk.

864
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:56,621
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

865
01:10:56,871 --> 01:10:57,830
...but it won't last.

866
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,168
Raise the gate!

867
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,172
The Master has his eye on you.

868
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:09,924
You'd do well to remember:

869
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:11,717
We know where you live.

870
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,636
It's a small town, Alfrid.

871
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,388
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

872
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:34,862
All this talk of civil unrest.

873
01:11:35,113 --> 01:11:36,781
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

874
01:11:40,283 --> 01:11:41,410
Gout playing up, sire?

875
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,619
It's the damp.

876
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:43,829
It's the only possible explanation.

877
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:45,705
Get me a brandy.

878
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,375
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

879
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:52,586
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

880
01:11:52,837 --> 01:11:54,379
It's not my fault they live in a place...

881
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:57,340
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

882
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:01,010
Jobs, shelter, food.

883
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:02,886
It's all they ever bleat about.

884
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:06,765
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

885
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,475
Then we must find these...

886
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:11,644
...troublemakers and arrest them.

887
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,813
My thoughts exactly, sire.

888
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,899
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

889
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,443
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

890
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:21,361
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

891
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:24,531
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

892
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:26,365
...forming committees...

893
01:12:27,324 --> 01:12:28,784
...launching inquiries.

894
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:31,495
Out with the old, in with the new?

895
01:12:32,204 --> 01:12:33,157
What?

896
01:12:33,405 --> 01:12:35,456
That's what they've been saying, sire.

897
01:12:35,707 --> 01:12:36,660
There is even talk...

898
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,126
...of an election.

899
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:39,593
An election? Heh.

900
01:12:39,844 --> 01:12:41,133
That's absurd.

901
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:43,379
I won't stand for it. Ha!

902
01:12:44,169 --> 01:12:46,415
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, sire.

903
01:12:48,286 --> 01:12:49,835
Shirkers.

904
01:12:50,086 --> 01:12:51,004
Ingrates.

905
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:52,297
Rabble-rousers.

906
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:55,258
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

907
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,177
Who would dare?

908
01:12:57,427 --> 01:12:58,431
Who-?

909
01:13:03,365 --> 01:13:04,700
Bard.

910
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:07,118
You mark my words:

911
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:08,993
<i>That trouble-making bargeman...</i>

912
01:13:09,243 --> 01:13:10,994
<i>...is behind all this.</i>

913
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,205
Get your hands off me.

914
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:28,373
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

915
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:31,832
The fish you can have for nothing.

916
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,977
Follow me.

917
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:46,251
Da!

918
01:13:46,759 --> 01:13:48,576
Our house, it's being watched.

919
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:26,839
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

920
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:27,727
...for the day.

921
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:31,617
Da! Where have you been?

922
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:34,872
Father! There you are! I was worried.

923
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:36,648
Here, Sigrid.

924
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,212
Bain, get them in.

925
01:14:46,076 --> 01:14:48,698
If you speak of this to anyone...

926
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,431
...I'll rip your arms off.

927
01:14:53,348 --> 01:14:54,827
Get off.

928
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:57,407
Up there.

929
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,074
Da...

930
01:15:06,328 --> 01:15:08,610
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

931
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:10,217
Will they bring us luck?

932
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:15,713
They may not be the best fit...

933
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:17,743
...but they'll keep you warm.

934
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,476
Thank you very much.

935
01:15:29,835 --> 01:15:31,948
A Dwarvish windlance.

936
01:15:32,244 --> 01:15:32,836
You look like...

937
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,400
...you've seen a ghost.

938
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:36,346
He has.

939
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:38,163
The last time we saw...

940
01:15:38,418 --> 01:15:40,108
...such a weapon...

941
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,054
...a city was on fire.

942
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,408
It was the day the dragon came.

943
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:51,186
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

944
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:52,581
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

945
01:15:55,075 --> 01:15:57,316
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

946
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:58,330
...rallied his bowmen...

947
01:15:58,585 --> 01:15:59,726
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

948
01:16:00,868 --> 01:16:02,644
But a dragon's hide is tough.

949
01:16:03,235 --> 01:16:05,433
Tougher than the strongest armor.

950
01:16:05,688 --> 01:16:08,900
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

951
01:16:09,154 --> 01:16:10,761
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

952
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:12,791
<i>And few of those...</i>

953
01:16:13,044 --> 01:16:14,861
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

954
01:16:20,273 --> 01:16:21,415
<i>The store was running low...</i>

955
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:22,515
<i>...when Girion...</i>

956
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:23,360
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

957
01:16:31,858 --> 01:16:35,325
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

958
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,777
...much would have been different.

959
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:43,907
You speak as if you were there.

960
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:47,417
All Dwarves know the tale.

961
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:49,996
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

962
01:16:50,249 --> 01:16:52,152
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

963
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:53,674
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

964
01:16:55,661 --> 01:16:57,564
That's a fairy story, lad.

965
01:16:57,817 --> 01:16:59,212
Nothing more.

966
01:17:00,227 --> 01:17:01,623
You took our money.

967
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:04,032
Where are the weapons?

968
01:17:06,653 --> 01:17:07,880
Wait here.

969
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,269
Tomorrow begins...

970
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:24,538
...the last days of autumn.

971
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:27,074
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

972
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:29,273
We must reach the mountain before then.

973
01:17:29,526 --> 01:17:30,879
And if we do not?

974
01:17:31,133 --> 01:17:33,501
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

975
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:35,065
Then this quest has been for nothing.

976
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:48,963
What is this?

977
01:17:49,549 --> 01:17:50,801
Pike hook.

978
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:52,208
Made from an old harpoon.

979
01:17:52,787 --> 01:17:54,971
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

980
01:17:55,223 --> 01:17:56,745
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

981
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:58,508
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

982
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:01,514
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

983
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:02,516
We paid...

984
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,483
...you for weapons.

985
01:18:04,734 --> 01:18:06,256
Iron-forged swords...

986
01:18:06,503 --> 01:18:07,517
...and axes!

987
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:08,730
It's a joke!

988
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:11,525
You won't find...

989
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:13,403
...better outside the city armory.

990
01:18:13,653 --> 01:18:15,031
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

991
01:18:15,281 --> 01:18:16,491
...under lock and key.

992
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:17,784
Thorin...

993
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,119
...why not take what's...

994
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:20,288
...on offer and go?

995
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:21,748
I've made do with less.

996
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:22,791
So have you.

997
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:27,297
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

998
01:18:27,547 --> 01:18:28,466
What did you say?

999
01:18:28,716 --> 01:18:29,967
There are spies watching this house...

1000
01:18:30,218 --> 01:18:32,888
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

1001
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:34,140
You must wait...

1002
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,308
...till nightfall.

1003
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:52,957
Thorin.

1004
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:07,100
Da?

1005
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,730
Don't let them leave.

1006
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:38,735
I thought you were an Orc.

1007
01:19:39,256 --> 01:19:40,937
If I were an orc ...

1008
01:19:41,338 --> 01:19:42,638
... you would be dead.

1009
01:19:43,893 --> 01:19:44,893
Tauriel...

1010
01:19:45,686 --> 01:19:47,731
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

1011
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:48,857
...on your own.

1012
01:19:49,107 --> 01:19:50,984
But I'm not on my own.

1013
01:19:51,818 --> 01:19:53,111
You knew I would come.

1014
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:56,574
The king is angry...

1015
01:19:56,824 --> 01:19:58,618
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

1016
01:19:58,868 --> 01:20:00,579
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

1017
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:03,081
You defied his orders.

1018
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:04,708
You betrayed his trust.

1019
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,913
Come back with me ...

1020
01:20:08,014 --> 01:20:09,914
... he will forgive you.

1021
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:11,045
But I will not.

1022
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:14,047
If I go back, I will not forgive myself.

1023
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,263
The king has never let Orc filth...

1024
01:20:16,513 --> 01:20:17,473
...roam our lands.

1025
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:21,019
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

1026
01:20:21,269 --> 01:20:22,562
It is not our fight.

1027
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:24,314
It is our fight.

1028
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:26,566
It will not end here.

1029
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:29,695
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1030
01:20:29,945 --> 01:20:32,698
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

1031
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:35,035
We will hide within our walls...

1032
01:20:35,285 --> 01:20:37,621
...live our lives away from the light...

1033
01:20:37,871 --> 01:20:39,414
...and let darkness descend.

1034
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,169
Are we not part of this world?

1035
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:45,546
Tell me, mellon.
(Friend)

1036
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:49,301
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

1037
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,893
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1038
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,479
There was a tapestry!

1039
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,316
An old one! Where's it gone?

1040
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,234
What tapestry you talking about?

1041
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,688
This one.

1042
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,263
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

1043
01:21:07,514 --> 01:21:08,349
...out of nowhere.

1044
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:10,770
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1045
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:12,649
I've never seen the like.

1046
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,988
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1047
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,700
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

1048
01:21:17,075 --> 01:21:18,870
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1049
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:29,725
Prophecy.

1050
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:34,563
Prophecy.

1051
01:21:34,813 --> 01:21:36,099
The old tales will come true.

1052
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:38,600
Vast halls of treasure!

1053
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,019
Can it really be true?

1054
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:42,979
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1055
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:45,857
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

1056
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:48,358
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

1057
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,194
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

1058
01:21:53,404 --> 01:21:55,322
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1059
01:21:56,656 --> 01:21:58,533
And the bell shall ring in gladness...

1060
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,367
<i>...At the Mountain...</i>

1061
01:21:59,617 --> 01:22:01,118
<i>...King's return</i>

1062
01:22:01,535 --> 01:22:04,079
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1063
01:22:04,788 --> 01:22:07,415
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

1064
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:11,376
Da, I tried to stop them. but...

1065
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,044
How long have they been gone?

1066
01:22:17,173 --> 01:22:18,841
Can you see anything?
Shh! Keep it down.

1067
01:22:19,091 --> 01:22:22,052
As soon as we have the
weapons, we make straight for the mountain.

1068
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:23,483
go, go, go!

1069
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,074
Go, Nori.

1070
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,208
Next.

1071
01:22:42,493 --> 01:22:43,674
You all right?

1072
01:22:43,928 --> 01:22:45,222
I can manage.

1073
01:22:45,972 --> 01:22:47,558
Let's just get out of here.

1074
01:23:01,581 --> 01:23:02,457
Run!

1075
01:23:02,707 --> 01:23:03,834
Quickly! Move now!

1076
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:19,185
Get off me! Get off!

1077
01:23:19,435 --> 01:23:21,020
Move them along here.

1078
01:23:22,146 --> 01:23:23,148
Move on!

1079
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:33,243
What is the meaning of this?

1080
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:36,581
- We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
- Ah.

1081
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:39,125
Enemies of the state, eh?

1082
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:40,168
A desperate bunch of...

1083
01:23:40,418 --> 01:23:42,588
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1084
01:23:42,838 --> 01:23:44,047
Hold your tongue!

1085
01:23:46,675 --> 01:23:48,761
You do not know to whom you speak.

1086
01:23:49,345 --> 01:23:51,222
This is no common criminal.

1087
01:23:51,514 --> 01:23:52,849
This is Thorin...

1088
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:56,228
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1089
01:23:59,398 --> 01:24:01,484
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1090
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:07,366
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1091
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,083
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1092
01:24:16,376 --> 01:24:18,420
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1093
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:20,089
...filled with silks and fine gems.

1094
01:24:21,466 --> 01:24:23,676
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1095
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,389
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

1096
01:24:29,224 --> 01:24:29,808
I would...

1097
01:24:30,059 --> 01:24:31,269
...see those days return.

1098
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:34,022
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

1099
01:24:34,272 --> 01:24:35,232
...and send wealth and riches...

1100
01:24:35,482 --> 01:24:37,944
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

1101
01:24:40,947 --> 01:24:41,530
Death!

1102
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,742
That is what you will...

1103
01:24:43,992 --> 01:24:45,285
...bring upon us!

1104
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:47,829
Dragon fire and ruin.

1105
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,210
If you waken that beast...

1106
01:24:52,835 --> 01:24:54,420
...it will destroy us all.

1107
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:56,507
You can listen to this naysayer...

1108
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:58,384
...but I promise you this:

1109
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:02,222
If we succeed...

1110
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,101
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

1111
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:13,567
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1112
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,028
...10 times over!

1113
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:18,242
All of you!

1114
01:25:18,575 --> 01:25:19,695
Listen to me!

1115
01:25:19,943 --> 01:25:20,986
You must listen!

1116
01:25:21,236 --> 01:25:22,945
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1117
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,698
Have you forgotten those...

1118
01:25:25,948 --> 01:25:27,992
...who died in the firestorm?!

1119
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:31,202
And for what purpose?

1120
01:25:32,704 --> 01:25:34,496
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1121
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:37,374
...so riven by greed, he could not...

1122
01:25:37,624 --> 01:25:39,126
...see beyond his own desire!

1123
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:42,003
Now, now!

1124
01:25:42,295 --> 01:25:44,255
We must not, any of us...

1125
01:25:44,505 --> 01:25:46,881
...be too quick to lay blame.

1126
01:25:48,008 --> 01:25:48,592
Let us...

1127
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:50,561
...not forget that it was...

1128
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,597
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

1129
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,532
...your ancestor...

1130
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:57,283
...who failed to kill the beast!

1131
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:01,776
It's true, sire.

1132
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:03,238
We all know the story.

1133
01:26:04,828 --> 01:26:06,496
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1134
01:26:06,747 --> 01:26:09,333
Each one missing its mark.

1135
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,340
You have no right.

1136
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,968
No right to enter that mountain.

1137
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,805
I have the only right.

1138
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,520
I speak to the Master...

1139
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,230
...of the Men of the Lake.

1140
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:36,775
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1141
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:38,692
Will you...

1142
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:42,830
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

1143
01:26:47,846 --> 01:26:49,306
What say you?

1144
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:56,213
I say unto you...

1145
01:26:57,457 --> 01:26:58,474
Welcome!

1146
01:26:59,025 --> 01:26:59,687
Welcome!

1147
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,013
And thrice...

1148
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:02,275
...welcome...

1149
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:04,155
...King Under the Mountain!

1150
01:27:16,253 --> 01:27:18,756
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1151
01:27:19,006 --> 01:27:21,634
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1152
01:27:21,885 --> 01:27:22,845
If we're to find the door before...

1153
01:27:23,095 --> 01:27:25,639
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1154
01:27:30,061 --> 01:27:30,812
Not you.

1155
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,856
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1156
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,942
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1157
01:27:37,192 --> 01:27:38,109
Not now.

1158
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:45,490
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1159
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:47,826
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1160
01:27:48,076 --> 01:27:50,327
Kili, stay here.

1161
01:27:50,953 --> 01:27:52,078
Rest.

1162
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:54,327
Join us when you're healed.

1163
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:01,243
I'll stay with the lad.

1164
01:28:01,492 --> 01:28:03,284
My duty lies with the wounded.

1165
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:04,495
Uncle.

1166
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:07,087
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1167
01:28:07,338 --> 01:28:08,591
Tales you told us.

1168
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:09,758
You cannot take that away...

1169
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:11,011
- ... from him!
- Fili.

1170
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:12,305
I will carry him if I must!

1171
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:14,975
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1172
01:28:15,726 --> 01:28:19,023
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one .

1173
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:22,111
Not even my own kin.

1174
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:26,618
Fili, don't be a fool.

1175
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:28,621
You belong with the company.

1176
01:28:28,872 --> 01:28:30,499
I belong with my brother.

1177
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:45,856
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1178
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:49,987
Go now with our goodwill...

1179
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:51,615
...and good wishes.

1180
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,746
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

1181
01:28:55,996 --> 01:28:57,120
...to all!

1182
01:29:01,535 --> 01:29:02,576
Good bye.

1183
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:09,662
Out of the way!

1184
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,249
No! No!

1185
01:29:17,887 --> 01:29:19,891
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1186
01:29:20,558 --> 01:29:21,722
Kili? Kili!

1187
01:29:25,463 --> 01:29:26,477
No.

1188
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,352
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1189
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:29,185
No, no...

1190
01:29:29,435 --> 01:29:30,240
...no! Please!

1191
01:29:30,536 --> 01:29:33,026
No one will help us. KiIt's sick.

1192
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:36,727
He's very sick.

1193
01:30:17,077 --> 01:30:18,705
What is this place?

1194
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,249
It was once the city of Dale.

1195
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:23,920
Now it is a ruin.

1196
01:30:24,672 --> 01:30:26,884
The desolation of Smaug.

1197
01:30:27,134 --> 01:30:29,054
The sun will soon reach midday.

1198
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:31,557
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1199
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:32,630
This way.

1200
01:30:32,876 --> 01:30:34,921
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1201
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:36,592
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1202
01:30:36,842 --> 01:30:38,471
- On no account were we to-
- Do you see him?

1203
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:39,806
We have no time...

1204
01:30:40,058 --> 01:30:41,435
...to wait upon the Wizard.

1205
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:43,481
We're on our own. Come!

1206
01:31:00,641 --> 01:31:02,394
Dol Guldur.

1207
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:04,812
The Hill of Sorcery.

1208
01:31:05,062 --> 01:31:07,314
It looks completely abandoned.

1209
01:31:07,564 --> 01:31:09,023
As it is meant to.

1210
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:11,484
A spell of concealment...

1211
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:14,820
...lies over this place, which means...

1212
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:18,155
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

1213
01:31:20,116 --> 01:31:23,451
He has not regained his full strength.

1214
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,246
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1215
01:31:27,496 --> 01:31:29,705
Tell her we must force his hand.

1216
01:31:29,956 --> 01:31:30,998
What do you mean?

1217
01:31:31,249 --> 01:31:32,834
I'm going in alone.

1218
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,585
On no account come after me.

1219
01:31:41,715 --> 01:31:43,007
Do I have your word?

1220
01:31:43,258 --> 01:31:45,259
Yes, yes, yes!

1221
01:31:56,974 --> 01:31:58,435
Wait, Gandalf!

1222
01:31:59,602 --> 01:32:01,522
What if it's a trap?!

1223
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,362
Turn around and do not come back.

1224
01:32:11,244 --> 01:32:14,081
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1225
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:51,838
The evil that is hidden here ...

1226
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:55,751
I command it come forth!

1227
01:32:56,052 --> 01:32:59,453
I command it reveal itself!

1228
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:20,263
The evil that is hidden here,
I command it come forth!

1229
01:33:20,717 --> 01:33:22,765
The Wizard has come.

1230
01:33:23,106 --> 01:33:25,497
He is lifting the spell ...

1231
01:33:25,638 --> 01:33:27,399
He will find us!

1232
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:30,431
Yes ... he will.

1233
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:37,777
Anything?

1234
01:33:38,025 --> 01:33:39,527
Nothing!

1235
01:33:43,323 --> 01:33:44,659
If the map is true...

1236
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:47,955
...then the hidden door
lies directly above us.

1237
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:54,129
Up here!

1238
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:04,976
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

1239
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:37,934
This must be it.

1240
01:34:40,145 --> 01:34:41,648
The hidden door.

1241
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:47,655
Let all those who doubted us...

1242
01:34:48,823 --> 01:34:50,158
...rue this day!

1243
01:34:55,874 --> 01:34:58,335
Right, then. We have a key.

1244
01:35:00,046 --> 01:35:01,547
Which means that somewhere...

1245
01:35:02,674 --> 01:35:04,051
...there is a key-hole.

1246
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,633
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1247
01:35:09,632 --> 01:35:10,454
...will shine upon...

1248
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,122
...the key-hole. "

1249
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,365
Nori.

1250
01:35:28,994 --> 01:35:30,953
We're losing the light. Come on.

1251
01:35:37,456 --> 01:35:40,041
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

1252
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:41,084
I can't find it.

1253
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:43,877
It's not here!

1254
01:35:44,127 --> 01:35:45,211
It's not here!

1255
01:35:46,962 --> 01:35:48,046
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1256
01:35:50,047 --> 01:35:50,842
Come on!

1257
01:35:53,017 --> 01:35:53,767
Break!

1258
01:35:54,018 --> 01:35:55,023
It has to break.

1259
01:35:55,986 --> 01:35:57,306
It's no good.

1260
01:35:57,554 --> 01:36:00,061
The door's sealed. Can't be opened by force.

1261
01:36:01,692 --> 01:36:02,817
There's a powerful magic on it.

1262
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,567
No!

1263
01:36:18,908 --> 01:36:21,204
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1264
01:36:23,082 --> 01:36:24,668
...will shine upon the key-hole. "

1265
01:36:29,092 --> 01:36:30,679
That is what it says.

1266
01:36:35,187 --> 01:36:36,606
What did we miss?

1267
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,031
What did we miss?

1268
01:36:43,075 --> 01:36:44,034
Balin?

1269
01:36:44,658 --> 01:36:46,368
We've lost the light.

1270
01:36:48,912 --> 01:36:50,746
There's no more to be done.

1271
01:36:52,289 --> 01:36:52,873
We had but...

1272
01:36:53,123 --> 01:36:54,373
...one chance.

1273
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,043
Come away, lads.

1274
01:36:58,293 --> 01:37:00,081
It's over.

1275
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:03,293
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1276
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:07,215
Where are they going?

1277
01:37:09,004 --> 01:37:10,882
You can't give up now!

1278
01:37:25,824 --> 01:37:26,991
Thorin.

1279
01:37:29,035 --> 01:37:30,704
You can't give up now.

1280
01:37:42,259 --> 01:37:44,637
"Stand by the gray stone...

1281
01:37:46,514 --> 01:37:48,599
...when the thrush knocks. "

1282
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:50,726
The setting sun.

1283
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:54,648
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine... "

1284
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:57,609
The last light.

1285
01:38:00,154 --> 01:38:01,531
Last light.

1286
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,490
The last light!

1287
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:50,837
The key-hole!

1288
01:38:51,338 --> 01:38:51,922
Come back!

1289
01:38:52,714 --> 01:38:54,049
Come back!

1290
01:38:54,299 --> 01:38:56,468
It's the light of the moon! The last...

1291
01:38:56,718 --> 01:38:59,805
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1292
01:39:01,724 --> 01:39:04,101
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the... ?

1293
01:39:04,353 --> 01:39:06,063
It was here.

1294
01:39:06,313 --> 01:39:08,106
Come on, it was... It was here.

1295
01:39:08,815 --> 01:39:09,650
It was just...

1296
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:09,134
Erebor.

1297
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:10,970
Thorin.

1298
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:26,237
I know these walls.

1299
01:40:29,991 --> 01:40:31,534
These halls.

1300
01:40:34,538 --> 01:40:35,914
This stone.

1301
01:40:39,836 --> 01:40:40,462
You remember it...

1302
01:40:40,712 --> 01:40:41,838
...Balin.

1303
01:40:45,467 --> 01:40:47,970
Chambers filled with golden light.

1304
01:40:49,847 --> 01:40:51,348
I remember.

1305
01:41:04,614 --> 01:41:05,963
"Herein lies...

1306
01:41:06,217 --> 01:41:08,101
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

1307
01:41:08,352 --> 01:41:09,511
...Durin's Folk. "

1308
01:41:11,455 --> 01:41:14,542
" May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

1309
01:41:14,793 --> 01:41:18,384
...Dwarves in defense of this home. "

1310
01:41:20,098 --> 01:41:21,934
The Throne of the King.

1311
01:41:22,602 --> 01:41:23,933
Ah.

1312
01:41:25,639 --> 01:41:28,987
And what's that above it?

1313
01:41:32,546 --> 01:41:34,293
The Arkenstone.

1314
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,001
Arkenstone.

1315
01:41:40,923 --> 01:41:42,258
And what's that?

1316
01:41:42,591 --> 01:41:45,554
That, Master Burglar...

1317
01:41:46,596 --> 01:41:48,639
...is why you are here.

1318
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:09,239
Can you not do something?

1319
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,709
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1320
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,344
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1321
01:42:14,596 --> 01:42:17,383
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1322
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,641
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1323
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:21,222
Pigs?

1324
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:22,593
Weed.

1325
01:42:23,339 --> 01:42:24,474
Right.

1326
01:42:25,442 --> 01:42:26,609
Don't move.

1327
01:42:29,402 --> 01:42:32,946
You want me to find a jewel?

1328
01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:36,198
A large, white jewel.

1329
01:42:36,656 --> 01:42:37,783
Yes.

1330
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,748
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1331
01:42:42,081 --> 01:42:45,295
There is only one Arkenstone...

1332
01:42:46,046 --> 01:42:48,132
...and you'll know it when you see it.

1333
01:42:49,259 --> 01:42:50,385
Right.

1334
01:42:54,142 --> 01:42:54,726
In truth...

1335
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,852
...lad...

1336
01:42:56,645 --> 01:42:58,666
...I do not know...

1337
01:42:58,914 --> 01:43:01,000
...what you will find down there.

1338
01:43:03,128 --> 01:43:06,257
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1339
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:07,468
No, Balin.

1340
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,764
I promised I would do this...

1341
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:13,142
...and I think I must try.

1342
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:19,567
It never ceases to amaze me.

1343
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:20,611
What's that?

1344
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:22,572
The courage of Hobbits.

1345
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:26,202
Go now...

1346
01:43:26,702 --> 01:43:30,708
...with as much luck as you can muster.

1347
01:43:37,927 --> 01:43:39,217
Oh, Bilbo?

1348
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:43,930
If there is, in fact...

1349
01:43:45,435 --> 01:43:46,283
...a live dragon...

1350
01:43:46,537 --> 01:43:47,575
...down there...

1351
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:52,026
...don't waken it.

1352
01:44:34,938 --> 01:44:38,439
The evil that is hidden here ...

1353
01:44:39,785 --> 01:44:43,441
I command it come forth!

1354
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:48,443
I command it reveal itself!

1355
01:45:00,607 --> 01:45:04,618
You have come too late, Wizard!

1356
01:45:05,749 --> 01:45:07,820
It is done.

1357
01:45:09,623 --> 01:45:11,084
Where is your master?

1358
01:45:12,877 --> 01:45:13,961
Where is he?!

1359
01:45:14,797 --> 01:45:17,591
He is everwhere ...

1360
01:45:18,022 --> 01:45:20,693
We are legion!

1361
01:45:34,677 --> 01:45:36,798
It is over.

1362
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,401
Run him down!

1363
01:46:01,771 --> 01:46:04,448
There is no light, Wizard ...

1364
01:46:05,549 --> 01:46:09,000
... that can defeat darkness.

1365
01:47:27,461 --> 01:47:30,254
Sauron!

1366
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:54,009
Hello?

1367
01:48:13,047 --> 01:48:14,460
He's not at home.

1368
01:48:15,417 --> 01:48:17,085
Not at home. Ahem.

1369
01:48:17,919 --> 01:48:19,005
Good.

1370
01:48:20,798 --> 01:48:22,550
Good, good... good.

1371
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:17,323
What's that?

1372
01:49:21,411 --> 01:49:23,372
Shush. Shush.

1373
01:49:24,706 --> 01:49:26,000
Arkenstone.

1374
01:49:27,043 --> 01:49:28,419
Arkenstone.

1375
01:49:29,253 --> 01:49:31,297
A large, white jewel.

1376
01:49:33,509 --> 01:49:34,885
Very helpful.

1377
01:52:00,515 --> 01:52:01,887
Well...

1378
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:04,845
...thief.

1379
01:52:06,849 --> 01:52:10,480
I smell you.

1380
01:52:10,857 --> 01:52:14,071
I hear your breath.

1381
01:52:15,365 --> 01:52:16,985
I feel...

1382
01:52:17,234 --> 01:52:18,153
...your air.

1383
01:52:22,075 --> 01:52:24,621
Where are you?

1384
01:52:26,082 --> 01:52:27,168
Where are you?

1385
01:52:47,326 --> 01:52:48,328
Come, now...

1386
01:52:49,078 --> 01:52:51,206
...don't be shy.

1387
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:53,669
Step into the light.

1388
01:52:57,885 --> 01:52:58,469
<i>Hmm.</i>

1389
01:53:00,598 --> 01:53:03,811
There is something about you.

1390
01:53:07,192 --> 01:53:07,979
Something you...

1391
01:53:08,228 --> 01:53:09,062
...carry.

1392
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:13,105
Something made of gold.

1393
01:53:13,856 --> 01:53:16,775
But far more...

1394
01:53:17,025 --> 01:53:18,817
...precious.

1395
01:53:19,068 --> 01:53:21,402
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1396
01:53:24,196 --> 01:53:25,364
There you are...

1397
01:53:25,614 --> 01:53:27,164
...Thief in the...

1398
01:53:27,415 --> 01:53:29,251
...Shadows.

1399
01:53:31,088 --> 01:53:33,673
I did not come to steal from you...

1400
01:53:33,923 --> 01:53:34,710
...Oh Smaug...

1401
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:38,212
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1402
01:53:38,462 --> 01:53:40,096
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

1403
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:41,264
To see...

1404
01:53:41,514 --> 01:53:44,474
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1405
01:53:45,182 --> 01:53:46,933
I did not believe them.

1406
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:59,689
And do you now?!

1407
01:54:01,022 --> 01:54:02,282
Truly...

1408
01:54:03,625 --> 01:54:05,799
...the tales and songs...

1409
01:54:06,928 --> 01:54:09,618
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

1410
01:54:09,866 --> 01:54:12,850
...Oh Smaug the Stupendous.

1411
01:54:13,102 --> 01:54:15,974
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1412
01:54:16,473 --> 01:54:17,426
No, no.

1413
01:54:17,674 --> 01:54:19,176
No, indeed.

1414
01:54:21,431 --> 01:54:24,686
You seem familiar with my name...

1415
01:54:24,936 --> 01:54:27,816
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

1416
01:54:28,943 --> 01:54:30,529
Who are you...

1417
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,285
...and where do you come from?

1418
01:54:33,535 --> 01:54:35,872
may I ask?

1419
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:47,100
I come from under the hill.

1420
01:54:47,476 --> 01:54:48,851
Underhill?

1421
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,436
And under hills...

1422
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,686
...and over hills my path has led.

1423
01:54:56,562 --> 01:54:57,395
And... And...

1424
01:54:58,187 --> 01:55:00,521
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1425
01:55:00,772 --> 01:55:02,480
Impressive.

1426
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:04,773
What else do you claim to be?

1427
01:55:05,731 --> 01:55:06,521
I am...

1428
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:11,236
Luck... Luck-wearer.

1429
01:55:12,705 --> 01:55:13,861
Riddle... Riddle-maker.

1430
01:55:14,108 --> 01:55:15,794
Lovely titles!

1431
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:17,663
Go on.

1432
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:18,996
Barrel-rider.

1433
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:22,670
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1434
01:55:24,132 --> 01:55:24,841
And what about...

1435
01:55:25,093 --> 01:55:28,057
...your little  friends?

1436
01:55:29,184 --> 01:55:30,437
Where are they hiding?

1437
01:55:33,318 --> 01:55:34,863
Dw... Dwarves?

1438
01:55:35,698 --> 01:55:36,783
No.

1439
01:55:37,449 --> 01:55:38,992
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1440
01:55:39,243 --> 01:55:40,326
You've got that all wrong.

1441
01:55:40,576 --> 01:55:44,329
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1442
01:55:44,912 --> 01:55:46,163
They sent you in here...

1443
01:55:46,414 --> 01:55:48,373
...to do their dirty work while they...

1444
01:55:48,623 --> 01:55:50,582
...skulk about outside.

1445
01:55:51,834 --> 01:55:53,000
Truly...

1446
01:55:53,793 --> 01:55:54,961
...you are mistaken...

1447
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:58,212
...Oh Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

1448
01:55:58,462 --> 01:56:01,840
You have nice manners...

1449
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,049
...for a thief and...

1450
01:56:04,299 --> 01:56:05,217
...a liar!

1451
01:56:06,593 --> 01:56:09,972
I know the smell and taste of dwarf .

1452
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:11,598
No one better!

1453
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:14,726
It is the gold!

1454
01:56:14,977 --> 01:56:15,727
They are drawn...

1455
01:56:15,978 --> 01:56:17,020
...to treasure like...

1456
01:56:17,271 --> 01:56:18,814
...flies to dead flesh.

1457
01:56:22,359 --> 01:56:23,569
Did you think I did not know...

1458
01:56:24,069 --> 01:56:25,529
...this day would come?!

1459
01:56:27,406 --> 01:56:28,699
That a pack of...

1460
01:56:28,949 --> 01:56:30,241
...canting Dwarves...

1461
01:56:30,491 --> 01:56:32,827
...would come crawling back...

1462
01:56:33,369 --> 01:56:34,620
...to the mountain?!

1463
01:56:39,167 --> 01:56:40,376
Was that an earthquake?

1464
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:42,753
That, my lad...

1465
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:47,425
...was a dragon.

1466
01:56:55,725 --> 01:56:56,319
Da?

1467
01:56:56,827 --> 01:56:58,455
It's coming from the mountain.

1468
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:03,745
You should leave us.

1469
01:57:04,035 --> 01:57:04,654
Take your children.

1470
01:57:04,903 --> 01:57:05,792
Get out of here.

1471
01:57:06,471 --> 01:57:07,760
And go where?

1472
01:57:08,841 --> 01:57:10,218
There is nowhere to go.

1473
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:13,722
Are we going to die, Da?

1474
01:57:15,766 --> 01:57:16,935
No, darling.

1475
01:57:17,185 --> 01:57:17,769
The dragon.

1476
01:57:18,019 --> 01:57:19,479
It's going to kill us.

1477
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:31,952
Not if I kill it first.

1478
01:57:33,412 --> 01:57:37,083
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1479
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:39,002
I took his throne.

1480
01:57:39,378 --> 01:57:40,295
I ate his...

1481
01:57:40,545 --> 01:57:43,341
...people like a wolf among sheep.

1482
01:57:47,095 --> 01:57:48,264
I kill where...

1483
01:57:48,514 --> 01:57:50,140
...I wish, when...

1484
01:57:50,391 --> 01:57:51,842
...I Wish.

1485
01:57:52,092 --> 01:57:55,390
My armor is iron.

1486
01:58:04,574 --> 01:58:06,986
No blade can pierce me.

1487
01:58:10,146 --> 01:58:11,399
All right.

1488
01:58:11,649 --> 01:58:13,986
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me'?

1489
01:58:14,236 --> 01:58:15,863
Because you did not need to know.

1490
01:58:23,458 --> 01:58:25,002
Listen to me carefully.

1491
01:58:25,378 --> 01:58:27,506
I need you to distract the guards.

1492
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:28,674
Once I'm at the top of...

1493
01:58:28,924 --> 01:58:31,219
...the tower, I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1494
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:32,054
There he is!

1495
01:58:32,305 --> 01:58:32,891
Bard!

1496
01:58:33,144 --> 01:58:35,325
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1497
01:58:35,576 --> 01:58:36,159
Stop him!

1498
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:44,449
Stop him!

1499
01:58:45,321 --> 01:58:45,906
Stop!

1500
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:51,760
Bain! Bain.

1501
01:58:52,593 --> 01:58:56,258
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1502
01:58:56,508 --> 01:58:58,216
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1503
01:59:02,174 --> 01:59:02,799
Braga.

1504
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:03,675
You're under arrest.

1505
01:59:03,925 --> 01:59:06,803
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1506
01:59:36,795 --> 01:59:38,213
Where's he gone?

1507
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:50,559
What about Bilbo?

1508
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:51,811
Give him more time.

1509
01:59:52,061 --> 01:59:54,230
Time to do what? To be killed?

1510
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:57,942
You're afraid.

1511
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:01,904
Yes, I'm afraid.

1512
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,408
I fear for you.

1513
02:00:05,784 --> 02:00:07,953
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1514
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,162
A sickness which drove...

1515
02:00:09,413 --> 02:00:10,705
...your grandfather mad.

1516
02:00:10,956 --> 02:00:12,541
I am not my grandfather.

1517
02:00:12,791 --> 02:00:14,543
You're not yourself.

1518
02:00:15,419 --> 02:00:17,547
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

1519
02:00:17,797 --> 02:00:18,381
I will not risk...

1520
02:00:18,631 --> 02:00:22,427
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

1521
02:00:24,303 --> 02:00:25,729
Bilbo.

1522
02:00:26,106 --> 02:00:28,024
His name is Bilbo.

1523
02:00:31,779 --> 02:00:33,586
It's Oakenshield...

1524
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,838
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1525
02:00:39,087 --> 02:00:41,207
He sent you in here...

1526
02:00:41,457 --> 02:00:44,208
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1527
02:00:44,459 --> 02:00:45,080
No. No...

1528
02:00:45,328 --> 02:00:48,212
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1529
02:00:48,464 --> 02:00:49,590
Don't bother denying it.

1530
02:00:50,967 --> 02:00:52,802
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

1531
02:00:55,473 --> 02:00:56,974
But it matters not.

1532
02:00:58,143 --> 02:01:00,520
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1533
02:01:02,523 --> 02:01:04,276
The darkness is coming.

1534
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:09,115
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

1535
02:01:40,225 --> 02:01:44,126
The Dwarf-scum are around here.

1536
02:01:44,237 --> 02:01:47,438
I smell them.

1537
02:01:51,711 --> 02:01:53,673
You are being used, Thief...

1538
02:01:53,923 --> 02:01:56,051
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

1539
02:01:56,301 --> 02:01:58,887
...ever a means to an end.

1540
02:01:59,722 --> 02:02:00,306
The coward...

1541
02:02:00,557 --> 02:02:03,143
...Oakenshield has weighed...

1542
02:02:03,394 --> 02:02:04,979
...the value of your life...

1543
02:02:05,229 --> 02:02:07,399
...and found it worth nothing.

1544
02:02:08,024 --> 02:02:09,182
No.

1545
02:02:09,927 --> 02:02:10,597
No.

1546
02:02:11,896 --> 02:02:12,850
No, you're lying.

1547
02:02:13,098 --> 02:02:14,272
What did he promise you?

1548
02:02:14,732 --> 02:02:16,829
A share of the treasure?

1549
02:02:17,835 --> 02:02:18,955
As if it was his...

1550
02:02:19,204 --> 02:02:20,289
...to give.

1551
02:02:21,123 --> 02:02:22,875
I will not part with...

1552
02:02:23,126 --> 02:02:24,127
...a single coin.

1553
02:02:24,794 --> 02:02:27,338
Not one piece of it.

1554
02:02:31,218 --> 02:02:32,101
My teeth...

1555
02:02:32,353 --> 02:02:33,511
...are swords.

1556
02:02:34,422 --> 02:02:37,728
My claws are spears.

1557
02:02:39,862 --> 02:02:41,014
My Wings...

1558
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:44,175
...are a hurricane.

1559
02:02:49,809 --> 02:02:51,645
So it is true.

1560
02:02:52,021 --> 02:02:54,149
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1561
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:55,318
What did you say?

1562
02:02:56,152 --> 02:03:00,033
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1563
02:03:00,283 --> 02:03:01,493
...the Tyrannical.

1564
02:03:02,077 --> 02:03:03,163
Truly.

1565
02:03:03,413 --> 02:03:05,374
You have no equal on this earth.

1566
02:03:09,797 --> 02:03:10,477
I am...

1567
02:03:10,731 --> 02:03:13,977
...almost tempted to let you take it.

1568
02:03:14,435 --> 02:03:16,423
If only to see Oakenshield...

1569
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:17,643
...suffer.

1570
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:19,824
Watch it...

1571
02:03:20,075 --> 02:03:21,577
...destroy him.

1572
02:03:22,078 --> 02:03:25,185
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1573
02:03:25,848 --> 02:03:28,233
...and drive him mad.

1574
02:03:31,455 --> 02:03:33,041
But I think not.

1575
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:35,865
I think our little game ends here.

1576
02:03:36,695 --> 02:03:37,947
So tell me...

1577
02:03:38,197 --> 02:03:39,082
...thief...

1578
02:03:39,966 --> 02:03:42,094
...how do you choose to die?

1579
02:04:25,551 --> 02:04:26,385
Nah.

1580
02:04:54,752 --> 02:04:56,796
Da? Is that you, Da?

1581
02:05:29,927 --> 02:05:31,261
- Aah!
- Stay down!

1582
02:06:32,065 --> 02:06:32,732
Get down!

1583
02:06:45,086 --> 02:06:47,007
Oakenshield has gone!

1584
02:06:48,008 --> 02:06:49,179
Fall back!

1585
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:51,081
Regroup at the bridge!

1586
02:07:09,293 --> 02:07:10,462
You killed them all.

1587
02:07:10,712 --> 02:07:11,797
There are others.

1588
02:07:12,214 --> 02:07:13,298
Tauriel.

1589
02:07:13,797 --> 02:07:14,880
Come.

1590
02:07:18,921 --> 02:07:19,879
We're losing him.

1591
02:07:23,794 --> 02:07:25,004
Tauriel.

1592
02:07:48,954 --> 02:07:49,955
Athens.

1593
02:07:52,792 --> 02:07:54,211
Athens.

1594
02:07:55,212 --> 02:07:56,297
What are you doing?

1595
02:07:59,301 --> 02:08:01,011
I'm going to save him.

1596
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:23,083
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1597
02:08:23,334 --> 02:08:26,297
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

1598
02:08:29,259 --> 02:08:30,844
Did you find it?

1599
02:08:36,351 --> 02:08:37,437
We have to get out.

1600
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:42,150
Thorin.

1601
02:08:45,856 --> 02:08:46,982
Thorin.

1602
02:09:17,436 --> 02:09:19,563
You will burn!

1603
02:09:20,732 --> 02:09:21,566
- Run!
- Ah!

1604
02:09:28,699 --> 02:09:29,785
Come on, Bilbo!

1605
02:09:42,675 --> 02:09:43,718
Come on.

1606
02:10:00,864 --> 02:10:02,074
Hold him down.

1607
02:10:18,469 --> 02:10:20,221
Unh! Tilda.

1608
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:14,287
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1609
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:23,590
We've given him the slip.

1610
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:24,841
No.

1611
02:11:25,301 --> 02:11:27,512
He's too cunning for that.

1612
02:11:29,264 --> 02:11:30,391
So where to now?

1613
02:11:30,975 --> 02:11:32,311
The western guardroom.

1614
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:34,564
There may be a way out.

1615
02:11:34,814 --> 02:11:36,817
It's too high. There's no chance...

1616
02:11:37,068 --> 02:11:39,154
- ... that way.
- It's our only chance.

1617
02:11:40,489 --> 02:11:41,950
We have to try.

1618
02:11:58,515 --> 02:11:59,683
Come on.

1619
02:12:47,196 --> 02:12:50,950
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1620
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:53,912
That was a privilege to witness.

1621
02:12:56,415 --> 02:12:57,578
Tauriel.

1622
02:13:01,855 --> 02:13:03,064
Lie still.

1623
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:12,368
You cannot be her.

1624
02:13:15,872 --> 02:13:18,042
She is far away.

1625
02:13:22,213 --> 02:13:23,631
She is far...

1626
02:13:23,883 --> 02:13:25,468
...far away from me.

1627
02:13:27,095 --> 02:13:29,222
She walks...

1628
02:13:29,473 --> 02:13:32,143
...in starlight in another world.

1629
02:13:37,484 --> 02:13:39,445
It was just a dream.

1630
02:13:51,126 --> 02:13:53,338
Do you think she could've loved me?

1631
02:14:00,681 --> 02:14:01,307
Stay close.

1632
02:14:12,071 --> 02:14:12,819
That's it, then.

1633
02:14:14,107 --> 02:14:15,946
There's no way out.

1634
02:14:22,383 --> 02:14:24,587
The last of our kin.

1635
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:30,388
They must have come here...

1636
02:14:31,059 --> 02:14:32,108
...hoping...

1637
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:33,485
...beyond hope.

1638
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:45,577
We could try to reach the mines.

1639
02:14:46,411 --> 02:14:48,655
We might last a few days.

1640
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:51,859
No.

1641
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:57,032
I will not die like this.

1642
02:14:58,410 --> 02:14:59,579
Cowering.

1643
02:15:00,456 --> 02:15:02,250
Clawing for breath.

1644
02:15:07,176 --> 02:15:08,303
We make for the forges.

1645
02:15:08,553 --> 02:15:10,515
He'll see us, sure as death.

1646
02:15:10,765 --> 02:15:12,018
Not if we split up.

1647
02:15:12,268 --> 02:15:12,852
Thorin...

1648
02:15:13,479 --> 02:15:14,981
...we'll never make it.

1649
02:15:15,231 --> 02:15:16,735
Some of us might.

1650
02:15:17,152 --> 02:15:19,364
Lead him to the forges.

1651
02:15:20,157 --> 02:15:22,161
We kill the dragon.

1652
02:15:23,872 --> 02:15:26,126
If this is to end in fire...

1653
02:15:26,585 --> 02:15:29,006
...then we will all burn together.

1654
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:31,469
This way.

1655
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:36,517
Flee.

1656
02:15:37,638 --> 02:15:38,547
Flee.

1657
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:41,520
Run for your lives.

1658
02:15:42,277 --> 02:15:43,153
There is...

1659
02:15:43,779 --> 02:15:45,967
...nowhere to hide.

1660
02:15:46,215 --> 02:15:47,193
Behind you!

1661
02:15:47,448 --> 02:15:48,324
Worm!

1662
02:15:49,451 --> 02:15:50,116
Come on!

1663
02:15:52,488 --> 02:15:53,492
Run!

1664
02:15:55,458 --> 02:15:56,751
Hey, you!

1665
02:15:57,126 --> 02:15:57,794
Here!

1666
02:16:30,249 --> 02:16:32,980
Send word to Dol Guldur ...

1667
02:16:33,301 --> 02:16:36,174
... Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!

1668
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:47,827
Go!

1669
02:16:48,328 --> 02:16:50,398
You! come with me.

1670
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:57,830
This way. It's this way!

1671
02:18:58,081 --> 02:18:59,207
Come on!

1672
02:18:59,458 --> 02:19:00,041
Thorin!

1673
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:06,924
Follow Balin!

1674
02:19:08,134 --> 02:19:09,385
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1675
02:19:25,236 --> 02:19:26,569
Thorin!

1676
02:19:35,649 --> 02:19:36,692
Hold on!

1677
02:20:10,523 --> 02:20:11,865
Thorin!

1678
02:20:14,761 --> 02:20:16,297
Go. Go!

1679
02:20:20,034 --> 02:20:23,720
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1680
02:20:23,972 --> 02:20:25,293
He's right. We've no...

1681
02:20:25,541 --> 02:20:27,888
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1682
02:20:30,446 --> 02:20:31,816
Have we not?

1683
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:36,267
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

1684
02:20:40,224 --> 02:20:40,868
You have grown...

1685
02:20:41,125 --> 02:20:43,070
...slow and fat...

1686
02:20:43,897 --> 02:20:44,772
...in your dotage...

1687
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,412
...slug!

1688
02:20:49,802 --> 02:20:51,469
Take cover. Go!

1689
02:21:18,903 --> 02:21:19,612
Bombur!

1690
02:21:19,904 --> 02:21:21,322
Get those bellows working.

1691
02:21:21,573 --> 02:21:22,657
Go!

1692
02:21:36,466 --> 02:21:37,050
Bilbo!

1693
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,052
Up there. On my mark...

1694
02:21:39,302 --> 02:21:40,595
...pull that lever.

1695
02:21:51,107 --> 02:21:53,444
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1696
02:21:53,694 --> 02:21:56,072
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1697
02:21:57,824 --> 02:21:59,284
We don't have a jiffy.

1698
02:22:11,258 --> 02:22:12,384
Where's the sulfur?

1699
02:22:12,759 --> 02:22:13,593
<i>DORY.
You sure you know what...</i>

1700
02:22:13,843 --> 02:22:14,511
...you're doing?

1701
02:22:26,276 --> 02:22:27,068
Come on!

1702
02:22:49,386 --> 02:22:50,053
NOW!

1703
02:24:46,819 --> 02:24:48,904
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1704
02:25:37,004 --> 02:25:38,125
Keep going, Bilbo!

1705
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:39,625
Run!

1706
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,971
You think you...

1707
02:26:26,221 --> 02:26:28,181
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1708
02:26:31,727 --> 02:26:34,730
You have come from Lake-town.

1709
02:26:36,441 --> 02:26:37,734
This is some...

1710
02:26:37,985 --> 02:26:41,239
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1711
02:26:41,489 --> 02:26:44,659
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1712
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,579
Those sniveling cowards...

1713
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:49,290
...with their long bows...

1714
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:52,376
...and Black Arrows.

1715
02:26:52,751 --> 02:26:54,629
Perhaps it is time...

1716
02:26:54,879 --> 02:26:56,756
...I paid them a visit.

1717
02:26:57,299 --> 02:26:58,550
Oh, no.

1718
02:27:00,428 --> 02:27:01,887
This isn't their fault!

1719
02:27:02,138 --> 02:27:02,925
Wait!

1720
02:27:03,173 --> 02:27:04,758
You cannot go to Lake-town!

1721
02:27:06,677 --> 02:27:08,864
You care about them...

1722
02:27:09,579 --> 02:27:10,832
...do you?

1723
02:27:11,082 --> 02:27:12,041
Good.

1724
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,334
Then you can...

1725
02:27:13,584 --> 02:27:15,164
...watch them die.

1726
02:27:20,693 --> 02:27:21,819
Here!

1727
02:27:22,738 --> 02:27:23,655
You witless worm.

1728
02:27:30,581 --> 02:27:31,957
You.

1729
02:27:32,375 --> 02:27:34,836
I am taking back what you stole.

1730
02:27:38,884 --> 02:27:39,551
You...

1731
02:27:39,801 --> 02:27:41,386
...will take nothing...

1732
02:27:41,637 --> 02:27:43,306
...from me...

1733
02:27:43,556 --> 02:27:44,724
...dwarf.

1734
02:27:45,224 --> 02:27:48,479
I laid low your warriors...

1735
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:50,357
...of old.

1736
02:27:50,607 --> 02:27:52,985
I instilled terror in...

1737
02:27:53,235 --> 02:27:54,904
...the hearts of Men.

1738
02:27:56,073 --> 02:27:57,491
I am...

1739
02:27:57,741 --> 02:27:59,118
...King...

1740
02:27:59,619 --> 02:28:01,412
... Under the Mountain.

1741
02:28:01,872 --> 02:28:04,124
This is not your kingdom.

1742
02:28:04,375 --> 02:28:06,378
These are lands.

1743
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:08,004
This is gold.

1744
02:28:10,466 --> 02:28:11,175
And we will...

1745
02:28:11,425 --> 02:28:13,595
...have our revenge.

1746
02:28:14,897 --> 02:28:16,397
[ Speaking Dwarvish Language ]

1747
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:35,952
Revenge?!

1748
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:39,457
Revenge?!

1749
02:29:40,249 --> 02:29:44,172
I will show you revenge!

1750
02:30:21,679 --> 02:30:22,721
Listen to me!

1751
02:30:23,265 --> 02:30:25,559
Do you not know what is coming?

1752
02:30:27,979 --> 02:30:31,679
I am fire.

1753
02:30:32,884 --> 02:30:35,383
I am...

1754
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:38,923
...death.

1755
02:30:47,627 --> 02:30:49,835
What have we done?

1756
02:30:49,957 --> 02:30:54,880


1757
02:30:57,096 --> 02:31:03,752
<i>Oh misty eye of the Mountain below</i>

1758
02:31:05,508 --> 02:31:11,162
<i>Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls</i>

02:31:12,813 --> 02:31:20,804
<i>And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke</i>

1760
02:31:21,859 --> 02:31:28,249

02:31:44,197 --> 02:31:47,357
<i>Then we shall all burn together</i>

1763
02:31:47,358 --> 02:31:50,890
<i>Watch the flames climb higher</i>

<i>We should all die together</i>

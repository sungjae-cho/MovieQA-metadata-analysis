1
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,893
<i>A story like mine should never be told.</i>

2
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,817
<i>For my world is as
forbidden as it is fragile.</i>

3
00:03:53,817 --> 00:04:01,617
<i>Without its mysteries it cannot survive.</i>

4
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>I certainly wasn't born
to the life of a Geisha.</i>

5
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>Like so much in my strange life</i>

6
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,753
<i>I was carried there by the current.</i>

7
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,718
<i>The first time I knew
my mother was sick,</i>

8
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>was when my father threw
the fish back into the sea.</i>

9
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:31,688
<i>That night we went hungry, to
understand emptiness he told us.</i>

10
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:40,489
<i>Mother always said that my
sister Satsu was like wood.</i>

11
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:46,495
<i>As rooted to the earth as a Sagura
tree. But she told me I was like water.</i>

12
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:52,751
<i>Water can carve its
way, even through stone.</i>

13
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:58,966
<i>And when trapped,
water makes a new path.</i>

14
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:07,784
-These are the girls from Tanaka?
-Sisters, yes, from Yurida.

15
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,038
This one maybe, the other one no.

16
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,896
Show your respect for mother. You
must not speak, I will answer for you.

17
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:50,911
Kneel, and head down,
never look her in the face.

18
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,516
-How old are you?
-She’s year of the rooster.

19
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,854
Only nine...

20
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,294
Where is my sister?

21
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,673
Let me see those eyes.

22
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,887
Look at me.

23
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:57,644
-Too much water.
- But mother, a little water is good to guard against fire.

24
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:02,649
You wouldn't have to worry about the
okea burning, losing all your people, no....

25
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,863
These country girls! Too
late to send her back now.

26
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,084
Go.

27
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,467
Pumpkin, keep her quiet,
mother is downstairs

28
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,388
Let me go!

29
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,851
Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:45,776
-Mother will hear you! She's got a bamboo stick.
-I want my sister. Satsu!

31
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,036
I cried too at first.

32
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:03,168
You know it is easier if you just forget
everything that happened before you came to the okea.

33
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:10,467
If you impress mother,
and do exactly as she says,

34
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,596
She will send you to
school to be a Geisha.

35
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:19,393
-A what?
-A Geisha, like Hatsumomo.

36
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:24,523
You will get to drink
sake, and sleep until noon.

37
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:29,611
-Where is my sister?
-Probably in another okea in Hanonoke.

38
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:40,038
Your family sold you to this
house, you live here now.

39
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:59,725
Outside you wear these, inside these.

40
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:06,732
We don't display our
naked feet like monkeys.

41
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,569
It's not flesh we're selling here,

42
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,782
This is a Geisha house.

43
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:20,120
Remember to always honour this okea.

44
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,585
You listen, you learn, now get to work.

45
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,172
Be quiet Hatsumomo is sleeping.

46
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,765
-Pumpkin, when can I go outside?
-Outside the okea? You can't.

47
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,725
It’s not allowed.

48
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,895
How will I find Satsu?

49
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,066
You can't just walk out to
every house in Hanamachi.

50
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,987
Do you know how many there are?

51
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,323
Look.

52
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,311
Tighter!

53
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,881
Chiyo, Chiyo-chan

54
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,133
Come.

55
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:01,680
Two nights ago, Hatsumomo had to
stay at the Tea-house until dawn,

56
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,223
thats what she told mother.

57
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,767
But she was really here
with a man, the whole...

58
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,021
Why can't you be quiet?!

59
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:18,405
So, this is the new arrival.

60
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:47,643
A pity she still stinks of fish.

61
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,233
Stay out of my room.

62
00:12:54,233 --> 00:13:00,072
Your fingers smell .I can't
have you touching my things!

63
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:19,424
Only reason mother tolerates Hatsumomo
is because she brings in good money.

64
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,930
Never forget it is Hatsumomo
who pays for your supper,

65
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,892
the clothes on your back.

66
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:34,523
By the time she was twenty, she had
already earned back her purchase price.

67
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:42,447
She has been the talk of
the Hanamachi ever since.

68
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:49,037
-These are all hers?
-Certainly not, they belong to the okea.

69
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:08,849
A Geisha needs an elegant wardrobe,
just like an artist needs ink.

70
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,936
If she's not properly dressed
then she is not a true Geisha.

71
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:18,192
-Nobody told me what a Geisha is.
-You will find out soon enough.

72
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:25,532
I have news for you child, mother has determined
that it is off to school with you.

73
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,829
You are to become Geisha!

74
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,170
Chiyo, Pumpkin!

75
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:46,428
Quick quick, don't be
late, and you will be late.

76
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,181
Go,go.

77
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,436
This way.

78
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,706
Pumpkin, Pumpkin…

79
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,919
I'm going to run, I'm
going to find Satsu.

80
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,798
Not yet you don't.

81
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,218
You will ruin your own
chances, and mine too.

82
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,388
Please,stay with me.

83
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,187
Squid!

84
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,459
Look for your sister's name later!

85
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,935
You are late!

86
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,508
Chiyo, where is granny's food?

87
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,930
Where have you
been? It’s freezing cold!.

88
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,060
Close the window. Hai! (yes).

89
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,996
Chiyo, Chiyo, come quickly.

90
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,918
Hatsumomo is at the bath-house

91
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,712
-Here tidy up.
-But she told me to stay ... !

92
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:30,509
Hatsumomo does not run this okea.

93
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,277
Look who's in my room...

94
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,881
Did you touch this?

95
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:22,519
I can just hear the General now why
Hatsumomo, you used to smell of jasmine,

96
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,899
What’s this new perfume? Blowfish?

97
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:31,778
I told you to never to touch my
things. Can’t you understand why?

98
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:40,787
Because your general will
say, Hatsumomo you stink!

99
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:51,048
At least you don't smell as bad as
your sister.You know, she was here...

100
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,133
She came by looking for you.

101
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,886
What?

102
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,639
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

103
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,517
Please, tell me where she is.

104
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,482
Only if you swear yourself
to me first.Yes? Huh?

105
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,368
Now get out!

106
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:47,020
Hatsumomo you'll wake the entire
house. Your big sister is thirsty, so am I,

107
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,314
go and get us some beer.

108
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,443
-I'm not in the mood for beer.
-I know what you're in the mood for.

109
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:59,408
And his name is Koichi

110
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,703
What did you say Korin?

111
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:07,708
I'm sorry.I forgot.

112
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:17,217
You're just jealous
someone cares for me!

113
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:25,475
Guess who this belongs to? A Geisha as desired as
she is ought to keep a closer eye on her clothes.

114
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,731
It’s Mameha's?!

115
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,650
How did you get it? Bribed her maid.

116
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,956
We can't, give it to her.

117
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,587
Chiyo, come, come.

118
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,177
Now then little Chiyo, it is
time to practice your calligraphy.

119
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,231
There.

120
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:22,115
Remember, you swore yourself to me. Yes.

121
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,022
Don't let anybody see you.

122
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,320
Go, go!

123
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,661
This will teach the great Mameha.

124
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,606
Thieving rat!.

125
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:43,155
-That kimono was worth more than you.
-Careful, you will hurt yourself more than her.

126
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:46,575
Let me.

127
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:04,760
Kneel. What have you done to Hatsumomo?

128
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:12,434
-I haven't done anything, I promise you.
-Her little trick with than kimono will cost  you.

129
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:18,690
Whatever you have done to anger
her, you'd be wise to stop, now!

130
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,611
Lie down. I will beat you hard,

131
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:27,282
So mother does not beat you harder.

132
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:59,648
I told you not to let anybody see you.

133
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:06,780
I have kept my promise,
so tell me, where is she?

134
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,331
She is in the next ...
in the house called Tatsuyo.

135
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,251
In the pleasure district.

136
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:23,213
Trust me little Chiyo,
you will find her.

137
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,291
Tatsuyo? Satsu, Satsu, Satsu…

138
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,037
Satsu, Satsu, no! Satsu! Satsu!

139
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,376
Satsu, Satsu!

140
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,088
Chiyo, what took you so
long? But Satsu, I tried...

141
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:16,261
I went to your okea weeks ago,
they laughed and turned me away.

142
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:20,724
Please, I did not know
I’ve missed you so much.

143
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,813
Let’s leave, tonight.
But we need money too.

144
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,360
I know I can steal some, first
thing tomorrow… No, please, tonight!

145
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:37,533
No, tomorrow, meet me at the
Saturn-May bridge, as soon as it's dark.

146
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:44,331
Now I have to go.Quickly
before someone catches you.

147
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,667
What if I cannot get away?

148
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,127
Be there Chiyo, we only have one chance.

149
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:56,677
Once I’ve left I can't go
back.I’ve waited as long as I can.Now go.

150
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,435
What is she doing here? She’s seen us!

151
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:55,152
Stupid girl, why have you come
back? You’re probably trying to escape!

152
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,780
Get in!

153
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,452
- Koichi please!
-Look at this, we're sneaking around like criminals!

154
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,246
-Koichi don't!
-It's degrading!

155
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:10,167
-What's going on?
-Koichi…

156
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,504
Who's there?

157
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,674
Go.

158
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,727
Show your face!

159
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,983
Look mother, I caught her stealing.

160
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:40,072
She was running away
with her sister,the whore!

161
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,617
-You little thief!
-No, she's lying.

162
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,453
After all we've done for her!

163
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:50,582
I saw her with a man, right
there! His name is Koichi!

164
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,878
Shut up! We should kick her out.

165
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,342
Take her arms.

166
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,368
You are never to see him again, huh?

167
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:32,165
What do you think? A
Geisha is free to love?

168
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:39,506
Never! Bolt the gate.No
one is leaving this okea!

169
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:12,928
Doctor Ohura is very expensive. You
seem to be racking up quite a debt, huh?

170
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:26,441
Kimono destroyed, Geisha school, rice and
pickles, train ticket,Mr. Bekku, ... all this...

171
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,821
… on top of the money I paid Mr. Tanaka?

172
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:39,121
And for what? And now I hear
that your sister has run away.

173
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:44,877
She didn't wait for you and
now she can never come back.

174
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:49,089
You must forget you
ever had a sister, huh?

175
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:02,019
We are your only family now.

176
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:38,305
Dear Satsu and little Chiyo, as one
who was once an orphan child myself,

177
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:45,979
this humble person is sorry to inform you,that six
weeks after you left for your new life in Myoko…

178
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:50,943
… the suffering of your honoured
mother came to it's end …

179
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:58,033
And only a few weeks afterwards your
honoured father departed this world as well.

180
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:05,666
This humble person feels confident that both your honoured
parents have found their places in paradise.

181
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:14,049
<i>At the temple there is a poem
called "loss",carved into the stone.</i>

182
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:20,055
<i>It has three words, but the
poet has scratched them out.</i>

183
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,351
<i>You cannot read loss, only feel it.</i>

184
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:34,778
<i>My father and mother had left this
life, my sister I never heard from again.</i>

185
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:41,869
<i>I had dishonoured the okea,so
mother had other plans for me.</i>

186
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,749
<i>I would pay back my debt,
year,after year,after year.</i>

187
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:54,131
<i>Not as a Geisha, as her slave.</i>

188
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,815
It is too pretty a day to be
so unhappy. Did you fall down?

189
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,740
Why so shy? Nothing to be ashamed of.

190
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,368
We all stumble from time to time.

191
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,165
You see that enchanting lady in green?

192
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:32,878
Once, when she was just a miko (an apprentice
Geisha), she fell clean off her wooden shoes.

193
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:38,258
-It's true, I did.
-And now look at her, so elegant!

194
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:42,095
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?We
will miss the beginning.

195
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:48,060
We see the Spring dances
every year.We can spare a moment.

196
00:37:48,060 --> 00:38:01,532
What's your name? Don't
be afraid to look at me.

197
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,494
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?

198
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:08,163
You mean to eat?

199
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,874
I like sweet plum myself.

200
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:11,875
Come.

201
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,340
None of us find much kindness
in this life, as we should.

202
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,803
Both kinds please.

203
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,475
My children wait for these every Spring.

204
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:49,663
-Now I am a Geisha too.
-So you are.

205
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:54,877
How did you come by
such surprising eyes?

206
00:38:55,252 --> 00:39:00,048
-My mother gave them to me.
-Generous of her wasn't it?

207
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:04,553
As you have been to me.

208
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,932
Smile for me won't you?

209
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:13,604
There now, that is your gift to me.

210
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:21,445
This will buy your
supper. Now promise me one thing.

211
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,617
Next time you take a tumble, no frowns.

212
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:31,830
That's better.

213
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:45,636
In that moment I changed from a
girl, facing nothing but emptiness

214
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:53,352
to someone with purpose.I saw that to
be a Geisha could be a stepping stone

215
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:58,857
to something else: a place in his world.

216
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:34,017
The money the chairman had given me,
could have bought fish and rice for a month,

217
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:40,607
but I gave it back in prayer,
keeping only his handkerchief.

218
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:54,788
I asked one day to become a Geisha,
and then somehow, to meet him again.

219
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,211
-Chiyo
-chan? I can't find my coat, did you found it yet?

220
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,213
Pumpkin it's time to go.

221
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,048
I found it.

222
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:52,513
I couldn't sleep last night I was
so worried about my stupid hair.

223
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:57,142
Am I lopsided? You look beautiful.

224
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:01,897
With your hair like that you look
more like a pumpkin than ever.

225
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:06,151
Don't fold your neck
forward like a tortoise.

226
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,112
She's not ready? We will be late.

227
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:13,033
Poor pumpkin, her debut and
everybody will be staring at you.

228
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:26,797
Hurry up. This time, do your ... before you play, when
you make a fool of yourself your big sister gets the blame

229
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:30,259
Stop crying, your face will run.

230
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:33,178
Pumpkin!

231
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:47,187
The winter I turned fifteen
I saw the chairman again,

232
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:52,150
But that wasn't the only surprise
fate brought me that season.

233
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,364
Along with the snow came
a most unexpected  visitor.

234
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:05,873
Why is she here?

235
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:10,210
Chiyo, Chiyo, open the gate!

236
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:41,575
Now that your beloved granny has
gone you have no need for a maid.

237
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:51,001
I would never question the great Mameha,
but you could choose anyone in the Hanamachi.

238
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,212
You flatter me, truly.

239
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:57,674
I would give you my pumpkin if she
weren't already tied to Hatsumomo.

240
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:05,474
Please I would never dream of asking. Besides,
I can always sell Chiyo to Mrs. Tetsuyo.

241
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:10,354
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent,

242
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,774
surely you can see what a
terrible waste that would be.

243
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:19,321
If you were not the kind hearted
Geisha I know you to be,

244
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:26,537
then I might think that you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

245
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:31,834
Then I'm grateful Mrs. Nita that
you don't have a suspicious mind.

246
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,670
Perhaps you can
pique my interest with...

247
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:39,883
-Your offer.

248
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:45,556
I will cover Chiyo's schooling, all
her expenses, until after her debut.

249
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:50,519
Now I am confident that you are teasing.

250
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,146
I could not be more sincere.

251
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:57,192
If Chiyo has not repaid her debt
within six months after her debut.

252
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:02,197
-Impossible, too little time!
- Then I will pay you twice over.

253
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:06,743
What... ?

254
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:12,624
-No Geisha could ever...
- I am certain you will not object to one trivial condition.

255
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:20,799
-Uh yes...?
-If Chiyo erases her debt in the time allowed,

256
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,803
You will not have any part
in her future earnings.

257
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:31,643
It's too good to be true,
Mameha is up to something.

258
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,689
She isn't in it for the money,
that much is for certain.

259
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:39,359
Rumour has it, ever since the Prime
Minister bought her misuage(virginity)

260
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,529
-She's been rich.

261
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:46,241
Absurd hard to think
that she noticed Chiyo.

262
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:53,207
-It's that kimono, she remembers how you
destroyed it, now she wants to get even.

263
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,501
An odd picture isn't it?

264
00:47:55,501 --> 00:48:04,468
Hatsumomo sweeping into tea-house after
tea-house with our Pumpkin, and Mameha with our maid.

265
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:07,846
I'm so far behind, I will
never catch up to you.

266
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:14,478
-Don’t worry, I will help you.
-Pumpkin!

267
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:23,153
You are never to speak to her
again, now you  are rivals!

268
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,637
This is how it was, this
tiny world of women,

269
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:53,058
friend turned against friend.

270
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:57,855
And now the two greatest
Geisha in Myoko at war over me.

271
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,692
Hatsumomo at my back, Mameha calling,

272
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:08,115
offering me the chance to become one of
those elegant women I had seen on the bridge.

273
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:14,121
floating in a silk
kimono, the chairman at my side.

274
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:22,212
-Chiyo is my new protoge.
-As lovely as her big sister.

275
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:27,217
And with eyes the colour of rain.

276
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,682
The baron is a very special
man to me, my “Danina,”

277
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:40,105
someday if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.

278
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:45,611
Don't kneel, you aren't
a servant girl anymore.

279
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:52,451
Step into the light.

280
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:01,627
-I see water in you.
-Does that displease you?

281
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:08,675
Water is powerful. It can wash away
earth, put out fire, and even destroy iron.

282
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:11,970
But you have not drawn on
those strengths have you?

283
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,015
-About your kimono...

284
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:18,101
You may apologise if you wish.

285
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:23,690
Why that is a perfect
bow, for a pig farmer...

286
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:30,489
Don't drop your head, fingertips together,
elbows in, no weight on the hands.

287
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,616
-Yes.

288
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:36,161
As for the kimono, I’m no fool Chiyo.

289
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:40,874
-Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition
-She is jealous of you...

290
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:48,257
Not me I'm afraid,
someone closer to home.

291
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:51,969
Rise.

292
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:55,472
Not like a horse.

293
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:02,563
Slide your foot forward.

294
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:09,236
That's it. Now walk. You
are a magnificent Geisha.

295
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:13,824
Tell me Chiyo, does Mrs.
Nita ever speak of the future?

296
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:15,742
Not to me.

297
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,287
Well someday soon she will
have to name an heir.

298
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,081
One of her own Geisha to succeed her.

299
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:24,543
Strange isn't it that she
hasn't adopted Hatsumomo?

300
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,213
That would be like releasing
a tiger from it's cage.

301
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:31,258
You have a gift for expression.

302
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:37,181
And if Mrs. Nita adopts
Pumpkin that is hardly a threat…

303
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:40,517
… but a young girl
with eyes like rain...

304
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:43,228
But Mrs. Nita would never choose me.

305
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:48,025
-On the contrary, that is our goal.
-It is?

306
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:53,071
Of course. If you do not inherit the
okea, then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.

307
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:03,081
Water is always in such a
hurry, perhaps that is just as well.

308
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,126
We have no time to lose.

309
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:13,800
We must transform you.

310
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,181
And what takes years,you
must learn in months.

311
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,772
Say I’m entertaining the baron.

312
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:30,692
Like so many clients he's trapped
in an arranged marriage.

313
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:34,530
So in the tea-house when he's
seeking my company instead,

314
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:39,993
I reward him like this with
a glimpse of my wrist.

315
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:48,752
Seeing this demure little trace of
naked skin, well it gives him pleasure.

316
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:54,424
Or when you're sitting down, for the
briefest moment, press your leg against his.

317
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:57,678
Always by accident,of course.

318
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,948
Mameha, when does a
Geisha choose her patron?

319
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:24,746
I'm afraid it's the other way around, focus on
your studies Chiyo, music, the art of conversation,

320
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:30,085
That's the surest way to attract a
patron on your feet, not off them!

321
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:12,461
Remember Chiyo, Geisha are not
courtesans, and we're not wives.

322
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:16,548
We sell our skills, not our bodies.

323
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,847
We create another secret
world, a place only of beauty.

324
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:29,061
The very word Geisha means
artist, and to be a Geisha …

325
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:34,066
… is to be judged as
a moving work of art.

326
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:45,262
Agony and beauty, for
us, live side by side.

327
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:49,766
Your feet will suffer,
your fingers will bleed.

328
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:53,770
Even sitting and
sleeping will be painful.

329
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:08,785
You cannot call yourself a true Geisha until you
can stop a man in his tracks with a single look.

330
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,705
-No one can do that.
-Choose someone for me.

331
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,419
The grey hat...

332
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,595
You are ready.

333
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:53,932
Hurry up, you're not making money.
Standing there gawking at yourself.

334
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:59,354
For luck.

335
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,464
This binds us together
forever as sisters.

336
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:29,551
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

337
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:36,934
From this day forward you
will be known as Sayuri.

338
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:43,774
When Mameha granted me my new name,

339
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:50,405
I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.

340
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:55,827
I was a miko now, an apprentice Geisha.

341
00:58:55,827 --> 00:59:07,881
From that moment I told myself when I make tea,
when I pour sake, when I dance, when I tie my kimono…

342
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:13,262
… it will be for the
chairman, until he finds me...

343
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,473
… until I am his.

344
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:31,697
-Ready?
-Big sister?

345
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,744
Thank you.

346
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:50,507
Friends, we have the pleasure to witness the
debut of another apprentice Geisha, cheers!

347
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:05,272
I remember those eyes what was her name?

348
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,485
Sayuri.

349
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:34,676
Determined isn't she? If there had been a drop of tea in
that tea-pot I believe Sayuri would have gotten it out!

350
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,680
I told you Mr. Baron, it
is her very first time.

351
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:41,285
What a beautiful dance, yes Pumpkin?

352
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:47,708
her fans are so hypnotic, that
you may not even notice her feet!

353
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:56,091
What's her name? Her name is Sayuri.

354
01:01:56,592 --> 01:02:02,389
A name as sweet as she is. I'm afraid
that these days even a common chambermaid…

355
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:09,229
… can call herself a Geisha. So it's nice to
see such a sincere young apprentice, isn't it?

356
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:16,945
-Oh yes.
- Surely you would like to thank Hatsumomo for her gracious compliment.

357
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:20,782
There is so much I would
like to say to Hatsumomo.

358
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:25,245
Sometimes the smartest
remark is silence.

359
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:30,334
What better advice to follow
you than your own? Sayuri!

360
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:39,051
-I was a miko myself once.
- Of course! But it's been such a very long,

361
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:44,556
long, long... long, long, time.

362
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:56,485
I shall destroy you.

363
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,492
She can destroy you. She
would spread rumours.

364
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,452
Stalk you from
tea-house to tea-house.

365
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:10,290
Then steal your clients, all in the hope that
Mrs. Nita adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

366
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,709
-What can we do?
-We've got to outwit her,

367
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:18,465
to find a place somewhere beyond her reach, where
you can practice your skills without any interference.

368
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,760
-Your first sumo match.
-What?

369
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,137
Today you will meet (Chairman) Iwamura.

370
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:29,768
He is head of the Iwamura electric
company in Osaka. My client for years.

371
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:35,983
We will entertain him and his partner
Nobu. You may find Nobu quite a challenge.

372
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:38,068
He does not like Geisha.

373
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:50,956
Be attentive, I will do the rest.

374
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:59,173
Chairman Iwamura, President Nobu, this
is my new younger sister Sayuri.

375
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,895
Injured in Manchuria, war hero.

376
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:16,773
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

377
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,861
Nobu-san will have to educate you, I
cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

378
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:24,323
That is the Chairman's diplomatic
way of saying he hates sumo.

379
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:32,956
Did you notice our contribution?

380
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:37,961
We are harnessing the power of water to
bring electricity to some of the smaller villages.

381
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,838
It was in the newspaper wasn't it?

382
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:45,385
Ah, the Chairman's picture, yes, you
compensate for all my shortcomings don't you?

383
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:50,349
May I ask, How does someone
harness the power of water?

384
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:54,937
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing because he will!

385
01:04:55,145 --> 01:05:00,067
Let the girl watch sumo.

386
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:11,161
Hatsumomo, that snake! Quick,
turn your attention to Nobu.

387
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:13,705
But Mameha-san...

388
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:17,042
Hatsumomo finds him repulsive,
she would never steal him away.

389
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,711
Mislead her, go.

390
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:41,733
Perhaps Nobu-san would be kind
enough to explain the rules of the match.

391
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:49,283
Three things matter in
life... … sumo, business, and war,

392
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:53,912
Understand one, you know them
all. But why should a Geisha care?

393
01:05:53,912 --> 01:05:59,877
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.

394
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,129
I humbly beg to differ.

395
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:04,548
What is sumo but a dance between giants?

396
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:08,177
What is business but a
dance between companies?

397
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:12,806
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.

398
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:19,730
They are throwing salt
to purify the ring.

399
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:33,035
That man is Miyagi, the
greatest fighter in Japan.

400
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:38,832
But he's so tiny! Only
compared to his opponent.

401
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:42,878
Miyagi may use...

402
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:47,799
Are you listening? Yes.

403
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:58,936
Hataki-comi is a movement a smaller
opponent uses to throw a larger opponent off balance.

404
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:02,439
Victory does not always
belong to the powerful!

405
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:06,693
Look, there, in his eyes!

406
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:13,158
I'm afraid our time has come
to a close. Going so soon?

407
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,495
Not yet! I want her to see.

408
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,977
Now that is Hataki-comi! I
see now why you like sumo.

409
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,188
You can never judge a man's
power by his appearance alone.

410
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:54,157
Mameha! You may bring her again.

411
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,887
<i>I scoured the newspaper for
the Chairman's photograph.</i>

412
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,349
<i>Anything to preserve
our moment together.</i>

413
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:25,647
<i>A moment, stolen, when I was
forced to turn my attention to Nobu.</i>

414
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:31,153
<i>In that instant I
felt the world shift...</i>

415
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:36,116
<i>But not my own determination</i>

416
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:36,575
<i>I made a secret promise.</i>

417
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:49,004
<i>Along with his picture, I would lock
away my heart, and save it for him.</i>

418
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:53,258
-Big sister.
-Come here.

419
01:08:55,511 --> 01:09:00,682
Tonight we will deliver a quick
blow to Hatsumomo - Hataki-comi.

420
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:04,478
-How? -We will meet
Nobu-san at the Sunashima restaurant.

421
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:07,898
-But first a visit to Dr. Crab.
-Dr. Crab?

422
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:10,817
It's a little nickname
he's earned over the years.

423
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:15,113
-Sister!
- Hold still!

424
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:18,325
I have something in mind, a plan.

425
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:20,994
Now cut your leg where I've marked it.

426
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:23,664
-What?!
-Or I will do it for you.

427
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:30,462
-Have you gone mad?
-Do you trust me or don't you?

428
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,756
Well?

429
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:43,058
Go ahead, do it!.

430
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:53,694
Careless with the
sowing scissors were you?

431
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:56,864
Right through your beautiful
kimono. Such a pity.

432
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:02,828
It won't leave a scar will
it? Sayuri is a special girl…

433
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:08,083
… at a very special time in her life.

434
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:13,589
Yes, with those eyes! You
must be quite a commodity.

435
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:25,601
Clean cut, won't leave
a mark, I promise.

436
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:33,609
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.

437
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:50,542
Your honourable sister says
cut your leg? You cut your leg.

438
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:56,965
She says follow me? You follow
her. My life had turned into a game…

439
01:10:57,591 --> 01:11:00,719
… and only she knew the rules.

440
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:10,979
At the right moment slip
it to Nobu – discreetly.

441
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,524
He will know what it means.

442
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:21,698
-You have kept us waiting.
-Please forgive us Nobu-san.

443
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:29,623
The Chairman thinks I should take more
pleasure in life, music and the theatre.

444
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,210
What is your impression?

445
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,756
It is useless to push
your cart sideways,

446
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:41,927
one could not wish Nobu-san to
be anyone other than Nobu-san.

447
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:46,265
I could not agree more. I
owe this man everything.

448
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:48,934
He gives me too much credit as usual.

449
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,144
Probably, cheers! Cheers!

450
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:05,075
It is a trinket, I found
it a few days ago...

451
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:11,081
Nobu-san, I had no idea you were so
sentimental. Call it my “new leaf.”

452
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:19,673
My mother... my mother, she
used to wear something similar.

453
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,639
You do not like it?

454
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:36,815
Forgive me, I've never
received a present before.

455
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:41,987
What a beautiful comb.

456
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:45,032
Such a joyous moment Sayuri.

457
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:48,327
You're finally getting what you deserve.

458
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:51,538
How lovely.

459
01:12:51,538 --> 01:13:01,632
And now will you excuse us please, we
have another engagement, many in fact.

460
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:02,633
Pumpkin?

461
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:20,609
You are most kind.

462
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,581
-Now give this one to Dr. Crab.
-Mameha please...

463
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:38,544
-You're upset?
-I want to trust you I do…

464
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:40,462
… but you have to tell
me what's going on.

465
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:44,299
-I am ensuring your future.
-But tell me how, I beg you.

466
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:47,553
-I am trying to orchestrate a bidding war.
-What for?

467
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:50,806
-Your most precious attribute.
-And what is that?

468
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:53,308
Your misuage (virginity).

469
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:58,230
Did mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

470
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:04,319
Well, every once in a while, a man's
eel likes to visit a woman's cave.

471
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:07,364
Yes I know. You do?

472
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:09,950
I live with Hatsumomo.

473
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:15,581
Well, your cave is untouched... men
like that. We call this misuage (virginity).

474
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:19,251
And to become a full Geisha we must
sell this to the highest bidder.

475
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:21,044
Did you sell yours?

476
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,379
It was the largest sum ever paid
- Ten thousand yen.

477
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,885
I freed myself from
debt, and so will you.

478
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:35,017
When you slip the rice-cake to Dr. Crab it is a sign
that says your misuage (virginity),is ripe for sale.

479
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:43,483
The Dr. has no desire to see
you tonight... or any night.

480
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:55,412
-Pumpkin! Hatsumomo went to see Dr.
Crab, yes? -I have to go Chiyo-chan.

481
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:57,789
-Didn't she?
-I do not know.

482
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:59,958
Of course you know! You
shadow her every step.

483
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,795
-You expect me to betray my big sister.
-Has she made you cruel as well?

484
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:10,469
-No.
-My Pumpkin always told the truth.

485
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:14,056
The truth…

486
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:24,483
Tonight, we went to the tea-house to see Dr. Crab. I
sat outside but I could still hear through the screen...

487
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:31,907
... and Hatsumomo then said to him “I live in the same Okea as
Sayuri, and did you know that she brings men back to her room?”

488
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:38,205
“No” he said, “they come in, sailors, and fishermen too.” And
the Dr. looked queezy like he didn't want to hear any more,

489
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:43,877
But she kept going. And Hatsumomo
said to him “what's the matter?”

490
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:50,801
“have I told you more than you wanted to
know?” I'm so sorry, I wanted to say something…

491
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:54,638
… but how could I Chiyo-chan? … how?

492
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:58,600
Am I really like her?

493
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,897
-Am I?
-Of course not.

494
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:08,902
-Is Mameha-san cruel to you
too? -No, she's so kind to me...

495
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,574
... but sometimes I worry she's taken
me further from the things I want.

496
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:24,793
-That man Nobu. Do you really like him?
-No.

497
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,129
That's what I thought.

498
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:30,465
Do you like somebody else?

499
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:45,480
Don't worry about me
Chiyo-chan. I'll be fine. Better than fine.

500
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:53,113
Mother plans to adopt me, so my dream of
having some place to live out my life may come true.

501
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,741
I have to go.

502
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:04,917
-We could still win Sayuri.
-How?

503
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:08,795
Hatsumomo has poisoned
Dr. Crab against me.

504
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:12,883
Forget about him, there are
plenty of other fish in the sea.

505
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:14,259
The Chairman has been kind...

506
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:17,513
Sayuri! Nobu and the
Chairman are business partners,

507
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:23,852
they would never bid against one
another. It is time we cast a wider net.

508
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:29,233
Suppose there was a night in Myoko. Hundreds
of men all in one place, eager to bid for you.

509
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:34,780
-What do you mean?
-Where you are the object of all their fantasies.

510
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,741
The most famous Geisha in the Hanamachi.

511
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:39,660
-But I'm not.
-You will be…

512
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:54,925
-Who is responsible for this?
-Ask Mameha.

513
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:59,304
-I'm asking you Mother.
-How come Sayuri gets to be the lead?

514
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:04,351
It's your own fault. You
should practice more.

515
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:15,112
What did Mameha do, speak
to the director in private?

516
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:19,825
Not every Geisha uses
that kind of currency.

517
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:30,669
I'm looking forward to your performance. You
know how I adore watching you dance... Chiyo.

518
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,288
They've all come,

519
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:13,795
the Baron, Nobu-san, our beloved
Hatsumomo, and that dapper General of hers..

520
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:19,676
Anybody else? And even
your old friend, Dr. Crab.

521
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:35,651
Big-sister, what if I dance
poorly, what if I disgrace myself,

522
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,069
and no one takes interest?

523
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:40,781
Sssh,you will be glorious.

524
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:58,090
Now, it's time.

525
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:15,662
-Sayuri, you remember the Doctor.
-I hope my performance pleased you Doctor.

526
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:21,126
-Aah, you danced with such profound fury.
-I most humbly thank you.

527
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:24,463
It seems you've once again
caught the Doctor's interest.

528
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,509
And I am most grateful. If
you have heard any gossip...

529
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:33,222
-Ah yes?
-Then I hope you will follow your own advice.

530
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:39,561
-And what would that be, pray tell?
-Seek a second opinion.

531
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:55,035
Ah Chairman. Sayuri gave such a
passionate performance, don't you think?

532
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,787
Indeed.

533
01:23:56,787 --> 01:24:00,749
Mameha, did you invite the Chairman
to my estate this weekend?

534
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:04,419
-It's my annual blossom viewing party.
-Baron, I told you I can't go.

535
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:08,590
-I have an urgent appointment.
-Taking care of a little nuisance,

536
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:16,056
or was that a naughty secret? Baron,
wouldn't Sayuri look stunning…

537
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:21,562
-among the flowers on your estate?
-Yes, very pretty.

538
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,731
-Be sure to send her along.
-With a chaparone of course,

539
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:29,027
I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.

540
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:33,282
That's a fine idea Baron, but Sayuri
is required at the theatre.

541
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:39,204
-Mameha, I expect her there.
-Nobu, coming Saturday?

542
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:45,169
All that way to see a cherry
tree? I will leave that to the Chairman.

543
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:52,301
[You were] wonderful tonight. Excuse me.

544
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:58,640
-If you would rather not go.
-I'd like to go very much.

545
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:05,147
Then be on your guard, every moment. There
is a reason Hatsumomo wants you there.

546
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,774
Trust me, I know my Baron Sayuri.

547
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:10,903
He has a weakness for beautiful women.

548
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:16,992
And now, you are the most celebrated
Geisha in all Myoko.

549
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:20,954
The most desired as well.

550
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:04,790
Sayuri, today, even the cherry
blossoms are envious of her.

551
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:18,303
There's something I've been wanting
to say to you for some time now.

552
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:22,766
I'd like to...

553
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:25,811
to thank you for your
attention to Nobu-san.

554
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:27,938
Nobu can be a difficult man.

555
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:32,651
So you see dear, at parties,
sake only in moderation.

556
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:35,487
And he disdains Geisha.

557
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:37,698
But he…

558
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:40,826
… he’s fond of you.

559
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:45,789
Because you admire
him, I respect him more.

560
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:50,586
He would never tell you
himself. He's far too modest.

561
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:55,048
We were fighting in Manchuria
together, and there was an explosion.

562
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:58,427
He protected me from the worst of it.

563
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:03,348
As you might imagine,
I owe him quite a debt.

564
01:27:03,348 --> 01:27:07,519
Nobu has taught me a great
deal, patience, for one thing.

565
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:10,480
I, in turn, have tried to teach him.

566
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,483
You have to savour life while you can.

567
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:16,361
The legend of the cherry blossom.

568
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:21,575
That is why Nobu likes you. We
must not expect happiness Sayuri,

569
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:27,331
it is not something we deserve. When
life goes well, it's a sudden gift,

570
01:27:27,331 --> 01:27:29,958
it cannot last forever.

571
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:42,804
Ah Sayuri, there you go.
I have a present for you.

572
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:54,149
Mameha asked me to show
you my kimono collection.

573
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:57,236
It's quite venerated, my
grandfather and father,

574
01:27:57,486 --> 01:27:59,613
collected kimono before me.

575
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:06,245
I've given a number of valuable kimono to
Mameha. I like to give presents to beautiful girls.

576
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,335
It's for you.

577
01:28:17,214 --> 01:28:22,094
Come, have a closer look.

578
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:26,223
Isn't it lovely?

579
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:37,025
-Try it on.
-The Baron is too kind.

580
01:28:37,025 --> 01:28:42,155
I will happily try it on, with
Mameha, when the Baron returns to Myoko.

581
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:44,116
Who knows when that would be?

582
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:52,749
Put it on now, don't be shy.

583
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:53,750
Don't worry,

584
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:57,504
I have experience in knotting
kimonos, and untying them as well.

585
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:04,011
Please, Mr. Bekku is waiting.

586
01:29:04,011 --> 01:29:09,057
Mr. Bekku is waiting for no one.

587
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:13,520
Please... stop!

588
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:25,324
Please stop now!

589
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:53,477
Sayuri, I only want to have a look.

590
01:29:53,727 --> 01:29:59,024
No harm in that. Any
man would do the same.

591
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:14,266
I heard a message on the wind.

592
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:18,645
So careless! You have
ruined all our plans!

593
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:21,732
-I did nothing.
-Sayuri, do not insult me.

594
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:23,692
I know the Baron better than that..

595
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:26,945
-He gave me a kimono.
-You sold yourself for a kimono!

596
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:31,325
I did not sell myself. Today is the day I
accept bids for your misuage (virginity).

597
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:35,245
But what kind of price can I hope to
demand with a finger pointed at your back?

598
01:31:35,245 --> 01:31:40,459
-He looked at me that's all big-sister. -You
will be examined at the misuage ceremony.

599
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:44,671
-If you are found to be worthless...
-I am not worthless!

600
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:47,049
I am not worthless.

601
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:06,485
How much longer is this
bidding going to take?

602
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:15,577
Besides, who wants a plum when
someone has already had a bite?

603
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:34,805
What is it? Twenty yen, thirty?

604
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:42,729
-This can't be the right amount.
-I trust you agree, I have won the wager.

605
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:47,359
Sayuri's made history, no misuage
has ever been sold for more.

606
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:52,197
Not even mine. Fifteen thousand yen.

607
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:57,077
Unbelievable. Thank you sister.

608
01:32:57,077 --> 01:33:02,249
Of course none of it will go
to Sayuri, or to you Mameha.

609
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:09,590
It goes to this okea. All fifteen
thousand yen. To this estate.

610
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:17,306
-I do not understand.
-That, Sayuri, you will inherit as my adopted daughter.

611
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:20,225
-What?
-You wouldn't dare!

612
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:23,187
I'm entitled to do as I choose.

613
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:25,564
But you promised the okea to Pumpkin!

614
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:33,822
Look at her, still a
virgin apprentice. Pumpkin!

615
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:37,743
Can't you adopt us both? Quiet Sayuri.

616
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:43,916
Now I'm no fool. Pumpkin would
only be Hatsumomo's puppet.

617
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:48,462
How long would it take before
you kick us out onto the street?

618
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:59,848
-I have given you my life.
-Yes, and your impudence, your vile temper.

619
01:33:59,848 --> 01:34:02,643
Who paid for that kimono on your back,

620
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:06,188
The rest in your ... The tobacco
in that paper of yours? Who?

621
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:10,651
Don't exaggerate! You have
never even had a patron.

622
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:17,449
Don't say it, don't say it! You
chose that no good Koichi.

623
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,993
Peeking through your window at
all hours of the night. Quiet!

624
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:25,457
Not like a Geisha, like
a common prostitute.

625
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:44,560
Besides, you are getting old. But Sayuri,
Sayuri's destined to become a legend.

626
01:34:57,197 --> 01:35:09,668
My dear Mother. We will see. Won't we?

627
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:21,722
Sayuri, your room is too
small. Take Hatsumomo's.

628
01:35:21,722 --> 01:35:27,477
From now on, your name is Nita Sayuri..

629
01:35:27,477 --> 01:35:31,523
-May I congratulate you both.
-You may.

630
01:35:37,571 --> 01:35:47,706
Big sister.Everything we
wanted you made happen. Thank you.

631
01:35:47,706 --> 01:35:49,625
-May I ask who?
-Dr. Crab.

632
01:35:53,003 --> 01:36:01,637
-Was Nobu disappointed?
-Nobu did not bid. It was against his mighty principles.

633
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:10,229
Dr. Crab was opposed my the Baron, my
Baron. Do you want to know the truth Sayuri?

634
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:16,568
He was the highest bidder. Forgive
me, but I let it go to Dr. Crab..

635
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:20,948
-I think you understand why.
-I swear to you, I am innocent.

636
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:27,663
Of course you are. No man would ever bid
so much for a thing he had already taken.

637
01:36:28,247 --> 01:36:34,878
It was my own fault.
I did not protect you.

638
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:46,223
Celebrate this moment Sayuri. Tonight, the
lights in the Hanamachi all burn for you..

639
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:28,659
My daughter...

640
01:38:38,168 --> 01:38:41,839
You are a full geisha now.

641
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:06,780
What are you doing in my room?

642
01:39:11,869 --> 01:39:15,205
I came to congratulate you.

643
01:39:17,165 --> 01:39:21,211
Please get out.

644
01:39:21,211 --> 01:39:26,800
Why little Chiyo, look what I've found.

645
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,345
His initials, how elegant.

646
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:32,389
You've been hiding your
love for a long time.

647
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:37,644
-The sacrifice every Geisha must make.
-Don't!

648
01:40:01,793 --> 01:40:05,339
Is this where you keep
it? Next to your heart?

649
01:40:16,225 --> 01:40:18,310
Give it back!

650
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:27,611
Give it back!

651
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:11,548
<i>I could be her. Now I
am Geisha to this house.</i>

652
01:42:14,426 --> 01:42:20,933
<i>I could be her. Were we so
different? She loved once. She hoped once.</i>

653
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:33,820
<i>I might be looking into my own future. Until
the real future came falling from the air.</i>

654
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:05,454
-Korin, have you see Sayuri?
-No... I don't know.

655
01:44:16,048 --> 01:44:21,136
Chairman! They are sending us
away but they won't say where.

656
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:25,849
Osaka, but you must not go.
The city is a prime target.

657
01:44:26,225 --> 01:44:29,311
Get your things, quickly.

658
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:33,732
Nobu and I are trying to find safe
havens for  as many people as we can.

659
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:35,776
Come.

660
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:47,371
Here, work certificates, nurse's aid. A
friend of mine is the chief surgeon in Kamioka.

661
01:44:47,371 --> 01:44:50,040
What about Sayuri? Can't we go together?

662
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,376
Don't worry, she will be taken care of.

663
01:44:57,756 --> 01:44:59,258
Here we go.

664
01:44:59,842 --> 01:45:02,219
-Sayuri.
-Big sister.

665
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:09,726
Sayuri come. This is Alima, he
will take you into the hills.

666
01:45:09,726 --> 01:45:18,360
Nobu has got a friend there, a kimono
maker. Anyone stops you, show them this.

667
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:24,116
- Do I have to go?
-It's remote, you will be safe.

668
01:45:24,449 --> 01:45:27,035
What about you? You said
Osaka was dangerous..

669
01:45:28,662 --> 01:45:37,421
Our factory is there, I have no choice.

670
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:43,385
Go, I will express your
gratitude to Nobu-san.

671
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:14,416
<i>A year without news, except news of
death. Defeat. Shame. Rumours of cities…</i>

672
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:24,343
<i>… evaporating into clouds of smoke.
Then another year, and then another.</i>

673
01:46:24,343 --> 01:46:29,139
<i>Until the old life is a dream-life.</i>

674
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:32,351
<i>Was I ever a Geisha?</i>

675
01:46:32,351 --> 01:46:44,780
<i>Did I ever dance, holding a fan? Who would
hold a fan now... or paint their lips?</i>

676
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:53,038
<i>And then another
year. Nothing. Rice… work.</i>

677
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:59,086
<i>Rice… work. Nothing.</i>

678
01:47:05,717 --> 01:47:08,095
Sayuri.

679
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:13,934
Sayuri, a man from
Osaka has come to see you.

680
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:40,627
Nobu-san.

681
01:47:47,342 --> 01:47:50,179
General Tottori was captured
and tried as a war criminal..

682
01:47:50,762 --> 01:47:57,769
-The Baron lost his fortune and committed suicide.
-What about the okea?

683
01:47:58,187 --> 01:48:01,190
-Mr. Bekku has gone, but the others...
-Auntie and mother?

684
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,402
Indestructible as always.

685
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:14,953
-And the chairman?
-As well as can be expected.

686
01:48:17,456 --> 01:48:21,126
This is all that
remains of our factories.

687
01:48:24,588 --> 01:48:26,381
I'm so sorry Nobu-san.

688
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:31,053
Sayuri...

689
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:41,396
We want to rebuild, but to do
that we will need your help.

690
01:48:41,396 --> 01:48:43,190
What can I do?

691
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:50,489
Somewhere, under those rags, are you
still the greatest Geisha in Myoko?

692
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:58,038
If a tree has no leaves or branches,
can you still call that a tree?

693
01:48:59,706 --> 01:49:05,087
With nothing but rubble at my feet,
can I  still call myself a businessman?

694
01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:20,477
I should have taken better care
of you. Please, you saved my life.

695
01:49:22,646 --> 01:49:24,898
I owe you so much in return.

696
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:31,697
The chairman and I
need American financing.

697
01:49:31,697 --> 01:49:38,704
There is a man, a certain Colonel Derricks
who has the power to grant us a contract.

698
01:49:38,704 --> 01:49:42,583
I showed him your
picture. He asked to meet you.

699
01:49:49,298 --> 01:49:56,138
I am not a persuasive man Sayuri,
but if you, and a few Geisha,

700
01:49:56,138 --> 01:49:58,682
would once again put on
your kimono and join us,

701
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,896
we can show the Americans how
hospitable our country can be.

702
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:11,361
How I wish Nobu-san. But
that was a long time ago.

703
01:50:11,361 --> 01:50:18,410
I have no doubt Sayuri, that you could
still melt the heart of any man....

704
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:23,957
... no matter how resistant.

705
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:28,670
I am not accustomed to begging,

706
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:29,922
but please know that...

707
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:36,053
… if you consent, the Chairman
and I would be most grateful.

708
01:51:12,798 --> 01:51:19,137
<i>The Chairman needed me. But I was a
far cry from the Geisha I had once been.</i>

709
01:51:21,348 --> 01:51:25,477
<i>The secrets of our hidden world were
postcards now for girls back home.</i>

710
01:51:27,479 --> 01:51:30,983
<i>Any street-walker with a
painted face and silk kimono…</i>

711
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:33,819
<i>… could call herself a Geisha..</i>

712
01:51:36,363 --> 01:51:40,492
<i>I looked for the one person
who might help. Mameha.</i>

713
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:51,753
<i>The war was written on her face. Everything about
her, not just her home, was less than before.</i>

714
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:57,926
Sayuri, when my poor Baron filled his
pockets with stones, I was desperate.

715
01:51:57,926 --> 01:52:02,973
What could I do? I sold my kimono.
I traded my jade cones for rations.

716
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:07,686
It was painful at first,
but I have made my peace.

717
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:13,692
Now, I make a small but
tidy living renting rooms.

718
01:52:13,692 --> 01:52:20,115
-I am not about to go chasing the past.
-It might do you good.

719
01:52:20,115 --> 01:52:21,116
How?

720
01:52:21,116 --> 01:52:31,043
To remind you that once with a single glance, you
could bring a man like the Baron, to his knees.

721
01:52:35,839 --> 01:52:39,426
Well, I did keep one kimono.

722
01:52:51,438 --> 01:52:54,441
The Baron gave it to me
when he became my patron.

723
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:03,116
Thank you big-sister.

724
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:13,418
So tell me. What do we know
about entertaining Americans?

725
01:53:51,164 --> 01:53:54,793
Chiyo-chan, is that you?

726
01:54:06,597 --> 01:54:10,434
I have no right to ask favours
of you Pumpkin, I know that .

727
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:13,270
Guess what? I only
smoke Chesterfield's now.

728
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:17,107
I've wanted to apologise to you
for so long,about the okea.

729
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:19,651
These soldier boys, you know
who they've got me singing?

730
01:54:19,651 --> 01:54:23,238
-It should have gone to you, not me.
-Frank Sinatra...

731
01:54:23,238 --> 01:54:31,455
-If it is in your heart to forgive me...
-Sayuri don't.

732
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:39,171
The honest truth? I'd rather chew
sand than go back to all that.

733
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:45,135
Then you are not angry with me?

734
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:51,683
Don't worry about me chica-dee.. I've
got more clients than I can handle.

735
01:54:52,601 --> 01:54:54,811
You see so at-home
with these Americans.

736
01:54:56,438 --> 01:54:57,981
They're bastards!

737
01:55:00,275 --> 01:55:03,320
So, who's this colonel?

738
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,531
Sounds like top-brass.

739
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:11,537
He has the power to approve American
funding for Nobu and the Chairman.

740
01:55:11,537 --> 01:55:19,211
So, is he willing to pay
us American dollars? Cash?

741
01:55:19,211 --> 01:55:24,007
Don't waste my time. You
think I'm a sucker?

742
01:55:24,007 --> 01:55:32,724
I want sixty cases of Lucky Strike or
I'm taking my business to Sgt. McFee.

743
01:55:32,724 --> 01:55:35,686
<i>I had to become a Geisha once more.</i>

744
01:55:36,186 --> 01:55:42,109
<i>Mother had reopened the okea,
but my powder-box was empty.</i>

745
01:55:42,109 --> 01:55:46,113
<i>My charcoal had turned to dust.</i>

746
01:55:46,113 --> 01:55:51,535
<i>And yet, it was my one chance
to see the Chairman again.</i>

747
01:55:51,535 --> 01:55:55,956
<i>Would he notice my weathered
hands? The threadbare silk?</i>

748
01:55:55,956 --> 01:56:00,210
See...? You are yourself again.

749
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:05,757
<i>The world had changed
completely. Had he?</i>

750
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:13,599
<i>And would I finally find the
strength to tell him all that I felt?</i>

751
01:56:34,161 --> 01:56:40,292
Just look at you Sayuri, it's
as if the war did not happen.

752
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:43,128
I'm so glad to see that
the Chairman's safe.

753
01:56:43,128 --> 01:56:46,673
-Please accept my apologies asking this of you.
-No

754
01:56:46,673 --> 01:56:49,009
There's nothing I can't
do to return your kindness.

755
01:56:51,428 --> 01:56:53,430
I've wanted to tell you that... Sayuri!

756
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:01,897
May I present Colonel
Derricks. Konichiwa.

757
01:57:05,442 --> 01:57:06,985
My god, you're more stunning in person.

758
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:09,905
This is my associate Lt. Hutchins.

759
01:57:11,782 --> 01:57:14,826
Sayuri is one of the mysteries
of the orient I told you about.

760
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:19,498
-A mystery that perhaps you can solve.
-Would you mind? Can we?

761
01:57:19,498 --> 01:57:22,835
Yes, of course. Colonel?

762
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:28,549
Beautiful.

763
01:57:29,258 --> 01:57:33,846
Hey, who likes whisky?

764
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:37,808
Chairman, don't tell me you've
started the party without me.

765
01:57:37,808 --> 01:57:42,145
May I present Pumpkin?

766
01:57:48,068 --> 01:57:49,903
Gentlemen.

767
01:57:52,781 --> 01:57:56,201
You haven't change!You
look like a little boy!

768
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:48,420
Good for him,not too good for us!

769
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:53,967
-May we join you gentlemen?
-Yes please,I could get used to this!

770
01:58:53,967 --> 01:58:58,889
Back home a bath is nothin' more than a
shower and a cold towel with a lotta soap. Right?

771
01:58:59,223 --> 01:59:05,896
-But here you make everything a ritual don't you?
-That is the art of turning habit into pleasure Colonel.

772
01:59:05,896 --> 01:59:11,401
Spoken like a true Geisha.
- If we are in business together, then perhaps we will visit you some day.

773
01:59:12,277 --> 01:59:16,782
-I would like to see the United States.
-I know a little game we can play.

774
01:59:16,782 --> 01:59:22,162
-It's called truth and lies.
-I know this game.

775
01:59:22,162 --> 01:59:26,750
Back home we call it marriage.

776
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:30,754
No,I'm serious.Now listen closely,

777
01:59:30,754 --> 01:59:32,047
Sayuri knows the rules.

778
01:59:32,047 --> 01:59:34,925
And every married woman who didn't!

779
01:59:34,925 --> 01:59:38,470
Each person says two things.
One is true, the other is not.

780
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:41,682
If you guess right,
the liar pays the price.

781
01:59:43,684 --> 01:59:47,437
So it pays to lose? There you go.

782
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:52,484
Ok I go first.Let's see.

783
01:59:52,484 --> 01:59:59,283
One day in Sapporo, where I was born,
a  fisherman caught a Token-fish...

784
01:59:59,283 --> 02:00:02,536
The other story is the true
one, and I haven't even heard it yet.

785
02:00:03,912 --> 02:00:11,920
-Now you drink.
-If I drown, it's all your fault.

786
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:16,341
Please, I am no match for these
Geisha, they are expert in the art of deceit.

787
02:00:16,842 --> 02:00:21,346
I'm an expert in one thing,
and one thing only, Sake.

788
02:00:23,682 --> 02:00:26,852
Sayuri, the truest story you know.

789
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:35,027
Once, when I was a little girl,
on the banks of the Sunagawa,

790
02:00:35,027 --> 02:00:40,240
a handsome stranger was kind enough
to buy me a cup of sweet ice...

791
02:00:40,407 --> 02:00:42,367
I think we have to stop the game…

792
02:00:42,367 --> 02:00:44,536
… if Pumpkin drinks any
more Sake, she will pass out.

793
02:00:44,536 --> 02:00:48,665
Ooh,that is the true story...

794
02:00:55,964 --> 02:01:01,094
So, what is the protocol?

795
02:01:01,094 --> 02:01:05,766
- Excuse me?
-Suppose I wanted to see you in private...

796
02:01:05,766 --> 02:01:08,810
I beg your pardon Colonel, that
is not a Geisha's custom.

797
02:01:13,148 --> 02:01:15,192
If it's a question of price?

798
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:20,030
If there were a price,
you could never afford it.

799
02:01:22,533 --> 02:01:27,412
I saw the two of you whispering. You have
arranged some kind of twist, haven't you?

800
02:01:27,412 --> 02:01:28,830
What did you promise him?

801
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:33,001
Your company, nothing more. He
seemed to expect a great deal.

802
02:01:33,001 --> 02:01:36,463
If I wanted a common whore,
I could have hired one.

803
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:42,594
-What are you trying to say?.
-Just the idea of you, with him,with any man,

804
02:01:42,594 --> 02:01:45,055
you would be dead to me.

805
02:01:54,773 --> 02:01:57,192
Can't you see that I
want you for myself?

806
02:01:59,403 --> 02:02:07,286
You have ruined me. Before we
met I was a disciplined man.

807
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:15,919
I should have listened to him.

808
02:02:26,972 --> 02:02:29,933
I must beg your forgiveness Nobu-san.

809
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:36,398
I was foolish to think
you would barter me away.

810
02:02:36,398 --> 02:02:40,986
Please, don't insult me again.

811
02:02:41,153 --> 02:02:46,867
If he ratifies our contract, then
I will be a man of means again.

812
02:02:46,867 --> 02:02:57,920
There is nothing I want more
Sayuri, than to become your patron.

813
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,298
-I already owe you far too much.
-I will not be refused.

814
02:03:01,298 --> 02:03:04,676
-Please don't...
- We are tied to each other. I know you feel it too.

815
02:03:05,594 --> 02:03:07,095
I never meant to mislead you.

816
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:12,726
Sayuri…

817
02:03:14,937 --> 02:03:24,696
I do not like things held out
before me, that I cannot have.

818
02:03:24,696 --> 02:03:29,368
When you first introduced me to Nobu, I
was such a fool to give him my attention.

819
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:32,162
-You cannot refuse him, you must not.
-But Mameha...

820
02:03:32,162 --> 02:03:36,375
-What is he to think? He safeguarded your life!
-So he owns it?!

821
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:41,046
Sayuri, I know what it is like to
try to scrape by without a patron.

822
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:43,006
I would do something,anything else.

823
02:03:43,006 --> 02:03:48,428
Leting rooms,scrounging for every
meal? Is this the life that you want?

824
02:03:48,428 --> 02:03:54,560
-I want a life that is mine!
- Nobu has never treated you with another other than kindness.

825
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,480
-I don't want mere kindness.
-What? What more can we expect?

826
02:03:58,814 --> 02:04:00,399
We're Geisha.

827
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,902
You had feelings for
the Baron didn't you?

828
02:04:07,614 --> 02:04:12,202
-I never allowed myself that.
-Don't lie to me.

829
02:04:12,202 --> 02:04:15,873
-In time, you learn.
-I don't want to learn!

830
02:04:15,873 --> 02:04:18,458
Sayuri!

831
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:21,587
We don't become Geisha to
pursue our own destinies.

832
02:04:21,879 --> 02:04:24,882
We become Geisha because
we have no choice.

833
02:04:44,276 --> 02:04:46,987
-Pumpkin!
-What is it, what's wrong?

834
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:50,908
-Nothing. I have a favour to ask, that's all.
-Ask.

835
02:04:52,075 --> 02:04:57,331
At nine o'clock, bring Nobu to the
pool, on the far side of the garden.

836
02:04:57,331 --> 02:05:02,085
Not a minute before,
not a minute after. Yes?

837
02:05:02,085 --> 02:05:06,215
And please, do not tell Nobu
that I will be there waiting.

838
02:05:06,215 --> 02:05:09,510
-It's a surprise?
-Yes. It's a surprise.

839
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:27,504
-Wait!
-Are we doing this or not?

840
02:06:28,172 --> 02:06:30,299
Yes?

841
02:07:01,455 --> 02:07:05,292
Chairman? Chairman!

842
02:07:13,509 --> 02:07:18,347
How could you? You don't
know what you have done.

843
02:07:18,388 --> 02:07:24,853
-But I do.
-I do not understand.

844
02:07:25,145 --> 02:07:29,900
-Why did you have to bring the Chairman?
-Because I know how you feel about him.

845
02:07:31,902 --> 02:07:42,913
A long time ago, you took something from
me. The only thing I ever truly wanted.

846
02:07:42,913 --> 02:07:46,708
Well... now you know how it feels.

847
02:09:21,678 --> 02:09:30,812
<i>The heart dies, a slow death,
shedding each hope like leaves...</i>

848
02:09:30,812 --> 02:09:40,322
<i>... until one day there are
none. No hopes. Nothing remains.</i>

849
02:09:41,323 --> 02:09:47,663
<i>She paints her face to hide her
face. Her eyes like deep water.</i>

850
02:09:50,123 --> 02:09:58,257
<i>It is not for Geisha to
want. It is not for Geisha to feel.</i>

851
02:09:58,841 --> 02:10:02,427
<i>Geisha is an artist
of the floating world.</i>

852
02:10:04,096 --> 02:10:19,319
<i>She dances. She sings. She entertains you,whatever
you want. The rest is shadows. The rest is secret.</i>

853
02:10:29,746 --> 02:10:38,755
Sayuri, quick quick, the tea-house just called.
You are to meet a very important client tonight.

854
02:10:38,797 --> 02:10:42,009
-Who?
-It must be Nobu.

855
02:10:42,384 --> 02:10:43,844
Yes.

856
02:10:45,846 --> 02:10:51,894
He's going to be one of
the richest men in Osaka.

857
02:10:51,852 --> 02:10:58,025
He'll want to honour his
promise, to become your patron at last.

858
02:11:04,114 --> 02:11:10,120
It's about time, finally.
A return on my investment.

859
02:11:11,747 --> 02:11:21,882
-Giko, maybe one day, you'll be as lucky.
-No Geisha can ever hope for more.

860
02:12:37,624 --> 02:12:41,211
Chairman! Where is Nobu-san?

861
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:44,673
-He won't be coming.
-Is something wrong?

862
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:48,802
He knows what happened. It is
not in his nature to forgive.

863
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:55,934
Chairman, what happened on the island...

864
02:12:56,185 --> 02:13:01,023
Please, you do not have to
explain. But I have shamed myself so deeply…

865
02:13:02,941 --> 02:13:10,866
… past all forgiveness. No, I
am the one who must be forgiven.

866
02:13:11,491 --> 02:13:21,084
-I do not understand.
-Perhaps if you had only known the truth.

867
02:13:22,377 --> 02:13:24,755
The truth?

868
02:13:27,299 --> 02:13:36,391
Some years ago, I was on my way to the theatre,
I saw a little girl weeping by the Sunagawa,

869
02:13:36,767 --> 02:13:43,899
-I stopped to buy her a cup of sweet ice.
-You knew I was that little girl?

870
02:13:44,733 --> 02:13:51,114
Didn't you ever wonder why
Mameha took you under her wing?

871
02:13:51,323 --> 02:13:53,700
Mameha came to me because of you.

872
02:14:01,917 --> 02:14:05,754
I wish you could have told me long ago.

873
02:14:05,754 --> 02:14:10,551
What could I do? I owe Nobu my life. .

874
02:14:10,551 --> 02:14:16,348
And so, when I saw he had a chance
at happiness with you, I stood silent.

875
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:20,352
But...

876
02:14:22,104 --> 02:14:30,904
But I cannot any longer. I
hope... it is not too late.

877
02:14:35,868 --> 02:14:43,292
Don't be afraid to look at me
- Chiyo.

878
02:14:52,342 --> 02:15:04,605
Can't you see? Every step I have
taken, since I was that child on the bridge,

879
02:15:04,605 --> 02:15:08,025
has been to bring myself closer to you.

880
02:16:13,048 --> 02:16:20,806
<i>You cannot say to the sun “more
sun,” or to the rain “less rain.”</i>

881
02:16:21,223 --> 02:16:24,852
<i>To a man Geisha can only be half a wife.</i>

882
02:16:25,602 --> 02:16:32,693
<i>We are the wives of
nightfall. And yet to learn of kindness…</i>

883
02:16:33,026 --> 02:16:41,827
<i>… after so much unkindness. To understand that
a little girl with more courage than she knew,</i>

884
02:16:41,827 --> 02:16:49,418
<i>would find that her prayers were
answered. Can that not be called happiness?</i>

885
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:56,842
<i>After all, these are not the memoirs
of an empress, nor of a queen…</i>

886
02:16:57,843 --> 02:17:01,889
<i>… these are memoirs of another kind.</i>

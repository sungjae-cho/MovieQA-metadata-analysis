1
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
In order to show you how

2
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,280
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

3
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,440
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
which is made up
of smaller pieces

5
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,200
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,800
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,120
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,320
which is a beautiful melody

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,760
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,280
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

12
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,400
Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear the four
different families of the orchestra

13
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,400
playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

14
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,280
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

15
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,000
The flutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.

16
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Here comes the brass family.

17
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,520
The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.

18
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
One to four.

19
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,360
Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.

20
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,480
I'm sick of this rain.

21
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,960
The violins, the violas, the
cellos and the double basses.

22
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,400
And of course, the harp.

23
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,680
And finally
the percussion family,

24
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,040
all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.

25
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,200
After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell

26
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,200
played once more in its original
form by all four families together.

27
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,560
That is, the whole orchestra.

28
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
This is
the island of New Penzance.

29
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,720
16 miles long.

30
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,840
Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.

31
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.

32
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,080
Chickchaw territory.

33
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
There are no
paved roads, but...

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Here comes Jed with the mail.

35
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,040
But instead many miles of intersecting
footpaths and dirt trails,

36
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,160
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

37
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,480
The year is 1965.

38
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,520
We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,

39
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,

40
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
which will strike from the
east on the 5th of September.

41
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
In three days' time.

42
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Morning, Gadge.

43
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
Morning, sir.

44
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Deluca, latrine inspection.

45
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,520
Good.

46
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?

47
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,000
Horrible.

48
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,800
Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?

49
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
We're building a tree house.

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
- Where?
- Right here.

51
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,560
That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?

52
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,720
If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.

53
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Well, where would
you have built it?

54
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,160
Lower.

55
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Nickleby? What are you doing?

56
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,520
Pest control.
Burning some ants.

57
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,240
Spot check.

58
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,000
Your socks are down,
your shirt tails are untucked,

59
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,480
your trousers are
not properly pressed.

60
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,000
You are reported for
a uniform violation.

61
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
How many rockets
you up to, Panagle?

62
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
Sixteen and a half, sir.

63
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,760
Is that enough
for the Hullabaloo?

64
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,400
Izod, go fetch another pint of
gunpowder from the armory shed.

65
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,840
Redford! Halt! I saw that!

66
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
- How fast were you just going?
- Safety test, sir.

67
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,080
Come again?

68
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
The vehicle
appears to be in good working order,

69
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm just checking if...

70
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Reckless cycling.
Second warning.

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Next time,
I take away the keys.

72
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
Morning, Chef.

73
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,800
Clear!

74
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,840
Who's missing?

75
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,880
- Who's missing?
- Shakusky.

76
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,080
- Shakusky.
- Shakusky.

77
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Shakusky! Breakfast!

78
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,320
Shakusky, you in there?

79
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Sam?

80
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
It's zipped from the inside.

81
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,840
Jiminy Cricket,
he flew the coop.

82
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp, over.

83
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

84
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,880
Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.

85
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

86
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,640
What does that mean? Over.

87
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,320
One of my boys
seems to have stolen

88
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,320
a miniature canoe and
some fishing tackle,

89
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,360
10 pounds of sundries,
two bedrolls, plus an air rifle.

90
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
And disappeared. Over.

91
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
Any idea why? Over.

92
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,160
No. He left me
a letter of resignation. Over.

93
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Dear Scout Master Ward,

94
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,240
I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved

95
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,160
with the Khaki
Scouts of North America.

96
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,440
The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.

97
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
It is not your fault.

98
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
Well, I guess we better
notify his folks. Over.

100
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
Okay. Over and out.

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
Hello, Diane.

102
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Becky, I have your
person-to-person from Chesterfield

103
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,960
Hold the line, please.

104
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
Hello?

105
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.

106
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.

107
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,560
In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,

108
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,800
because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,

109
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,000
and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

110
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,440
we can't invite him
back at this time.

111
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,600
There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.

112
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,400
We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.

113
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,760
I understand that. I'm notifying
you of the situation on my end.

114
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?

115
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,520
But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?

117
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,440
He's emotionally disturbed.

118
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
Am I speaking
with Sam's father?

119
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,560
No, sir.

120
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,840
Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.

121
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,960
We're Mr. and
Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents.

122
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,120
Sam's been with
us since last June.

123
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Excuse me, sir.
This is Scout Master Ward speaking.

124
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,720
Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?

127
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Excuse my language.

128
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
I don't know. What register?

129
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,920
We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.

130
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,080
Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.

131
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,440
We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.

132
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,720
You say you can't invite him back?
You say that he's an orphan?

133
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,040
I don't understand
how that works.

134
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,640
What am I supposed
to do with him?

135
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,360
That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.

136
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,200
They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.

137
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
You have your orders.

138
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,760
Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills

139
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,400
that you've been
practicing all summer.

140
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.

141
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Remember, this isn't
just a search party,

142
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,840
it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.

143
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,080
Any questions?

144
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,280
Lazy-Eye?

145
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
What's your real job, sir?

146
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?

147
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?

148
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,000
Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,

149
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,640
we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.

150
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,840
One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,960
Anybody else? Redford?

152
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
What if he resists?

153
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
- Who?
- Shakusky.

154
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,400
Are we allowed to
use force on him?

155
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,640
No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.

156
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,080
Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.

157
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Am I making myself understood?

158
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,920
- Yes.
- Good.

159
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.

160
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,720
Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,520
Be leery out there. Okay?

162
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?

163
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
Right here.

164
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
Give him the scent.

165
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,680
I heard he ran away
because his family died.

166
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

167
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
That's probably why he's crazy.

168
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,640
I'll tell you one thing,

169
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,480
if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.

170
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,520
Me, neither.

171
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,440
Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.

172
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,800
You really think
a 12-year-old boy

173
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

174
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
Most likely not.

175
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
It is possible, Counselor.

176
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,760
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

177
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,280
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

178
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,

179
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,640
- will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
- Yup.

180
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,320
Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.

181
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky

182
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,480
Morale is extremely low,

183
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,600
in part, I suppose,

184
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,960
because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.

185
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
By a significant margin.

186
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm confused and I'm worried.

187
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,760
Please let us
find him tomorrow.

188
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,160
Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,

189
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,440
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.

190
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,120
A terrible day at Camp Ivanhoe.

191
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Let's hope tomorrow's better.

192
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,920
One Year earlier

193
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
What kind of bird are you?

194
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm a sparrow, she's a dove...

195
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,400
No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?

196
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm a raven.

197
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Boys aren't allowed in here.

198
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,120
I'll be leaving soon.

199
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,440
What happened to your hand?

200
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,240
I got hit in the mirror.

201
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,040
Really, how did that happen?

202
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
I lost my temper at myself.

203
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,800
What's your name?

204
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,120
Sam. What's yours?

205
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm Suzy.

206
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,040
It's not polite to stare.

207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,720
- Birds, ready?
- Who are you?

208
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,360
Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.

209
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
He likes you.

210
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,720
Were you followed?

211
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
- I doubt it.
- Good.

212
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,480
Is that a cat in there?

213
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,920
Can you read a map?

214
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,520
I do cartography.

215
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,720
I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow

216
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,200
since you're a less
experienced hiker,

217
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,320
and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.

218
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
They're not really
Sunday school shoes.

219
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Here.

220
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
Oh, thank you.

221
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,720
Here's where we are right now.

222
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,920
I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,

223
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,840
which means 4:00.
How does that sound?

224
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,800
- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?

225
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
- Okay.
- Let's go.

226
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
Are you thirsty?

227
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
No, thank you.

228
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,080
Well, if your throat
gets parched,

229
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,960
stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.

230
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,920
You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.

231
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,360
Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.

232
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
That's a good idea.

233
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,880
It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.

234
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah. True.

235
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
You can go ahead. Be careful.

236
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air

237
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,320
and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.

238
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Which Way?

239
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
I guess it
doesn't really matter,

240
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
just as long as we
cover our tracks.

241
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
You smell like perfume.

242
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
Oh, it's my mother's.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,880
I brought water, too.

244
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,840
- You wait here.
- Okay.

245
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,480
Be right back.

246
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
Watch your head!

247
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,240
Where the hell is it?

248
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
Found it!

249
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,480
It's ready.

250
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,920
He knows someone's
watching him.

251
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?

252
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,760
I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.

253
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,680
Follow me.

254
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,680
How strong of
a swimmer are you?

255
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,520
Pretty good. I broke our school
record for the backstroke.

256
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,160
Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.

257
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,160
Watch out for turtles.

258
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,760
They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.

259
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,400
Okay.

260
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,200
Let me see if I
can catch this one.

261
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
Feel something.

262
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,800
Somebody wrote on him.

263
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,800
The stick's moving.

264
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,040
You got one!

265
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,040
Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.

266
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,680
Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?

267
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.

268
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,120
Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.

269
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,880
Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.

270
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,280
Oh.

271
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,680
What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.

272
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,640
Okay.

273
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,160
Go ahead.

274
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,200
This is my record player.
It works with batteries.

275
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,640
Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

276
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
- I left him a note.
- Okay.

277
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,160
- Do you like music?
- Yeah.

278
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
This is my
favorite record album.

279
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.

280
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
She lives in France.

281
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,520
These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.

282
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,040
Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.

283
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,240
Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.

284
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,440
I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.

285
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,640
You can borrow any you want.

286
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,760
Thank you.

287
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,720
I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,

288
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,320
some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,

289
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,480
and my binoculars, as you know.

290
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,600
Yeah.

291
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,880
I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.

292
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,560
Wait, these are all
library books.

293
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,520
In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.

294
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,840
Some of these are
going to be overdue.

295
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,920
Do you steal?

296
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,200
Why? You're not poor.

297
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,080
I might turn some of them back in one day.
I haven't decided yet.

298
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,720
I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.

299
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,480
Anyway, for some reason,

300
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,200
it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.

301
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,400
Are you depressed?

302
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,400
How come?

303
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,760
Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,

304
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,520
but it doesn't make
me feel very good.

305
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,920
Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.

306
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,320
Does that mean you?

307
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,840
I think so.

308
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,400
Are you laughing?

309
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,800
It's not funny.

310
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,080
You really know
how to make friends.

311
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
I'm sorry.

312
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh. It's okay.

313
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,360
I'm on your side.

314
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,160
I know.

315
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,600
Thank you.

316
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,120
Which one's the best?

317
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,360
"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw"

318
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows"

319
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,080
"and down to its stone floor."

320
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,240
"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast"

321
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'"

322
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,400
"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested."

323
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
"There would be
another time for war."

324
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,920
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.

325
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,720
Where's your sister?

326
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,120
I don't know, but she borrowed my record
player for 10 days without asking.

327
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
What does that mean?

328
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,320
Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.

329
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,960
I will give it back in 10 days or less.
Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.

330
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,240
I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.

331
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,760
Walt! Where the hell are you?

332
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,960
Right here!

333
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,960
Why are you cursing at me?

334
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,680
Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?

335
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,120
That's a loaded question.

336
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,960
Come down and read this.

337
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,240
Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.

338
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,360
They're going home for...

339
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,520
Who's there?

340
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,280
Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.

341
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,880
What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.

342
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,280
I know. I know.

343
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
The search party's
not over yet. In other words...

344
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.

345
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,240
The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week

346
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,120
off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly

347
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,800
and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.

348
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,600
Stay tuned for
further information

349
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,480
How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.

350
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
It's getting worse.

351
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Whose fault is it?

352
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,440
I don't know.

353
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,920
But just for the record
95% of all runaways

354
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,880
return home within
the first six hours.

355
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,440
That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.

356
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,320
But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet

357
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,680
at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers

358
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,080
at this very moment,
as we speak.

359
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,360
She doesn't have any friends.

360
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,240
How's Laura?

361
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,800
"How's Laura?"

362
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,440
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

363
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,080
I don't understand.

364
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
Is she upset?

365
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,280
There's a porcupine.

366
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,320
She has a pen pal! It's very intimate.
They planned this together.

367
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,600
Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.

368
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,760
His family died.

369
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?

370
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,240
He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.

371
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
She sit for this?

372
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
What's he say?

373
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,240
Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.

374
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,600
You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.

375
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,040
Please find enclosed...

376
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,760
Dear Sam, thank you very much.

377
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,600
I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.

378
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...

379
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.

380
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,760
Maybe they will grow out of it.

381
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,360
Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...

382
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,

383
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
especially trees
and telephone poles.

384
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,120
Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...

385
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,920
Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.

386
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,080
I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.

387
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Unfortunately, it is...

388
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,280
Dear Sam, I am in trouble again

389
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,880
because I threw a rock
through the window.

390
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...

391
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,920
Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,

392
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,480
but I feel people do
not like my personality.

393
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,400
In fact, I can understand
why they might not...

394
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,360
Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended

395
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,960
because I got in
a fight with Molly.

396
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...

397
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,

398
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,520
but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...

399
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,240
Dear Sam, I do think you should

400
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,480
think of their faces every day,

401
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,040
even if it makes you sad.

402
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,560
It is too bad they
did not leave you

403
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,560
more pictures of themselves.
Can you...

404
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,560
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

405
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

406
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,120
Dear Suzy, when?

407
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,800
Dear Sam, where?

408
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,360
Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house

409
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,960
to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.

410
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,920
Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.

411
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,960
Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?

412
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.

413
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,480
She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.

414
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,120
Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...

415
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,520
I think he's onto us.

416
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Of course he is.

417
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,360
Of course he is?

418
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,200
Of course he is.

419
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,240
Then why aren't we
worried about that?

420
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
I am.

421
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,640
Well, I didn't know.

422
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,080
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

423
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,200
Did you hit him?

424
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,400
No. He fell in a ditch.

425
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,120
Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.

426
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,920
That's her.

427
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,240
Where's he going?

428
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,480
I don't know.

429
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,680
All right,
we know they're together.

430
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,960
We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.

431
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,280
I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.

432
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,840
Until help arrives, I'm deputizing
the little guy, the skinny one,

433
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,360
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

434
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,760
to come with me in
the station wagon.

435
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,920
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

436
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,240
split up on foot.

437
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,400
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

438
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,920
this end of the island
and fly low.

439
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,440
Is it them?

440
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,560
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
They found the campfire.

442
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,920
Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.

443
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,480
Be careful.

444
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
What do you creeps want?

445
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,280
We're looking for you.

446
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,360
Why?

447
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,320
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

448
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,640
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

449
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,160
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

450
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,520
We've been deputized.

451
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,840
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

452
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
Listen to some reason.

453
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,440
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

454
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,200
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

455
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,080
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

456
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,480
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

457
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Why not?

458
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
Because he's crazy.

459
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,120
Maybe you just don't know him.

460
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,360
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

461
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,360
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

462
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,160
Nickleby, tie him up.

463
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,040
Do not cross this stick.

464
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,320
You're doomed, Shakusky.

465
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,320
Molly's right, I do go berserk.

466
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,280
It was him or us.

467
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,960
Oh, no.

468
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.

469
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
Repeat that, please? Over.

470
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,920
Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.

471
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,520
You're going to be okay.

472
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,560
Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.

473
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,480
I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.

474
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,040
He's got
excellent marksmanship.

475
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,360
Shot Deluca in both arms.

476
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,720
I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.

477
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,120
Where's Snoopy?

478
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Those sons of bitches.

479
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,080
They got him right
through the neck.

480
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,720
Was he a good dog?

481
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,400
Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.

482
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,600
What happened? Who is that?

483
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,760
Clear the dock, Edgar!

484
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,400
- Why is he bleeding?
- Is Suzy with you?

485
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,200
No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.

486
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,320
Where am I going?

487
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,320
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?

488
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,520
Yup.

489
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,880
Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.

490
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,280
Hold it right there!

491
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,400
You're not leaving this island.

492
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,360
Our daughter has been
abducted by one of these beige lunatics.

493
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,800
Walt, it's very clear.

494
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,840
The two of them
conspired in this together.

495
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
Don't worry,
Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

496
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
Sam's got excellent
wilderness skills.

497
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Why can't you
control your Scouts?

498
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,880
Well, I'm trying.

499
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
Hey.

500
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,120
Stop it! Stop it!

501
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
- Stop it!
- Stop it.

502
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,520
I do blame him.
But I also blame myself and both of you.

503
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,080
With all due respect,
you can't let your children stab people.

504
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,720
What are you talking about?

505
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,400
She's violent,
Mrs. Bishop, it's assault.

506
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not a lawyer.

507
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,800
Well, we are!

508
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,960
Take your hands off my wife!

509
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,800
Take them off!

510
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Sharp!

511
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,560
As some of you know,
I taught Sam

512
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,920
for the cartography
accomplishment button.

513
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,320
He's a smart boy
and he expressed a keen interest

514
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,960
in the history of the island's
indigenous peoples.

515
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,480
In particular,
I recall his fascination with the idea

516
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,840
of retracing the original path of the
old Chickchaw harvest migration.

517
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,040
What I'm getting at is this.
I think I know where they're going.

518
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,960
Onto the birdhouse,

519
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,120
where every kind
of bird imaginable

520
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,280
is whirling
and wheeling around.

521
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,760
This is our land!

522
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,440
Yes, it is!

523
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,840
Run!

524
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,720
Let's jump!

525
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,720
On three!

526
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,840
One, two, three!

527
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,360
Any of you who have ever
had to sweat through piano exercises

528
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,600
will sympathize with these...

529
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,760
I like it here,
but I don't like the name.

530
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,240
Me, neither.

531
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,160
"Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"
It's got no ring to it.

532
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,120
Let's change it.
What should it be?

533
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,080
Let me think for a minute.

534
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,200
I made you some jewelry.

535
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,280
Are your ears pierced?

536
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,520
It's pretty.

537
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,800
Do the other one.

538
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,320
Why do you
always use binoculars?

539
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,640
It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.

540
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,520
I pretend it's my magic power.

541
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,880
That sounds like poetry.

542
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,920
Poems don't always
have to rhyme, you know.

543
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,640
They're just
supposed to be creative.

544
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,440
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

545
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,360
I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.

546
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,280
Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?

547
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,000
Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.

548
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,880
Anyway, we can't
predict the exact future.

549
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,840
That's true.

550
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,400
It's possible I may
wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.

551
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,720
Okay.

552
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,560
I wish I didn't
have to mention it, but just in case.

553
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
I don't want to
make you be offended.

554
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,240
Of course I won't.

555
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,520
What's that one for?

556
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,960
- This?
- Yeah.

557
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,840
It's not
an accomplishment button.

558
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,800
I inherited it from my mother.

559
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,640
It's not actually meant for a male to
wear, but I don't give a damn.

560
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,800
Are your foster parents
still mad at you,

561
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,760
for getting in trouble so much?

562
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,160
I don't think so.

563
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
We're starting to get to
know each other better.

564
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
I feel I'm in
a real family now.

565
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,320
Not like yours,
but similar to one.

566
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,920
I always wished
I was an orphan.

567
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
Most of my
favorite characters are.

568
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,200
I think your lives
are more special.

569
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,160
I love you, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

570
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,280
I love you, too.

571
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,000
- I've got sand in my mouth.
- Oh.

572
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,200
Can you French kiss?

573
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,320
I think so.
Is there any secret to it?

574
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,480
The tongues touch each other.

575
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,280
Okay, let's try it.

576
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,160
It feels hard.

577
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,080
Do you mind?

578
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,200
I like it.

579
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,280
Tilt your head sideways.

580
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,120
You can touch my chest.

581
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,040
I... I think they're
going to grow more.

582
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,160
"The flashlight's
beam drew a moon through the black

583
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,840
"across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard.

584
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,560

"'Little brothers

592
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,840
I'm listening. Read on.

593
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,280
Part two.

594
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,040
No!

595
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,520
Dear Sam, it saddens
me to write this letter,

596
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
but Mrs. Billingsley
and I have decided

597
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
we cannot permit you
to return to our home.

598
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,440
I know you mean well.
Do trust me, this is for the best.

599
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Godspeed, Herbert Billingsley.

600
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,960
Be advised, the two of you will
never see each other again.

601
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,920
Those were your last words.
Do you understand?

602
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
I'd be careful if I were you.

603
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,360
One of these days,
somebody's going to get pushed too far,

604
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,160
and who knows what
they're capable of.

605
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,080
Is that a threat?

606
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
It's a warning.

607
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,600
You're a traitor to our family.

608
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,400
Good. I want to be.

609
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,560
I'm sorry about this.
I didn't know your situation.

610
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,680
It wasn't in the register.

611
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,920
How'd you lose your parents?

612
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,040
Never mind, I don't
need to ask about that.

613
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,600
I wish we had time to do an
inspection back there. On the beach.

614
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,800
I would have given
you a commendable.

615
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,000
That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.

616
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,200
Honestly.

617
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,600
Thank you.

618
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,200
You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?

619
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,040
Hello, Becky?

620
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,360
Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.

621
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,480
Go ahead, New Penzance.

622
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,600
Hello, this is Captain Sharp.

623
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,040
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

624
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,720
I'm calling in reference to Sam
Shakusky, ward of the state.

625
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,960
I understand he's
in your custody.

626
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,160
That's correct.

627
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,080
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

628
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,400
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

629
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,200
- He's fine.
- Very good.

630
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,640
How do I get to you?

631
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,240
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

632
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,920
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

633
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,920
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

634
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,760
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

635
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,480
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

636
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,720
Is that a yes?

637
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,720
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

638
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,880
Wait a second.

639
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,200
Yes?

640
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,440
Social Services?

641
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,720
Captain Sharp?

642
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,680
What's going to happen to him?

643
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,440
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

644
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,640
but that option's no
longer available to us,

645
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,920
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

646
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,240
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

647
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,160
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

648
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,840
Who's speaking?

649
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,000
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

650
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,040
Right, an orphanage.

651
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,920
But the first step is
the admissions panel

652
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,680
requires
a psychological evaluation

653
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,160
to determine
whether or not the boy

654
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,200
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

655
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,800
or electroshock therapy.

656
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,880
Excuse me. Shock therapy?

657
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,120
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

658
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,120
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

659
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,360
That was the girl.

660
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,600
That was the girl
that did that.

661
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,200
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

662
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,000
Okay.

663
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,920
I'll be out back.

664
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,920
I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.

665
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,960
I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

666
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,960
I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?"

667
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,520
"Who made this decision?"

668
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,520
"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?"

669
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,920
"And why is it
still happening?"

670
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,560
We women are more emotional...

671
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,080
I hate you.

672
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,400
Don't say "hate."

673
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,920
Why not? I mean it.

674
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,960
You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

675
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,240
Exactly.

676
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,920
I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.

677
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,280
He's not dumb.

678
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,520
But I guess he is kind of sad.

679
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,880
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

680
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,880
It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge

681
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,440
what I already just said.

682
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,560
Poor Suzy.

683
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,080
Why is everything
so hard for you?

684
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,760
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?

685
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,760
Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?

686
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,240
I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.

687
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,240
We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

688
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,600
But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.

689
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,840
When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

690
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,800
That's very eloquent.

691
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,720
I can't argue against
anything you're saying.

692
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,520
But then again, I don't have to,
'cause you're 12 years old.

693
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,720
Look, let's face it.

694
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,920
You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.

695
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,960
In fact, I guarantee it.

696
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,840
But even smart kids
stick their finger

697
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,520
in electrical
sockets sometimes.

698
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,880
It takes time to
figure things out.

699
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,120
It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.

700
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,440
It's our job to
try to protect you

701
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,720
from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.

702
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,440
You want a slug?

703
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,480
What's your rush?

704
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,160
You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.

705
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,600
Ahead of you, I mean.

706
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,480
Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.

707
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,960
So are you.

708
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,080
That's true.

709
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,800
Did you love someone ever?

710
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,160
Yes, I did.

711
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,440
What happened?

712
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,000
She didn't love me back.

713
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,520
I'm sorry for your loss.

714
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,360
Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.

715
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,120
Scout Master's log.
September 4th.

716
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,880
I heard he's going
to reform school.

717
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,840
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

718
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,400
send him to an insane asylum.

719
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,600
I like his girl.

720
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,760
She's too scruffy for me.

721
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,080
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

722
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,640
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

723
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,760
Over shirt or under shirt?

724
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,920
Damn us.

725
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
It's none of our business.

726
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,920
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

727
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,840
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

728
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,200
Why's he so unpopular?

729
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,560
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

730
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,160
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

731
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,320
Nickleby?

732
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,160
Deluca?

733
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,920
Lazy-Eye?

734
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,440
Gadge?

735
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,200
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

736
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,000
Are we man enough to give that

737
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,160
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

738
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,720
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

739
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,960
Okay. Okay. What do you need?

740
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,960
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

741
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,280
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

742
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,200
In other words, it's over.

743
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,040
I guess so. For the moment.

744
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,400
Until further notice.

745
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,600
That's right.

746
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,720
I understand.

747
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,520
I have to do better,
for everybody.

748
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,040
Except me.

749
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,560
Except you.

750
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,400
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

751
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,680
You're doing the right thing.

752
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,800
Who knows what's
going to happen, Duffy?

753
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,600
I'll probably see you tomorrow.

754
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,200
Get out of my chimney.

755
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,480
Listen to me.

756
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,600
We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

757
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,800
No, thanks.

758
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,200
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

759
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,200
It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

760
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,160
How'd you get here?

761
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,880
They snuck me down
the laundry chute

762
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,840
and left a papier-mâché
dummy in my bed.

763
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,200
Diversion tactics.
Good thinking.

764
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,600
Where we going?

765
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,720
Fort Lebanon.

766
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,880
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and
Resources outpost for the Hullabaloo.

767
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,200
He's a Falcon Scout,
Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.

768
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,840
Can we trust him?

769
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,720
Normally, I'd say no.

770
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,360
Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

771
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,520
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

772
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,240
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

773
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,360
True.

774
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,960
This is the island
of St. Jack Wood,

775
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,760
extending far north
from Land's End

776
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,160
along the deep water channel
that leads to Broken Rock.

777
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,880
A low flood plain separates the
beach from the township above.

778
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,440
A small but
prosperous community.

779
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,120
The barometer reads
28 inches and dropping.

780
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,720
Strong winds, as you can see,
already at 22 knots.

781
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,960
The time is now 4:35 a.m.

782
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,400
Did you file the motion
of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?

783
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,720
It was sustained.

784
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,080
Good.

785
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,080
Did the judge consider
your application for leniency?

786
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,520
Rogers v. Yentob?

787
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,440
- He granted it.
- Great.

788
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,600
I'm sorry, Walt.

789
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,920
It's not your fault.

790
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,640
Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

791
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,040
Specifically?

792
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,480
Whichever ones still hurt.

793
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,840
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

794
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,080
I hope the roof flies off,
and I get sucked up into space.

795
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,560
You'll be better
off without me.

796
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,000
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

797
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,840
Why?

798
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,280
We're all they've got, Walt.

799
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,040
That's not enough.

800
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,440
"'But I'm not going, '
said Barnaby Jack.

801
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,800
"'I'm running away
tonight for good.

802
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,000
"'And this time I
won't get caught.'

803
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,400
"Annabelle whispered,
'I'm coming with you.'

804
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,240
"Her yellow hair,
now brown at the roots,

805
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,120
"caught up in
the wind and danced.

806
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,800
"Barnaby Jack
took Annabelle's hand

807
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,520
"and pressed something into it
the size of a jellybean.

808
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,600
"'Hide this in your socks,
and be ready at midnight."'

809
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,080
Continue.

810
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,200
Keep going.

811
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,760
- Keep going.
- Go on.

812
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,960
- We're listening.
- That's good.

813
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,600
"He leapt out the window
and landed in the fresh fallen snow."

814
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,720
Where's my record player?

815
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,400
You're not going to
believe this one, sir.

816
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,480
That Scout Master on
New Penzance has now lost his entire troop.

817
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,120
Well, I'll be damned!

818
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,360
Who is this bimbo?

819
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,600
Couldn't say, sir.

820
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,560
Be right back.

821
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,560
There's a broken gumball machine
right behind the snack tent.

822
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,760
I don't care how they do it
where you come from.

823
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,760
You want pop? You want candy?
You want a snake bite kit?

824
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,960
Get some money.

825
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,600
Cousin Ben?

826
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,720
Come back in five minutes.

827
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,240
Is this him?

828
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Field Mate Sam Shakusky,
Troop 55, resigned.

829
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,200
He's hot. Almost too hot.
What's in the can?

830
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,680
$76, but it's mostly
in nickels.

831
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,840
Give it to me.

832
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,560
- Your badge in seamanship?
- Yes, sir.

833
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,040
Good. There's a cold water
crabber moored off Broken Rock.

834
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,280
The skipper owes me an IOU.

835
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,520
We'll see if he
can take you on as a claw cracker.

836
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,520
It won't be an easy life,
but it's better than shock therapy.

837
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,800
Thank you, sir.

838
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,600
By the way,
where's the chapel tent?

839
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,880
Back there,
but the padre's home with the mumps.

840
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,120
Why do you ask?

841
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
I want to bring my wife.

842
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,080
But we're not married yet.

843
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,280
You his girl?

844
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,400
Yeah.

845
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,280
Technically,
I'm a civil law scrivener.

846
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,960
I'm authorized
to declare births, deaths, and marriages.

847
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,640
You're kind of young.
You got a license?

848
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,000
- No.
- No.

849
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,520
I can't offer you
a legally binding union.

850
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,080
It won't hold up in
the state, the county,

851
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,560
or, frankly,
any courtroom in the world

852
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,040
due to your age,
lack of a license,

853
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,760
and failure to get
parental consent.

854
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,400
But the ritual does
carry a very important

855
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,200
moral weight within yourselves.

856
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,240
You can't enter
into this lightly. Look into my eyes.

857
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,000
- Do you love each other?
- Yes, we do.

858
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,160
But think about
what I'm saying.

859
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,280
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

860
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,000
- Yes, we are.
- They're not listening to me.

861
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,880
- Let me rephrase it.
- We're in a hurry.

862
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,080
Are you chewing...

863
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,560
Spit out the gum, sister.
In fact, everybody.

864
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,080
I don't like
the snappy attitude.

865
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,440
This is the most important decision
you've made in your lives.

866
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,960
Go over by that trampoline
and talk it through

867
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,800
before you give me
another quick answer.

868
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,720
We're sure.

869
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Okay. Let's do a blood test.

870
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,360
Under the eye of God,

871
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,640
and within the boundaries of
this local jurisdiction,

872
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,520
which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the 5th of September, 1965.

873
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,680
That's the end
of the short form.

874
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,720
Do any of the witnesses
have objections or remarks?

875
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,160
Usually they don't. Skotak?

876
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,440
Can we loan them the nickels?
I'm worried about their future.

877
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,440
That's my fee.

878
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,680
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

879
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,160
What'd I just say?
That's my fee. I'm keeping the nickels.

880
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,320
Okay, they can have
the tennis ball can.

881
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,720
Sign here,
initial here and here.

882
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,440
Take the carbon,
leave the Bible. Let's go.

883
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,920
Where are they going, again?

884
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,560
He's going to work on a shrimper,
if I understand correctly.

885
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,560
- I wish them well.
- Me, too.

886
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,440
Me, too.

887
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,120
I think they're coming back.

888
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,960
- Be quick, sailor!
- What happened?

889
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,240
She left her
binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.

890
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,320
Just leave them.

891
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,240
We can't. It's her magic power!

892
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,000
You killed your dog,
by the way.

893
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,520
Snoopy?

894
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,360
Well, it couldn't be helped.

895
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,840
Why do you
consider me your enemy?

896
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,680
Because your
girlfriend stabbed me

897
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,280
in the back with
lefty scissors.

898
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,360
She's my wife now.

899
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,440
Congratulations.

900
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,640
Thank you, but I'm saying before
that, six weeks ago, from day one.

901
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,640
Why don't you like me?

902
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,600
Why should I? Nobody else does.

903
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,640
My God! He's here!
The fugitive! Stop him!

904
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,320
Stop him!

905
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,200
On this spot,
I'll fight no more, forever.

906
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,400
Come and get me, you bastards!

907
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,120
I'm okay.

908
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,520
Follow me.

909
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,360
Company, let's go!

910
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,120
Captain Sharp,
we've located the missing troop.

911
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,280
They just fled camp.
We're in pursuit.

912
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,000
They're accompanied
by a 12-year-old girl

913
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,600
in knee socks
and Sunday school shoes.

914
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,760
Stand by, Commander Pierce.

915
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,080
Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood.

916
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,120
Tell Social Services
the boy's at Fort Lebanon.

917
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,240
Roger that. Will comply.

918
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,920
Notify the Bishops,
Suzy's there.

919
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,080
Randy, you monitoring?

920
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,280
Affirmative. I'm on my way.

921
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,520
Hello?

922
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,640
Hello, Mr. Bishop?

923
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,640
Oh, dear God. Get the boys!

924
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,760
Let's go! Right now!

925
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,800
Tower control, this is Jed.

926
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,880
Confirm coordinates for new
destination, Alpha two-two-seven-one-fiver.

927
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,280
Looking pretty soupy up here.

928
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,240
Wouldn't mind setting down
before the pot boils over.

929
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,600
Hang on, Social Services.

930
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,480
Once again, storm
waters have just breached

931
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,240
the dam at
Black Beacon Reservoir.

932
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,480
A flash flood alert is in effect.
Take immediate precautions

933
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,040
That's coming our way.

934
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,800
Did you find them?

935
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,480
Prepare to mobilize
to higher ground.

936
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,840
St. Jack's Church
is the designated storm shelter.

937
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,920
Notify all Scouts to
muster outside my tent, on the double.

938
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,880
Attention, company!

939
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,560
Prepare for...

940
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,760
Who's that?

941
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,080
You call yourself
a Khaki Scout?

942
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,600
Sorry, sir?

943
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,200
Where's your goddamn troop,
you son of a bitch?

944
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,640
You don't have them?

945
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,080
They could get
killed out there!

946
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,280
I'm field stripping
you of your command.

947
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,560
Attention, company!

948
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,880
Prepare for
emergency evacuation!

949
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,320
Sir, do you have your medicine?

950
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,520
I'll be right back.

951
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,760
Hold your positions!

952
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,960
Company secretary,
status report.

953
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,680
All accounted for,
Scout Master!

954
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,160
Okay, boys,
we're going to make a run for it! Fall in!

955
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,480
Let's move!

956
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,760
Come on, follow me!

957
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,440
Who's in charge here?

958
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,000
Randy, what happened?

959
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,160
Take the commander off me!

960
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Suzy?

961
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,160
Suzy? Sam?

962
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,320
They ran away again.

963
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,040
We got to go back out there.
I need volunteers.

964
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,280
You, and you and you.

965
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,200
- You?
- Are you all right?

966
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,520
Of course I am.

967
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,320
Where's the boy?

968
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,440
We don't know yet.

969
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,840
That's not acceptable.

970
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,560
What do you
want me to say, lady?

971
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,960
Somebody get
Jed a cup of coffee.

972
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,800
- You're Captain Sharp.
- That's correct.

973
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,880
I'm Social Services. I remanded the
boy into your personal custody.

974
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,320
You're responsible
for his safety.

975
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,800
I'm told that
he's just been struck by lightning.

976
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,200
That's the first
I've heard of it.

977
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,320
It's true.

978
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,720
Scout Master Ward, I presume.

979
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,840
Yes, ma'am.

980
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,280
Your reputation precedes you.

981
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,760
You two are
the most appallingly

982
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,360
incompetent custodial guardians

983
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
Social Services has
ever had the misfortune

984
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,880
to encounter in
a 27-year career!

985
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,240
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

986
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,800
You can't do this.
They'll eat him alive in there.

987
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,920
Where?

988
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,440
What's the name
of the place again?

989
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,400
Juvenile Refuge.

990
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,120
Sounds like jail.

991
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,960
Just find the boy,
and deliver him to Social Services.

992
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,840
Nothing else is in your power.

993
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,800
I'm sorry.
Can we get back to the rescue now?

994
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,560
- Suzy is still out there.
- Who are you?

995
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,760
Walt and Laura Bishop,
their daughter's the missing girl.

996
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,880
The parents of the stabber?

997
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,040
I object to that description.
She was attacked.

998
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,160
Excuse me?

999
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,520
I want the details about that.
Where's the Scout she knifed?

1000
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,960
Right here.

1001
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,000
- Field Mate Redford, sir.
- What's his condition?

1002
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,640
He may suffer some limited
chronic kidney insufficiency.

1003
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,760
Here's the report.

1004
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,280
- We don't have time for that!
- She's right.

1005
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,920
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1006
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,400
Nobody's going anywhere.

1007
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,720
He's not getting shock therapy.

1008
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,920
That's it!
I am citing you for gross misconduct.

1009
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,280
You are hereby
summoned to appear...

1010
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,520
I'm writing you up back!

1011
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,040
Be notified that
you stand accused of mistreatment...

1012
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,160
What are you talking about?

1013
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,280
I won't let you do it!

1014
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,400
Look!

1015
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,640
- They're gone.
- Who?

1016
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,480
- Suzy?
- Sam!

1017
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,600
- They're here?
- Yeah.

1018
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,080
Where'd they go? Answer me!

1019
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,400
Halt! Stop!

1020
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,280
Stay there.

1021
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,880
Wait, take these!

1022
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,840
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

1023
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,640
Come down!

1024
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,680
Social Services,
do you read me? Over.

1025
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,920
We might have to swim for it.

1026
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,240
How deep is it?
I didn't bring my life jacket.

1027
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,160
I don't know, but if it's too
shallow, we'll break our necks anyway.

1028
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,680
Hang on to me.

1029
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,280
Okay.

1030
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,960
No, I'm not married, but
I'm a police officer.

1031
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,800
Application denied. I'm sorry.

1032
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,440
I cannot authorize that. Over.

1033
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,920
Counselors, what's
the legal perspective? Over.

1034
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,120
In this state,
I would litigate with extreme confidence.

1035
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,960
- I concur.
- Open with Article 15

1036
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,440
of the Codes of
Civic Jurisdiction.

1037
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,320
No party,
under any circumstances,

1038
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,880
shall be denied due
and proper consideration

1039
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,440
without prejudice
in perpetuity.

1040
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,520
On three again.

1041
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,760
Wait.

1042
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,960
Just in case this is a suicide

1043
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,560
or they capture us
and we never see each other again anymore,

1044
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,960
I just want to say
thank you for marrying me.

1045
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,680
I'm glad I got
to know you, Suzy.

1046
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,800
I think you've still
got lightning in you.

1047
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,240
Let's jump.

1048
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,920
No! God damn it!

1049
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,640
Tell him. Over.

1050
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,440
Captain Sharp is
offering to assume

1051
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,200
the responsibility
of foster parenthood.

1052
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,280
He wants you to live with him.

1053
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,000
Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?

1054
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,840
What do you think, pal?

1055
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,160
We're coming down.
Over and out.

1056
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,120
They're coming down.
Over and...

1057
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,080
Don't let go.

1058
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,120
The Black Beacon
storm was considered

1059
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,920
by the US Department
of Inclement Weather

1060
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,880
to be the region's
most destructive meteorological event

1061
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,840
of the second half
of the 20th century.

1062
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,120
It lingered through six high
tides and inundated the islands

1063
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,920
with punishing winds
and extreme high waters.

1064
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,760
On St. Jack Wood,
powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk

1065
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,160
and demolished
the village bandstand and casino.

1066
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,800
Scout Master's log.
October 10th.

1067
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,560
Reconstruction continues
increasingly ahead of schedule,

1068
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,160
which I attribute to
a particularly robust

1069
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,080
esprit de corps
among the troop.

1070
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,360
The latrine, however,
does continue to present...

1071
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,560
Excuse me, sir?

1072
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,600
- You've got the new recruit?
- Yes, sir.

1073
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,200
- What's his rank?
- He doesn't have one.

1074
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,960
Pigeon Scout.
Let's get him a patch.

1075
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,960
The coastal
areas of New Penzance

1076
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,000
were battered
and changed forever.

1077
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,640
Height.

1078
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,720
63 inches.

1079
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,120
Mile 3.25
Tidal Inlet was erased from the map.

1080
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,040
But harvest yields
the following autumn

1081
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,800
far exceeded any
previously recorded,

1082
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:52,480
and the quality of the crops
was said to be extraordinary.

1083
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,360
So you see,
the composer Benjamin Britten

1084
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,920
has taken the whole
orchestra apart.

1085
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,920
Now he puts it
back together again in a fugue.

1086
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,800
The instruments come
in one after another

1087
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,160
in the same order as before,
beginning with the piccolo.

1088
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,360
And at the end, when all the
instruments have finally come in...

1089
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,920
Suzy, Lionel,
Murray, Rudy, dinner!

1090
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,400
Melody, while
the other instruments...

1091
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,000
Don't make us ask twice!

1092
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,920
See you tomorrow.

1093
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,560
For Juman

1094
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,240
Now we will
demonstrate the orchestration

1095
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,040
of Monsieur Desplat's
musical suite.

1096
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,840
A little electronic
metronome sets the time.

1097
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,200
First, a harp.

1098
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,160
Next, pizzicato cellos.

1099
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,560
Flute and piccolo.

1100
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,720
Electric guitar.

1101
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,600
Ukulele.

1102
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,480
Classical guitar.

1103
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,520
Banjo.

1104
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,520
Thin wood blocks.

1105
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,960
And two more harps.

1106
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,040
B-3 organ.

1107
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,800
Celesta.

1108
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,480
Bowed vibraphone.

1109
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,120
And piano.

1110
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,840
Pizzicato violins.

1111
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,320
And double bass.

1112
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,960
Tubular bells.

1113
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,640
And the glockenspiel.

1114
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,880
The ride cymbal.

1115
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,640
Piatti.

1116
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,840
Snare drums.

1117
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,640
Gran casa.

1118
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,360
Timpani!

1119
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,880
Sixteen baritone bass singers.

1120
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,080
Xylophone.

1121
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,320
Bassoons.

1122
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,720
Clarinet.

1123
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,360
French horns.

1124
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,440
Tenor sax.

1125
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,280
Trombone.

1126
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,200
Tuba!

1127
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,080
Trumpets.

1128
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,000
Triangle.

1129
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,720
Thank you very
much for listening.

57
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,379
Fatima...you came.

58
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,046
You waited.

59
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,357
Your CDs.

60
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,726
Get on.

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,755
Did you listen to them?

62
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:21,657
Yes.

63
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,667
They were okay.

64
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,275
You have the worst taste
in music.

65
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:36,274
Stop, Khalid.

66
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,140
We can't go this way.

67
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,575
It's a shortcut.

68
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,585
Khalid, I said stop.

69
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:47,516
My father has tea here
every morning.

70
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,688
You see him?

71
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,698
No.

72
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,258
Fatima.

73
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:57,793
Fatima, wait.

74
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,628
Fatima, wait.

75
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,497
I want to meet him.

76
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,232
I told you, you can't.

77
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:04,333
Has he called?

78
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,470
Only to yell at me.

79
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,576
We should run away, just go.

80
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:14,464
We have our studies, Fatima.

81
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,246
We have to be realistic.

82
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:20,716
Okay for you.
No one's forcing you to marry.

83
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,126
I just want to meet him.

84
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:26,063
He has chosen someone for me.

85
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,099
He has chosen.

86
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,268
He might like me more.

87
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,335
You don't know my father.

88
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,044
Daddy.

89
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:46,475
Daddy, did I wake you?

90
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,485
No, sweetheart.

91
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:52,281
Daddy, do you dream about me
when you're sleeping?

92
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,291
I dream...

93
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,019
about you...

94
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,887
and your mother...

95
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:01,024
and your sister.

96
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:07,532
Fatima said you stop dreaming
when you get married.

97
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,934
She's wrong, sweetheart.

98
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,918
You dream all your life.

99
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,087
It's one of God's gifts.

100
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,345
Understand?

101
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,478
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,145
- One kiss.
- No.

103
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,155
Only one.

115
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,915
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

116
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:34,983
Tea, please.

117
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,993
Okay.

123
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,586
Out the back! Out the back!

170
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,218
19 dead, 75 injured.

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,052
El-Hazim have
claimed responsibility.

172
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,887
And the new guy?

173
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:40,555
Shrapnel in the neck.

174
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:42,190
He bled to death.

175
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Damn.

176
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:45,760
Sir.

177
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,029
You have calls
from Corrine Whitman, CIA...

178
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,433
and Mr. Davis
at the U.S. State Department.

179
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,443
Give me Corrine first.

180
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,749
One dead American.

280
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,269
Lina.

281
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,741
Dad, when is Fatima
coming home?

282
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,783
Finish your milk.

283
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,289
Please, Abasi.

284
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,278
Tell her you made a mistake.

285
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,961
It's not the same
as when we were young.

286
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,971
There are rules, Samia.

287
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,407
There are rules.

288
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,567
Look at my sister Layla.

289
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:09,068
She'll never marry.

290
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,317
Call her, Abasi.

291
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,512
Please.

292
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,247
For me.

293
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,648
I have called.

294
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,483
I've left a dozen messages.

295
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,751
She doesn't answer.

296
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,761
What can I do?

297
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:29,297
Leave the egg alone!

298
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,226
Have you called your father?

299
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:34,236
Not yet.

300
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:36,906
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:40,434
Don't worry, it's nothing.

302
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,708
What have I done?

303
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:51,916
I'm proud of you
for standing up to him.

304
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:55,183
That's my taxi.

305
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:57,193
Please stay.

306
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:05,685
I want you in this apartment
by eight while I'm gone.

307
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:10,302
If my brother knew I was
leaving you here alone...

308
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,410
he'd kill me.

309
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,579
Okay?

310
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,951
See you in a few days.

346
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,455
My grandma has
the middle floor. I'm on top.

347
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:56,497
I don't want her
to find me here.

348
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:58,566
She's away for the week.

349
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,737
I have a back way in.
No one will see us.

350
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,619
You okay?

351
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:42,351
My grandma's room.

352
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,021
Come.

374
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,421
Like jasmine.

375
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,614
Do you sell what you paint?

376
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:02,249
Some.

377
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,523
I'm getting better.

378
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,926
No.

379
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:13,936
Those are just drafts.

380
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,881
That's you?

381
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:28,909
Mm-hmm.

382
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,919
And them?

383
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,752
My brother and grandma.

384
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,726
This is your mother?

385
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:40,128
She was beautiful.

386
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:43,222
You are the beautiful one.

387
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:51,420
You and your brother
have the same eyes.

388
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,709
Where's he now?

389
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Does he visit you?

390
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,107
No.

391
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:02,117
Not anymore.

392
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:04,953
Are you hungry?

393
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:09,318
Come, let's go to the kitchen.

469
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:06,422
- Peace be with you.
- And with you.

470
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:25,360
I thought you weren't coming.

471
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,426
Come.

472
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:53,894
Sir, he's here.

490
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,464
Al Jazeera
is running footage.

491
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:46,606
Security authorities
have confirmed 19 deaths.

492
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:49,836
Most of the victims
are women and children.

493
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:53,805
A tourist video
found at the scene...

494
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,400
shows the source of the blast.

495
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:09,761
In an email to the station,
El-Hazim has claimed...

496
00:37:12,502 --> 00:37:15,222
Why the hell didn't we get that?

497
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:19,967
Call Abdou, I want a copy now.

504
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:48,868
The struggle against
the Zionist and the Crusader...

505
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:54,454
represents the decisive battle
between faith and infidelity.

506
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:57,345
Between good and evil.

507
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:04,216
The destruction of the infidel
and hypocrite is your sacred duty.

508
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:11,065
When you meet the Apostate you are
commanded to "strike the necks."

509
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,891
The Crusader
talks about freedom.

510
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:25,639
Jihad is the only path
to freedom.

511
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,536
Do not fear their bullets.

512
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,414
What can they do...

513
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:35,376
but set your soul free?

514
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,444
On the Day of Judgment...

515
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:43,383
when you stand before
the Almighty God...

516
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:46,127
and He asks you...

517
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:50,652
"Why did you not fight
for the cause of God?

518
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:56,216
"And for the oppressed. The men,
the women and the children?

519
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:05,148
"What did you do
with the one weapon I gave you?

520
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,574
"Your body."

521
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:11,580
What will be your answer?

522
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:19,256
Will you display the wounds
of martyrdom and walk through
the gates of heaven?

523
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:27,926
Or, will you hang your head
in shame and roast in the fires of hell?

524
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:33,507
Success is from God.

525
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:38,405
May the peace and blessings and
glory of God, the Almighty, be upon you.

526
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,415
Amen.

527
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:42,717
Amen.

528
00:39:42,786 --> 00:39:43,810
Praise God.

529
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
God is great!

546
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:22,817
You are Egyptian. Yes?

547
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:27,455
You are Egyptian.

607
00:44:47,957 --> 00:44:49,957
Put him in the hole.

639
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,641
That's him.

640
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:09,809
You see?

641
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:12,369
Heading right for me. The dog.

642
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:16,749
Is someone trying to stop him?

643
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:18,551
Wait, wait.

644
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:20,561
She's blocking him.

645
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:23,464
The gunshot...

646
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:34,943
Useless.

728
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:34,141
Where were you?

729
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:36,202
Fatima,
what are you doing here?

730
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,369
I was worried.

731
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:40,014
You can't keep missing classes.

732
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:42,249
I was busy.

733
00:54:43,919 --> 00:54:45,644
You were busy.

734
00:54:45,654 --> 00:54:47,379
Don't.

735
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,769
Are you seeing another girl?

736
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:52,985
No.

737
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:54,587
Then where were you?

738
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,222
- With Omar.
- Where?

739
00:54:56,232 --> 00:54:58,782
At his home. He has a problem.

740
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:01,427
I am his friend.

741
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:03,437
Friend.

742
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:09,476
I'm sorry.

743
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:13,981
I have to go.

744
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,508
Now?

745
00:55:15,518 --> 00:55:16,775
Stay here.

746
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:18,785
No.

747
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,148
Please...

748
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:24,158
stay with me.

749
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:27,961
I'm sorry.

772
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,470
Leave us.

795
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:13,947
Is Fatima here?

796
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:20,688
There's...

797
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:23,682
There's a problem, Abasi.

798
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:29,628
I don't know where Fatima is.

799
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:35,667
But she was staying with you.

800
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:39,206
I went away...

801
01:01:40,843 --> 01:01:42,843
Away for work.

802
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,345
You left her alone?

803
01:01:49,351 --> 01:01:52,144
When was the last time
you saw her?

804
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:53,679
Six days ago.

805
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:55,689
Six days ago?

806
01:01:57,593 --> 01:01:59,633
She's been seeing a boy.

807
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,550
She said he was a school friend.

808
01:02:03,866 --> 01:02:05,866
Just a friend.

809
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:08,302
What's his name?

810
01:02:10,072 --> 01:02:11,363
I don't know if she's with him.

811
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:12,832
What's his name?

812
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:13,866
Khalid.

813
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:15,101
Khalid who?

814
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,406
I don't know his last name.

815
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,450
I'm sorry.

914
01:08:55,244 --> 01:08:56,635
Khalid.

915
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:58,645
Smile.

916
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:02,240
Wait, I want one with Fatima.

917
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,310
Fatima. Come get in the picture.

918
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,316
Smile.

919
01:09:07,326 --> 01:09:09,322
Brothers and sisters.

920
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:11,998
Sorry to stop the music.

921
01:09:12,494 --> 01:09:15,384
I just need to make
a few points...

922
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,091
before the march tomorrow.

923
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:22,161
Remember, the streets
will be lined with police.

924
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:24,969
We must remain calm.

925
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:28,566
We will show the world...

926
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:32,671
We will show the world
that we have had enough.

927
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:34,940
That we won't take it anymore.

928
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,308
Enough!

929
01:09:36,318 --> 01:09:38,318
Enough!

930
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,725
Khalid!

931
01:10:26,735 --> 01:10:28,735
Khalid!

932
01:10:32,574 --> 01:10:33,865
Khalid!

933
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,875
- Khalid!
- Omar!

934
01:10:35,911 --> 01:10:37,911
Omar!

935
01:10:54,696 --> 01:10:56,955
The boy's name
is Khalid El-Emin.

936
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:58,357
Khalid El-Emin?

937
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,492
I got it from the school.

938
01:11:00,902 --> 01:11:02,194
Father's in Paris.

939
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:03,862
Mother's dead.

940
01:11:03,872 --> 01:11:07,272
His brother, Fadil,
had multiple arrests.

941
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:09,776
We had him for a while.

942
01:11:10,412 --> 01:11:12,412
We let him go?

943
01:11:14,449 --> 01:11:16,917
He died.

944
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:29,262
Where's the boy?

945
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:31,556
We don't know.

946
01:11:31,566 --> 01:11:34,881
We're trying to find
an address for him.

947
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:37,396
Then why are you standing here
like an idiot?

948
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:39,131
Go!

949
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:41,141
Find him!

950
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,410
Move!

951
01:11:49,084 --> 01:11:51,379
Khalid, where are we going?

952
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:54,446
Who is it?

953
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,315
It's Khalid. They've taken Omar.

954
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:58,325
Open, open.

955
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:02,629
They took Omar.

956
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,770
They took Omar.

957
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:18,437
Go in the kitchen
and boil some water.

958
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:20,472
So we can clean him up.

959
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:47,866
You should not have
brought her here.

960
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:51,370
What are we going to do
about her?

961
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,380
Leave her out of it.

962
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:58,176
I'm not going to her house.

963
01:12:58,186 --> 01:13:02,181
You've got to understand,
she is not her father.

964
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,696
Then we will do it another way.

965
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:11,957
They have Omar.

966
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:13,825
They will make him talk.

967
01:13:13,835 --> 01:13:15,494
Over.

968
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,504
It is over.

969
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:24,844
Then...

970
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,580
we must do it now.

971
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:35,255
Remember your brother.

972
01:13:38,326 --> 01:13:40,521
Remember your brother.

1085
01:21:38,973 --> 01:21:40,973
Who contacted you?

1087
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,681
How?

1088
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:51,417
He called me...

1089
01:21:52,253 --> 01:21:54,253
on my cell phone.

1124
01:27:12,907 --> 01:27:16,343
Do you know
what they will do to Omar?

1125
01:27:20,214 --> 01:27:22,214
Do you?

1208
01:35:28,802 --> 01:35:30,802
Sorry to wake you, sir.

1209
01:35:31,238 --> 01:35:33,363
We have someone
who knows your daughter.

1210
01:35:33,373 --> 01:35:35,373
Omar Adnan.

1211
01:35:35,409 --> 01:35:38,635
He was arrested
by the riot squad last week.

1212
01:35:38,645 --> 01:35:41,110
He knows where the boy lives.

1213
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,416
Khalid?

1220
01:39:48,328 --> 01:39:51,297
I do this in memory
of my brother.

1232
01:42:56,950 --> 01:43:01,178
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

1233
01:43:01,188 --> 01:43:02,245
Tea, please.

1234
01:43:02,255 --> 01:43:04,255
Okay.

1238
01:43:39,693 --> 01:43:41,693
Khalid!

1239
01:43:42,862 --> 01:43:44,862
Khalid!

1240
01:43:45,865 --> 01:43:47,865
Khalid!

1241
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,195
Khalid!

1242
01:43:52,205 --> 01:43:53,230
Khalid!

1243
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,240
Khalid!

1244
01:44:01,681 --> 01:44:03,681
Khalid!

1245
01:44:14,761 --> 01:44:16,761
Why is he stopping?

1246
01:44:27,641 --> 01:44:29,641
Please, he's my father.

1247
01:44:31,378 --> 01:44:33,378
Khalid, please.

1248
01:44:36,716 --> 01:44:38,716
Please.

1249
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
Please.

1250
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,828
He's not going to do it.

1251
01:44:54,768 --> 01:44:57,032
Take him out.

1252
01:45:04,544 --> 01:45:06,544
Take him out.

1253
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:19,123
Khalid!

1254
01:45:21,795 --> 01:45:23,795
Khalid!

1257
01:46:51,451 --> 01:46:53,942
When did he die?

1258
01:46:54,821 --> 01:46:57,255
God's will.

1259
01:47:00,326 --> 01:47:02,326
When?

1260
01:47:06,199 --> 01:47:08,199
A week ago.

1261
01:47:11,304 --> 01:47:13,772
They were just children.

1
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,534
<i>You asked me once...</i>

2
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:19,414
<i>...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.</i>

3
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,707
<i>And while I can honestly...</i>

4
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>...say I have told you...</i>

5
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,376
<i>...the truth...</i>

6
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,879
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.</i>

7
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,973
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

8
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,227
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.</i>

9
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,481
<i>I think...</i>

10
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,692
<i>...it is time for you to know...</i>

11
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,863
<i>...what really happened.</i>

12
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,824
<i>It began...</i>

13
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,826
<i>...long 890--</i>

14
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>...in a land far away to the east...</i>

15
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:06,294
<i>...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.</i>

16
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,097
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

17
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,099
<i>Its markets known...</i>

18
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,392
<i>...far and wide.</i>

19
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:24,896
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.</i>

20
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,608
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.</i>

21
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,237
<i>For this city lay before the doors...</i>

22
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,451
<i>Erebor.</i>

23
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:40,703
<i>Stronghold of Thror...</i>

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,832
<i>...King Under the Mountain. Mightiest...</i>

25
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,959
<i>...of the Dwarf Lords.</i>

26
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,713
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...</i>

27
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,341
<i>...never doubting his house would endure...</i>

28
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,801
<i>...for his line lay secure...</i>

29
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,803
<i>...in the lives of his son...</i>

30
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,639
<i>...and grandson.</i>

31
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:04,018
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

32
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,479
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...</i>

33
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,816
<i>...the beauty of this fortress city was legend.</i>

34
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,944
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...</i>

35
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,987
<i>...in precious gems hewn...</i>

36
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,199
<i>...from rock and in great seams of gold...</i>

37
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,661
<i>...running like rivers through stone.</i>

38
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,873
<i>The skill of the Dwarves...</i>

39
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,876
<i>...was unequaled, fashioning objects...</i>

40
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:29,794
<i>...of great beauty...</i>

41
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,966
<i>...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

42
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,802
<i>Ever they delved deeper...</i>

43
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,804
<i>...down into the dark.</i>

44
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,141
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

45
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,399
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.</i>

46
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,528
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

47
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel."</i>

48
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,410
<i>He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule...</i>

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,287
<i>...was divine.</i>

50
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,705
<i>All would pay...</i>

51
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:06,998
<i>...homage to him.</i>

52
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,249
Even the great...

53
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,918
<i>...Elven King, Thranduil.</i>

54
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,009
<i>As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew...</i>

55
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,139
<i>...their store of good will ran thin.</i>

56
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,394
<i>No one knows exactly what began the rift.</i>

57
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:32,607
<i>The Elves say...</i>

58
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,900
<i>...the Dwarves stole their treasure.</i>

59
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,944
<i>The Dwarves tell another tale.</i>

60
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:41,407
<i>They say the Elf King
refused to give them their rightful pay.</i>

61
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,910
<i>It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances...</i>

62
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,077
<i>...can be broken.</i>

63
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,581
<i>How friendships between peoples
can be lost.</i>

64
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,250
And for what?

65
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,513
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...</i>

66
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,140
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

67
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,652
<i>Thror's love of gold...</i>

68
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,029
<i>...had grown too fierce.</i>

69
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,951
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

70
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,913
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

71
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,502
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

72
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,588
<i>...bad things will follow.</i>

73
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,850
<i>The first they heard
was a noise...</i>

74
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,726
<i>...like a hurricane coming down...</i>

75
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:51,936
<i>...from the North.</i>

76
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,480
<i>The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked...</i>

77
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,275
<i>...in the hot, dry wind.</i>

78
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,656
Balin, sound the alarm.

79
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,411
Call out the guard. Do it now!

80
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,079
What is it?

81
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,873
Dragon.

82
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,708
Dragon!

83
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:17,545
<i>He was...</i>

84
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:18,963
<i>...a firedrake from the North.</i>

85
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:27,930
<i>Smaug...</i>

86
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:29,807
<i>...had come.</i>

87
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,300
<i>Such wanton death...</i>

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,676
<i>...was dealt that day.</i>

89
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,722
<i>For this city of Men was nothing...</i>

90
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:10,640
<i>...to Smaug.</i>

91
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:12,767
<i>His eye...</i>

92
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,811
<i>...was set on another prize.</i>

93
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,525
<i>For dragons...</i>

94
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,027
<i>...covet gold...</i>

95
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,528
<i>...with a dark and...</i>

96
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,530
<i>...fierce desire.</i>

97
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,059
Aah!

98
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,189
No!

99
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,488
Come on.

100
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,325
<i>Erebor was lost.</i>

101
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:16,789
<i>For a dragon...</i>

102
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,833
<i>...will guard his plunder...</i>

103
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,252
<i>...as long as he lives.</i>

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,263
Run for your lives!

105
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,141
Ah! Help us!

106
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,823
<i>Thranduil would not risk
the lives of his kin against...</i>

107
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,575
<i>...the wrath of the dragon.</i>

108
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,994
<i>No help came from the Elves...</i>

109
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,622
<i>...that day, nor any day since.</i>

110
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,960
<i>Robbed of their homeland...</i>

111
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:06,881
<i>...the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...</i>

112
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,384
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.</i>

113
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,140
<i>The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find</i> it...

114
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,642
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.</i>

115
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,353
<i>But always he remembered...</i>

116
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,981
<i>...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...</i>

117
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,401
<i>...the trees like torches blazing bright.</i>

118
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,153
<i>For he had seen dragon fire...</i>

119
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,905
...in the sky...

120
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,491
<i>...and a city turned to ash.</i>

121
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,661
<i>And he never forgave...</i>

122
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,789
<i>...and he never forgot.</i>

123
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,503
<i>Far away, in another corner of the world...</i>

124
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:46,462
<i>...dragons were...</i>

125
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,463
...only make-believe.

126
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,506
Up they go!

127
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:49,507
<i>A party trick...</i>

128
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,758
<i>...conjured by Wizards...</i>

129
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:51,801
<i>...on Midsummer's Eve.</i>

130
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,344
<i>No more frightening...</i>

131
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,637
<i>...than fairy dust.</i>

132
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,140
Bilbo!

133
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,601
<i>And that, my dear Frodo...</i>

134
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:01,560
<i>...is where I come in.</i>

135
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,480
Bilbo! Bilbo.

136
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,566
<i>It was the beginning
of an unlikely friendship...</i>

137
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,737
<i>...that has lasted all my life.</i>

138
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:19,537
<i>But it is not the start of my story.
For me, it began...</i>

139
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,997
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.</i>

140
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,877
<i>In a hole in the ground, there lived...</i>

141
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,546
<i>...a Hobbit.</i>

142
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:35,719
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

143
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,805
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.</i>

144
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:42,476
<i>And that means good food, a warm hearth...</i>

145
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,689
<i>...and all the comforts of home.</i>

146
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,225
Thank you.

147
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,477
What's this?

148
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:26,854
That is private.

149
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,606
Keep your sticky paws off.

150
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,151
It's not ready yet.

151
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,861
Not ready for what?

152
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,112
Reading.

153
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,327
What on earth are these?

154
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,370
Replies to the party invitations.

155
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:48,167
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

156
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,752
They all say they're coming.

157
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,756
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

158
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,425
Are they, indeed? Over my...

159
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,469
-...dead body.
- They'd probably find that...

160
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,553
...quite agreeable.

161
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,931
They seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold.

162
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,809
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

163
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,562
And it still smells of Troll.

164
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,606
What on earth are you doing?

165
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,528
Taking precautions. You know...

166
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,156
...I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

167
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,785
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

168
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,747
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

169
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,123
Dreadful woman.

170
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,835
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

171
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,256
When I'm... When I'm...

172
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,758
When you're what?

173
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,765
It's nothing. Nothing.

174
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,481
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

175
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,359
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

176
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,028
Odd? Oh. Hm.

177
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,530
Unsociable.

178
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,616
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

179
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,076
Be a good lad and put that...

180
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,286
...on the gate.

181
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,130
Do you think he'll come?

182
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,464
Who?

183
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:18,966
Gandalf.

184
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:23,178
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers. He'll give us...

185
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,847
...quite a show, you'll see.

186
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,182
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

187
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,518
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

188
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:34,023
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

189
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:42,072
<i>He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.
Not that</i> I...

190
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,699
<i>. . . ever was.</i>

191
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,869
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

192
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,205
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

193
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,084
<i>And nothing unexpected...</i>

194
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,088
<i>...ever happened.</i>

195
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,156
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?

196
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:28,243
Do you wish me a good morning
or do you mean that it is a good morning...

197
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,703
...whether I want it or not'?

198
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,917
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

199
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,588
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

200
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,966
All of them at once, I suppose.

201
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,719
Hmm.

202
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,808
Can I help you?

203
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,727
That remains to be seen.

204
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,191
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

205
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,904
An adventure?

206
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:10,994
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

207
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,582
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

208
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,794
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

209
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:19,795
Mm.

210
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,588
Huh.

211
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:23,757
<i>Hmm.</i>

212
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,844
Oh. Ah.

213
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,178
Good morning.

214
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,265
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

215
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:36,437
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

216
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,105
Beg your pardon?

217
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,524
You've changed,
and not entirely for the better...

218
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,900
...Bilbo Baggins.

219
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,318
I'm sorry, do I know you?

220
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,655
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

221
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,323
I'm Gandalf.

222
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,617
And Gandalf means...

223
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,246
...me.

224
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,498
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

225
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,000
...who made such excellent...

226
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,713
...fireworks? Old Took used to have them
on Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

227
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,965
No idea you were still in business.

228
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,551
And where else should I be?

229
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,554
Where else--? Ahem.

230
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:16,143
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

231
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,062
...even if it's only my fireworks.

232
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,483
Yes. Well, that's decided.

233
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,485
It'll be very good for you...

234
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,696
...and most amusing for me.

235
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,531
I shall inform the others.

236
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,993
Inform the who? What? No. No. No-- Wait.

237
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,369
We do not want...

238
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,749
...any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not--

239
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,669
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

240
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,466
Good morning.

241
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,225
Morning!

242
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,615
Twelve. There we go. Have a very good day.

243
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,179
Chum.

244
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,767
Hello, Mr. Bilbo. Here.

245
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,563
Have a feel of me tubers.
Nice and firm, they are.

246
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,357
- Just come in from West Farthing.
- Very impressive, Mr. Worrywort.

247
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:31,320
Now, I don't suppose you've seen
a Wizard lurking around these parts?

248
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,321
A tall fellow.

249
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:33,905
Long, gray beard.

250
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,073
Pointy hat.

251
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,243
Can't say I have.

252
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,711
Dwalin, at your service.

253
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,714
Hm. Uh...

254
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,843
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

255
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,095
Do we...

256
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,096
...know each other?

257
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,348
No.

258
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,100
Which way, laddie?

259
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,310
Is it down here?

260
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,395
Is what...

261
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,854
...down where?

262
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,106
<i>Supper.</i>

263
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,442
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

264
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,821
He-- He said? Who said?

265
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,491
Mmm.

266
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,330
Mmm.

267
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,459
Very good, this. Any more?

268
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,129
What? Oh, yes, yes.

269
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,714
Ah.

270
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,012
Help yourself.

271
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:29,146
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.

272
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,609
That'll be the door.

273
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,448
Balin...

274
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,658
...at your service.

275
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,368
Good evening.

276
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,495
Yes. Yes, it is.

277
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,457
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

278
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,875
Am I late?

279
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,252
Late for what?

280
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,545
Oh!

281
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,422
Ha, ha!

282
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,340
Evening, brother.

283
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,802
By my beard...

284
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,972
...you're shorter and wider than last we met.

285
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,849
Wider, not shorter.

286
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,769
Sharp enough for both of us.

287
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,739
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

288
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:25,035
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

289
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,245
- Have you eaten?
- It's not that I don't like...

290
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,080
...visitors. I like visitors...

291
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,374
...as much as the next Hobbit.

292
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,128
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

293
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,630
- What is this?
- I don't know.

294
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,758
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.

295
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:45,347
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest. I don't mean...

296
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,599
...to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind.

297
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:48,850
- I'm sorry.
- You think--?

298
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,980
apology accepted.

299
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,649
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother...

300
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:56,566
...don't stint.

301
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,153
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

302
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,991
- Fili.
- And Kili.

303
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,993
At your service.

304
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,578
You must be Mr. Boggins.

305
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,914
Nope! You can't come in.
You've come to the wrong house.

306
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,040
What?

307
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,501
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

308
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,419
No, nothing's been canceled.

309
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,504
That's a relief.

310
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,843
Careful with these.

311
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,512
I just had them sharpened.

312
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,430
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.

313
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,892
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

314
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,937
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

315
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,731
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

316
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,317
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

317
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,071
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

318
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,116
- "Everyone"? How many more are there?
- Where do you want this?

319
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,201
- Oh, no.
- It's really heavy.

320
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,996
No. No. There's nobody home!

321
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,915
Go away and bother somebody else.

322
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,294
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

323
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,423
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke...

324
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,092
...I can only say it is in very...

325
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,135
...poor taste.

326
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,138
Get off...

327
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,514
...you big lump!

328
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,438
Gandalf.

329
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,777
Excuse me, that's my chicken. Um--

330
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,780
if-- If you don't--
That's my wine. Excuse me!

331
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,162
He's got an injury.

332
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,039
You mean the ax in his head?

333
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,125
Dead? No, only between his ears.

334
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,502
His legs work fine.

335
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,006
Put those back.

336
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,090
Put that back.

337
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,342
Put that back.

338
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:46,301
Not the jam.

339
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,469
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,555
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

341
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,600
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.

342
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,187
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair--
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

343
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:01,274
- I cannot hear what you're saying.
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

344
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:06,821
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

345
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,324
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

346
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,160
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

347
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,123
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

348
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,796
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

349
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,384
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

350
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,678
Oin, Gloin.

351
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,847
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

352
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,725
-...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

353
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,477
No, thank you.

354
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,108
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

355
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,568
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

356
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,199
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

357
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:55,120
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

358
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,330
It's got a fruity bouquet.

359
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,833
Oh. Cheers.

360
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,878
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

361
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,588
Hmm.

362
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,467
No chance. Not from that distance.

363
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,594
Wanna bet? Bombur...

364
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:12,512
...catch!

365
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,017
I'll help you with that.

366
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,567
Oh, you great...

367
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,860
...galumphing git!

368
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,153
Who wants an ale? There you go.

369
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,070
Over here, brother.

370
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,322
I said have another...

371
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,533
...drink. Here you go.

372
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,998
Ale on the count of three!

373
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:40,915
One...

374
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,792
-...two...
- Up!

375
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,472
I knew you had it in you!

376
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,266
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

377
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,559
But it's full of holes.

378
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,978
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

379
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,148
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

380
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,233
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

381
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,153
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

382
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,156
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

383
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,908
What are they doing here?

384
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,828
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

385
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,955
I don't want to get used to them.

386
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:24,292
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

387
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,877
They've pillaged the pantry.

388
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,463
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

389
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:32,509
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

390
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,889
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

391
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,350
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

392
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:45,772
Take that back.

393
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:46,689
Excuse me.

394
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,191
That's my mother's...

395
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,943
...West Farthing pottery. It's over...

396
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,361
...100 years old!

397
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:55,490
And can you...

398
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,491
...not do that?

399
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:57,408
You'll blunt them.

400
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,536
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

401
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:00,995
He says...

402
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,914
...we'll blunt the knives.

403
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,999
<i>Blunt the knives, bend the forks</i>

404
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,669
<i>Smash the bottles and burn the corks</i>

405
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,671
<i>Chip the glasses and crack the plates</i>

406
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,215
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins</i>

407
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,133
<i>Hates</i>

408
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,759
<i>Cut the cloth, tread on the fat</i>

409
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,803
<i>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat</i>

410
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,513
<i>Pour the milk on the pantry floor</i>

411
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:21,808
<i>Splash the wine</i>

412
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:22,725
<i>On every door</i>

413
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,519
<i>Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl</i>

414
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,312
<i>Pound them up with a thumping pole</i>

415
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:27,230
<i>When you're finished</i>

416
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,523
<i>If they are whole</i>

417
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,194
<i>Send them down the hall to roll</i>

418
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,580
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates</i>

419
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,626
Bilbo.

420
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,304
He is here.

421
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,893
Gandalf.

422
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,103
I thought you said...

423
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,396
...this place would be easy...

424
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,149
...to find. I lost my way, twice.

425
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,819
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

426
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,947
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

427
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,201
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

428
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:26,122
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:

429
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,625
Thorin Oakenshield.

430
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,376
So...

431
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,630
...this is the Hobbit.

432
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,966
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

433
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,718
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?

434
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,803
What's your weapon of choice?

435
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,474
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

436
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:48,269
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

437
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,230
Thought as much.

438
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,233
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

439
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,155
What news...

440
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,158
...from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

441
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,411
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!

442
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,206
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

443
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,292
Is Dain with us?

444
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,088
They will not come.

445
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,217
They say this quest...

446
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,637
...is ours and ours alone.

447
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,350
You're going on a quest?

448
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:32,855
Bilbo, my clear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

449
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,608
Far to the east...

450
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,987
...over ranges and rivers...

451
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,532
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

452
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,076
...lies a single, solitary peak.

453
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,415
"The Lonely Mountain."

454
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,126
Aye, Oin has read...

455
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:57,714
...the portents,
and the portents say it is time.

456
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,048
Ravens have been seen...

457
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,844
...flying back to the mountain,
as it was foretold.

458
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,638
"When the birds of yore return...

459
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:06,973
...to Erebor...

460
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,725
...the reign of the beast...

461
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,643
...will end."

462
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,732
- Uh, what beast?
- That would be a reference...

463
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,400
...to Smaug the Terrible...

464
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,901
...chiefest and greatest...

465
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,278
...calamity of our age.

466
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:23,990
Airborne fire-breather.

467
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,241
Teeth like razors...

468
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,951
...claws like meat hooks.

469
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,494
Fond of precious metals.

470
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,620
I know what a dragon is.

471
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,914
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

472
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,917
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

473
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:35,835
Good lad, Ori!

474
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:36,753
Sit down.

475
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,171
The task would be difficult...

476
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,797
...with an army behind us...

477
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,133
...but we number just 13.

478
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,260
And not 13 of the best...

479
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,179
...nor brightest.

480
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,306
Here, who are you calling dim?

481
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,308
Sorry, what did he say?

482
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,435
We may be few in number...

483
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,230
...but we're fighters, all of us...

484
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,482
...to the last Dwarf.

485
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,901
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

486
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,944
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons.

487
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,655
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say--

488
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,824
- How many, then?
- What?

489
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,326
How many dragons have you killed?

490
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,288
Go on.

491
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,790
Give us a number.

492
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,460
Excuse me. Please.

493
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,800
If we have read these signs...

494
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,677
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

495
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,557
Rumors have begun to spread.

496
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,644
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

497
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,564
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

498
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,735
...wondering, weighing the risk.

499
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,530
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

500
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,617
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

501
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,036
Or do we seize this chance...

502
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:53,204
...to take back Erebor?

503
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:58,292
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

504
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,585
There is no way...

505
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,712
...into the mountain.

506
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:05,216
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

507
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,680
How came you by this?

508
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:12,223
It was given to me...

509
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,058
...by your father.

510
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,810
By Thrain.

511
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,562
For safekeeping.

512
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:19,105
It is yours...

513
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,440
...now.

514
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,282
If there is a key...

515
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,868
...there must be a door.

516
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,161
These runes...

517
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,956
...speak of a hidden passage
to the Lower Halls.

518
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,292
There's another way in.

519
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:43,296
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

520
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,468
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

521
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,678
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

522
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,098
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

523
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,353
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

524
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,647
...and no small amount of courage.

525
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:07,570
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

526
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,322
That's why we need a burglar.

527
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:13,117
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

528
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,620
And are you?

529
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,457
Am I what?

530
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,418
He said he's an expert. Hey.

531
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,757
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

532
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,635
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

533
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,845
He's hardly burglar material.

534
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,055
Nope.

535
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:38,518
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

536
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,603
He's just fine.

537
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,360
Enough!

538
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,153
If I say Bilbo Baggins...

539
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,863
...is a burglar, then a burglar...

540
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,532
...he is.

541
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,326
Hobbits are light...

542
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,705
...on their feet. In fact, they can pass
unseen by most, if they choose.

543
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:03,501
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

544
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,962
...the scent of a Hobbit is all but...

545
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:10,091
...unknown to him,
which gives us a distinct advantage.

546
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,969
You asked me to find
the 14th member of this company...

547
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,762
...and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

548
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,180
There's more to him...

549
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,890
...than appearances suggest.

550
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,935
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

551
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,896
Including himself.

552
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,029
You must trust me on this.

553
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,492
Very well.

554
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,411
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

555
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,997
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

556
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,124
It's just the usual. Summary...

557
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,209
...of out-of-pocket expenses,
time required...

558
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,210
...remuneration...

559
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,212
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

560
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,590
Funeral arrangements?

561
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:57,930
I cannot guarantee his safety.

562
00:34:58,598 --> 00:34:59,849
Understood.

563
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,852
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

564
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,024
Agreed.

565
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:08,941
Cash on...

566
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,778
...delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

567
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,822
Hmm. Seems fair.

568
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,701
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

569
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:24,165
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

570
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,293
...evisceration..."

571
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,839
- incineration?
- Aye.

572
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,050
He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

573
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,431
You all right, laddie?

574
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,183
Huh? Yeah.

575
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,311
Feel a bit faint.

576
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,647
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.

577
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,273
I need air.

578
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,442
Flash of light, searing pain, then:

579
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:54,195
Poof. You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

580
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,821
Hmm.

581
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:01,661
Nope.

582
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,705
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

583
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,583
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

584
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,045
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

585
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,047
Tell me...

586
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,549
...when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

587
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,426
...become so important to you?

588
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,765
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

589
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,102
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

590
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,897
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

591
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,566
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

592
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:36,112
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

593
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,405
The world...

594
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,574
...is not in your books and maps.

595
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:42,243
It's out...

596
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:43,661
...there.

597
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,665
I can't just go running off into the blue.

598
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:51,001
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

599
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,337
You are also a Took.

600
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:55,798
Did you know...

601
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,508
...that your great-great-great-great-uncle...

602
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,885
...Bullroarer Took was so large...

603
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,095
...he could ride a real horse?

604
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,596
- Yes.
- Yes...

605
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:03,764
...well, he could.

606
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,809
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

607
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,813
He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

608
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:15,192
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

609
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,111
And thus, the battle was won.

610
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,656
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

611
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,245
I do believe you made that up.

612
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:30,166
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

613
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,671
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own
when you come back.

614
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,635
Can you promise that I will come back?

615
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,097
No.

616
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,349
And if you do...

617
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:50,227
...you will not be the same.

618
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,647
That's what I thought.

619
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,484
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

620
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,822
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

621
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,707
It appears we have lost our burglar.

622
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,585
Probably for the best.

623
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,421
The odds were always against us.

624
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,424
After all, what are we?

625
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,803
Merchants, miners...

626
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:25,888
...tinkers, toy-makers.

627
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,975
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

628
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,978
There are a few warriors amongst us.

629
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,731
Old warriors.

630
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,317
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

631
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,611
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

632
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:43,531
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

633
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,076
Loyalty, honor...

634
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,328
...a willing heart.

635
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,541
I can ask no more than that.

636
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,500
You don't...

637
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,252
...have to do this.

638
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,254
You have a choice.

639
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,465
You've done honorably by our people.

640
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,095
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

641
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,429
A life of peace...

642
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,431
...and plenty.

643
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:15,229
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

644
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:20,734
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

645
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,195
They dreamt of the day...

646
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,198
...when the Dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland.

647
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,411
There is no choice, Balin.

648
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,539
Not for me.

649
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,585
Then we are with you, laddie.

650
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,839
We will see it done.

651
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:07,156
Far over

652
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:11,452
<i>The misty mountains cold</i>

653
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,999
<i>To dungeons deep</i>

654
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,668
<i>And caverns old</i>

655
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,965
<i>We must away</i>

656
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,677
<i>'Ere break of day</i>

657
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,974
<i>To find our</i>

658
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:39,563
<i>Long-forgotten gold</i>

659
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,943
<i>The pines were roaring</i>

660
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:48,781
<i>On the height</i>

661
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,240
<i>The winds</i>

662
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,202
<i>Were moaning</i>

663
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,664
<i>In the night</i>

664
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:02,670
<i>The fire was red</i>

665
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,757
<i>It flaming spread</i>

666
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:11,261
<i>The trees like torches</i>

667
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:15,265
<i>Blazed With light</i>

668
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,349
Hello?

669
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,652
Yes.

670
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,904
Yes.

671
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,061
Here...

672
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,979
...Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

673
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,482
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

674
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:31,485
I'm going on an adventure!

675
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,702
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Corning here was a waste of time.

676
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,454
That's true enough.

677
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,499
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Half ling?

678
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,084
Whose idea was it anyway?

679
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,377
Wait!

680
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,212
Wait!

681
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,964
Whoa, whoa.

682
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,968
Whoa, whoa.

683
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:02,933
I signed it.

684
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,061
Here.

685
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,238
Everything appears...

686
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,865
...to be in order.

687
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,450
Welcome, Master Baggins...

688
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,663
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

689
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,211
Give him a pony.

690
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,213
No, no, that won't be necessary.

691
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,591
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

692
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,343
I've done my fair share of walking holidays,
you know?

693
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:40,637
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

694
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,403
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

695
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,407
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.

696
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,159
What's that about?

697
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:06,872
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

698
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,917
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

699
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:12,836
And what did you think?

700
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,630
Well...

701
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:22,262
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

702
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,979
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

703
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,316
No, wait, wait, stop.

704
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:37,027
Stop! We have to turn around.

705
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:38,278
What on earth...

706
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,321
...is the matter?

707
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,740
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.

708
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,409
Use this.

709
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,332
Move on.

710
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,259
You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs.</i> ..

711
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,761
<i>...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...</i>

712
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:06,348
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.</i>

713
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:07,724
<i>You were born...</i>

714
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:12,312
...to <i>the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.</i>

715
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:16,233
<i>But home is now behind you.</i>

716
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,486
<i>The world is ahead.</i>

717
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:03,697
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

718
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,077
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

719
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,246
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

720
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,044
What was that?

721
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,463
Orcs.

722
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:21,214
Ores?

723
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:23,675
Throat-cutters.

724
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,761
There'll be dozens of them out there.

725
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:26,803
The lone-lands...

726
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,972
- ...are crawling with them.
- They strike...

727
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:33,018
...in the wee small hours when everyone's
asleep. Quick and quiet, no screams.

728
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,478
Just lots of blood.

729
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,776
You think that's funny?

730
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,030
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

731
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,240
We didn't mean anything by it.

732
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,243
No, you didn't.

733
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,537
You know nothing of the world.

734
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,666
Don't mind him, laddie.

735
00:47:56,917 --> 00:48:01,588
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

736
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,303
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

737
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,722
...King Thror...

738
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:15,185
...tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

739
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:20,732
<i>But our enemy had got there first.</i>

740
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:36,998
<i>Moria had been taken by legions of Ores...</i>

741
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,543
<i>...led by the most vile...</i>

742
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,422
<i>Azog...</i>

743
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:45,507
<i>...the Defiler.</i>

744
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,512
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...</i>

745
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:55,934
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

746
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,898
He began...

747
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:04,818
...by beheading the king.

748
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:19,040
No!

749
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,960
Thrain, Thorin's father...

750
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:25,130
...was driven mad by grief.

751
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,966
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

752
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:30,677
...we did not know.

753
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,013
We were leaderless.

754
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,683
<i>Defeat and death...</i>

755
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:38,477
<i>...were upon us.</i>

756
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:45,650
That is when I saw him.

757
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,071
A young Dwarf prince...

758
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,407
<i>...facing down...</i>

759
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,409
<i>...the pale Orc.</i>

760
00:49:58,914 --> 00:49:59,706
<i>He stood alone...</i>

761
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,501
<i>...against this terrible foe.</i>

762
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,845
<i>His armor rent...</i>

763
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:14,804
...wielding nothing...

764
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,223
<i>...but an oaken branch...</i>

765
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:17,474
<i>...as a shield.</i>

766
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,363
<i>Azog...</i>

767
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:35,242
<i>...the Defiler learned that day...</i>

768
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:40,205
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

769
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,693
<i>Our forces rallied...</i>

770
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,363
<i>...and drove the Orcs back.</i>

771
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,533
<i>And our enemy...</i>

772
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:18,034
<i>...had been defeated.</i>

773
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:23,164
But there was no feast...

774
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,585
...nor song that night...

775
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:31,548
<i>...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.</i>

776
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:35,844
<i>We few had survived.</i>

777
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,979
<i>And I thought to myself then...</i>

778
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:52,902
<i>...there is one who I could follow.</i>

779
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,032
There is one...

780
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,160
...I could call king.

781
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,472
And the pale Orc?

782
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,309
What happened to him?

783
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,063
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

784
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:32,108
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

785
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,572
Here, Mr. Gandalf...

786
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:21,825
...can't you do something
about this deluge?

787
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,828
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

788
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:28,748
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.

789
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,792
If you wish to change...

790
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,420
...the weather of the world,
find yourself another Wizard.

791
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,339
- Are there any?
- What?

792
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:39,092
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.

793
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:43,805
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

794
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,474
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

795
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,186
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.

796
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:52,564
And who is the fifth?

797
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:56,693
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

798
00:53:56,943 --> 00:54:00,655
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?

799
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:07,454
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.

800
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:08,747
He's a gentle soul...

801
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:12,167
...who prefers the company
of animals to others.

802
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,420
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

803
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,131
<i>...to the east. And a good thing too.</i>

804
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:23,386
<i>For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.</i>

805
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:33,062
Not good. Not good at all.

806
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,821
Eww.

807
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:59,547
Oh, no. Sebastian.

808
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,302
Good gracious.

809
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:27,325
Come on. Move back! Give him some air...

810
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,536
...for goodness sake.

811
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,089
There. There.

812
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:45,051
I don't understand why it's not working.

813
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,720
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

814
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,475
Witchcraft.

815
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:57,564
Oh, but it is.

816
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:04,445
A dark and powerful magic.

817
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,330
Where on...

818
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,959
...this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?

819
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,088
The old fortress?

820
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:46,839
Show me.

821
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,250
We'll camp here for the night.

822
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:27,046
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

823
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:31,300
A farmer and his family used to live here.

824
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,262
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.

825
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,471
Right you are.

826
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:39,308
I think it would be wiser to move on.

827
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,187
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

828
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:45,314
I have told you already...

829
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,358
...I will not go near that place.

830
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,819
Why not? The Elves could help us.

831
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:52,071
We could get food, rest, advice.

832
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,991
- I do not need their advice.
- We have a map...

833
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:58,578
...that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

834
00:58:58,828 --> 00:59:00,163
Help?

835
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,249
A dragon attacks Erebor.

836
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:05,710
What help came from the Elves?

837
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:07,879
Orcs plunder Moria...

838
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:12,383
...desecrate our sacred halls.
The Elves looked on...

839
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,093
...and did nothing.

840
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:19,098
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

841
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,808
Who betrayed my father.

842
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,810
You are neither of them.

843
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:24,270
I did not...

844
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,231
...give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

845
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:28,900
I did not know
that they were yours to keep.

846
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:38,284
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

847
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:41,871
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

848
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:42,830
And who's that?

849
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:44,749
Myself, Mr. Baggins.

850
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:47,710
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

851
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,589
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

852
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,383
Is he coming back?

853
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,098
He's been a long time.

854
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,557
- Who?
- Gandalf.

855
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,893
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

856
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:07,146
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

857
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,232
Stop it. You've had plenty.

858
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:13,069
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

859
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,279
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

860
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,740
Hilarious.

861
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:29,669
What's the matter?

862
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:34,257
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

863
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:36,342
We had 16.

864
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:39,345
Now there's 14.

865
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,976
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

866
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:46,894
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

867
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:49,689
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

868
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:52,775
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

869
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:56,195
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

870
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,822
Well, uh...

871
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:02,451
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

872
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:07,165
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

873
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:09,041
H9)'-

874
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,169
There's a light.

875
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,212
Over here.

876
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:16,757
Stay down.

877
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,598
What is it?

878
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,224
Trolls.

879
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:44,577
Oh.

880
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:56,964
He's got Myrtle and Minty. I think they're
gonna eat them. We have to do something.

881
01:01:58,216 --> 01:01:59,967
Yes, you should.

882
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,636
Mountain Trolls are slow...

883
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:04,263
...and stupid, and you're small,
they'll never see you.

884
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,432
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

885
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,559
If you run into trouble,
hoot twice like a barn owl...

886
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,144
...and once like a brown owl.

887
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,231
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown-- Once like a--

888
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:15,441
Like a-- Are you sure this is a good idea?

889
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,819
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

890
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:22,531
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

891
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,576
Quit your griping.

892
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,997
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

893
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:34,377
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.

894
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:36,671
- Not enough fat on them.
- Well, it's better...

895
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:39,090
...than leathery old farmer.
All skin and bone, he was.

896
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:40,716
I'm still picking...

897
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:42,551
...bits of him out of me teeth.

898
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:47,056
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

899
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,183
Might improve the flavor.

900
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,936
Ah. There's more where that came from.

901
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,437
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!

902
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:58,943
Sit down!

903
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:11,539
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

904
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,500
I don't like the stinky parts.

905
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:17,545
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

906
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:18,754
I'm starving!

907
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:22,008
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

908
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:24,135
Shut your cakehole.

909
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,262
You'll eat what I give you.

910
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,808
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

911
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,560
Everything tastes like chicken.

912
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,978
Except the chicken.

913
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,438
What tastes like fish!

914
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:38,399
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

915
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:43,362
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.

916
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:45,031
Lovely stew, Bert."

917
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:49,243
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

918
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:50,286
Just needs...

919
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,455
...a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

920
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:54,248
Here...

921
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,499
...that's my grog.

922
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,172
Sorry. Ow!

923
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:07,303
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

924
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,848
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

925
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:12,850
Good, isn't it?

926
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:17,188
That's why I'm the cook.

927
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:29,283
Oh, me guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

928
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,244
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!

929
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:36,749
Blimey!

930
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,336
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

931
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,671
It's got arms and legs and everything.

932
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,174
- What is it?
- I don't know.

933
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:47,301
I don't like the way it wriggles around.

934
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:54,475
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

935
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,352
I'm a burglar-- Uh, Hobbit.

936
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:58,604
A burglar Hobbit?

937
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:00,398
Can we cook him?

938
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,608
We can try.

939
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:07,988
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

940
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:10,950
Not when he's skinned and boned.

941
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,535
Perhaps there's more...

942
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:15,162
...burglar Hobbits around these parts.
Might be enough...

943
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:16,705
...for a pie.

944
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:19,583
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.

945
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:23,087
Right. Come here, you little--

946
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:24,463
Gotcha.

947
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:27,049
Are there any more of you little fellas...

948
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,219
-...hiding where you shouldn't?
- No.

949
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,762
He's lying.

950
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:36,267
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

951
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:37,518
Make him squeal!

952
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:43,649
Drop him!

953
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,276
You what?

954
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:47,528
I said...

955
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,821
...drop him.

956
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:12,303
Get the sacks!

957
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:15,306
Stick them in the sacks!

958
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,288
Ow!

959
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:05,439
Come on!

960
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,024
Get up!

961
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:08,609
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

962
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:12,238
Lay down your arms...

963
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,698
...or we'll rip his off.

964
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,092
- Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!
- Don't bother cooking them.

965
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:37,513
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

966
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:41,892
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

967
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,602
Is this really necessary?

968
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,563
That does sound quite nice.

969
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:48,232
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.

970
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,776
Never mind the seasoning.

971
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:53,529
We ain't got all night. Dawn ain't...

972
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:55,531
...far away. Let's get a move on.

973
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,867
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

974
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,871
Wait!

975
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,206
You are making...

976
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,083
...a terrible mistake.

977
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,626
You can't reason with them.

978
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,086
- They're half-wits!
Half-wits?

979
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:10,754
What does that make us?

980
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,090
I meant with...

981
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,174
...the seasoning.

982
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,094
What about the seasoning?

983
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,554
Well, have you smelt them?

984
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:22,391
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

985
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,018
- Traitor!
- What do you know...

986
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:25,728
...about cooking Dwarf?

987
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:27,354
Shut up.

988
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:31,317
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

989
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:35,112
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

990
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:38,407
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

991
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,659
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

992
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:44,913
...to skin them first.

993
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,082
What? Skin us?

994
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,710
Tom, get me filleting knife.

995
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,545
I'll skin you, you little--!

996
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,547
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

997
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,091
What a load of rubbish.

998
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:59,178
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

999
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:00,304
Scarf them, I say...

1000
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:01,764
...boots and all.

1001
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,642
He's right.

1002
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:07,478
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

1003
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,399
Nice and crunchy.

1004
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:13,901
Oh, not that one.

1005
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,235
He's infected.

1006
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:16,153
Huh?

1007
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:17,154
You what?

1008
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:21,450
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

1009
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,451
Eww!

1010
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,619
Aah!

1011
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:25,371
In fact, they all have.

1012
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:28,165
They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.

1013
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,875
I wouldn't risk it. I wouldn't.

1014
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,001
Parasites?

1015
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,087
Did he say "parasites"?

1016
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,339
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

1017
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,966
What are you talking about, laddie?

1018
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:43,305
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

1019
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:46,100
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

1020
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:49,645
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.

1021
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,063
Yes, we are, badly.

1022
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,981
What would you have us do, then?

1023
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,859
Let them all go?

1024
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,653
- Well...
- You think...

1025
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,571
...I don't know what you're up to?

1026
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:00,823
This little...

1027
01:10:01,073 --> 01:10:04,076
...ferret is taking us for fools.

1028
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:05,077
Ferret?

1029
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,036
Fools?

1030
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:09,248
The dawn will take you all.

1031
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:11,333
Who's that?

1032
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:12,251
No idea.

1033
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,544
Can we eat him too?

1034
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:42,239
Get your foot out of my back.

1035
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,538
Ah.

1036
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,291
Where did you...

1037
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:53,876
...go to, if I may ask?

1038
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:55,753
To look ahead.

1039
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:57,045
What brought you back?

1040
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:58,964
Looking behind.

1041
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:01,133
Nasty business.

1042
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:02,885
Still, they're all in one piece.

1043
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:04,511
No thanks to your burglar.

1044
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,056
He had the nous to play for time.

1045
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:11,059
None of the rest of you thought of that.

1046
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,815
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.

1047
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:19,818
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?

1048
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,112
Ooh. Not for an age.

1049
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:26,200
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

1050
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:35,125
They could not have moved in daylight.

1051
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,420
There must be a cave nearby.

1052
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,558
Oh, what's that stench?

1053
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,937
It's a Troll-hoard.

1054
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,439
Be careful what you touch.

1055
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,037
Seems a shame just to leave it...

1056
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,372
...lying around.

1057
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:17,376
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

1058
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,211
- Nori.
- Yeah?

1059
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:20,796
Get a shovel.

1060
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,107
These swords were not made by any Troll.

1061
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:50,367
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

1062
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,082
These were forged in Gondolin...

1063
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:01,753
...by the High Elves of the First Age.
You could not...

1064
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:03,505
...wish for a finer blade.

1065
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,354
- Set it down.
- That's good.

1066
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:21,982
All right, come on. Quick.

1067
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:32,951
We're making a long-term deposit.

1068
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,203
Let's get out of this foul place.

1069
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:37,247
Come on, let's go.

1070
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:39,583
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

1071
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:00,687
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?

1072
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,106
Here.

1073
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:05,859
This is about your size.

1074
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,908
I can't take this.

1075
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:15,243
The blade is of Elvish make...

1076
01:14:15,494 --> 01:14:16,954
...which means...

1077
01:14:17,204 --> 01:14:20,415
...it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

1078
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,877
I have never used a sword in my life.

1079
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,088
And I hope you never have to.

1080
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,674
But if you do, remember this:

1081
01:14:30,092 --> 01:14:35,389
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

1082
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:38,266
...but when to spare one.

1083
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,107
Something's coming!

1084
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:46,024
Gandalf.

1085
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:47,442
Stay together!

1086
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:48,777
Hurry now!

1087
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:51,655
Arm yourselves!

1088
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,173
Thieves!

1089
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:11,675
Fire! Murder!

1090
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,430
Radagast.

1091
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,807
It's Radagast the Brown.

1092
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:20,684
Well...

1093
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,563
What on earth are you doing here?

1094
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,273
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

1095
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:27,816
Something's wrong.

1096
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:29,359
Something's terribly wrong.

1097
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,528
Yes?

1098
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:35,282
Oh.

1099
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,869
Just give me a minute.

1100
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:42,039
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

1101
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:43,790
It was right there...

1102
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,667
...on the tip of my tongue.

1103
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:46,918
Oh.

1104
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,379
It's not a thought at all.

1105
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:50,756
It's a silly old...

1106
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,259
... stick insect.

1107
01:15:58,305 --> 01:16:02,059
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

1108
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,686
A darkness has fallen over it.

1109
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,938
Nothing grows anymore.

1110
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,316
At least, nothing good.

1111
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:12,152
The air is foul with decay.

1112
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:14,112
But worse are the webs.

1113
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,448
Webs? What do you mean?

1114
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:18,742
Spiders, Gandalf.

1115
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:20,327
Giant ones.

1116
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:24,873
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.

1117
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,250
I followed their trail.

1118
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:30,295
They came from Dol Guldur.

1119
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,923
Huh?

1120
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:35,175
Dol Guldur?

1121
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:38,595
But the old fortress is abandoned.

1122
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,223
No, Gandalf.

1123
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:44,559
'Tis not.

1124
01:16:52,818 --> 01:16:55,570
<i>RADAGAST".
A dark power dwells in there...</i>

1125
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:57,697
<i>...such as I have never...</i>

1126
01:16:57,948 --> 01:16:59,491
<i>...felt before.</i>

1127
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:05,330
<i>It is the shadow of an ancient horror.</i>

1128
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:14,756
<i>One that can summon the spirits...</i>

1129
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:15,924
<i>...of the dead.</i>

1130
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:34,943
<i>I saw him, Gandalf.</i>

1131
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:38,738
<i>From out of the darkness...</i>

1132
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:40,031
<i>...a Necromancer...</i>

1133
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:42,284
<i>...has come.</i>

1134
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,412
Radagast.

1135
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,586
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

1136
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:56,423
Wait for me!

1137
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:11,980
Sorry.

1138
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,566
Try a little Old Toby.

1139
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:16,318
It'll help settle your nerves.

1140
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:20,947
And out.

1141
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:29,497
Now...

1142
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:33,210
...a Necromancer. Are you sure?

1143
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,266
That is not...

1144
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:52,562
...from the world of the living.

1145
01:18:58,485 --> 01:19:01,238
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?

1146
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:04,282
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

1147
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,331
Kili! Get your bow!

1148
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,006
Warg scouts.

1149
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:22,217
Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.

1150
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,343
Orc pack?

1151
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:24,928
Who did you tell about your quest...

1152
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:26,346
...beyond your kin?

1153
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:27,514
No one.

1154
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:28,431
Who did you tell?

1155
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:29,891
No one, I swear.

1156
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,142
What in...

1157
01:19:31,393 --> 01:19:32,394
...Durin's name is going on?

1158
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:33,770
You are being hunted.

1159
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,690
We have to get out of here.

1160
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,066
We can't. We have no ponies.

1161
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:40,902
They bolted.

1162
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:42,404
I'll draw them off.

1163
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:44,364
These are Gundabad Wargs.

1164
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:45,532
They will outrun you.

1165
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:47,617
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1166
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:52,038
I'd like to see them try.

1167
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,882
Come on! Come on!

1168
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,385
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

1169
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:16,313
Come on.

1170
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,258
Stay together.

1171
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:46,509
Move!

1172
01:20:57,771 --> 01:21:00,231
Ori, no! Get back.

1173
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,736
All of you, come on. Quick!

1174
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:09,908
Where are you leading us?

1175
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:19,519
Move!

1176
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:20,937
Run!

1177
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:39,456
There they are!

1178
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:42,083
This way!

1179
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,376
Quickly!

1180
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,181
There's more coming!

1181
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:57,849
Kili!

1182
01:22:58,349 --> 01:22:59,809
Shoot them!

1183
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,815
We're surrounded!

1184
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:11,571
Where's Gandalf?

1185
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,948
He's abandoned us.

1186
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,290
Hold your ground!

1187
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:32,884
This way, you fools!

1188
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:35,053
Come on, move!

1189
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,097
Quickly!

1190
01:23:38,348 --> 01:23:39,265
All of you!

1191
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:40,892
Come on!

1192
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:42,769
Go, go, go!

1193
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:54,322
Eight, nine, 10.

1194
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:57,408
Kili!

1195
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:58,660
Run!

1196
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:40,159
Elves.

1197
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,038
I cannot see...

1198
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:46,916
...where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or no?

1199
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,085
Follow it, of course.

1200
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,424
I think that would be wise.

1201
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:18,489
Gandalf.

1202
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:20,533
Where are we?

1203
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:21,659
You can feel it?

1204
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:25,538
Yes. It feels like...

1205
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:27,498
Well, like magic.

1206
01:25:27,749 --> 01:25:30,209
That's exactly what it is.

1207
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,296
A very powerful magic.

1208
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:36,382
There's light ahead.

1209
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:19,634
The Valley of lmladris.

1210
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:24,222
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

1211
01:26:25,098 --> 01:26:26,557
Rivendell.

1212
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:34,315
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

1213
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,651
This was your plan all along.

1214
01:26:38,653 --> 01:26:40,655
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1215
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:44,158
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

1216
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,285
The only ill will to be found...

1217
01:26:46,536 --> 01:26:48,329
...in this valley
is that which you bring yourself.

1218
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:52,792
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

1219
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,336
They will try to stop us.

1220
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:59,549
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

1221
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,639
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

1222
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:08,182
And respect.

1223
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:10,852
And no small degree of charm.

1224
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:15,106
<i>Which is why you will leave
the talking to me.</i>

1225
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:12,413
Mithrandir.

1226
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:14,916
Ah.

1227
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,584
Lindir.

1228
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:18,377
Stay sharp.

1229
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,674
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1230
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,885
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1231
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,095
Not here?

1232
01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:30,097
Where is he?

1233
01:28:44,946 --> 01:28:46,572
Close ranks!

1234
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:11,639
Gandalf.

1235
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,933
Lord Elrond.

1236
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:34,745
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

1237
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:38,916
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

1238
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:41,460
Ah. That may have been us.

1239
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,760
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1240
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:52,388
I do not believe we have met.

1241
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:55,892
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1242
01:29:56,142 --> 01:29:57,643
I knew Thror when he ruled...

1243
01:29:57,894 --> 01:30:02,064
-...Under the Mountain.
-Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1244
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:15,494
What is he saying?

1245
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:18,122
Does he offer us insult?

1246
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:22,001
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1247
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:29,717
Well...

1248
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:31,886
...in that case, lead on.

1249
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:34,263
Hey. Come on.

1250
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:37,391
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1251
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:39,185
I don't like green food.

1252
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:41,354
Where's the meat?

1253
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,523
Have they got any chips?

1254
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:46,317
Kind of you...

1255
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:47,944
...to invite us.

1256
01:30:48,194 --> 01:30:49,695
Not really dressed for dinner.

1257
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:51,113
Well, you never are.

1258
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:13,761
I can't say I fancy Elf maids myself, too thin.

1259
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,763
They're all high cheekbones...

1260
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:18,015
...and creamy skin.

1261
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:19,642
Not enough facial hair for me.

1262
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:23,521
Although that one there is not bad.

1263
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,315
That's not an Elf maid.

1264
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,037
That's funny.

1265
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,469
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1266
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,263
A famous blade...

1267
01:31:57,513 --> 01:32:02,852
...forged by the High Elves
of the West, my kin.

1268
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:05,396
May it serve you well.

1269
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:06,439
And this...

1270
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,024
...is Glamdring...

1271
01:32:09,692 --> 01:32:11,152
...the Foehammer. Sword...

1272
01:32:11,402 --> 01:32:13,487
...of the King of Gondolin.

1273
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:16,198
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

1274
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,491
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

1275
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:21,162
Swords are named
for the great deeds they do in war.

1276
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:23,664
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

1277
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:26,167
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1278
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:29,587
More of a letter opener, really.

1279
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:32,631
- How did you come by these?
- We found them...

1280
01:32:32,882 --> 01:32:35,134
...in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road...

1281
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:36,635
...shortly before...

1282
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:40,890
-...we were ambushed by Orcs.
- And what were you doing...

1283
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,309
...on the Great East Road?

1284
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:45,686
Excuse me.

1285
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:54,904
Thirteen Dwarves...

1286
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:56,572
...and a Half ling. Hm.

1287
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:59,784
Strange traveling companions, Gandalf.

1288
01:33:00,034 --> 01:33:02,536
These are the descendants
of the house of Durin.

1289
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:04,747
They're noble, decent folk.

1290
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:07,625
And they're surprisingly cultured.

1291
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:08,876
They've got a deep love...

1292
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:11,670
-...of the arts.
- Change the tune, why don't you?

1293
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:13,506
I feel like I'm at a funeral.

1294
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:15,132
- Did somebody die?
- All right...

1295
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,718
...lads. There's only one thing for it.

1296
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:21,680
There's

1297
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:24,600
<i>An</i>

1298
01:33:25,142 --> 01:33:27,228
<i>Inn, there's an inn
There's a merry old inn</i>

1299
01:33:27,478 --> 01:33:29,146
<i>Beneath an old gray hill</i>

1300
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:32,608
<i>And there they brew a beer so brown
The Man in the Moon</i>

1301
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:34,110
<i>Himself came down
One night</i>

1302
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,236
<i>To drink his fill</i>

1303
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:36,612
<i>Oh</i>

1304
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:38,280
<i>The ostler has a tipsy cat</i>

1305
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:40,241
<i>That played a five-stringed fiddle</i>

1306
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,451
<i>And up and down he saws his bow</i>

1307
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,245
<i>Now squeaking high</i>

1308
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:47,748
<i>Now purring low</i>

1309
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,919
<i>Now sawing in the middle</i>

1310
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:53,170
<i>So</i>

1311
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:53,921
<i>The cat on the fiddle</i>

1312
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:56,382
<i>Played hey-diddle-diddle
A drink that'll wake the dead</i>

1313
01:33:56,966 --> 01:33:58,592
<i>He squeaked and he sawed
And he quickened</i>

1314
01:33:58,843 --> 01:33:59,468
<i>The tune
And the landlord</i>

1315
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:00,427
<i>Shook the Man</i>

1316
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:01,387
<i>In the Moon
"it's after</i>

1317
01:34:01,637 --> 01:34:02,471
<i>Three!" he said</i>

1318
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:13,190
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1319
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:15,192
For goodness sake, Thorin...

1320
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:17,069
- ...show him the map.
- It is the legacy...

1321
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,571
...of my people.

1322
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:22,324
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1323
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:25,035
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

1324
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:28,164
Your pride will be your downfall.

1325
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:31,250
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1326
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:35,087
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

1327
01:34:42,261 --> 01:34:43,053
Thorin, no.

1328
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:54,982
Erebor.

1329
01:34:56,442 --> 01:34:58,152
What is your interest...

1330
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,070
...in this map?

1331
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:02,823
It's mainly academic.

1332
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:04,116
As you know...

1333
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:07,870
...this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

1334
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,462
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

1335
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:26,972
Moon runes?

1336
01:35:27,223 --> 01:35:28,849
Of course.

1337
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,560
An easy thing to miss.

1338
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,354
Well, in this case, that is true.

1339
01:35:33,604 --> 01:35:36,023
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

1340
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:38,359
...of the same shape and season...

1341
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:40,611
...as the day on which they were written.

1342
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:43,197
Can you read them?

1343
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:50,829
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

1344
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,292
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

1345
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,754
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

1346
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:00,881
Fate is with you...

1347
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,841
...Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon...

1348
01:36:03,092 --> 01:36:05,135
...shines upon us tonight.

1349
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:25,406
"Stand by the...

1350
01:36:25,656 --> 01:36:28,993
...gray stone when the thrush knocks...

1351
01:36:29,243 --> 01:36:33,998
...and the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day...

1352
01:36:34,248 --> 01:36:38,544
-...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

1353
01:36:38,794 --> 01:36:42,172
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

1354
01:36:42,423 --> 01:36:45,217
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

1355
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:46,427
This is ill news.

1356
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:50,014
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1357
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:51,473
We still have time.

1358
01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:54,101
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

1359
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:58,063
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

1360
01:36:58,314 --> 01:37:02,026
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

1361
01:37:02,276 --> 01:37:02,943
So this is...

1362
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:05,779
...your purpose, to enter the mountain?

1363
01:37:06,697 --> 01:37:07,990
What of it'?

1364
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:11,160
There are some who would not deem it wise.

1365
01:37:12,786 --> 01:37:13,871
What do you mean?

1366
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:19,918
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1367
01:40:18,805 --> 01:40:19,640
Not with your...

1368
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:20,849
...companions?

1369
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:25,354
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

1370
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:32,402
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

1371
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,030
Indeed?

1372
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:39,034
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

1373
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:43,664
Really?

1374
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:45,749
Mm.

1375
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:54,132
I've also heard they're fond
of the comforts of home.

1376
01:40:57,678 --> 01:41:00,389
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

1377
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,475
That they will answer with yes and no.

1378
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:14,903
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that...

1379
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:16,488
...is your wish.

1380
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:50,522
No, you did the same thing.
It's not like you didn't do it.

1381
01:41:51,023 --> 01:41:53,942
Dori! Here, take that.

1382
01:41:59,323 --> 01:42:00,115
Bombur!

1383
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:20,010
Of course
I was going to tell you. I was waiting...

1384
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:25,057
...for this very chance. And really, I think
you can trust that I know what I am doing.

1385
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:27,809
Do you? That dragon has slept...

1386
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,603
...for 60 years.

1387
01:42:29,853 --> 01:42:31,855
What will happen if your plan should fail...

1388
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:34,816
-...if you wake that beast?
- What if we succeed?

1389
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:37,152
If the Dwarves take back the mountain...

1390
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:39,029
...our defenses in the east
will be strengthened.

1391
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:41,615
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.

1392
01:42:41,865 --> 01:42:43,659
It is also dangerous to do nothing.

1393
01:42:43,909 --> 01:42:48,163
Oh, come, the throne of Erebor
is Thorin's birthright. What is it you fear?

1394
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:49,748
Have you forgotten?

1395
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:53,293
A strain of madness
runs deep in that family.

1396
01:42:54,086 --> 01:42:56,755
His grandfather lost his mind.
His father succumbed to...

1397
01:42:57,005 --> 01:42:58,507
...the same sickness.

1398
01:42:58,757 --> 01:43:01,259
Can you swear Thorin Oakenshield...

1399
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:03,303
...will not also fall?

1400
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:09,976
Gandalf, these decisions
do not rest with us alone. It is not...

1401
01:43:10,227 --> 01:43:13,980
...up to you or me to redraw
the map of Middle-earth.

1402
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:18,652
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.

1403
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:21,738
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.

1404
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:27,077
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1405
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:28,954
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1406
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:32,708
It is not me you must answer to.

1407
01:43:44,428 --> 01:43:46,596
Lady Galadriel.

1408
01:43:47,013 --> 01:43:49,057
Mithrandir.

1409
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,620
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1410
01:44:11,538 --> 01:44:13,165
He didn't.

1411
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:15,250
I did.

1412
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,923
Ah.

1413
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:25,093
Saruman.

1414
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:29,473
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1415
01:44:30,015 --> 01:44:32,309
Tell me, Gandalf...

1416
01:44:32,559 --> 01:44:36,021
...did you think these plans
and schemes of yours...

1417
01:44:36,271 --> 01:44:38,106
...would go unnoticed?

1418
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:40,317
Unnoticed?

1419
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:42,360
No.

1420
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:44,738
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1421
01:44:45,155 --> 01:44:48,658
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1422
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:51,119
That is true, my lady.

1423
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:53,663
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1424
01:44:53,914 --> 01:44:56,666
But if he should side with the enemy...

1425
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:59,753
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1426
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,505
What enemy?

1427
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:05,050
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1428
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:10,138
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

1429
01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:15,602
Does it not worry you
that the last of the Dwarf rings...

1430
01:45:15,852 --> 01:45:17,687
...should simply vanish...

1431
01:45:17,938 --> 01:45:19,940
...along with its bearer?

1432
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:23,902
Of the seven Dwarf rings,
four were consumed by dragons...

1433
01:45:24,152 --> 01:45:27,364
...two were taken by Sauron
before he fell in Mordor.

1434
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:32,077
The fate of the last Dwarf ring
remains unknown.

1435
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:37,290
The ring that was worn by Thrain.

1436
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,501
Without the ruling Ring of Power...

1437
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:42,379
...the seven are of no value to the enemy.

1438
01:45:44,589 --> 01:45:45,257
To control...

1439
01:45:45,507 --> 01:45:46,633
...the other rings...

1440
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:50,554
...he needs the One.

1441
01:45:50,804 --> 01:45:53,348
And that ring was lost long, long ago.

1442
01:45:53,598 --> 01:45:54,558
It was swept out...

1443
01:45:54,808 --> 01:45:57,269
...to sea by the waters of the Anduin.

1444
01:45:57,519 --> 01:46:02,607
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

1445
01:46:02,858 --> 01:46:04,359
...a hard-won...

1446
01:46:04,609 --> 01:46:05,861
...watchful peace.

1447
01:46:06,111 --> 01:46:08,822
Are we? Are we at peace?

1448
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:14,286
Trolls have come down from the mountains.
They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1449
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:17,581
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1450
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:19,583
Hardly a prelude to war.

1451
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:22,002
Always you must meddle...

1452
01:46:22,252 --> 01:46:24,170
...looking for trouble where none exists.

1453
01:46:24,421 --> 01:46:26,548
Let him speak.

1454
01:46:27,674 --> 01:46:32,596
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

1455
01:46:32,846 --> 01:46:35,140
Something far more powerful.

1456
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:41,396
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1457
01:46:41,646 --> 01:46:43,523
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1458
01:46:44,649 --> 01:46:47,402
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.

1459
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:48,987
And they say...

1460
01:46:51,323 --> 01:46:51,990
Well?

1461
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,034
Don't stop now.

1462
01:46:54,284 --> 01:46:56,536
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1463
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:59,039
They speak of a Necromancer...

1464
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:00,415
...living in Dol Guldur.

1465
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:03,627
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1466
01:47:03,877 --> 01:47:05,211
That's absurd.

1467
01:47:05,462 --> 01:47:08,214
No such power exists in this world.

1468
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:12,510
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1469
01:47:12,844 --> 01:47:15,305
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1470
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:17,057
And so I thought too.

1471
01:47:17,307 --> 01:47:20,727
- But Radagast has seen--
Radagast?

1472
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:24,272
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

1473
01:47:24,522 --> 01:47:26,274
He's a foolish fellow.

1474
01:47:26,524 --> 01:47:30,654
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1475
01:47:30,904 --> 01:47:33,114
It's not that. It's his excessive...

1476
01:47:33,365 --> 01:47:35,241
...consumption of mushrooms.

1477
01:47:35,784 --> 01:47:37,160
They've addled his brain...

1478
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:39,829
...and yellowed his teeth.

1479
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:41,623
I've warned him.

1480
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:45,043
It is unbefitting one of the lstari
to be wandering the woods...

1481
01:47:45,293 --> 01:47:47,921
<i>You carry something.</i>

1482
01:47:49,089 --> 01:47:52,008
<i>It came to you from Radagast.</i>

1483
01:47:52,258 --> 01:47:55,470
<i>He found it in Dol Guldur.</i>

1484
01:47:55,887 --> 01:47:57,764
<i>Yes.</i>

1485
01:47:58,765 --> 01:48:00,809
Show me.

1486
01:48:02,352 --> 01:48:03,478
listen to me.

1487
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:07,482
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

1488
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:09,693
By all means...

1489
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:11,903
What is that?

1490
01:48:13,863 --> 01:48:16,533
A relic of Mordor.

1491
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:28,962
A Morgul Blade.

1492
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:32,298
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1493
01:48:32,549 --> 01:48:35,677
And buried with him.

1494
01:48:37,804 --> 01:48:39,806
When Angmar fell...

1495
01:48:40,056 --> 01:48:42,600
...the Men of the North took his body...

1496
01:48:42,851 --> 01:48:46,813
...and all that he possessed and sealed it
within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1497
01:48:47,063 --> 01:48:49,983
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1498
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:53,570
...in a tomb so dark...

1499
01:48:54,154 --> 01:48:55,697
...it would never come to light.

1500
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,074
This is not possible.

1501
01:48:59,034 --> 01:49:01,745
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1502
01:49:01,995 --> 01:49:03,788
They cannot be opened.

1503
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:08,835
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?

1504
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:10,503
I have none.

1505
01:49:10,754 --> 01:49:12,255
Because there is none.

1506
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,383
Let us examine what we know.

1507
01:49:16,176 --> 01:49:18,344
A single Orc pack...

1508
01:49:18,595 --> 01:49:20,847
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1509
01:49:21,556 --> 01:49:24,684
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.

1510
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:30,231
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...

1511
01:49:30,523 --> 01:49:34,360
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1512
01:49:35,236 --> 01:49:38,948
It's not so very much after all.

1513
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:42,494
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however...

1514
01:49:42,744 --> 01:49:44,370
...troubles me deeply.

1515
01:49:44,621 --> 01:49:46,247
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1516
01:49:46,498 --> 01:49:49,918
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1517
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:54,506
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

1518
01:49:54,756 --> 01:49:57,801
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.

1519
01:49:58,051 --> 01:49:59,677
<i>They are leaving.</i>

1520
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:03,723
<i>Yes.</i>

1521
01:50:05,809 --> 01:50:07,477
You <i>knew.</i>

1522
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,149
No, I'm afraid there is...

1523
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:15,485
...nothing else for it.

1524
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:18,363
My Lord Elrond.

1525
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:22,367
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1526
01:50:27,664 --> 01:50:29,541
Be on your guard.

1527
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:32,085
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1528
01:50:32,669 --> 01:50:34,921
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1529
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:36,756
Aye.

1530
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:43,388
Master Baggins...

1531
01:50:44,347 --> 01:50:46,724
...I suggest you keep up.

1532
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:01,239
You will follow them.

1533
01:51:02,073 --> 01:51:03,158
Yes.

1534
01:51:03,408 --> 01:51:06,452
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1535
01:51:06,703 --> 01:51:09,873
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1536
01:51:10,123 --> 01:51:13,418
...forces we do not yet understand.

1537
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:17,672
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.

1538
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:21,384
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.

1539
01:51:21,634 --> 01:51:23,595
It will not show itself.

1540
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:25,555
Not yet.

1541
01:51:25,805 --> 01:51:28,558
But every day it grows in strength.

1542
01:51:28,808 --> 01:51:30,518
You must be careful.

1543
01:51:35,231 --> 01:51:36,232
Mithrandir?

1544
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:40,528
Why the Half ling?

1545
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:44,449
I do not know.

1546
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:50,955
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...

1547
01:51:51,206 --> 01:51:54,083
...that can hold evil in check.

1548
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,045
But that is not what I have found.

1549
01:51:58,171 --> 01:52:01,841
I have found it is the small things...

1550
01:52:02,091 --> 01:52:04,385
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1551
01:52:04,636 --> 01:52:07,597
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

1552
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:11,601
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1553
01:52:13,686 --> 01:52:16,356
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1554
01:52:18,775 --> 01:52:21,486
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1555
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:25,823
...and he gives me courage.

1556
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:33,790
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1557
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,126
You are not alone.

1558
01:54:17,393 --> 01:54:20,104
Hey! Hold on!

1559
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:27,153
Aah!

1560
01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:28,446
Bilbo!

1561
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:31,908
We must find...

1562
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,868
...shelter!

1563
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:35,620
Look out!

1564
01:54:42,043 --> 01:54:42,877
Look out, brother!

1565
01:54:44,212 --> 01:54:45,254
Hold on!

1566
01:54:49,133 --> 01:54:50,718
This is no thunderstorm.

1567
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,638
It's a thunder-battle!

1568
01:54:54,597 --> 01:54:55,598
Look!

1569
01:55:00,645 --> 01:55:02,605
Well, bless me.

1570
01:55:02,855 --> 01:55:04,565
The legends are true.

1571
01:55:04,816 --> 01:55:08,736
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1572
01:55:15,868 --> 01:55:16,702
Take cover, you fool!

1573
01:55:18,788 --> 01:55:20,498
Hold on!

1574
01:55:28,798 --> 01:55:29,799
What's happening?

1575
01:55:30,049 --> 01:55:31,217
Grab my hand!

1576
01:55:55,158 --> 01:55:56,117
Go, go, go!

1577
01:55:56,367 --> 01:55:57,034
Run! Get off!

1578
01:55:57,285 --> 01:55:58,369
Get off!

1579
01:56:02,457 --> 01:56:04,000
- Run!
- Hold on!

1580
01:56:10,047 --> 01:56:10,756
Look out!

1581
01:56:31,903 --> 01:56:33,446
Jump!

1582
01:56:33,696 --> 01:56:34,822
Come on!

1583
01:56:38,868 --> 01:56:40,286
Hold on!

1584
01:56:48,377 --> 01:56:49,045
No!

1585
01:56:50,755 --> 01:56:52,256
No!

1586
01:57:01,015 --> 01:57:01,682
No!

1587
01:57:01,933 --> 01:57:03,351
Kili!

1588
01:57:09,398 --> 01:57:11,651
It's all right! They're alive!

1589
01:57:13,361 --> 01:57:14,028
Where's Bilbo?

1590
01:57:14,654 --> 01:57:15,655
Where's the Hobbit?

1591
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:17,949
There!

1592
01:57:21,494 --> 01:57:22,411
Get him!

1593
01:57:23,746 --> 01:57:24,747
Aah!

1594
01:57:24,997 --> 01:57:25,665
Grab my hand!

1595
01:57:25,915 --> 01:57:26,582
Bilbo!

1596
01:57:28,626 --> 01:57:29,669
Ori, be careful!

1597
01:57:29,919 --> 01:57:31,045
Take it!

1598
01:57:31,295 --> 01:57:32,463
I've got you, lad.

1599
01:57:32,713 --> 01:57:33,756
Grab on! Grab on!

1600
01:57:43,933 --> 01:57:44,642
Come on.

1601
01:57:45,643 --> 01:57:46,686
Get him.

1602
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:48,604
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1603
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:53,276
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1604
01:57:54,694 --> 01:57:57,238
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1605
01:57:58,072 --> 01:57:59,782
He should never have come.

1606
01:58:00,157 --> 01:58:02,034
He has no place amongst us.

1607
01:58:03,953 --> 01:58:05,413
Dwalin!

1608
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:12,712
It looks safe enough.

1609
01:58:12,962 --> 01:58:14,213
Search to the back.

1610
01:58:14,672 --> 01:58:17,466
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

1611
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:22,930
There's nothing here.

1612
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:26,851
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1613
01:58:27,101 --> 01:58:29,937
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1614
01:58:30,187 --> 01:58:31,814
Get some sleep.

1615
01:58:32,064 --> 01:58:34,233
We start at first light.

1616
01:58:34,734 --> 01:58:38,362
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

1617
01:58:38,613 --> 01:58:39,905
That was the plan.

1618
01:58:40,156 --> 01:58:41,490
Plans change.

1619
01:58:41,741 --> 01:58:45,202
Bofur, take the first watch.

1620
01:59:59,235 --> 01:59:59,902
Where do you think...

1621
02:00:00,152 --> 02:00:01,654
---You're going?

1622
02:00:04,448 --> 02:00:05,741
Back to Rivendell.

1623
02:00:06,909 --> 02:00:09,161
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1624
02:00:09,412 --> 02:00:10,663
You're part of the company.

1625
02:00:10,913 --> 02:00:12,289
You're one of us.

1626
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:13,833
I'm not, though, am I?

1627
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:18,170
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

1628
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:19,964
I'm not a Took...

1629
02:00:20,214 --> 02:00:23,175
...I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1630
02:00:24,552 --> 02:00:26,220
I should never have run out my door.

1631
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:28,639
You're homesick. I understand.

1632
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:31,308
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

1633
02:00:31,559 --> 02:00:34,186
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

1634
02:00:34,437 --> 02:00:35,646
To living on the road...

1635
02:00:35,896 --> 02:00:38,190
...never settling in one place,
not belonging anywhere!

1636
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:43,779
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't--

1637
02:00:49,535 --> 02:00:51,120
No, you're right.

1638
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:56,459
We don't belong anywhere.

1639
02:01:04,759 --> 02:01:07,011
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1640
02:01:10,264 --> 02:01:11,265
I really do.

1641
02:01:16,103 --> 02:01:16,937
What's that?

1642
02:01:19,732 --> 02:01:21,108
Hmm?

1643
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,003
Wake up!

1644
02:01:41,253 --> 02:01:42,046
Wake up!

1645
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:43,297
Whoa!

1646
02:02:05,945 --> 02:02:06,612
Look out! Look out!

1647
02:02:10,825 --> 02:02:11,492
Get away!

1648
02:02:16,539 --> 02:02:17,206
Filthy scum!

1649
02:02:18,207 --> 02:02:19,250
Get back!

1650
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,089
You'll pay for this!

1651
02:02:32,429 --> 02:02:34,056
Got you.

1652
02:02:35,266 --> 02:02:36,600
All right, all right.

1653
02:02:39,019 --> 02:02:41,856
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

1654
02:02:47,403 --> 02:02:48,571
Get off me!

1655
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:33,968
I feel a song coming on.

1656
02:04:36,512 --> 02:04:38,889
<i>Clap, snap
The black crack</i>

1657
02:04:39,139 --> 02:04:41,558
<i>Grip, grab
Pinch and nab</i>

1658
02:04:41,809 --> 02:04:43,435
<i>Batter and beat</i>

1659
02:04:43,686 --> 02:04:46,188
<i>Make 'em stammer and</i>

1660
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:47,898
<i>Squeak</i>

1661
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:53,028
<i>Pound,pound
Far</i>

1662
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:58,617
<i>Underground</i>

1663
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,913
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin-town</i>

1664
02:05:03,163 --> 02:05:04,999
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin-town</i>

1665
02:05:05,249 --> 02:05:08,335
<i>With a swish and a smack
And a whip and a crack</i>

1666
02:05:08,585 --> 02:05:11,296
<i>Everybody talks
When they're on my rack</i>

1667
02:05:11,547 --> 02:05:14,842
<i>Pound,pound
Far underground</i>

1668
02:05:15,092 --> 02:05:17,845
<i>Down, down, down to Goblin-town</i>

1669
02:05:18,095 --> 02:05:20,723
<i>Down, down, down to Goblin-town</i>

1670
02:05:20,973 --> 02:05:23,600
<i>Hammer and tongs
Get out your knockers and gongs</i>

1671
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:29,064
<i>You won't last long
On the end of my prong</i>

1672
02:05:29,773 --> 02:05:31,191
<i>Clash, crash</i>

1673
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:32,901
<i>Crush and smash</i>

1674
02:05:33,152 --> 02:05:35,446
<i>Bang, break
Shiver and shake</i>

1675
02:05:35,696 --> 02:05:39,825
<i>You can yammer and yelp
But there ain't no help</i>

1676
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:45,080
<i>Pound,pound
Far underground</i>

1677
02:05:45,914 --> 02:05:49,043
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin</i>

1678
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:52,212
<i>Town</i>

1679
02:05:57,092 --> 02:05:59,595
Yeah!

1680
02:06:08,812 --> 02:06:10,564
Catchy, isn't it?

1681
02:06:10,898 --> 02:06:14,318
It's one of my own compositions.

1682
02:06:14,735 --> 02:06:16,111
That's not a song.

1683
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:18,030
It's an abomination!

1684
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:19,239
Abomination.

1685
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:21,950
Mutations. Deviations.

1686
02:06:22,201 --> 02:06:25,079
That's all you're gonna find down here.

1687
02:06:28,999 --> 02:06:34,338
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

1688
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:35,547
Spies?

1689
02:06:35,798 --> 02:06:36,715
Thieves?

1690
02:06:36,965 --> 02:06:38,050
Assassins?

1691
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:39,927
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1692
02:06:40,177 --> 02:06:41,220
Dwarves?

1693
02:06:42,096 --> 02:06:43,764
We found them on the Front Porch.

1694
02:06:44,014 --> 02:06:46,767
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1695
02:06:48,519 --> 02:06:49,645
Every crack.

1696
02:06:49,895 --> 02:06:51,063
Every crevice.

1697
02:06:57,778 --> 02:06:58,695
It is my belief...

1698
02:06:58,946 --> 02:07:01,240
...your great protuberance, that they...

1699
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:03,200
...are in league with Elves!

1700
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:07,121
"Made in Rivendell." Ah.

1701
02:07:07,496 --> 02:07:10,457
Second Age. Couldn't give it away.

1702
02:07:13,627 --> 02:07:15,838
Just a couple of keepsakes.

1703
02:07:16,088 --> 02:07:18,215
What are you doing in these parts?

1704
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:23,345
Uh, don't worry, lads. I'll handle this.

1705
02:07:23,595 --> 02:07:24,888
What's--? What's that?

1706
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:29,893
No tricks. I want the truth, warts and all.

1707
02:07:30,144 --> 02:07:32,729
You're going to have to speak up.

1708
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:35,399
Your boys flattened my trumpet.

1709
02:07:35,649 --> 02:07:37,734
I'll flatten more than your trumpet!

1710
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:42,489
If it's more information you want,
I'm the one you should speak to.

1711
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:44,867
Mm-hm.

1712
02:07:47,911 --> 02:07:51,665
We were on the road.
Well, it's not so much a road as a path.

1713
02:07:51,915 --> 02:07:54,376
It's not even that, come to think of it.
More like a track.

1714
02:07:54,710 --> 02:07:58,130
Anyway, the point is, we were on this road,
like a path, like a track.

1715
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:01,758
And then we weren't, which is a problem,
because we were...

1716
02:08:02,009 --> 02:08:03,093
-...supposed to be in Dunland...
- Shut up.

1717
02:08:03,343 --> 02:08:04,511
...last Tuesday.

1718
02:08:04,761 --> 02:08:06,263
Visiting distant relations.

1719
02:08:06,763 --> 02:08:08,473
Some inbreds on me mother's side.

1720
02:08:08,724 --> 02:08:10,184
Shut up!

1721
02:08:13,562 --> 02:08:16,899
If they will not talk, we'll make them squawk.

1722
02:08:17,649 --> 02:08:19,109
Bring up the mangler.

1723
02:08:19,401 --> 02:08:22,112
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1724
02:08:22,362 --> 02:08:23,488
Start with the youngest.

1725
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:25,449
Wait!

1726
02:08:27,993 --> 02:08:30,787
Well, well, well.

1727
02:08:31,496 --> 02:08:32,664
Look who it is.

1728
02:08:34,708 --> 02:08:38,212
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1729
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:42,090
...King Under the Mountain.

1730
02:08:43,592 --> 02:08:46,887
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

1731
02:08:47,137 --> 02:08:48,680
And you're not a king...

1732
02:08:48,931 --> 02:08:49,973
...which makes you...

1733
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:53,227
...nobody, really.

1734
02:08:56,647 --> 02:09:01,485
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.

1735
02:09:02,361 --> 02:09:04,238
Just a head.

1736
02:09:04,488 --> 02:09:06,156
Nothing attached.

1737
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:10,702
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1738
02:09:11,286 --> 02:09:13,997
An old enemy of yours.

1739
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:20,963
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1740
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:25,717
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1741
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:30,347
He was slain in battle long ago.

1742
02:09:30,597 --> 02:09:34,309
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?

1743
02:09:36,436 --> 02:09:38,855
Send word to the pale Orc.

1744
02:09:39,106 --> 02:09:41,775
Tell him I have found his prize.

1745
02:10:19,604 --> 02:10:20,689
Yes.

1746
02:10:22,441 --> 02:10:23,859
Yes.

1747
02:10:24,985 --> 02:10:27,321
Yes.

1748
02:10:28,864 --> 02:10:31,325
Yes!

1749
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,410
Gollum, gollum!

1750
02:10:57,893 --> 02:10:59,311
Aah!

1751
02:11:02,064 --> 02:11:05,108
Nasty Goblinses!

1752
02:11:06,902 --> 02:11:08,570
Better than old bones, precious.

1753
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,697
Better than nothing.

1754
02:11:39,142 --> 02:11:43,814
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!

1755
02:11:44,064 --> 02:11:47,442
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1756
02:11:48,443 --> 02:11:49,361
Start with its head.

1757
02:11:55,784 --> 02:11:59,496
<i>The cold hard lands
They bites our hands</i>

1758
02:11:59,746 --> 02:12:02,999
<i>They gnaws our feet</i>

1759
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:07,295
<i>The rocks and stones
They're like old bones</i>

1760
02:12:07,921 --> 02:12:10,090
<i>All bare of meat</i>

1761
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:13,718
<i>Cold as death
Without no breath</i>

1762
02:12:14,136 --> 02:12:15,178
<i>It's good to eat</i>

1763
02:12:54,468 --> 02:12:56,761
Bless us and splash us...

1764
02:12:57,012 --> 02:12:58,638
...precious.

1765
02:12:58,889 --> 02:13:00,765
That's a meaty mouthful.

1766
02:13:02,642 --> 02:13:05,312
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1767
02:13:06,605 --> 02:13:08,899
Back. Stay back.

1768
02:13:09,149 --> 02:13:10,859
I'm warning you...

1769
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:13,361
...don't come any closer.

1770
02:13:14,446 --> 02:13:16,531
It's got an Elfish blade.

1771
02:13:16,781 --> 02:13:19,159
But it's not an Elfs.

1772
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,287
Not an Elfs, no.

1773
02:13:22,787 --> 02:13:24,498
What is it, precious?

1774
02:13:25,624 --> 02:13:27,000
What is it?

1775
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:30,670
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1776
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:33,548
Bagginses?

1777
02:13:34,257 --> 02:13:37,761
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1778
02:13:38,261 --> 02:13:42,224
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

1779
02:13:42,474 --> 02:13:47,812
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1780
02:13:49,022 --> 02:13:51,942
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

1781
02:13:52,192 --> 02:13:53,318
Now, now...

1782
02:13:53,568 --> 02:13:55,695
...keep your distance!

1783
02:13:55,946 --> 02:13:57,822
I'll use this if I have to.

1784
02:13:58,073 --> 02:13:58,949
Aah!

1785
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:00,325
I don't want any trouble.

1786
02:14:00,575 --> 02:14:01,993
Do you understand?

1787
02:14:02,244 --> 02:14:05,247
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.

1788
02:14:05,497 --> 02:14:07,332
Why? Is it lost?

1789
02:14:07,582 --> 02:14:11,336
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.

1790
02:14:11,586 --> 02:14:14,506
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

1791
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:16,216
Safe paths in...

1792
02:14:16,466 --> 02:14:17,759
...the dark. Shut up!

1793
02:14:18,134 --> 02:14:19,135
I didn't say anything.

1794
02:14:19,386 --> 02:14:21,346
We wasn't talking to you.

1795
02:14:21,596 --> 02:14:24,307
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1796
02:14:24,683 --> 02:14:26,893
Look, I don't know what your game is...

1797
02:14:27,143 --> 02:14:27,811
...but I--

1798
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:29,062

1799
02:14:29,771 --> 02:14:32,524
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?

1800
02:14:32,774 --> 02:14:34,985
Does it like games? Does it, does it?

1801
02:14:35,235 --> 02:14:36,945
Does it like to play?

1802
02:14:37,821 --> 02:14:39,114
Maybe.

1809
02:14:56,214 --> 02:14:57,799
Yes, yes.

1810
02:14:58,049 --> 02:15:01,177
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1811
02:15:01,428 --> 02:15:03,179
Yes! Do it again.

1812
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:04,764
Do it again. Ask us.

1813
02:15:05,015 --> 02:15:06,641
No! No more riddles.

1814
02:15:08,393 --> 02:15:09,185

02:15:15,108 --> 02:15:18,111
No. I want to play. I do.

1818
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:20,905
I want to play. I can see...

1819
02:15:21,156 --> 02:15:24,826
...you are very good at this.

1820
02:15:25,493 --> 02:15:27,203
So why don't we...

1821
02:15:29,164 --> 02:15:31,416
...have a game of riddles? Yes?

1822
02:15:31,666 --> 02:15:33,293

02:15:45,889 --> 02:15:47,599
Yes. Yes.

1828
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:49,559
And if it loses?

1829
02:15:49,809 --> 02:15:51,436
What then?

1830
02:15:51,686 --> 02:15:55,106
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it.

1831
02:15:56,358 --> 02:15:59,986
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1832
02:16:06,534 --> 02:16:07,494
Fair enough.

1833
02:16:12,457 --> 02:16:13,958
Well, Baggins first.

1834

02:16:27,097 --> 02:16:28,640
<i>Then they stand still</i>

1838
02:16:39,526 --> 02:16:40,568
Teeth?

1839
02:16:41,903 --> 02:16:42,987
Teeth!

1840
02:16:43,238 --> 02:16:45,782
Oh, Yes, my precious!

1841
02:16:46,408 --> 02:16:49,119
But we-- We...

1842
02:16:49,369 --> 02:16:52,497
...only have nine.

1843
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:56,793
Our turn.

02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,481
Oh. Oh!

We knows! We knows!

1853
02:17:20,608 --> 02:17:21,317
Shut up!

1854
02:17:28,158 --> 02:17:29,409
Wind.

1855
02:17:29,659 --> 02:17:30,744
It's wind.

1856
02:17:30,994 --> 02:17:32,120
Of course it is.

1857
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:33,872
Very clever...

1858
02:17:34,122 --> 02:17:35,665
...Hobbitses.

1859
02:17:36,291 --> 02:17:37,500
Very clever.

1860
02:17:37,751 --> 02:17:38,626

Box. The lid and a key.

1868

Well?

1869
02:17:57,937 --> 02:17:59,898
It's nasty.

1870
02:18:01,983 --> 02:18:03,485
Box. Key.

1871
02:18:03,735 --> 02:18:04,444
Do you give up?

1872
02:18:04,694 --> 02:18:07,197
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!

Answer us.

1888
02:19:06,005 --> 02:19:10,468
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

1889
02:19:10,844 --> 02:19:14,389
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

1890
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:15,974
I don't know this one.

1891
02:19:16,224 --> 02:19:18,059
Is it tasty?

1892
02:19:19,602 --> 02:19:22,689
Is it scrumptious?

1893
02:19:24,148 --> 02:19:25,608
Is it crunchable?

1894
02:19:25,984 --> 02:19:27,235
Let me think.

1895
02:19:27,485 --> 02:19:28,778
Let me think.

It's stuck.

1897
02:19:36,578 --> 02:19:41,207
Bagginses is stuck.

1898
02:19:44,752 --> 02:19:46,379
Time's up.

1899
02:19:50,341 --> 02:19:51,926
Time.

1900
02:19:52,176 --> 02:19:53,136
The answer...

1901
02:19:53,595 --> 02:19:54,762
...is time.

1902
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:58,474
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1903
02:20:00,894 --> 02:20:02,186
Last question.

1904
02:20:03,897 --> 02:20:05,607
Last chance.

1905
02:20:05,857 --> 02:20:07,525
Okay.

1906
02:20:10,069 --> 02:20:11,821
Ask us.

1907
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:13,948
Ask us!

...in my pocket?

1911
02:20:27,462 --> 02:20:29,464
That's no fair.

1912
02:20:30,214 --> 02:20:32,133
It's not fair! It's against...

1913
02:20:32,383 --> 02:20:33,343
...the rules!

1914
02:20:35,303 --> 02:20:36,721
Now ask us another one.

1915
02:20:37,138 --> 02:20:38,431
No. No, no, no.

1916
02:20:38,681 --> 02:20:42,560
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

02:20:46,648 --> 02:20:49,025
Three guesses, precious. It must give us...

1919
02:20:49,275 --> 02:20:50,109
...three!

1920
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,570
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1921
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:54,656
- Handses!
- Wrong.

1922
02:20:54,906 --> 02:20:55,865
Guess again.

1923
02:20:57,367 --> 02:21:01,204
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

1924
02:21:03,998 --> 02:21:06,084
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1925
02:21:06,334 --> 02:21:08,044
Wrong again. Last guess.

1926
02:21:08,294 --> 02:21:09,504
String.

1927
02:21:10,129 --> 02:21:11,339
Or nothing.

02:21:21,432 --> 02:21:23,017
Come, then. I won the game.

1931

You promised to show me the way out.

1932
02:21:25,645 --> 02:21:28,481
Did we say so, precious?

1933
02:21:28,731 --> 02:21:31,651
Did we say so?

1934
02:21:34,904 --> 02:21:39,450
What has it got in its pocketses?

1935
02:21:40,702 --> 02:21:42,370
That's no concern of yours.

1936
02:21:42,996 --> 02:21:44,998
You lost.

02:23:25,973 --> 02:23:27,058
<i>You'll be beaten</i>

1963
02:23:27,308 --> 02:23:29,477
<i>And battered
From racks you'll be hung</i>

1964
02:23:29,727 --> 02:23:30,895
<i>You will die down here</i>

1965
02:23:31,646 --> 02:23:32,939
<i>And never be</i>

1966
02:23:33,189 --> 02:23:33,856
<i>Found</i>

1967
02:23:34,107 --> 02:23:35,608
<i>Down in the deep</i>

1968
02:23:35,858 --> 02:23:38,236
<i>Of Goblin-town</i>

1969
02:23:41,155 --> 02:23:42,615
I know that sword!

1970
02:23:43,116 --> 02:23:45,118
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

1971
02:23:45,743 --> 02:23:46,911
The Biter!

1972
02:23:48,162 --> 02:23:49,455
The blade that sliced...

1973
02:23:49,705 --> 02:23:51,541
...a thousand necks! Slash them!

1974
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,794
Beat them! Kill them!

1975
02:23:55,044 --> 02:23:56,671
Kill them all!

1976
02:23:56,921 --> 02:23:58,506
Cut off his head!

1977
02:24:28,619 --> 02:24:30,830
Take up arms.

1978
02:24:31,497 --> 02:24:32,790
Fight.

1979
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:35,334
Fight!

1980
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,178
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

1981
02:24:45,803 --> 02:24:47,597
Bright as daylight!

1982
02:24:57,023 --> 02:24:58,316
Thorin!

1983
02:25:11,746 --> 02:25:12,914
Follow me.

1984
02:25:13,247 --> 02:25:13,915
Quick!

1985
02:25:17,210 --> 02:25:18,419
Run!

1986
02:25:27,053 --> 02:25:29,180
Give it to us!

1987
02:25:48,491 --> 02:25:49,659
It's...

1988
02:25:49,909 --> 02:25:51,369
<i>. . BUYS .</i>

1989
02:25:51,619 --> 02:25:53,371
It's ours!

1990
02:26:18,813 --> 02:26:20,982
Thief!

1991
02:26:22,441 --> 02:26:25,236
Baggins!

1992
02:26:31,742 --> 02:26:32,910
Quickly!

1993
02:26:34,912 --> 02:26:35,830
Faster!

1994
02:26:46,674 --> 02:26:47,633
Post!

1995
02:26:50,636 --> 02:26:51,721
Charge!

1996
02:27:38,642 --> 02:27:39,310
Cut the ropes!

1997
02:28:03,209 --> 02:28:04,377
Come on, quickly!

1998
02:28:04,627 --> 02:28:06,629
- Come on, move!
- Bombur!

1999
02:28:12,968 --> 02:28:15,012
Go, go, go!

2000
02:28:18,516 --> 02:28:19,934
Jump!

2001
02:28:25,689 --> 02:28:26,482
Jump, lad!

2002
02:28:47,503 --> 02:28:48,254
Come on!

2003
02:28:51,132 --> 02:28:52,508
Push!

2004
02:29:11,402 --> 02:29:12,987
Come on!

2005
02:29:18,576 --> 02:29:19,410
Come on!

2006
02:29:26,083 --> 02:29:27,042
Watch your backs!

2007
02:29:27,293 --> 02:29:29,837
You thought you could escape me.

2008
02:29:33,466 --> 02:29:35,926
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

2009
02:29:44,393 --> 02:29:45,478
That'll do it.

2010
02:30:20,888 --> 02:30:23,390
Well, that could have been worse.

2011
02:30:24,058 --> 02:30:24,850
Haver!

2012
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:28,437
You've got to be joking!

2013
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:35,027
Gandalf!

2014
02:30:40,407 --> 02:30:42,576
There's too many. We can't fight them.

2015
02:30:42,826 --> 02:30:44,828
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

2016
02:30:45,079 --> 02:30:46,247
Come on!

2017
02:30:46,497 --> 02:30:47,498
Here! On your feet.

2018
02:30:50,584 --> 02:30:52,753
- Balin.
- Come on!

2019
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:55,965
Wait!

2020
02:30:56,632 --> 02:30:59,051
My precious. Wait!

2021
02:30:59,885 --> 02:31:02,471
Gollum, gollum!

2022
02:31:07,643 --> 02:31:09,103
Quick, quick!

2023
02:31:11,105 --> 02:31:12,106
This way.

2024
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:18,028
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.

2025
02:31:20,656 --> 02:31:22,366
Right, good!

2026
02:32:49,411 --> 02:32:50,788
Baggins!

2027
02:32:52,122 --> 02:32:54,083
Thief!

2028
02:32:54,958 --> 02:32:59,463
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

2029
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:15,270
Five, six, seven, eight.

2030
02:33:15,729 --> 02:33:17,940
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

2031
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:20,651
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

2032
02:33:20,984 --> 02:33:24,154
And Bombur. That makes 13.

2033
02:33:24,905 --> 02:33:26,198
Where's Bilbo?

2034
02:33:27,032 --> 02:33:29,076
Where is our Hobbit?

2035
02:33:30,202 --> 02:33:31,745
Where is our Hobbit?

2036
02:33:33,247 --> 02:33:34,164
Curse that Half ling!

2037
02:33:35,082 --> 02:33:36,125
Now he's lost?

2038
02:33:36,375 --> 02:33:37,710
I thought he was with Dori!

2039
02:33:38,544 --> 02:33:39,545
Don't blame me!

2040
02:33:39,795 --> 02:33:40,879
Where did you last see him?

2041
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:41,797
I think I saw him...

2042
02:33:42,047 --> 02:33:42,756
...slip away...

2043
02:33:43,006 --> 02:33:43,716
...when they first collared us.

2044
02:33:43,966 --> 02:33:45,342
And what happened, exactly?

2045
02:33:45,592 --> 02:33:47,845
- Tell me!
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what happened.

2046
02:33:48,095 --> 02:33:49,680
Master Baggins saw his chance...

2047
02:33:49,930 --> 02:33:50,848
...and he took it.

2048
02:33:51,724 --> 02:33:54,226
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

2049
02:33:54,643 --> 02:33:57,271
...since first he stepped out of his door.

2050
02:33:57,521 --> 02:33:59,815
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

2051
02:34:00,482 --> 02:34:02,067
He is long gone.

2052
02:34:14,246 --> 02:34:14,955
No.

2053
02:34:16,248 --> 02:34:16,915
He isn't.

2054
02:34:21,211 --> 02:34:22,463
Bilbo Baggins.

2055
02:34:23,046 --> 02:34:24,173
I have never been so glad...

2056
02:34:24,423 --> 02:34:26,008
...to see anyone in my life.

2057
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:28,677
Bilbo.

2058
02:34:29,178 --> 02:34:29,887
We'd given you up.

2059
02:34:30,137 --> 02:34:32,055
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

2060
02:34:32,306 --> 02:34:33,849
How, indeed.

2061
02:34:43,025 --> 02:34:45,986
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

2062
02:34:47,112 --> 02:34:47,988
It matters.

2063
02:34:48,614 --> 02:34:49,948
I want to know.

2064
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:53,869
Why did you come back?

2065
02:34:57,206 --> 02:35:00,292
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

2066
02:35:02,503 --> 02:35:04,588
And you're right.
I often think of Bag-end.

2067
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:07,216
I miss my books.

2068
02:35:08,175 --> 02:35:10,719
And my armchair and my garden.

2069
02:35:11,970 --> 02:35:13,305
See, that's where I belong.

2070
02:35:14,014 --> 02:35:15,724
That's home.

2071
02:35:17,476 --> 02:35:19,561
And that's why I came back. Because...

2072
02:35:21,897 --> 02:35:24,775
...you don't have one. A home.

2073
02:35:25,442 --> 02:35:27,027
It was taken from you.

2074
02:35:30,113 --> 02:35:32,658
But I will help you take it back if I can.

2075
02:36:06,149 --> 02:36:07,568
Out of the frying pan.

2076
02:36:07,818 --> 02:36:10,112
And into the fire. Run.

2077
02:36:10,445 --> 02:36:11,530
Run!

2078
02:36:27,588 --> 02:36:28,255
Go!

2079
02:36:56,158 --> 02:36:56,825
Up into the trees!

2080
02:36:57,075 --> 02:36:58,035
All of you!

2081
02:36:58,285 --> 02:36:59,536
Climb! Bilbo, climb!

2082
02:37:00,245 --> 02:37:00,913
Quickly!

2083
02:37:11,632 --> 02:37:12,674
They're coming!

2084
02:37:51,213 --> 02:37:52,881
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!

2085
02:38:14,361 --> 02:38:15,821
Azog.

2086
02:38:42,514 --> 02:38:44,307
It cannot be.

2087
02:39:37,819 --> 02:39:39,237
It's going!

2088
02:40:28,829 --> 02:40:30,080
Fili!

2089
02:40:54,688 --> 02:40:55,689
Yeah!

2090
02:41:04,948 --> 02:41:06,116
No!

2091
02:41:12,914 --> 02:41:13,582
Oh, no.

2092
02:41:19,171 --> 02:41:20,630
Mr. Gandalf!

2093
02:41:26,511 --> 02:41:27,554
Oh, no, Dori!

2094
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:39,167
Help!

2095
02:42:57,894 --> 02:42:59,104
No!

2096
02:43:11,783 --> 02:43:13,576
Thorin! No!

2097
02:46:12,589 --> 02:46:13,256
Look.

2098
02:47:01,721 --> 02:47:03,264
Thorin!

2099
02:48:18,339 --> 02:48:19,924
Thorin!

2100
02:48:23,678 --> 02:48:24,721
Thorin.

2101
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:43,364
The Half ling?

2102
02:48:44,449 --> 02:48:46,492
It's all right.

2103
02:48:46,909 --> 02:48:47,869
Bilbo is here.

2104
02:48:48,119 --> 02:48:50,079
He's quite safe.

2105
02:49:00,006 --> 02:49:01,049
You!

2106
02:49:05,011 --> 02:49:06,054
What were you doing?

2107
02:49:06,971 --> 02:49:07,764
You nearly got...

2108
02:49:08,014 --> 02:49:09,182
...yourself killed!

2109
02:49:11,225 --> 02:49:11,976
Did I not say...

2110
02:49:12,226 --> 02:49:14,145
...that you would be a burden?

2111
02:49:14,979 --> 02:49:17,440
That you would not survive in the Wild?

2112
02:49:18,608 --> 02:49:20,526
That you had no place amongst us?

2113
02:49:26,115 --> 02:49:28,326
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

2114
02:49:42,173 --> 02:49:43,716
I am sorry I doubted you.

2115
02:49:43,966 --> 02:49:46,177
No, I would have doubted me too.

2116
02:49:47,011 --> 02:49:48,012
I'm not a hero...

2117
02:49:48,262 --> 02:49:49,722
...or a warrior.

2118
02:49:51,683 --> 02:49:52,350
Not even...

2119
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:53,851
...a burglar.

2120
02:50:13,287 --> 02:50:15,540
Is that what I think it is?

2121
02:50:30,763 --> 02:50:31,806
Erebor...

2122
02:50:33,433 --> 02:50:34,976
...the Lonely Mountain...

2123
02:50:35,226 --> 02:50:37,186
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms...

2124
02:50:37,437 --> 02:50:39,897
...of Middle-earth.

2125
02:50:42,608 --> 02:50:44,402
Our home.

2126
02:50:48,865 --> 02:50:49,532
A raven!

2127
02:50:50,450 --> 02:50:51,242
The birds...

2128
02:50:51,492 --> 02:50:53,494
...are returning to the mountain.

2129
02:50:56,914 --> 02:50:58,666
That, my dear Oin...

2130
02:50:58,916 --> 02:51:00,668
...is a thrush.

2131
02:51:01,919 --> 02:51:04,005
But we'll take it as a sign.

2132
02:51:04,255 --> 02:51:05,256
A good omen.

2133
02:51:05,506 --> 02:51:07,008
You're right.

2134
02:51:07,717 --> 02:51:10,511
I do believe the worst is behind us.

2135
02:53:03,416 --> 02:53:05,668
Far over

2136
02:53:05,918 --> 02:53:10,089
<i>The misty mountains rise</i>

2137
02:53:11,424 --> 02:53:14,051
<i>Leave us standing</i>

2138
02:53:15,177 --> 02:53:17,638
<i>Upon the height</i>

2139
02:53:19,223 --> 02:53:21,893
<i>What was before</i>

2140
02:53:23,185 --> 02:53:26,147
We see once more

2141
02:53:27,315 --> 02:53:32,528
<i>ls our kingdom a distant light</i>

2142
02:53:34,572 --> 02:53:39,911
<i>Fiery mountain beneath the moon</i>

2143
02:53:41,370 --> 02:53:44,790
<i>The words unspoken</i>

2144
02:53:45,333 --> 02:53:47,919
<i>We'll be there soon</i>

2145
02:53:49,503 --> 02:53:52,506
<i>For home a song</i>

2146
02:53:53,507 --> 02:53:56,594
<i>That echoes on</i>

2147
02:53:57,553 --> 02:54:02,892
<i>And all who find us will know the tune</i>

2148
02:54:06,228 --> 02:54:09,440
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

2149
02:54:10,232 --> 02:54:13,569
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

2150
02:54:14,403 --> 02:54:17,531
<i>Haven't seen the back of us yet</i>

2151
02:54:18,491 --> 02:54:21,786
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

2152
02:54:22,495 --> 02:54:25,706
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

2153
02:54:26,415 --> 02:54:29,794
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

2154
02:54:30,544 --> 02:54:33,756
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2155
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:39,428
<i>Until we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2156
02:54:41,347 --> 02:54:43,474
<i>We lay under</i>

2157
02:54:43,724 --> 02:54:47,186
<i>The misty mountains cold</i>

2158
02:54:49,063 --> 02:54:51,565
<i>In slumbers deep</i>

2159
02:54:52,733 --> 02:54:55,194
<i>And dreams of gold</i>

2160
02:54:57,029 --> 02:55:00,241
<i>We must awake</i>

2161
02:55:01,117 --> 02:55:04,120
<i>Our lives to make</i>

2162
02:55:05,121 --> 02:55:10,167
<i>And in the darkness a torch we hold</i>

2163
02:55:12,211 --> 02:55:17,550
<i>From long ago when lanterns burned</i>

2164
02:55:19,218 --> 02:55:22,221
<i>Until this day</i>

2165
02:55:23,264 --> 02:55:25,558
<i>Our hearts have yearned</i>

2166
02:55:27,268 --> 02:55:30,062
<i>Her fate unknown</i>

2167
02:55:31,397 --> 02:55:34,650
<i>The Arkenstone</i>

2168
02:55:35,526 --> 02:55:37,987
<i>What was stolen</i>

2169
02:55:39,363 --> 02:55:41,615
<i>Must be returned</i>

2170
02:55:57,548 --> 02:56:01,260
<i>We must awake</i>

2171
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:05,264
<i>And make the day</i>

2172
02:56:05,556 --> 02:56:09,143
<i>To find a song</i>

2173
02:56:09,393 --> 02:56:11,520
<i>For heart and soul</i>

2174
02:56:15,232 --> 02:56:18,486
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

2175
02:56:19,278 --> 02:56:22,531
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

2176
02:56:23,449 --> 02:56:26,535
<i>Haven't seen the end of it yet</i>

2177
02:56:27,578 --> 02:56:30,706
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

2178
02:56:31,499 --> 02:56:34,877
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

2179
02:56:35,544 --> 02:56:38,964
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

2180
02:56:39,632 --> 02:56:42,843
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2181
02:56:43,636 --> 02:56:48,432
<i>Till we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2182
02:56:50,101 --> 02:56:52,520
Far away

2183
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:57,566
<i>From misty mountains cold</i>

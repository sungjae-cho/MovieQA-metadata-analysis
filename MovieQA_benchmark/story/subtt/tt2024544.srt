Get out.

1105
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,421
Get off the porch. You ain't
supposed to be on the porch.

1106
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:55,743
Get off the porch.

Yes, sir.

1110
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,132
No, sir, I have not.

1111
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,467
It comes to you quite naturally.

1112
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,631
Are you educated?

1113
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:17,677

How does such come to pass?

1175
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,055
Working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand.

1176
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,967
I'm of a damn sight
better station.

1177
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,104
I worked as
an overseer, you know.

1178
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:53,684
I did not know, sir.

1179
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:55,349
Not "sir."

1180
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:57,859
Just "Armsby."

1181
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,899
I'm not owed more than
any other in the field.

1182
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:04,032
How did you arrive at such
a place, if I may ask?

1183
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,034
Ask, it's just conversation.

1184
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,123
I became a little too
dependent on the whiskey...

1185
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,751
a little too
undependable on the job.

1186
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,792
Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1187
01:30:18,954 --> 01:30:21,082
let me state my case.

1188
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,127
As reliable employment
as overseeing is,

1189
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,345
it is no easy chore
on the spirit.

1190
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:30,015
I say, no man of conscious...

1191
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,644
can take the lash to another
human day in and day out...

1192
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:35,180
without shredding
at his own self.

1193
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,354
Takes him to a place...

1194
01:30:38,515 --> 01:30:43,021
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

1195
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,865
or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations.

1196
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,368
So, I trampled.

1197
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,449
With frequency.

1198
01:30:52,988 --> 01:30:56,118
I gave in to tales
of wealth and prosperity.

1199
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,877
But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.

1200
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,675
It's the lot of
the rest of us to serve.

1201
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:14,679
Now, all I want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home.

I promise them to you if you
will do me the favor I require.

01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:02,145
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

1207
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,775
Uh...

1208
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:06,104
What is it you ask?

1209
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:08,444
First, your word, sir.

1210
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,149
On my honor.

1211
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,279
It's a simple enough request.

1212
01:32:15,654 --> 01:32:17,453
I only ask that
you deposit a letter

1213
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,326
at the post office
in Marksville...

1214
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,962
and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

1215
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,635
A patron is what I require, sir.

1216
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,016
I'll do it.

1217
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,557
And I'll accept
whatever payment's offered.

1218
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:44,855
To assist you,
I put my own self at risk.

1219
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,485
I will do so...

1220
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,819
but fair compensation
is all I ask.

1221
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:02,247
Draw up your letter.

1222
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:04,878
We'll meet again in two days?

1223
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,378
In two days.

1224
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:12,671

Well, boy...

1227
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:37,096
I understand I got a learned
nigger that writes letters.

Armsby told me today...

1231
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,938
the devil was among my niggers.

1232
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:57,576
That I had one that
needed watching...

1233
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,078
or he would run away.

1234
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,907
When I asked him why...

1235
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:08,286
he said you come over to him...

1236
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,296
waked him up in the
middle of the night...

1237
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,130
and wanted him to
carry a letter...

1238
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,127
to Marksville.

1239
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,640
What do you got to say to that?

1240
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,228
There's no truth to it.

1241
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,643
You say.

1242
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:36,109
How could I write a letter
without ink or paper?

1243
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,777
Who am I gonna write to? I got
no friends living as I know of.

1244
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,576
That Armsby...

1245
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:48,493
That Armsby is a lying,
drunken fellow.

1246
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,252
Didn't he want you to
hire him as an overseer?

1247
01:35:55,123 --> 01:35:56,751
Well, that's it.

1248
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,328
He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...

1249
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:02,841
so you'll hire him
as an overseer.

1250
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,728
He believes you're a soft soap.

1251
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:10,064
And he's given to such talk.

1252
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,689

01:43:14,854 --> 01:43:17,984
that there is no justice nor
righteousness in their slavery.

1341
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:20,945

an interesting question.

1342
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,534
What right have
you to your niggers,

1343
01:43:23,655 --> 01:43:25,033

Mmm.

I paid for them.

1346
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:32,331
Of course you did,
and the law says

1347
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,253
you have the right
to hold a nigger.

1348
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:36,385
But begging
the law's pardon, it lies.

1349
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:39,050
Suppose they pass
a law taking away

1350
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,219
your liberty,
making you a slave.

1351
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:42,507

Universal truths are constant.

1355
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:51,149
It is a fact,
a plain and simple fact...

1356
01:43:51,307 --> 01:43:54,528
that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

God, what is the difference?

1360
01:44:05,155 --> 01:44:06,923

what the difference is

1361

and a baboon.

higher than brute animals...

you and men like you
will have to answer for it.

white, or white, black...

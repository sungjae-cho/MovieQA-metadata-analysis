3
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,087
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

4
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,754
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

5
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,060
MESSNER: Well, that's
my problem, though.
I don't gain weight. I tried.

6
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,793
That's 'cause
you're 12 years old.

7
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,129
Yeah, well, then,
who gives a shit?

8
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,726
Can I get you
something to drink?

9
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,362
You're disgusting.

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,230
Come on, don't keep it
by the water either.

11
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,435
Don't even let it
rub shoulders
with the other bottle.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,412
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

13
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:26,475
My grandmother...
I swear to God,
my grandmother told me.

14
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:31,047
She said... She did, 'cause
when I used to get a zit
or something, she said...

15
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,648
She pissed on your face?

16
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,285
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,329
What?
It's my grandmother!

18
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,491

Joe, are you guys

25
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,586
Because if you are,
it's certainly not
coming up here in the van

26
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,781

What?

34

What kind of deodorant
do you use?
I don't use deodorant.

35

Look at you.
What? I live in a van.

36
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,241
What does that mean?

37
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,215
It's bad for you.
It causes Alzheimer's.

38
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,376
What?

39
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,886
Alzheimer's. You get
Alzheimer's if you're

It's a double-cross.</i>

<i>... ransom him back,
pick up that nut.</i>

76
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,599
<i>We're that much closer to
doing our own thing.</i>

77

Let me tell you.
These guys got some balls.

81
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,211

<i>You ain't heard

85
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,022
<i>But before I get to it,
one more thing. I should
probably bring it up.</i>

86

<i>Primo wants Israel's heart.</i>

87
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,102
What'd he just say?
He's going to cut
his heart out.

88
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,070
<i>His heart?
Jesus, what for?</i>

89
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,074

This is how they hate.</i>

91

<i>Let's get pros.
People who know
how to behave.</i>

95

This thing's gonna

96
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,052
<i>You know, there's
a pair of broads I think
might be very good for this.</i>

97
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,150
Which broads?

98
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,956
<i>They're reliable?
They're good? What?</i>

99
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,829

102
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:06,927
<i>Might have to

00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,405
Here's the punch line.

He said one million.
One million.

114
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,023
One million,

115
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,567
Plus the heart.

Who am I gonna whack?

141

Stop it. Stop it.

<i>Now he's got connections.
He's got pull.</i>

143
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,731
So he starts to make plays.

00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,290
<i>Wants to live

00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,685
<i>The next thing you know,
Buddy Israel
has brought the heat to bear</i>

162
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,456
on none other than
Mr. Primo Sparazza himself.

163
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,558
Enforcer,
extortionist, killer.

164
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,861
Sparazza has been rumored
to have performed

165
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,463
in excess of
100 contract murders,

166
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,272
including one of the Bureau's
most celebrated agents,
Freeman Heller.

167
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,835
I thought Heller
was a double-op?

168
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,371
He worked for the OSS
before joining
the Bureau in its heyday.

169
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,477
He was the first operative
assigned with
infiltrating the mob.

170
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,079
Fake identity,
falsified backgrounds,

171
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,351
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

172
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,653
<i>Heller implemented
way back when.</i>

173
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,819
...your attention
to these overlays,

174
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,592
I'll show you exactly
what I meant when I said,
"Change my face."

175
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,658
And as a result,
his undercover work
was highly successful.

176
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,228
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

177
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,467
I will have my ears
pinned back.

178
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,977
Removing a slight piece
of bone in my chin,
I will alter my jaw line.

179
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,415
<i>Eventually, he reached
the rank of capo inside
the Carlotta crime family,</i>

180
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,113
<i>but due to some
internal slipup,
his cover was compromised.</i>

181
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,020
<i>Primo Sparazza
was given the contract
to kill him.</i>

182
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,023
Sparazza is
a bit of a specter.

183
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,394
Over the years, the serious
crimes with which he was
thought to be involved with,

184
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,956
including Heller's murder,
could never be
traced back to him.

185
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,527
<i>A dedicated viciousness
and slavish devotion
to mob doctrine</i>

186
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,971
had Sparazza's star
on the rise.

187
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,374
So they relocated him to
Nevada and made him the head
of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

188
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,433
Water.

189
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,070
What's his connection
to Israel?

190
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,547
<i>Sparazza introduced
Israel to the life.</i>

191
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,712
<i>Gave him his first big break
onstage, brought him up
through the ranks.</i>

192
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,517
And Israel played
the situation very shrewdly.

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,354
<i>Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,</i>

194
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,916
<i>with the idea
of toppling the throne.</i>

195
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,554
You know, I've seen
some stupid moves, but...

196
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,497
Well, you spend your life
pulling rabbits out of hats
and sawing people in half,

197
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,056
anything seems possible.

198
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,728
Israel wanted to touch
something real,
something dangerous.

199
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,207
But what he wound up doing
was splitting the family
into dual factions.

200
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,267
Sparazza on one side,
Israel on the other.

201
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,983
<i>The infighting that followed
drew the interest
of every investigative body</i>

202
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,021
<i>operating under the canopy
of the federal government.</i>

203
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,078
This is it, right here.

204
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,680
Presently, we have...

205
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,283
Sixteen state
and federally-funded agencies

206
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,124
running concurrent
criminal probes

207
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,130
<i>on select members
of La Cosa Nostra.</i>

208
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,032
<i>LOCKE. : With Israel
being the target of
virtually every one.</i>

209
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,538
<i>His testimony
has the potential
of blowing the lid</i>

210
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,005
<i>off of what's left
of La Cosa Nostra
in this country.</i>

211
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,770
<i>That alone warrants
total immunity
from prosecution</i>

212
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,972
<i>and a vanishing act with the
Witness Protection Program.</i>

213
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,385
The wiretaps
on Serna and Padiche,
mention of Israel's heart?

214
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,718
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

215
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,779
Sparazza's health
is in rapid decline

216
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,827
and before he dies,
he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

217
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,729
A recently opened
million-dollar escrow account

218
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,097
has been traced
back to Sparazza.

219
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,728
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

220
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,034
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

221
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,637
SYKES: How real?

222
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:22,505
How about six figures
for that fool?
How's that love?

223
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,607
Bullshit.
No, baby.

224
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,553
They heard about
that triad hit,
the work y'all put in.

225
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,453
And they recognize
the skills.

226
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,991
Now, you all want this?

227
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,892
Hell, yeah.
Well, I'm gonna
get it for you.

228
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,292
What?

229
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,193
There it is! There it is!

230
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,738
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

231
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,375
You see? Write that shit down.

232
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,716
Are you saying that just
because me and baby girl
here got a rep on the rise,

233
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,251
you know,
we chipped some nails
on some niggas,

234
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,050
they want us to
go in and drop
this mafioso motherfucker?

235
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:08,184
The way it works, girl.
Y'all peeled some
serious caps. Word travels.

236
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,458
So, we're supposed
to go in there,
bust on this punk

237
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,362
and remove his heart.
Is that for real?

238
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:19,393
You go in and pull him out.
That heart shit?
That's just for flavor.

239
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,402
Now, I'm still trying
to get the down-Iow
from this cat Padiche.

240
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,345
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

241
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,745
Buddy Israel.

242
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,010
What else did Padiche say?

243
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,281
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

244
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,313
I said, "Cool. 'Cause I got
two of the hottest,

245
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,120
"heaviest bitches alive."

246
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,821
Like who?
Like Pasquale Acosta.

247
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,921
Blood-money mercenary.

248
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,628
<i>His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "El Estrago."</i>

249
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,630
<i>"The Plague."</i>

250
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,133
<i>American educated. Fluent in
over a dozen languages.
Freelanced for the CIA.</i>

251
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,111
<i>Noted for his
legendary torture techniques.</i>

252
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,177
(SCREAMING)

253
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,451
<i>When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,</i>

254
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,085
<i>in prison he chewed off
his fingertips to the bones,</i>

255
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,391
<i>so he couldn't be
printed or ID'd by Interpol.</i>

256
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,954
Is it possible that
he could be involved in this?

257
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,435
A million-dollar hit fee
would draw some huge flies.
And Acosta's pure mercenary.

258
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:29,340
He has a history of
taking on tough kills,
and he's certainly not alone.

259
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,172
Who else?
How about the Tremor Brothers?

260
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:37,011
Three of them.
Same skank mom,
different deadbeat dads.

261
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,017
They're used for
that suicide-style,
kamikaze shit.

262
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,814
Heard about that
dinner club in Cleveland?

263
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,846
<i>That got squat-fucked,
shot to shit,
slashed and burned?</i>

264
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,756
<i>What happened?</i>

265
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,729
<i>Well, the Tremor Brothers
go rip-shit riot
on the whole fucking place.</i>

266
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,994
<i>Seven dead, 28 wounded.</i>

267
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,160
<i>Just to get
this one fucking guy.</i>

268
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,832
<i>In the course of the melee,
one of them gets shot
in the neck. He passes out.</i>

269
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,741
<i>Another one catches blowback
from a jammed piece.</i>

270
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,800
<i>He's temporarily blinded.</i>

271
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,312
<i>Third one gets
a bullet lodged in his back,
he can't walk.</i>

272
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,083
<i>They're speed-freak,
neo-Nazi assholes
who read and recite</i>

273
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,556
<i>Mein Kampf like it was
Mother Goose.</i>

274
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,183
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

275
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,750
and these motherfuckers
will go megaton

276
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,527
at the drop of a hat.

277
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,091
<i>S YKES. : I ain't never
heard of him.
WATTERS. : Me, neither.</i>

278
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,633
Then listen up,
'cause he may wind up
being your main competition.

279
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,574
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

280
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,603
A lot of folks want
this white boy clapped.

281
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,581
Word is Soot is working
for one of them.

282
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,720
<i>Now, they don't know
where he's from, how long
he's been in the game,</i>

283
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,619
<i>or even what he looks like.</i>

284
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,194
<i>But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,</i>

285
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,126
<i>they're the last ones
to see it coming.</i>

286
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,929
<i>DUPREE. : So, there it is.</i>

287
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,905
The bond on Buddy Israel
expires in 18 hours.
After that, it's a jump ball.

288
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,805
Who posted the bond?

289
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,811
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

290
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,439
He walked out the door
after he made bail.
Hasn't been seen since.

291
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,009
If this Israel really is
the great white whale
of snitches,

292
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,487
then what are we doing
messing with the mob,
who are,

293
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:02,255
correct me if I'm wrong, but
I think they're going to pour
boxes of bullets into his ass?

294
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,386
Here we go.

295
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,453
What incentive
is there to track him

296
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,728
on something as small time
as a fucking skip trace?

297
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,166
I take it you're not going.

298
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,931
No, I'm gonna go
into Kentucky

299
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,996
and take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot,

300
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,632
and after that I'm gonna go
into hell after Hitler.

301
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,145
Would you please
find your fangs,
you fucking coward,

302
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,511
and get with this?
What is wrong with you?

303
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,540
Seriously.
What is wrong with you?

304
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:31,214
Listen, I know
where Israel is, okay?

305
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,225
So we have maybe a day

306
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,626
before that location
that I know

307
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,859
gets grapevined and
the whole fucking world
gets hip to this.

308
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,458
He's in Lake Tahoe
on the Nevada side.

309
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,230
We got to lay
something out, though.

310
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,534
You go up in there
ad-libbing and shit,
it's your ass.

311
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,664
What are we talking
on the split?

312
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,470
Forty-five a piece
for you two.

313
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,066
Ten percent finder's fee
for me.

314
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,270
So, what's
the time frame?

315
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,642
Fast as we can
get you there.

316
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,046
We wait any longer,
someone gonna dead this fool.

317
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,209
<i>MESSNER. : Then we
lose our witness.</i>

318
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,514
And we lose our case.

319
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,580
Now, Israel's manager,
a man by the name
of Morris Mecklen,

320
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,093
<i>has guaranteed us
that Israel will enter

learned of his whereabouts.

return him to Las Vegas.

<i>We got a receipt
out of his pocket.</i>

812

<i>It was for a uniform rental.
What kind of uniform?</i>

813

I need you to lock down...
I need you
to limit physical activity...

822
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,400
Is that clear?
Nobody gets in the hotel.

823
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,469
Nobody gets near
the crime scene.
Make it happen, okay?

824
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,402
Dupree was
going in as security.
Yep.

I'm gonna go over

You get over to the lake.

whatever you can.
What are you gonna do?

828
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,937
I'm gonna get to Israel
before they do.

I don't think
that's gonna work.
And why?

830
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,483
Because we don't need
to bring any more
shit down on our heads.

831

I'm saying we're gonna hit

Israel. That's how I'm on it.

the kind of loyalty

00:55:58,613 --> 00:56:01,138
Bitch, I'm about to ball this.

967
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:05,016
Okay, then. Punk.

968
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:06,348
No, it was not
made clear to me.

969
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:07,445
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

970
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,717
Have you contacted
Agent Carruthers?

971
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:13,218
Yeah, cell reception up here
is terrible, but until you
or I speak with him,

972
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:15,125
he's the SAC and he's
the guy I answer to...

973
00:56:15,196 --> 00:56:16,595
<i>REPORTER. : As to the identity
of the two bodies...</i>

974
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,188
Look, in less than an hour,
you're gonna have

975
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:20,496
40 to 50-odd field agents
arriving in Lake Tahoe

976
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:21,967
without the slightest clue
as to why.

977
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:24,334
We are instructed
to take Israel
into protective custody.

978
00:56:24,405 --> 00:56:25,531
That's a two-man operation.

979
00:56:25,607 --> 00:56:27,666
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

980
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:30,233
Messner?
Listen. Hold it. I need
to speak with Locke.

981
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:31,300
Get him on the phone.

982
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:33,279
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

983
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,838
You Messner?
Yeah. Who's this?

984
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:37,248
Take a look at that.
Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

985
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:38,410
Used to be
with the PD down there.

986
00:56:38,486 --> 00:56:40,283
Agent Messner,
we recovered the car.

987
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,018
What car?
Dupree's car. '89
Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

988
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:47,220
Where did you find it?
Parking structure
at the Nomad.

989
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:04,434
Are the overheads necessary?

990
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:06,776
Turn the overheads off! Now!

991
00:57:06,848 --> 00:57:09,339
Not exactly low profile,
is this?
No, sir.

992
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:10,679
Hotel locked down at all?

993
00:57:10,752 --> 00:57:12,947
I couldn't tell you that
right now, sir.

994
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:15,512
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

995
00:57:16,157 --> 00:57:21,026
What, you stuck on stupid
or something? I know. You rode
a little bus to school.

996
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:25,623
Hey, man, stop using
that fucking lotion, man.
You look like a damn Muppet.

997
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:28,302
And don't let your bitch
cut your hair no more, dawg.

998
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:31,338
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

999
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,569
Hey, but you need to bring
your ass down here and
help me out, Hugo, for real.

1000
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:36,769
I ain't cleaning all this
shit up myself, man.

1001
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,642
I'm tired.
I ain't no fucking
cleaning lady, dawg.

1002
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:42,342
For real. Bring your ass
down here. Shit.

1003
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,406
(SHOT FIRED)

1004
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:45,577
(GASPING)

1005
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:55,551
What the fuck?

1006
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:00,957
Hell, no.
You didn't do that, dawg.

1007
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:08,005
What'd you say to Mecklen?

1008
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,439
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

1009
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:14,409
You see,

1010
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:18,879
this is one of them
rare moments where
your ass get a chance

1011
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,113
to be completely honest.

1012
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:26,584
If I'm asking you what
you said to Mecklen,
assume the shit is rhetorical.

1013
00:58:27,495 --> 00:58:29,087
Assume I already know.

1014
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:32,662
What do you see right now?

1015
00:58:33,668 --> 00:58:36,831
You see exactly and only

1016
00:58:37,705 --> 00:58:42,642
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, Ivy.

1017
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:47,611
That is the lie that
I tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

1018
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:52,085
in the moment,
in that split second,

1019
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,154
but seeing behind
this motherfucker and knowing

1020
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,858
that it's all bullshit.
Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

1021
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:06,127
But I can shape it, I can
shift it, I can make it
as real as this room.

1022
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,227
That's why I'm valuable here,
Ivy. And that is why
you are not.

1023
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:12,329
I ain't valuable?
I am sorry.

1024
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:15,807
I love you. I never
wanted it to be like this.
You know that.

1025
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:19,904
It don't matter
what you wanted.
It's what you did.

1026
00:59:20,982 --> 00:59:23,951
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

1027
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,447
<i>wait till you see
what I'm about to do here.</i>

1028
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:01,045
I don't believe this.

1029
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:06,349
Battery's completely dead.

1030
01:00:08,529 --> 01:00:12,488
Forget it. You won't get
a signal in here.
You'll have to wait.

1031
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:16,265
What about that line?
Can't you contact
your people with that?

1032
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:18,965
No, these phones
are hardwired directly
to maintenance,

1033
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,304
but once we reach
the penthouse,
I can call down.

1034
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,900
I'll have the elevators
taken offline, sir.

1035
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,507
<i>LOCKE. : Pasquale Acosta.</i>

1036
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,849
<i>Blood-money mercenary.

1037
01:00:33,721 --> 01:00:35,052
<i>The Plague.</i>

1038
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,350
<i>When he was caught
by the SAS in Belfast.</i>

1039
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,520
<i>And in prison, he chewed off
his fingertips to the bone.</i>

1040
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:49,292
Why don't you
have maintenance do it?

1041
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:52,799
Do what, sir?
Shut the elevator down.

1042
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:56,241
An emergency shutdown
of our entire elevated
lift system, sir?

1043
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,335
No. That has to be
handled by my staff, sir.

1044
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:13,420
How long have you
been working here?

1045
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:15,859
Bill?

1046
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,763
<i>MAN. : Oh, my God, I need
an ambulance for Bill!
I'm in the security room.</i>

1047
01:01:38,953 --> 01:01:40,784
Are you anywhere
near the penthouse?
No, no.

1048
01:01:40,855 --> 01:01:42,447
But that definitely
sounds like gunshots,

1049
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:43,854
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

1050
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:45,790
It's your IFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

1051
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,191
You just picking up
their signal.

1052
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:50,094
<i>We need Nomad hotel security
to lock down the elevators
immediately.</i>

1053
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,224

this motherfucker
just went off.

1054
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:55,735
<i>Man, these fools.
What? What's wrong? What?</i>

1055
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:59,637
Man, fucking security's
shutting down the elevators
in your building.

<i>AUTOMATED VOICE. :

1057

<i>Elevator service has been

1059

01:02:12,453 --> 01:02:16,981
<i>Elevator service has been

1061
01:02:17,058 --> 01:02:18,889
Well, let's get on it, then.

1062
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:32,533
I wanna pick them down there.
In the elevator.

1063
01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:36,743
More duct. Come on, more duct.
A little more duct.

1064
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:45,679
That's how we do!

1065
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:48,352
Now, okay, okay.

1066
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:53,883
Now, I'm a registered nurse
and this was my bath
not a half hour ago.

1067
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,663
Whoopsie.
We'll take care of that.

1068
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,099
Hey, Boogie!
I need you to go in,

1069
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,898
get my heating pad,
get my blanket.

1070
01:03:03,971 --> 01:03:07,566
Nana, not during training.
Okay, Grandma's
big helper boy?

1071
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:10,109
Nana, Nana. Nana?

1072
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:12,538
Grandma will get it. Go on.

01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:17,083
I feel like
you're eyeballing me, dawg!

1075
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,446
I don't like punk bitches
eyeballing me.

You want some of this? Yeah.

any second, all right?
All right? You with me?

1126
01:06:04,852 --> 01:06:06,615
You with me, baby? Huh?

1127
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,657
We're almost home.

1128
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:24,264
These two are down.

1129
01:06:24,338 --> 01:06:26,238
What the fuck is going on?

1130
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:33,502
Come on, you fucker.

1131
01:06:36,817 --> 01:06:38,478
<i>WATTERS. : Forget it. It's done.</i>

1132
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:40,076
Hey, quit saying that,
all right?

1133
01:06:40,154 --> 01:06:43,214
Girl, I just saw
muzzle flashes
coming from that suite.

1134
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:46,357
That's probably
where you heard
the shots earlier.

1135
01:06:46,427 --> 01:06:49,089
<i>Somebody just deaded
Israel's ass. It's a wrap.</i>

1136
01:06:49,163 --> 01:06:53,122
I ain't come all this way
just to pack it up because
you thinking something up.

1137
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,260
<i>Whatever, man.
We can bounce out,
chill for a little bit.</i>

1138
01:06:56,337 --> 01:06:58,897
Shoot a little craps.
Maybe spend the night.

1139
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,680
<i>Come on, baby, look.
We could break down now...</i>

1140
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:12,184
Shit, girl.

1141
01:07:12,253 --> 01:07:13,242
What?

1142
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,514
These two dudes
just sitting in the elevator,
all shot up.

1143
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:22,586
Whatever it was,
it got way past words.

1144
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,255
What are they doing right now?

1145
01:07:25,966 --> 01:07:27,058
Dying.

1146
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:31,400
So, them fellas,
the ones that was shot
and tossed into the lake?

1147
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:33,633
Them police officers, too?

1148
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:34,696
Mmm-hmm.

1149
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:41,542
Them are left over
after my hysterectomy,
so they'd be a few years old.

1150
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:43,606
I'm not gay because
I have a beard.

1151
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,345
My fingers are cut off.

1152
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:47,215
Poor me.

1153
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:50,588
Warren, go and practice
your nunchakus now.

1154
01:07:50,658 --> 01:07:52,558
Leave us be alone, shug.

1155
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,707
Go on, now, shug.

1156
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:09,743
Anytime, anytime, fag.

1157
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,778
I am sorry about that boy.

1158
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:14,313
His mama abandoned him
going on a year now

1159
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,042
and his daddy, my boy Dale,

1160
01:08:16,116 --> 01:08:19,517
he's over at the Reno-Washoe
Correctional Facility.

1161
01:08:20,321 --> 01:08:22,380
Got some clarity issues.

1162
01:08:22,456 --> 01:08:25,448
Did some home-invasion,
sodomy-torture type stuff.

1163
01:08:25,526 --> 01:08:27,391
Wrote a bunch of bad checks.

1164
01:08:27,461 --> 01:08:31,329
My husband, Bill, committed
suicide by hanging
about nine months back.

1165
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:35,061
And ever since then,
little Boogie there
has been man of the house.

1166
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:40,233
I don't think
that's been opened
since my husband died.

1167
01:08:40,307 --> 01:08:42,867
I might just borrow this
for a little while.

1168
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:44,937
<i>MESSNER. : Your IFB working?</i>

1169
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:46,070
No, that's why
we're on walkies.

1170
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:47,477
Jurisdiction's
a nightmare right now.

1171
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:49,015
Anything more
on Dupree's car?
Nothing.

1172
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,813
You mean to tell me that
nobody noticed anyone
getting out of a Cadillac

1173
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:52,977
that looked like
a wiffle ball?

1174
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:54,077
I know.
Where's your guy?

1175
01:08:54,154 --> 01:08:55,143
Right here.

1176
01:08:55,289 --> 01:08:56,381
Ricky, this is Agent Messner.

1177
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:58,425
Tell him exactly
what happened, nice and slow.

1178
01:08:58,492 --> 01:09:01,928
Yeah, so, earlier,
there was that guy,
Carruthers...

1179
01:09:01,995 --> 01:09:03,462
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1180
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,792
No. He wanted to know...
Yeah, he's here right now.

1181
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:06,127
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

1182
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,326
...which floor security
was on.

1183
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:09,733
And then later I saw him
get on the elevator
with the other agent.

1184
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:11,236
Wait, hold on.
Wait a minute.
What other agent?

1185
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:13,569
There were no other agents.
Our agents
are landing here now.

1186
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,540
There was nobody here.
He said he was
from San Francisco.

1187
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,372
Did he give you a name?

1188
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,708
Spanish something.
It was Diego or Garcia.

1189
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,577
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1190
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:22,672
Something stinks here.

1191
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,910
Call San Francisco.
See if they...

1192
01:09:23,984 --> 01:09:25,849
You know,
he was wearing
one of our jackets.

1193
01:09:25,919 --> 01:09:27,181
What?
Who was?

1194
01:09:27,254 --> 01:09:29,848
The other agent.
He said he was here
to do some inspections.

1195
01:09:29,923 --> 01:09:32,118
Then later, when I saw him
get on the elevator
with Carruthers...

1196
01:09:32,192 --> 01:09:34,217
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1197
01:09:34,294 --> 01:09:35,454
Yeah, I mean,
he had the badge
and everything.

1198
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:38,430
And when you saw him later,
he was wearing one
of your security jackets.

1199
01:09:38,499 --> 01:09:39,659
Yeah.

1200
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,129
And that didn't
seem odd to you?

1201
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,996
I mean, I thought
they gave it to him
so he could...

1202
01:09:46,073 --> 01:09:47,301
Walk with me.

1203
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:51,538
Okay, so obviously,
we got a man posing
as one of us.

1204
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:55,042
Make your team aware,
but do it quietly. Okay?

1205
01:09:57,785 --> 01:09:58,945
Fuck it.

1206
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,852
Okay, now let's get
a tactical team assembled.
We're going up.

1207
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,583
Okay, we need to get
these elevators powered up.

1208
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:04,681
All right, maintenance,

1209
01:10:04,758 --> 01:10:06,623
I need somebody to power up
these elevators immediately.

1210
01:10:06,693 --> 01:10:09,753
I need to get Deputy Director
Locke on a hard line
as soon as possible.

1211
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,888
All right, done.

1212
01:10:10,964 --> 01:10:11,988
Come on, step back, step back.

1213
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:13,599
Come on...
Are you kidding?

1214
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:25,138
I thought you were gonna go...

1215
01:10:25,646 --> 01:10:28,945
Gonna go down and get Vitoli.
Get him back up here.

1216
01:10:29,216 --> 01:10:30,444
We gotta...

1217
01:10:31,118 --> 01:10:32,779
We gotta pack up.

1218
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:35,283
We gotta pack it up now.

1219
01:10:36,457 --> 01:10:39,915
Bring him up here.
We gotta get packed up.
We're gonna pack it up.

1220
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:42,655
All right? Where is he?

1221
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:46,433
<i>WATTERS. : He's dead.
No, I said dying, not dead.</i>

1222
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,789
Shit.

1223
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:52,798
Shit, girl.

1224
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,832
One of them is a fed.

1225
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,373
<i>Hello, did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?</i>

1226
01:10:57,444 --> 01:10:58,934
<i>I said one of them
has got a FBI badge.</i>

1227
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:00,741
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold up, hold up.

1228
01:11:00,814 --> 01:11:02,543

1230
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,218
All right, hold on.

1231
01:11:12,926 --> 01:11:16,384
Just lay still for a minute.
Let me figure out...
What the fuck...

1232
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,220
Get out of the way.

1233
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,832
Fuck.

1234
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,043
You ain't gonna
believe this shit.

1235
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:35,038
Both these motherfuckers
is feds.

1236
01:11:35,115 --> 01:11:36,309
No. One of them is not.

1237
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:38,715
One of them is bullshit.
It's all over the air here.

Some fool with a fake badge.</i>

You think it might be
that motherfucker that Loretta
was telling us about? Soot?

1240
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:49,456
Wait. Hold up, hold up.
What I got here
is a Gerald Diego.

01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:39,529
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

1459
01:33:39,605 --> 01:33:42,733
Dr. Ingstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

1460
01:33:42,808 --> 01:33:44,173
<i>Supposedly a specialist.</i>

1461
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:47,007
He's had a sustained
arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1462
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,877
He's actually
the head of cardiology
at Stockholm University.

1463
01:33:49,949 --> 01:33:51,416
<i>Primo wants Israel's heart.</i>

1464
01:33:51,483 --> 01:33:53,383
Heart?
Mention of Israel's heart?

1465
01:33:53,452 --> 01:33:55,920
<i>He's one of the
best heart surgeons
in the world.</i>

1466
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:58,456
<i>The actual contract
went to Lazlo Soot,</i>

1467
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:02,052
<i>the man who escaped
the penthouse yesterday...</i>

1468
01:34:02,294 --> 01:34:03,625
Don't shoot me!

1469
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:05,021
<i>... in disguise.</i>

1470
01:34:05,097 --> 01:34:08,726
<i>He was hired by Sparazza
to neutralize
Israel's entourage.</i>

1471
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:13,661
<i>Dr. Ingstrom was here
to perform the surgery.</i>

1472
01:34:13,739 --> 01:34:17,732
And as father and son,
they are blood compatible.

1473
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:29,512
You're talking
about a transplant,
aren't you?

1474
01:34:30,089 --> 01:34:31,920
You're talking about
a fucking heart transplant.

1475
01:34:31,991 --> 01:34:34,960
You're gonna kill Israel
to save Sparazza.

1476
01:34:38,264 --> 01:34:39,424
No.

1477
01:34:41,934 --> 01:34:44,494
Well, they dug it up
in archives as part of
the Sparazza investigation.

1478
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:47,334
That Sparazza
had major elective
plastic surgery?

1479
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:49,499
It wasn't elective.
It was undertaken
to save his life.

1480
01:34:49,575 --> 01:34:50,564
Look at the work
he's had done.

1481
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:53,407
It wasn't cosmetic.
It was reconstructive.

1482
01:34:53,746 --> 01:34:55,941
Look at the date
of the first procedure.

1483
01:34:56,015 --> 01:34:58,040
Fifteen separate procedures
since 1952.

1484
01:34:58,117 --> 01:35:01,712
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered
Freeman Heller.

1485
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:05,723
I'd like to show you
exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

1486
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:09,253
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1487
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:11,091
I will have my ears
pinned back.

1488
01:35:11,397 --> 01:35:15,834
Removing a slight piece
of bone in my chin
I will alter my jaw line.

1489
01:35:15,901 --> 01:35:19,632
A procedure known
as rhinoplasty will reduce
the size of my nose.

1490
01:35:19,905 --> 01:35:21,998
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1491
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:24,634
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1492
01:35:25,044 --> 01:35:27,808
and more importantly,
nothing like
a federal agent's.

1493
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,814
<i>Oh, Christ.
I will maintain a slight limp.</i>

1494
01:35:29,949 --> 01:35:32,383
<i>My accent will be
a regional Calabrese.</i>

1495
01:35:32,618 --> 01:35:34,848
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1496
01:35:34,954 --> 01:35:36,080
That's him.

1497
01:35:36,221 --> 01:35:37,313
<i>And my name...</i>

1498
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:39,880
That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1499
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:44,024
Now, gentlemen,
I understand that this is
a dramatic approach.

1500
01:35:44,096 --> 01:35:47,122
<i>He went deep cover in 1940.
He could have ripped
the Mafia apart.</i>

1501
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,257
But I firmly believe...

1502
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:50,632
Dismantled most of
the organized crime

1503
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:54,161
...this is the only way
to truly infiltrate
organized crime.

1504
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,675
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1505
01:35:57,743 --> 01:35:59,074
swapped allegiances,

1506
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,271
<i>so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.</i>

1507
01:36:01,347 --> 01:36:05,010
<i>All this time, we were told
that it was Sparazza
that killed Heller,</i>

1508
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:08,242
<i>when it was us, the FBI.</i>

1509
01:36:11,423 --> 01:36:13,084
<i>And we didn't kill him.</i>

1510
01:36:14,827 --> 01:36:18,092
<i>He survived.
But the injuries he sustained</i>

1511
01:36:18,163 --> 01:36:21,564
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1512
01:36:21,667 --> 01:36:26,400
So he assumed
the identity of his alter ego.

1513
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:30,466
<i>The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,</i>

1514
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:33,443
<i>and Freeman Heller
was no more.</i>

1515
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:39,878
Now, the brass wanted
Heller's op removed
from official records,

1516
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:42,512
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1517
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:45,383
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1518
01:36:45,457 --> 01:36:47,687
so history defaulted to fable.

1519
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,287
Until now.
Heller's op predated
the second World War.

1520
01:36:51,363 --> 01:36:53,263
About 60 years
of amassed intel.

1521
01:36:53,332 --> 01:36:55,892
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1522
01:36:55,968 --> 01:36:57,060
Yeah.

1523
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:00,437
So you made another deal,
didn't you?

1524
01:37:00,506 --> 01:37:02,599
Israel's deal
with the government
was tossed out.

1525
01:37:02,674 --> 01:37:06,610
We are now trying to
rehabilitate him, so we
can attempt a transplant.

1526
01:37:06,678 --> 01:37:09,272
You realize that
you're doing this
to save Sparazza?

1527
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:12,112
No, son. I'm doing all this
to save Heller.

1528
01:37:12,184 --> 01:37:14,379
So you send us in there,
bugles blaring,

1529
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:17,183
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1530
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,451
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1531
01:37:19,525 --> 01:37:23,985
Oh, shitcan
the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

1532
01:37:24,063 --> 01:37:28,966
You withheld information
while Carruthers lay dying
in vain and in the dark.

1533
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:32,526
And your reasons
for doing that
are exactly what?

1534
01:37:34,706 --> 01:37:35,866
That?

1535
01:37:37,676 --> 01:37:39,644
Some mob fossil?

1536
01:37:40,412 --> 01:37:42,744
A monster that
the Bureau built?

1537
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,875
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1538
01:37:45,951 --> 01:37:48,283
that's going to
blow the lid off
the last 60 years?

1539
01:37:48,353 --> 01:37:49,377
Possibly.

1540
01:37:49,455 --> 01:37:51,855
Is he gonna
show you where all
the bodies are buried?

1541
01:37:51,924 --> 01:37:56,725
Or is his ultimate worth
bullshit?

1542
01:37:56,795 --> 01:37:58,820
Utterly useless?

1543
01:37:58,897 --> 01:38:01,991
That's a risk we take.
Yeah, empty pockets.

1544
01:38:02,067 --> 01:38:05,559
Empty pockets paid for
by the lives of
our own people.

1545
01:38:05,637 --> 01:38:06,899
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1546
01:38:06,972 --> 01:38:08,439
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1547
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:10,566
My guy is dead.
You're starting
to piss me off.

1548
01:38:10,642 --> 01:38:12,542
The Bureau betrayed us.

1549
01:38:12,611 --> 01:38:14,169
Wake up.
You betrayed us...

1550
01:38:14,246 --> 01:38:15,508
Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1551
01:38:15,581 --> 01:38:17,014
Get that thing out of my face.

1552
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:18,572
You betrayed us
the way you
betrayed them.

1553
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:19,639
You fucking asshole!

1554
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:26,620
Okay, if you like,
I'll take your verbal
resignation right here,

1555
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:27,681
right now.

1556
01:38:27,893 --> 01:38:31,329
Do you want your career
to end here, now, like this?

1557
01:38:31,997 --> 01:38:33,157
Your call.

1558
01:38:33,232 --> 01:38:36,292
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss
your behavior. And in light
of what's happened,

1559
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:38,734
I understand it.
I really do,
and I'm truly sorry.

1560
01:38:38,804 --> 01:38:40,328
But a decision
has been made.

1561
01:38:40,405 --> 01:38:43,772
And we're required to abide
by it, regardless of
our personal feelings.

1562
01:38:43,842 --> 01:38:46,709
Feelings that might
run contrary
to the collective good.

1563
01:38:46,778 --> 01:38:49,110
And that, I need you
to understand.

1564
01:38:49,181 --> 01:38:52,014
It's time for you
to get on a jet back to DC

1565
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:54,746
and make no further
inquiry into this matter.

1566
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:57,084
Is that understood,
Agent Messner?

1567
01:38:59,358 --> 01:39:02,156
Are we clear, Agent Messner?

1568
01:39:07,366 --> 01:39:08,856
We're clear.

1569
01:39:13,272 --> 01:39:14,569
We're clear.

1570
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:46,197
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)

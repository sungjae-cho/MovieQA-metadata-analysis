1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,236
There are more than yesterday.

3
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,886
He will be saying prayers in the garden.
Just follow the others.

4
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:30,933
He will be saying prayers in the garden.
Just follow the others.

5
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,344
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

6
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,140
Oh, God!

7
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,653
The object of this massive tribute...

8
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,905
...died as he had always lived:

9
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,491
A private man without wealth...

10
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,118
...without property...

11
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,829
...without official title or office.

12
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,331
Mahatma Gandhi...

13
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,375
...was not the commander of armies...

14
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:04,170
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

15
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,381
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

16
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,341
...or artistic gift.

17
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,801
Yet men...

18
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:15,764
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

19
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,933
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

20
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,769
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

21
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,856
...who led his country to freedom.

22
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,067
In the words of General
George C. Marshall...

23
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,362
...the American secretary of state:

24
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:33,782
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

25
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,911
...for the conscience of all mankind.

26
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:38,704
He was a man...

27
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,414
...who made humility...

28
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,249
...and simple truth...

29
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,502
...more powerful than empires."

30
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:47,671
And Albert Einstein added:

31
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:52,551
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

32
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,929
...ever in flesh and blood...

33
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,973
...walked upon this earth."

34
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,018
Tell me...

35
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,062
...do you think about hell?

36
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,232
No, neither do I.

37
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,526
But this man here...

38
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,154
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe...

39
00:06:58,326 --> 00:06:59,451
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,121
How long have you been in South Africa?

41
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,125
- A week.
- I don't know how you got a ticket.

42
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,169
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

43
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,630
Why, I have a ticket.

44
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,471
Why, I have a ticket.

45
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,717
A first-class ticket.

46
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,554
- How did you get it?
- I sent for it in the post.

47
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,055
I'm an attorney.
I didn't...

48
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,558
There are no colored attorneys
in South Africa.

49
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:23,892
Sit where you belong!

50
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:26,270
- I'll take your luggage back, sir.
- No.

51
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,397
Just a moment, please.

52
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,357
You see?

53
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:34,069
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

54
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,406
I'm going to conduct a case
for an Indian trading firm.

55
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:42,328
Didn't you hear me? There are no
colored attorneys in South Africa.

56
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,913
I was called to the bar in London...

57
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,375
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

58
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,502
I am, therefore, an attorney.

59
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,255
And since I am, in your eyes, colored...

60
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,591
...I think we can deduce
there is at least...

61
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,926
...one colored attorney
in South Africa.

62
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,013
Smart bloody Kaffir!

63
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,306
Throw him out.

64
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:04,892
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

65
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:07,519
...or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

66
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,521
But I always go first class!

67
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,093
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

68
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,720
Yes, I am rich.
But I am Indian.

69
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,265
I do not expect to travel first class.

70
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,934
- In England, I was a poor student.
- That was England.

71
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,769
This is part of England's Empire.

72
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:35,732
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

73
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:38,777
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

74
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,739
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

75
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,909
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

76
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,620
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

77
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:52,708
- But that is very unchristian...
- Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

78
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,753
...Indians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

79
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:02,759
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

80
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,137
...but you can't walk down the street
with him?

81
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,513
Well, I can.

82
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,975
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

83
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,811
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

84
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,781
Well, then it must be fought.

85
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,367
We are children of God
like everyone else.

86
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,869
Allah be praised!

87
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,580
And what battalions will you call upon?

88
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,503
I will write to the press...

89
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,963
...here and in England.

90
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,548
I will use the courts.

91
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,218
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is...

92
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:47,012
We are members of the Empire.

93
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,225
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

94
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,062
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

95
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:59,358
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

96
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,654
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

97
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,615
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

98
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:11,620
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

99
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:34,184
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

100
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,648
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

101
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,529
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

102
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,366
No, I asked my wife to organize that.

103
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,327
Some of them are leaving.

104
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,046
"Ladies and gentlemen...

105
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:07,467
...we have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

106
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,846
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

107
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,140
We do not seek conflict.

108
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:16,935
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

109
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:22,441
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

110
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,986
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

111
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:31,366
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

112
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,910
...which we must carry
at all times...

113
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,997
...but which no European
even has to have.

114
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:40,083
The first step towards
changing our status...

115
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,462
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

116
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,722
Now?

117
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,314
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

118
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:06,860
"We do not want to ignite...

119
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,489
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

120
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:12,449
But we ask you...

121
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,911
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

122
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,955
...to help us light up the sky...

123
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,501
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

124
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,879
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

125
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:32,094
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

126
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:36,473
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire...

127
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,016
You bloody dog!

128
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,565
Those passes...

129
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,693
...are government property!

130
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:52,197
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

131
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,085
Take him away.

132
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,191
You little...

133
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:29,818
...Sammy...

134
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,403
...bastard!

135
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,824
Now!
Are there any more?

136
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,244
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

137
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,352
Let me go!

138
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,397
Let me go!

139
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,626
Stop.

140
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,189
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

141
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:52,359
The worst was the Daily Mail.
They said the burning of passes...

142
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:55,695
- Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
- ...was the most significant act...

143
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,157
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

144
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,660
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

145
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:05,038
Mr. Gandhi will find he's
on a long hiding to nothing.

146
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,626
"A High Court judge
confirmed that Mr. Gandhi...

147
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:13,255
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

148
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:16,591
...since neither he nor
Mr. Khan resisted arrest."

149
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:18,552
I told you about English law.

150
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,721
As I told you about English policemen.

151
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,015
Yes?

152
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,185
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

153
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,438
And I am glad to be back.

154
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,482
Come.

155
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,068
Mind your face.

156
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,828
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

157
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,455
Come, come.

158
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:56,590
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

159
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,093
They're boys and they're Indian.

160
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,932
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

161
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,648
I've got it.

162
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,658
You'd be Gandhi.

163
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,745
I thought you'd be bigger.

164
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:30,457
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

165
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:33,585
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

166
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,086
I've come from India.

167
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,882
I've read a great deal about you.

168
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,051
Some of it good, I hope.

169
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,512
Would you care to walk?

170
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,600
- You're a clergyman?
- Yes.

171
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,727
I met some remarkable people in India.

172
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,980
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

173
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,107
- Does that surprise you?
- Not anymore.

174
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,109
At first, I was amazed...

175
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,029
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

176
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:05,575
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

177
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,703
Even when it's dangerous or....

178
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,416
Hey, look what's coming!

179
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,836
A white shepherd leading a brown Sammy!

180
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:21,466
- Perhaps we should....
- Doesn't the New Testament say:

181
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:25,136
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

182
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,139
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord...

183
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:32,018
I'm not so sure.
I have thought about it a great deal.

184
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,270
I suspect he meant
you must show courage...

185
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,607
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

186
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,485
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

187
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:44,614
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

188
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,451
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

189
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,997
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

190
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,540
Good morning.

191
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,042
Get off the pavement, you bloody coon.

192
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,585
- Yeah, get off.
- Kaffir!

193
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,007
- Colin, what you doing?
- Nothing.

194
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:04,092
Come out where I can see you!

195
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,348
I said, what you doing?

196
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,601
We were just trying
to clean up the neighborhood.

197
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,188
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 10 minutes ago.

198
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,190
Get on!

199
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,323
You'll find there's room for us all.

200
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,709
- That was lucky.
- I thought you were a man of God.

201
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,086
I am, but I'm not
so egotistical as to think...

202
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,172
...he plans his day
around my dilemmas.

203
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,511
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

204
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,222
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

205
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,975
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

206
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:57,395
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

207
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,981
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."

208
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,150
Not always practiced...

209
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,737
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

210
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,656
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

211
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,325
Well, we shall try.

212
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,410
Bad news, I'm afraid.

213
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,330
They're going to change the pass laws.

214
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:23,588
It's taken time,
but it needed to be done fairly.

215
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:27,550
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

216
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:30,011
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

217
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,806
Just one moment, sir, please.

218
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,976
I beg your pardon.

219
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:40,105
But on a short trip...

220
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:44,234
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

221
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,236
It's a tiny factor in South Africa.

222
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:50,865
Well, it is news at the moment.

223
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,868
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

224
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,703
- ...as well as the economy.
- Good.

225
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,581
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

226
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,042
- Gandhi.
- Gandhi.

227
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,712
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

228
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,799
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

229
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,927
But as an old lawyer, let me warn you.

230
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:14,097
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

231
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,975
...however otherworldly he may seem.

232
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,103
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

233
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,106
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

234
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,196
So it's not spiritualism or nationalism.

235
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:34,617
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

236
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,035
You see?

237
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,621
Hindus, Muslims...

238
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,748
...Sikhs, Jews...

239
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,625
...even Christians.

240
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,253
Mr. Walker of the New York Times.

241
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:46,504
How you doing?

242
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,259
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

243
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:53,344
...you cannot unite a community.

244
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,681
You belong to a
very important profession.

245
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,729
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

246
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:06,482
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

247
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,484
I don't know.

248
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,029
I'm still searching for a response.

249
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,072
You will respect the law?

250
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:18,661
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

251
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:22,081
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

252
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:27,503
- ...not to mention the British Empire.
- If you are a minority of one...

253
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,131
...the truth is the truth.

254
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,259
Herman Kallenbach...

255
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,471
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

256
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,155
Vince Walker, New York Times.

257
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:40,558
This is quite a place you've got here.

258
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,770
And you call it an ashram?

259
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,898
That's right.
The word only means "community."

260
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:50,401
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

261
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,904
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

262
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,822
I hope not.

263
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:01,663
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

264
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,624
- Is that part of the experiment?
- Ba!

265
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,379
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

266
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,798
I will tell Tara.

267
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,512
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labor...

268
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,472
...is as important as another's.

269
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,891
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

270
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,352
...seems far more important
than the law.

271
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,562
Please, come and join us.

272
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:29,565
You'll need something before
your journey back.

273
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,986
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

274
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,455
What is it?

275
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,167
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

276
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,628
...rake and cover the latrine.

277
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:54,048
That's right.
Everyone takes their turn.

278
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:55,842
It is the work of untouchables!

279
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,803
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

280
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,930
...and no work is beneath any of us.

281
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:02,890
I'm your wife!

282
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,851
All the more reason.

283
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:09,147
As you command.

284
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,486
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

285
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,156
...I knew you when you were a boy.

286
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:19,949
It's not me.

287
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,660
It's the principle.

288
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,581
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

289
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:29,500
Not at all then.

290
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,548
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

291
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:39,594
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

292
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,554
Have you no shame?

293
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:43,222
I'm your wife!

294
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,653
Where do you expect me to go?

295
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,407
What's the matter with me?

296
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,666
You're human.

297
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,545
Only human.

298
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:19,133
And it's even harder for those of us...

299
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:23,096
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

300
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,601
I apologize.

301
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:37,318
I must get back to that reporter.

302
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:40,613
And I must...

303
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:44,826
...rake and cover the latrine.

304
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,104
I want to welcome you all.

305
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,315
Every one of you.

306
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,902
We have no secrets.

307
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,037
Let us begin by being clear...

308
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,999
...about General Smuts' new law.

309
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:37,128
All Indians must now be fingerprinted...

310
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,379
...like criminals.

311
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:40,298
Men and women.

312
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,552
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

313
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,304
Under this act...

314
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,307
...our wives and mothers are whores.

315
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:53,186
And every man here is a bastard.

316
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,109
He has become quite good at this.

317
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,906
And a policeman...

318
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:08,409
...passing an Indian dwelling...

319
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,495
I will not call them homes.

320
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:14,665
...may enter and demand the card of
any Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

321
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,876
Goddamn them!

322
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:19,462
Understand...

323
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,424
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

324
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,052
He may enter.

325
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:27,595
I will not allow it!

326
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,598
I swear to Allah.

327
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:35,311
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

328
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,231
...and let them hang me!

329
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:46,364
I say talk means nothing!

330
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:51,160
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

331
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:54,997
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

332
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:59,252
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

333
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,429
I praise such courage.

334
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,432
I need such courage...

335
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:16,936
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

336
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,646
But, my friend...

337
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:24,026
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

338
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,862
Whatever they do to us...

339
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,073
...we will attack no one...

340
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:31,242
...kill no one.

341
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:35,329
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

342
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:40,293
They will imprison us. They will fine us.
They will seize our possessions.

343
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:43,796
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

344
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:45,548
...if we do not give it to them.

345
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:47,758
Have you been to prison?

346
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:51,220
They beat us and torture us.
I say...

347
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,515
I am asking you to fight.

348
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:59,395
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

349
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:04,525
We will not strike a blow.

350
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,695
But we will receive them.

351
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,405
And through our pain...

352
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,034
...we will make them see
their injustice.

353
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,910
And it will hurt...

354
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:17,538
...as all fighting hurts.

355
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,042
But we cannot lose.

356
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:23,377
We cannot.

357
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,632
They may torture my body...

358
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,509
...break my bones...

359
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,929
...even kill me.
Then...

360
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,016
...they will have my dead body...

361
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,561
...not my obedience.

362
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,459
We are Hindu and Muslim...

363
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,046
...children of God, each one of us.

364
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:12,051
Let us take a solemn oath in his name...

365
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,887
...that, come what may...

366
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:19,433
...we will not submit to this law.

367
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:05,146
God save our gracious King

368
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:10,484
God save our noble King

369
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:14,739
God save our King

370
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:18,302
These men are contracted laborers.

371
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:19,887
They belong in the mines.

372
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,556
You put their comrades in jail.

373
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,141
When you free them...

374
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,143
...they will go back to work.

375
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,395
I've warned you.

376
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:30,689
We've warned each other.

377
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,618
I don't think that's very good.

378
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:29,874
Steady, steady.

379
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,250
Stop!

380
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:45,139
At the canter, charge!

381
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,269
We should lie down.
Down!

382
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,273
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

383
00:34:33,313 --> 00:34:36,565
Follow me!
Follow me!

384
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:58,462
Now what the hell do we do?

385
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,756
Let them march.

386
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:07,054
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

387
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,056
...we'll get them.

388
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,687
- One law!
- One king!

389
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,439
- One law!
- One king!

390
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:26,281
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

391
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:31,203
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

392
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:35,374
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

393
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,836
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

394
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,839
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

395
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,968
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

396
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,846
...is ask questions about ourselves.

397
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:54,268
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

398
00:35:55,979 --> 00:36:00,941
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

399
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,902
...who will not fight...

400
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:06,739
...but will not comply?

401
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:10,284
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word...

402
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,675
They're sparing no one, I see.

403
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,888
No, you were the surprise.

404
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:33,140
It has been all over the prison.

405
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:35,809
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

406
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:37,686
So did I.

407
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,115
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

408
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,661
- Have they touched the women?
- My wife publicly defied the law.

409
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:57,039
They've arrested her and four others.

410
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,166
It split the government.

411
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,877
Well, that's one victory.

412
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:05,631
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.

413
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,924
Don't worry.

414
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:09,968
I've never seen men so determined.

415
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,513
You have given them a way to fight.

416
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:18,769
Gandhi!

417
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,813
I want Gandhi!

418
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,981
Which Sammy is it?

419
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,732
Mr. Gandhi.

420
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,820
I thought we might have a little talk.

421
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:12,948
Thank you, Daniels.

422
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:18,203
Will you have a glass of sherry?

423
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,372
Thank you, no.

424
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:23,876
- Perhaps some tea?
- I dined at the prison.

425
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:31,133
Please, do come and sit down.

426
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,023
Mr. Gandhi.

427
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,736
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

428
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:53,447
...that you have taken
such exception to.

429
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:58,243
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

430
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,746
It's not quite that simple.

431
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:03,040
Somehow, I expected not.

432
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,043
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

433
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,462
...to investigate the new legislation.

434
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:12,716
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

435
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,927
I congratulate them.

436
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,720
But they might also recommend...

437
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:21,266
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

438
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,685
...even stopped.

439
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:36,198
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

440
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,743
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we....

441
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,830
We are in a position of advantage.

442
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,299
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

443
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,136
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

444
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:08,230
Assuming we are in agreement.

445
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,649
Yes, yes.

446
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,445
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

447
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:16,822
All right.
Fine.

448
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,659
I'm afraid I have no money.

449
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:24,413
Neither have I.

450
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:27,916
I'm awfully sorry.

451
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:29,376
Daniels...

452
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:32,713
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

453
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:35,007
I beg your pardon, sir?

454
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:38,135
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

455
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:42,931
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

456
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:47,019
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

457
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:56,653
Thank you.

458
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,536
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

459
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:07,372
...but I can find my own way out.

460
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,932
Guard of honor!

461
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,852
Guard of honor!

462
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,896
Attention!

463
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:46,453
Present arms!

464
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:54,669
- My God, he loves it!
- I'm sure he hates it.

465
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:58,131
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

466
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,008
...fighting on the Western front.

467
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:04,221
Not as military governors in India.

468
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,933
What the devil's going on back there?

469
00:42:08,101 --> 00:42:10,977
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

470
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,146
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

471
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:15,732
There he is.

472
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,570
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

473
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,364
I thought he was a lawyer.

474
00:42:22,698 --> 00:42:26,159
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

475
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,994
No, I haven't refused.

476
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,331
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

477
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,291
Will you support the war effort?

478
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:38,338
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

479
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,092
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defense.

480
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,553
Now that you're back in India,
what will you do?

481
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,054
I don't know.

482
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:48,056
- I don't know.
- One more question.

483
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:52,018
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

484
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,272
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

485
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:56,815
Thank you very much.

486
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,450
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

487
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:07,826
May I?

488
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,047
I'm glad to be home...

489
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:28,513
...and I thank you for your greeting.

490
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:48,658
I'll follow with your wife.

491
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,619
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

492
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,250
- Who's that young man?
- That's young Nehru.

493
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:00,253
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

494
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:01,796
...and the devil's own charm.

495
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:05,592
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge...
Wave, wave!

496
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,761
...he might amount to something.

497
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:18,104
I must say, when I first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

498
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:20,815
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

499
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:22,734
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

500
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,611
Yes, you are!

501
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,739
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

502
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,242
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

503
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:35,163
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

504
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:04,234
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

505
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:06,736
Too bad you came back third class.

506
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,405
He might have been impressed...

507
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:12,117
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

508
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,078
Yes, I'm sure.

509
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,550
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

510
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:33,013
No.
I leave practical matters to my husband...

511
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,557
...and revolution to my son.

512
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,519
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

513
00:45:39,687 --> 00:45:42,063
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League.

514
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:43,565
How do you do?

515
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:45,942
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

516
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:49,487
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

517
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,116
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

518
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:54,576
I have simply written...

519
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,121
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

520
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:00,624
...it is an Indian’s duty
to kill an Englishman...

521
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,168
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

522
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:06,963
It's a clever argument.
It may not produce the end you desire.

523
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:11,551
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

524
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:15,805
Excuse me. May I, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

525
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:17,098
Excuse me.

526
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:20,935
Sorry to rush you.

527
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,856
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

528
00:46:25,066 --> 00:46:26,775
That's nonviolence for you.

529
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:29,944
You know, Mohan...

530
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:32,280
...now I have a confession to make.

531
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,241
I didn't decide to come to South Africa.

532
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:37,452
Professor Gokhale sent me.

533
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:41,581
We are trying to make a nation, Gandhi.

534
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,000
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

535
00:46:44,794 --> 00:46:48,463
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

536
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:51,800
What you were writing in South Africa...

537
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:53,551
...that's what we need here.

538
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:56,012
I have so much to learn about India.

539
00:46:56,222 --> 00:47:00,183
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

540
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:03,770
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

541
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,940
We want none of you imperialists here.

542
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:10,944
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

543
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,613
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

544
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,740
...and convert her to Christianity.

545
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,743
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

546
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,872
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

547
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,835
Now, you forget about your practice.

548
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:29,129
You have other things to do.

549
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:33,550
India has many men with too much wealth.

550
00:47:33,968 --> 00:47:37,929
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

551
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,016
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

552
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:43,935
I'll see to it.

553
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,729
You begin your journal.

554
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,230
I have little to say.

555
00:47:47,606 --> 00:47:49,315
Come, let's sit down.

556
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,568
India is an alien country to me.

557
00:47:51,944 --> 00:47:53,194
Change that.

558
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,656
Go and find India.

559
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,283
Not what you see here...

560
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,077
...but the real India.

561
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:04,164
You'll see what needs to be said...

562
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:07,167
...what we need to hear.

563
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:16,050
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

564
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,972
I knew I could die in peace.

565
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:25,185
Make India proud of herself.

566
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:54,644
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

567
00:51:54,853 --> 00:51:57,939
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

568
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,692
Please!
Come in.

569
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,694
No violence, please.

570
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:06,239
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

571
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,782
Englishman, sahib!

572
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,909
Come, there is room up here!

573
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,581
Put your foot on the window.
Come!

574
00:52:22,423 --> 00:52:25,717
- What are you doing?
- I'm going nearer to God.

575
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,679
Charlie!
Be careful!

576
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:32,098
Let go.
Let go!

577
00:52:33,142 --> 00:52:34,642
- Let go!
- Oh, dear!

578
00:52:47,448 --> 00:52:49,323
Hello.

579
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:53,286
You see?
It is most comfortable.

580
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,912
Sahib?

581
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:57,165
Are you a Christian?

582
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,625
Yes, I'm a Christian.

583
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,419
I know a Christian.

584
00:53:02,171 --> 00:53:04,088
She drinks blood.

585
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:07,341
Blood of Christ.
Every Sunday.

586
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,723
Charlie!

587
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:19,312
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

588
00:53:20,105 --> 00:53:21,397
Bend!

589
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:28,863
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

590
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,824
I agree with Jinnah.

591
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:36,037
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

592
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:38,706
The Germans are worn out as it is.

593
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,250
And our first act should be...

594
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,545
...to convene
a congress party convention...

595
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:47,256
...and demand independence.

596
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:50,676
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

597
00:53:52,554 --> 00:53:54,055
And we should invite Gandhi.

598
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:56,057
What the devil's happened to him?

599
00:53:56,642 --> 00:53:58,434
He's discovering India.

600
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:01,395
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

601
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:04,607
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

602
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:07,026
...then let him slip into oblivion.

603
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,391
Insurgents.

604
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:40,309
They've derailed a troop train.

605
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,729
Keep clear!
Come on.

606
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,113
They've killed an English soldier.

607
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:02,790
We were asked for toleration.

608
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,085
We were asked for patience.

609
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,254
Some of us gave it...

610
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,631
...and some did not.

611
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:14,510
Well, their war is over.

612
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,930
And those of us who supported it...

613
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,683
...and those of us who refused...

614
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:24,270
...must forget our differences.

615
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:27,815
And there can be no excuses...

616
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,318
...from the British now.

617
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:32,445
India wants...

618
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:34,071
...home rule.

619
00:55:34,323 --> 00:55:35,406
India...

620
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:37,658
...demands home rule!

621
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,843
Congratulations.

622
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,940
And let no one question...

623
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:11,150
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

624
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,569
...not just for the Muslims...

625
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,862
...but for all India!

626
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,287
And now...

627
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:25,831
...I'm going to introduce to you...

628
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,000
...a man whose writings...

629
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,336
...we are all becoming familiar with.

630
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:34,674
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

631
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,593
A man whose accomplishments
in South Africa...

632
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,345
...will always be remembered.

633
00:56:39,638 --> 00:56:41,639
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

634
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,893
Your journal has made great impact.

635
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,437
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

636
00:56:48,689 --> 00:56:51,732
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

637
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:53,192
But it is true.

638
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,820
I read it.
Often!

639
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:11,252
Since I returned from South Africa...

640
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:16,173
...I've traveled over much of India.

641
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:20,928
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

642
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:24,390
...and still only see
a small part of her.

643
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,268
And yet, I already know...

644
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,395
...that what we say here...

645
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,441
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

646
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:37,611
Here, we make speeches for each other...

647
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:42,408
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

648
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,079
But the people of India...

649
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:48,622
...are...

650
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,624
...untouched.

651
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:54,754
Their politics are confined to bread...

652
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,422
...and salt.

653
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:59,050
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

654
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:02,553
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

655
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,931
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

656
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:07,975
...in the name of freedom.

657
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,521
This congress tells the world...

658
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:14,899
...it represents India.

659
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:17,276
My brothers...

660
00:58:17,736 --> 00:58:18,819
...India...

661
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:22,531
...is 700,000 villages...

662
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,577
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

663
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:28,329
...and Bombay.

664
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,749
Until we stand in the fields...

665
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:35,878
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

666
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:39,924
...we will not represent India.

667
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:43,844
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

668
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:46,138
...as one nation.

669
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:04,990
Have you read his magazine?

670
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:06,742
No.

671
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:09,078
But I think I'm going to.

672
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,126
Pull over.

673
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:16,919
This can't be the way.

674
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:20,840
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

675
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,844
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

676
00:59:25,053 --> 00:59:27,138
...when all this was awaiting me.

677
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,117
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

678
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:53,747
- You'll find him under that tree.
- Thank you.

679
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,209
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

680
00:59:57,669 --> 01:00:00,838
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

681
01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:03,132
It's stupid, of course.

682
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:04,925
Because in our country...

683
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:07,678
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

684
01:00:08,555 --> 01:00:10,806
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

685
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:12,808
And from their luxury...

686
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:16,812
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

687
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:21,358
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

688
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,613
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

689
01:00:25,864 --> 01:00:28,699
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

690
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,618
...while greedily assimilating...

691
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:34,663
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

692
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,710
If we have home rule...

693
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:41,545
...that'll change.

694
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,551
Would you, please?

695
01:00:48,637 --> 01:00:51,263
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

696
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:55,809
We must take the peelings to the goats.

697
01:00:56,394 --> 01:01:00,814
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

698
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:02,816
We've bred an army of anarchists...

699
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:06,278
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

700
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,405
Hello!
Hello!

701
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:10,491
But I thought you were against fighting.

702
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:13,911
Now just spread it around.

703
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,663
There you are.

704
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,708
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

705
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,005
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

706
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,593
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

707
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:33,639
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

708
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,517
And if we really want
to change things...

709
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:39,270
...there are better ways
of doing it...

710
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:42,898
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

711
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,858
The fire is ready.

712
01:01:46,027 --> 01:01:48,112
You see, even here...

713
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:51,115
...we live under tyranny.

714
01:01:57,664 --> 01:02:00,416
What did I tell you?
Look at him!

715
01:02:01,126 --> 01:02:03,544
I can see the British shaking now.

716
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,855
Hello!

717
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,941
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

718
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,614
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

719
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,534
Our crops.

720
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,536
We cannot sell them.

721
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:40,247
We have no money.

722
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:43,584
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

723
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,630
We have nothing left.

724
01:03:30,757 --> 01:03:33,509
Mr. Taylor, sir.
Up here!

725
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:47,106
Jesus!

726
01:03:48,274 --> 01:03:50,109
What the hell is going on?

727
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:52,486
I don't know, sir.

728
01:03:57,492 --> 01:03:58,951
The agent got a telegram.

729
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,913
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

730
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:11,046
Who the hell is "he"?

731
01:04:12,257 --> 01:04:13,298
I don't know, sir.

732
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,450
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

733
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:48,500
- Who the devil are you?
- My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

734
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:50,544
Whoever you are, we don't want you here.

735
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:53,797
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

736
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:55,924
They seem to want me.

737
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:57,217
Now, look here.

738
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,470
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

739
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,597
On what charge?

740
01:05:05,977 --> 01:05:07,561
I don't want any trouble.

741
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:12,399
I'm an Indian traveling in my own country.
I see no reason for trouble.

742
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:17,154
Well, there had better not be.

743
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,410
Make way for the officer.

744
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:44,473
For years...

745
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:47,226
...the landlords have ordered us...

746
01:05:47,435 --> 01:05:48,769
...to grow indigo...

747
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,979
...for dyeing cloth.

748
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:55,734
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

749
01:05:56,736 --> 01:05:57,820
But now...

750
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:02,449
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

751
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,867
So no one wants...

752
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:06,578
...our indigo.

753
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,247
The landlords...

754
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:11,333
...say we must pay our rent...

755
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:13,001
...in cash.

756
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:16,380
What we could...

757
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,465
...we sold.

758
01:06:18,716 --> 01:06:21,510
The police have taken the rest.

759
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:23,512
There is...

760
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,764
...no food.

761
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,892
I understand.

762
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,729
The landlords are British?

763
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:45,158
What we can do, we will try to do.

764
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,805
Shukla...

765
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:09,141
...is all Champaran like this?

766
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:11,268
Yes, Bapu.

767
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:13,270
The whole region.

768
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:16,148
Hundreds.
Thousands.

769
01:07:18,818 --> 01:07:21,153
Some landlords have tried to help.

770
01:07:21,654 --> 01:07:23,530
But what can they do?

771
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,214
- Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
- Yes.

772
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,467
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

773
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:45,719
I'm not sorry at all.

774
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,565
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

775
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:03,487
Oh, no!

776
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:13,580
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

777
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:16,708
- India’s full of grief, old man.
- I've got no idea.

778
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,545
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

779
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:22,255
The whole company's ordered out.

780
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,858
I would like to see the prisoner.

781
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:55,497
On the left, sir.

782
01:09:03,715 --> 01:09:05,340
- Charlie.
- Shades of South Africa.

783
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,009
- Charlie.
- Shades of South Africa.

784
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,343
Not quite.

785
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,303
They're only holding me...

786
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,639
...until the magistrate's hearing.

787
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,891
Then it will be prison.

788
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:19,312
Did they take your clothes?

789
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,607
These are my clothes now.

790
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:27,696
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

791
01:09:28,448 --> 01:09:30,282
If I want to be one with them...

792
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,242
...I have to live like them.

793
01:09:32,452 --> 01:09:33,785
Yes, I think you do.

794
01:09:34,912 --> 01:09:37,080
But thank God we all don't.

795
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:39,291
My puritanism runs in a different way.

796
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,501
I'm far too modest for such a display.

797
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:50,969
Couldn't I be let in with the prisoner?
I am a clergyman.

798
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:06,109
They're calling you "Bapu."

799
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,028
I thought it meant "father."

800
01:10:08,696 --> 01:10:10,155
It does.

801
01:10:11,157 --> 01:10:13,200
We must be getting old, Charlie.

802
01:10:16,287 --> 01:10:17,746
What do you want me to do?

803
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:23,001
I think that you can help us most...

804
01:10:23,211 --> 01:10:26,630
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

805
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:31,718
I have to be sure...

806
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:34,387
They have to be sure that what we do...

807
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,849
...can be done by Indians alone.

808
01:10:49,654 --> 01:10:51,238
But you know the strategy.

809
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,741
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

810
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:56,701
It is their strength that we need.

811
01:10:56,911 --> 01:10:58,286
Before you go...

812
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:02,499
...you could start us
in the right direction.

813
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,094
I must leave from Calcutta...

814
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:16,888
...and soon.

815
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,309
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

816
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,399
Well, I....

817
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:31,528
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

818
01:11:32,572 --> 01:11:35,657
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

819
01:11:56,804 --> 01:12:00,056
- I'm going to clear the courtroom.
- I'm not sure we'd be able to.

820
01:12:00,224 --> 01:12:02,601
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

821
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:04,644
And he's a lawyer.

822
01:12:05,813 --> 01:12:07,689
I don't know where they found the nerve.

823
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:10,859
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

824
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,528
How did the press get here
before the military?

825
01:12:13,821 --> 01:12:16,656
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

826
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:20,076
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

827
01:12:33,299 --> 01:12:35,383
You have been ordered
out of the province...

828
01:12:35,635 --> 01:12:38,178
...on the grounds of
disturbing the peace.

829
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:46,978
With respect, I refuse to go.

830
01:12:49,857 --> 01:12:52,234
Do you want to go to jail?

831
01:12:52,485 --> 01:12:53,693
As you wish.

832
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:00,158
All right.

833
01:13:01,327 --> 01:13:03,078
I will release you on bail...

834
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:07,207
...of 100 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

835
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:12,337
I refuse to pay 100 rupees.

836
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:24,683
Then I will grant release on bail...

837
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:28,687
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

838
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:56,089
Gandhiji!
Gandhiji!

839
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,888
We are from Bihar.

840
01:14:04,432 --> 01:14:06,641
We received a cable
from an old friend...

841
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:08,560
...who was at Cambridge with us.

842
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:10,103
His name is Nehru.

843
01:14:10,354 --> 01:14:12,397
- I believe you know him.
- Indeed.

844
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:16,067
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

845
01:14:18,112 --> 01:14:22,699
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

846
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:24,284
It may take months.

847
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:26,077
We have no pressing engagements.

848
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:28,955
You will have to live with the peasants.

849
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,249
There will be risks.

850
01:14:50,227 --> 01:14:52,228
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

851
01:14:52,396 --> 01:14:53,521
But good God, man!

852
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:57,442
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

853
01:14:58,611 --> 01:15:01,988
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

854
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,282
...demanding services without pay.

855
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:05,700
Even refusing them water.

856
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:06,868
Even refusing them water.

857
01:15:07,411 --> 01:15:08,828
In India!

858
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:11,831
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

859
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,125
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

860
01:15:14,293 --> 01:15:16,669
...into an international hero.

861
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:20,965
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

862
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:24,677
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

863
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:28,181
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

864
01:15:29,934 --> 01:15:32,560
What do they want?

865
01:15:32,812 --> 01:15:34,020
Gareth!

866
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:36,731
Yes, sir.

867
01:15:36,982 --> 01:15:39,150
There's a rebate on rents paid.

868
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:42,153
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

869
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:46,741
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

870
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:53,123
That would satisfy him?

871
01:15:53,624 --> 01:15:55,125
And His Majesty's government.

872
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,545
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

873
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:10,098
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

874
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,103
Thank you, sir.

875
01:16:16,355 --> 01:16:19,190
- We're too damned liberal.
- Perhaps.

876
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:24,279
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

877
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:28,116
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

878
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:44,924
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

879
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,969
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

880
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:52,015
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

881
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:54,517
He came third class.

882
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:58,062
God, give me patience.

883
01:17:03,027 --> 01:17:04,861
My house is honored.

884
01:17:05,112 --> 01:17:06,654
The honor is ours.

885
01:17:06,864 --> 01:17:09,574
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

886
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:13,912
He's interested in flowers.
I told him he could wander your garden.

887
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,930
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

888
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,125
Thank you.

889
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,715
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

890
01:17:25,966 --> 01:17:28,301
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

891
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:30,637
Mr. Patel you know.

892
01:17:30,888 --> 01:17:33,473
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

893
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,518
...and just recently
released from prison.

894
01:17:38,395 --> 01:17:39,771
Mr. Kripalani.

895
01:17:40,898 --> 01:17:44,150
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

896
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,278
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

897
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,614
Please sit down.
Do sit down.

898
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:54,244
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

899
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:57,288
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

900
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:59,666
And it is exactly as was rumored.

901
01:18:00,084 --> 01:18:03,419
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

902
01:18:03,629 --> 01:18:06,214
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

903
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:09,968
And your writings
are specifically listed.

904
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:12,512
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

905
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:16,349
There is only one answer.
Direct action on a scale...

906
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,351
...they can never handle.

907
01:18:19,353 --> 01:18:20,812
I don't think so.

908
01:18:21,272 --> 01:18:24,816
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

909
01:18:25,693 --> 01:18:28,152
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

910
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:32,240
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

911
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:35,535
I too have read Mr. Gandhi's writings...

912
01:18:35,786 --> 01:18:39,414
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

913
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:42,000
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

914
01:18:42,209 --> 01:18:44,335
I must say, it seems to me...

915
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:49,424
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

916
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:51,551
If I may...

917
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,263
...I, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

918
01:18:57,808 --> 01:19:01,269
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.
We must never submit to such laws...

919
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:02,979
...ever.

920
01:19:04,064 --> 01:19:09,152
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

921
01:19:11,405 --> 01:19:12,447
May I?

922
01:19:14,742 --> 01:19:18,453
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

923
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:21,539
Thank you.

924
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,544
All of them.

925
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:29,464
- Forgive my stupid illustration.
- Allow me.

926
01:19:29,715 --> 01:19:31,382
No, please.

927
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:33,718
But I want to change their minds...

928
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:37,388
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

929
01:19:40,184 --> 01:19:42,560
And what resistance would you offer?

930
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:46,981
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

931
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,150
I want to call upon the nation...

932
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:53,196
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

933
01:19:53,447 --> 01:19:54,530
A general strike?

934
01:19:55,949 --> 01:19:58,576
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

935
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:02,288
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

936
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,540
No trains.

937
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:06,209
No factories.

938
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,044
No administration.

939
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:10,963
The country would stop.

940
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:14,967
My God, it would terrify them!

941
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:18,012
350 million people at prayer?

942
01:20:18,722 --> 01:20:21,432
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

943
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:23,476
...and explain why.

944
01:20:23,727 --> 01:20:26,270
- But could we get people to do it?
- Why not?

945
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,524
Champaran stirred the whole country.

946
01:20:30,943 --> 01:20:32,652
Thank you.

947
01:20:33,153 --> 01:20:35,071
They're calling you "Mahatma."

948
01:20:35,989 --> 01:20:37,448
"Great Soul."

949
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:41,035
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

950
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,277
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

951
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:47,917
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

952
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:49,377
...all of congress...

953
01:20:49,962 --> 01:20:51,713
...every avenue we know....

954
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:56,426
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

955
01:21:07,104 --> 01:21:10,189
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

956
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,276
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

957
01:21:13,485 --> 01:21:16,362
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

958
01:21:19,658 --> 01:21:23,453
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

959
01:21:28,459 --> 01:21:31,878
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Mr. Kinnoch.

960
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:34,547
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

961
01:21:35,632 --> 01:21:36,924
Nothing's working, sir.

962
01:21:37,176 --> 01:21:39,844
The buses, the trains, the markets.

963
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,257
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

964
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:45,767
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

965
01:21:46,018 --> 01:21:49,228
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

966
01:21:49,688 --> 01:21:52,482
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

967
01:21:53,692 --> 01:21:55,568
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

968
01:22:01,366 --> 01:22:02,992
I can't believe it.

969
01:22:03,202 --> 01:22:05,912
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

970
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:09,415
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

971
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:11,209
Arrest him.

972
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,885
He's to go to the visitors' room.

973
01:22:39,196 --> 01:22:40,404
Bapu.

974
01:22:41,406 --> 01:22:42,990
You too?

975
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:47,370
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

976
01:22:55,754 --> 01:22:59,090
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

977
01:22:59,758 --> 01:23:02,176
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

978
01:23:02,427 --> 01:23:03,928
I want to stop them.

979
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,850
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

980
01:23:09,977 --> 01:23:13,646
But some English civilians
have been killed.

981
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:19,610
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

982
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,155
Sometimes worse.

983
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,955
Maybe I'm wrong.

984
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:34,000
Maybe we're not ready yet.

985
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,628
In South Africa, our numbers were small.

986
01:23:42,926 --> 01:23:46,178
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

987
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:49,515
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

988
01:23:50,017 --> 01:23:54,353
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

989
01:23:57,316 --> 01:24:00,109
I've never spoken for anything else.

990
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:27,303
England...

991
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:29,305
...is so powerful.

992
01:24:30,182 --> 01:24:31,390
Its army...

993
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,808
...and its navy...

994
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:35,603
...all its modern weapons....

995
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:38,856
But when a great power like that...

996
01:24:39,816 --> 01:24:41,901
...strikes defenseless people...

997
01:24:42,694 --> 01:24:45,571
...it shows its brutality...

998
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:46,864
...its own weakness.

999
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,951
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

1000
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:21,107
Fighting back will not work.

1001
01:25:21,358 --> 01:25:23,567
And that is why the Mahatma...

1002
01:25:24,444 --> 01:25:27,363
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

1003
01:25:58,562 --> 01:26:01,313
Back away!
Back away!

1004
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,575
But if we riot...

1005
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,785
...if we fight back...

1006
01:26:16,621 --> 01:26:18,205
...we become the vandals...

1007
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:19,874
...and they become the law.

1008
01:26:20,959 --> 01:26:25,504
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1009
01:26:26,757 --> 01:26:29,133
God and his law are on our...

1010
01:26:59,456 --> 01:27:01,999
Front rank, kneel in position!

1011
01:27:05,295 --> 01:27:06,796
We...

1012
01:27:07,214 --> 01:27:09,548
...must have the courage...

1013
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,009
...to take their anger.

1014
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:27,066
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1015
01:27:29,402 --> 01:27:31,195
They've had their warning:

1016
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,697
No meetings.

1017
01:27:37,744 --> 01:27:39,411
Fire!

1018
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,487
Take your time!

1019
01:28:35,218 --> 01:28:36,385
Corporal!

1020
01:28:36,803 --> 01:28:38,179
To your left.

1021
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,187
General Dyer...

1022
01:29:29,356 --> 01:29:32,107
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1023
01:29:32,317 --> 01:29:34,693
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1024
01:29:35,278 --> 01:29:37,071
That is so.

1025
01:29:41,952 --> 01:29:44,954
1516 casualties with...

1026
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:50,084
...1650 bullets.

1027
01:29:50,502 --> 01:29:52,336
My intention was to inflict a lesson...

1028
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:55,464
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

1029
01:30:00,804 --> 01:30:01,929
General...

1030
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:07,351
...had you been able to
take in the armored car...

1031
01:30:07,978 --> 01:30:10,437
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1032
01:30:14,901 --> 01:30:16,360
I think, probably, yes.

1033
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:24,159
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1034
01:30:25,537 --> 01:30:26,954
I did.

1035
01:30:27,914 --> 01:30:30,624
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1036
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,501
That is correct.

1037
01:30:39,092 --> 01:30:42,970
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1038
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:49,310
I was ready to help any who applied.

1039
01:30:51,688 --> 01:30:54,440
General, how does a child...

1040
01:30:54,941 --> 01:30:57,484
...shot with a .303 Lee-Enfield...

1041
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,487
...apply for help?

1042
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:49,883
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...

1043
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:55,138
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1044
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:59,685
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1045
01:35:00,144 --> 01:35:01,520
Now...

1046
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:03,730
...what I would like to do...

1047
01:35:04,148 --> 01:35:08,569
...is to come to some compromise
over the new...

1048
01:35:08,778 --> 01:35:11,280
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1049
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:14,700
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1050
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:17,035
We think it is time you recognized...

1051
01:35:17,245 --> 01:35:20,330
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1052
01:35:22,333 --> 01:35:24,668
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1053
01:35:24,836 --> 01:35:28,880
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1054
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:33,885
General Dyer is but
an extreme example of the principle.

1055
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:36,597
It is time you left.

1056
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:43,186
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1057
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:45,564
...without British administration...

1058
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:47,816
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1059
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:49,443
Mr. Kinnoch...

1060
01:35:51,487 --> 01:35:53,864
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1061
01:35:54,032 --> 01:35:56,450
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1062
01:35:56,659 --> 01:35:58,952
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1063
01:35:59,162 --> 01:36:01,955
My dear sir, India is British.

1064
01:36:02,206 --> 01:36:04,499
We're hardly an alien power.

1065
01:36:10,673 --> 01:36:11,757
Mr. Gandhi.

1066
01:36:11,924 --> 01:36:16,887
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1067
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:21,224
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1068
01:36:21,476 --> 01:36:23,560
...who are a minority in this realm.

1069
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:27,189
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1070
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,026
...and his administration
are essential...

1071
01:36:31,277 --> 01:36:33,820
...in order to secure the peace.

1072
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:37,991
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1073
01:36:38,201 --> 01:36:41,328
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1074
01:36:41,621 --> 01:36:43,288
But they will be ours...

1075
01:36:43,665 --> 01:36:44,831
...not yours.

1076
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,085
How do you propose to make them yours?

1077
01:36:49,128 --> 01:36:51,672
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India.

1078
01:36:52,382 --> 01:36:54,216
Yes.

1079
01:36:54,425 --> 01:36:57,219
In the end, you will walk out...

1080
01:36:57,387 --> 01:37:01,056
...because 100,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1081
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:03,975
...350 million Indians
if those Indians refuse...

1082
01:37:04,227 --> 01:37:05,852
...to cooperate.

1083
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:08,522
And that is what we intend to achieve.

1084
01:37:08,773 --> 01:37:13,068
Peaceful, nonviolent noncooperation...

1085
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,988
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1086
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,157
...Your Excellency.

1087
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,996
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

1088
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,082
And he said, "Yes."

1089
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:30,043
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1090
01:37:30,253 --> 01:37:32,504
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1091
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,799
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually gonna do something.

1092
01:37:35,967 --> 01:37:40,512
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1093
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:43,557
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

1094
01:37:43,766 --> 01:37:47,227
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1095
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,938
Whatever mischief he causes...

1096
01:37:50,148 --> 01:37:53,191
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1097
01:37:57,238 --> 01:38:00,073
But now something worse is happening.

1098
01:38:00,283 --> 01:38:02,576
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

1099
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:06,079
...women wove their own cloth.

1100
01:38:07,165 --> 01:38:10,041
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1101
01:38:10,793 --> 01:38:15,714
...because those who can
buy all they need from England.

1102
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:19,176
I say with Gandhiji:

1103
01:38:19,844 --> 01:38:22,929
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1104
01:38:23,181 --> 01:38:27,184
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1105
01:38:58,424 --> 01:39:00,509
My message to you...

1106
01:39:01,385 --> 01:39:04,930
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1107
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:08,141
To gain independence...

1108
01:39:08,559 --> 01:39:10,519
...we must prove worthy of it.

1109
01:39:11,896 --> 01:39:16,817
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1110
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:23,240
Second:

1111
01:39:24,367 --> 01:39:27,911
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1112
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:30,539
We must remove untouchability...

1113
01:39:30,748 --> 01:39:33,625
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1114
01:39:39,215 --> 01:39:40,549
Third:

1115
01:39:41,259 --> 01:39:43,927
We must defy the British.

1116
01:40:00,903 --> 01:40:05,156
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1117
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:09,828
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1118
01:40:10,454 --> 01:40:13,081
English factories make the cloth...

1119
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,792
...that makes our poverty.

1120
01:40:16,544 --> 01:40:19,546
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1121
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:23,415
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1122
01:40:25,094 --> 01:40:27,888
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1123
01:40:29,181 --> 01:40:30,640
...and in London.

1124
01:40:31,142 --> 01:40:32,350
And if...

1125
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,519
...like me...

1126
01:40:35,271 --> 01:40:38,440
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1127
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,570
...wear it with dignity.

1128
01:41:26,781 --> 01:41:28,782
Thank you very much.

1129
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,493
No, thank you, I can manage.

1130
01:41:33,204 --> 01:41:35,956
Don't destroy my good intentions.
I already feel guilty...

1131
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:39,417
- ...about traveling second class.
- You've earned a few indulgences.

1132
01:41:39,585 --> 01:41:42,212
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1133
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:44,089
Our trains met in Bombay.

1134
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:47,425
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

1135
01:41:47,677 --> 01:41:49,552
There's another passenger.

1136
01:41:49,845 --> 01:41:53,598
A Miss Slade from London.
She's been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1137
01:41:53,891 --> 01:41:56,226
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1138
01:41:56,727 --> 01:41:59,938
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1139
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:01,815
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1140
01:42:02,024 --> 01:42:05,068
- Sink us?
- From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1141
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,905
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1142
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:10,740
Miss Slade!

1143
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:13,034
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1144
01:42:13,869 --> 01:42:16,496
And you would be Miss Slade?

1145
01:42:16,872 --> 01:42:19,332
I prefer the name Gandhiji has given me:

1146
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:20,834
Mirabehn.

1147
01:42:26,799 --> 01:42:30,760
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

1148
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,770
Leave it.
Leave it.

1149
01:42:41,063 --> 01:42:43,106
God gave you 10 thumbs.

1150
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:44,524
Eleven.

1151
01:42:48,863 --> 01:42:50,572
Sardar!

1152
01:42:56,662 --> 01:42:57,370
Mirabehn!

1153
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:58,371
Mirabehn!

1154
01:43:04,962 --> 01:43:06,629
Come, come.

1155
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,592
You will be my daughter.

1156
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:14,054
But then...

1157
01:43:14,305 --> 01:43:16,389
...some rioting broke out...

1158
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:19,434
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1159
01:43:20,352 --> 01:43:22,896
Violent, terrible.

1160
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:26,149
Whether it was provoked...

1161
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,526
...I don't know.

1162
01:43:29,361 --> 01:43:33,281
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1163
01:43:35,034 --> 01:43:37,577
Some of the things
the military have done....

1164
01:43:37,953 --> 01:43:39,996
Is the campaign weakening?

1165
01:43:40,289 --> 01:43:43,374
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1166
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,502
But with the censorship here...

1167
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:50,006
...they know more in England
than we do.

1168
01:43:50,216 --> 01:43:53,551
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

1169
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:56,054
They are not alone.

1170
01:43:56,555 --> 01:44:00,767
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1171
01:44:05,064 --> 01:44:07,315
Is that homespun?

1172
01:44:08,818 --> 01:44:12,362
I sent for it from here.
I dyed it myself.

1173
01:44:16,534 --> 01:44:19,202
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1174
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,954
It must have produced hardship.

1175
01:44:21,163 --> 01:44:22,539
It has...

1176
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:25,500
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

1177
01:44:25,709 --> 01:44:26,918
Good.

1178
01:44:30,047 --> 01:44:32,382
Ba will have to teach you to spin too.

1179
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:34,634
- I'd rather march.
- First, spin!

1180
01:44:36,178 --> 01:44:38,596
Let the others march for a time.

1181
01:44:39,515 --> 01:44:42,183
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1182
01:44:42,434 --> 01:44:44,185
And you must teach me yours.

1183
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:56,489
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1184
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:07,292
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1185
01:45:20,973 --> 01:45:24,976
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1186
01:45:31,734 --> 01:45:33,860
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1187
01:45:35,613 --> 01:45:37,197
Help us!

1188
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:39,741
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1189
01:45:40,326 --> 01:45:42,118
Go on your way.
On your way!

1190
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,787
Come back!

1191
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,583
Help us!
Help us!

1192
01:45:51,253 --> 01:45:53,129
Help!
Help!

1193
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:26,889
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1194
01:47:30,519 --> 01:47:32,770
Now it's all over the world.

1195
01:47:33,022 --> 01:47:35,940
India’s "nonviolence."

1196
01:47:38,027 --> 01:47:39,610
What can we do?

1197
01:47:40,195 --> 01:47:41,904
We must end the campaign.

1198
01:47:45,242 --> 01:47:48,828
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1199
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:53,666
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1200
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:56,586
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1201
01:47:56,795 --> 01:47:59,172
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

1202
01:47:59,381 --> 01:48:02,342
The whole of India is on the move!

1203
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:04,802
Yes, but in what direction?

1204
01:48:05,095 --> 01:48:08,973
If we obtain our freedom by murder
and bloodshed, I want no part of it.

1205
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:15,271
Bapu, you are the father of the nation.

1206
01:48:15,522 --> 01:48:18,649
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1207
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:24,364
This was one incident.

1208
01:48:24,615 --> 01:48:27,492
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1209
01:48:31,622 --> 01:48:36,667
Bapu, the whole nation is marching.

1210
01:48:37,044 --> 01:48:40,171
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

1211
01:48:42,674 --> 01:48:44,467
I will ask.

1212
01:48:45,094 --> 01:48:49,555
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1213
01:48:49,765 --> 01:48:52,392
And I will not stop until they stop.

1214
01:48:54,228 --> 01:48:55,311
But....

1215
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:58,856
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1216
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:01,150
They'll put it on every street corner.

1217
01:49:02,361 --> 01:49:06,322
Gandhiji, people are aroused.

1218
01:49:06,532 --> 01:49:08,282
They won't stop!

1219
01:49:09,993 --> 01:49:12,954
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

1220
01:49:52,327 --> 01:49:55,204
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1221
01:49:55,456 --> 01:49:57,457
Mirabehn is here.

1222
01:50:44,046 --> 01:50:46,255
I've brought your drinking water.

1223
01:50:59,061 --> 01:51:02,271
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

1224
01:51:15,077 --> 01:51:18,162
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

1225
01:51:18,747 --> 01:51:20,540
There was a telegram.

1226
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:23,834
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1227
01:51:24,253 --> 01:51:26,087
When it is everywhere...

1228
01:51:27,548 --> 01:51:30,216
...then my prayers will be answered.

1229
01:51:34,179 --> 01:51:36,305
Do you find me stubborn?

1230
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,391
I don't know.

1231
01:51:39,393 --> 01:51:41,519
I know that you are right.

1232
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:44,438
I don't know that this is right.

1233
01:51:47,025 --> 01:51:48,818
May I turn you?

1234
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:04,542
When I despair...

1235
01:52:05,043 --> 01:52:08,546
...I remember that
all through history...

1236
01:52:09,423 --> 01:52:13,634
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1237
01:52:15,596 --> 01:52:18,514
There have been tyrants and murderers...

1238
01:52:18,724 --> 01:52:22,852
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1239
01:52:23,061 --> 01:52:26,230
But in the end, they always fall.

1240
01:52:27,899 --> 01:52:29,317
Think of it.

1241
01:52:30,902 --> 01:52:32,612
Always.

1242
01:52:34,531 --> 01:52:37,992
Whenever you are in doubt
that that is God's way...

1243
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:41,162
...the way the world is meant to be...

1244
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,913
...think of that...

1245
01:52:44,333 --> 01:52:47,627
...and then try to do it his way.

1246
01:52:50,797 --> 01:52:55,343
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

1247
01:52:59,264 --> 01:53:00,765
Panditji!

1248
01:53:13,654 --> 01:53:15,196
Jinnah...

1249
01:53:15,447 --> 01:53:16,614
...Patel...

1250
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:21,327
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1251
01:53:21,578 --> 01:53:25,247
There's not been one demonstration.

1252
01:53:26,249 --> 01:53:31,003
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1253
01:53:31,463 --> 01:53:33,047
They're walking in the streets...

1254
01:53:33,256 --> 01:53:36,008
...offering garlands to the police...

1255
01:53:38,095 --> 01:53:39,512
...and British soldiers.

1256
01:53:42,432 --> 01:53:44,767
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1257
01:54:05,997 --> 01:54:08,624
- Good morning, Bapu.
- Good morning.

1258
01:54:08,917 --> 01:54:12,169
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1259
01:54:12,379 --> 01:54:14,296
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

1260
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:44,744
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1261
01:54:44,953 --> 01:54:46,495
...but you're under arrest.

1262
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:48,497
On what charge?

1263
01:54:48,749 --> 01:54:50,124
Sedition.

1264
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:52,543
You can't be serious.

1265
01:54:52,919 --> 01:54:54,754
This man has just stopped a revolution.

1266
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:56,088
That's as may be.

1267
01:54:56,298 --> 01:54:58,215
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1268
01:54:58,467 --> 01:54:59,884
I don't believe it!

1269
01:55:00,135 --> 01:55:02,511
Even the British can't be that stupid.

1270
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:05,222
Help me, please.

1271
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:08,267
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1272
01:55:12,856 --> 01:55:16,984
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1273
01:55:17,194 --> 01:55:18,611
...I will fast again.

1274
01:55:18,945 --> 01:55:20,154
Herman.

1275
01:55:20,614 --> 01:55:22,740
I have been on many trips.

1276
01:55:23,325 --> 01:55:24,950
Monda.

1277
01:55:25,243 --> 01:55:27,203
This is just another trip.

1278
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:29,955
I am at your command.

1279
01:55:35,545 --> 01:55:38,756
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1280
01:55:38,965 --> 01:55:42,134
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1281
01:55:42,344 --> 01:55:44,595
...our country can make at this time.

1282
01:55:45,597 --> 01:55:50,434
And if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1283
01:55:58,610 --> 01:56:00,778
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1284
01:56:46,783 --> 01:56:49,702
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1285
01:56:49,911 --> 01:56:52,121
The overthrow of the government.

1286
01:56:52,414 --> 01:56:54,832
Sedition must become our creed.

1287
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:57,334
We must give no quarter...

1288
01:56:57,586 --> 01:57:00,462
...nor can we expect any."

1289
01:57:00,672 --> 01:57:02,923
- Do you deny writing it?
- Not at all.

1290
01:57:03,884 --> 01:57:05,801
And I will save the court's time...

1291
01:57:06,011 --> 01:57:08,554
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1292
01:57:08,763 --> 01:57:11,140
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1293
01:57:11,308 --> 01:57:13,601
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

1294
01:57:14,644 --> 01:57:17,229
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1295
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:25,154
I presume you are conducting
your own defense, Mr. Gandhi.

1296
01:57:25,322 --> 01:57:27,990
I have no defense, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1297
01:57:28,575 --> 01:57:30,910
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1298
01:57:31,161 --> 01:57:35,873
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1299
01:57:47,052 --> 01:57:50,763
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

1300
01:57:50,972 --> 01:57:53,974
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1301
01:57:54,809 --> 01:57:56,894
...or am likely to try.

1302
01:57:57,395 --> 01:57:59,897
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1303
01:58:00,106 --> 01:58:03,901
...to six years' imprisonment.

1304
01:58:14,162 --> 01:58:18,165
If, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1305
01:58:18,917 --> 01:58:21,961
...see fit to reduce the term...

1306
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:27,216
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1307
01:58:54,953 --> 01:58:57,246
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped.

1308
01:58:57,539 --> 01:59:00,791
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1309
01:59:01,459 --> 01:59:03,544
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1310
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:06,296
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1311
01:59:06,464 --> 01:59:09,425
As soon as he got out, he was back
tramping the countryside...

1312
01:59:09,592 --> 01:59:12,886
...preaching nonviolence
and demanding a free India.

1313
01:59:14,305 --> 01:59:17,266
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1314
01:59:19,019 --> 01:59:21,603
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1315
01:59:21,813 --> 01:59:24,565
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1316
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:26,775
I've been aware of him for a long time.

1317
01:59:26,985 --> 01:59:28,986
He certainly makes good copy.

1318
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:33,365
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1319
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:36,869
I met him once.

1320
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,787
- What, you mean Gandhi?
- Yeah.

1321
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:41,331
South Africa, a long time ago.

1322
01:59:41,833 --> 01:59:43,751
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1323
01:59:44,002 --> 01:59:45,044
What was he like?

1324
01:59:45,295 --> 01:59:47,504
He had a full head of hair then.

1325
01:59:47,672 --> 01:59:50,883
We were like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1326
01:59:51,051 --> 01:59:53,886
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1327
02:00:00,393 --> 02:00:04,229
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1328
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:06,482
Helpmate.

1329
02:00:07,609 --> 02:00:12,279
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

1330
02:00:13,573 --> 02:00:16,033
I will ever live devoted to you...

1331
02:00:16,284 --> 02:00:20,871
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1332
02:00:22,207 --> 02:00:23,415
Take the fifth step...

1333
02:00:23,416 --> 02:00:24,541
Take the fifth step...

1334
02:00:24,793 --> 02:00:26,543
...the walking around a fire...

1335
02:00:29,172 --> 02:00:32,257
...that we may serve the people.

1336
02:00:32,509 --> 02:00:35,177
I will follow close behind you...

1337
02:00:35,386 --> 02:00:37,971
...and help to serve the people.

1338
02:00:39,682 --> 02:00:41,558
Take the sixth step...

1339
02:00:42,769 --> 02:00:46,313
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1340
02:00:46,689 --> 02:00:51,110
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1341
02:00:52,237 --> 02:00:54,363
Take the seventh step...

1342
02:00:57,242 --> 02:01:00,327
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1343
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:05,082
You are my best friend...

1344
02:01:06,209 --> 02:01:08,210
...my highest guru...

1345
02:01:09,129 --> 02:01:11,547
...and my sovereign lord.

1346
02:01:15,677 --> 02:01:18,470
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1347
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:21,473
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1348
02:01:21,724 --> 02:01:24,268
And with that, we were pronounced...

1349
02:01:24,561 --> 02:01:26,145
...man and wife.

1350
02:01:28,398 --> 02:01:30,941
We were both 13.

1351
02:01:43,288 --> 02:01:44,913
It's beautiful.

1352
02:01:46,457 --> 02:01:48,417
Even as a boy...

1353
02:01:48,626 --> 02:01:50,127
...I thought so.

1354
02:01:52,172 --> 02:01:53,672
Thank you.

1355
02:01:54,757 --> 02:01:58,051
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1356
02:01:59,929 --> 02:02:03,640
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1357
02:02:05,226 --> 02:02:08,061
- Is it?
- Perhaps.

1358
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:10,939
I've come here to think about it.

1359
02:02:14,736 --> 02:02:16,820
Do you remember much of South Africa?

1360
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:19,531
Oh, yes.
A great deal.

1361
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:23,785
I've traveled so far...

1362
02:02:24,412 --> 02:02:26,622
...and thought so much.

1363
02:02:30,835 --> 02:02:34,963
As you can see, my city is a sea city.

1364
02:02:36,299 --> 02:02:38,634
Always full of Hindus...

1365
02:02:38,843 --> 02:02:40,385
...Muslims...

1366
02:02:40,595 --> 02:02:42,804
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1367
02:02:45,266 --> 02:02:48,310
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1368
02:02:48,728 --> 02:02:50,020
Hindu, of course.

1369
02:02:50,230 --> 02:02:53,482
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1370
02:02:53,691 --> 02:02:55,943
...from the Muslim Koran...

1371
02:02:56,152 --> 02:02:58,987
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

1372
02:02:59,197 --> 02:03:01,740
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1373
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:03,825
...as long as God was worshiped.

1374
02:03:07,538 --> 02:03:08,789
When I was a boy...

1375
02:03:09,374 --> 02:03:11,500
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

1376
02:03:15,004 --> 02:03:19,299
A true disciple Knows another's woes

1377
02:03:19,509 --> 02:03:21,718
As his own

1378
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,428
He bows to all...

1379
02:03:23,638 --> 02:03:25,847
...and despises none.

1380
02:03:27,141 --> 02:03:28,308
Like all other boys...

1381
02:03:28,518 --> 02:03:30,060
...I sang the words...

1382
02:03:30,728 --> 02:03:34,815
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

1383
02:03:38,403 --> 02:03:40,445
I've traveled so far.

1384
02:03:41,739 --> 02:03:44,199
And all I've done is come back...

1385
02:03:44,993 --> 02:03:46,285
...home.

1386
02:03:56,504 --> 02:03:58,338
Wait a minute.

1387
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:02,134
- You know what you're gonna do?
- It would have been uncivil of me...

1388
02:04:02,343 --> 02:04:05,095
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1389
02:04:07,307 --> 02:04:09,224
- Where are you going?
- Come.

1390
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,312
- Where are we going?
- Back to the ashram.

1391
02:04:13,563 --> 02:04:15,522
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

1392
02:04:15,773 --> 02:04:18,692
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in India.

1393
02:04:19,027 --> 02:04:20,068
Salt?

1394
02:04:20,278 --> 02:04:24,239
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

1395
02:04:26,326 --> 02:04:28,660
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

1396
02:04:29,912 --> 02:04:34,458
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

1397
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:37,127
All right, he's breaking the law.

1398
02:04:37,378 --> 02:04:40,672
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

1399
02:04:40,882 --> 02:04:45,594
It's not a serious attack on the revenue.
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1400
02:04:45,803 --> 02:04:49,431
- Don't patronize me, Charles.
- No, sir, I....

1401
02:04:52,268 --> 02:04:55,562
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1402
02:04:55,813 --> 02:04:59,900
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

1403
02:05:00,735 --> 02:05:04,488
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1404
02:05:04,697 --> 02:05:05,947
The day he sets off...

1405
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:10,202
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

1406
02:05:10,912 --> 02:05:15,624
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

1407
02:05:19,879 --> 02:05:21,922
I say ignore it.

1408
02:05:22,173 --> 02:05:24,633
Let them raise their damned flags.

1409
02:05:24,884 --> 02:05:25,926
Let him make his salt.

1410
02:05:27,053 --> 02:05:30,138
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

1411
02:05:32,517 --> 02:05:34,184
He'll arrive at the sea...

1412
02:05:34,394 --> 02:05:37,521
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1413
02:05:46,656 --> 02:05:49,157
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.

1414
02:05:49,575 --> 02:05:52,411
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

1415
02:05:52,662 --> 02:05:56,456
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

1416
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:53,597
You've done me a great service.

1417
02:06:53,848 --> 02:06:55,056
Not at all, sir.

1418
02:06:55,308 --> 02:06:59,394
It would be uncivil for us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

1419
02:07:14,285 --> 02:07:15,494
We'll go.

1420
02:07:15,745 --> 02:07:19,331
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1421
02:07:41,938 --> 02:07:43,813
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1422
02:07:43,981 --> 02:07:45,148
Not if they arrest me...

1423
02:07:45,399 --> 02:07:47,817
...or 1000 or 10,000.

1424
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:51,988
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1425
02:07:52,448 --> 02:07:55,450
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1426
02:07:55,618 --> 02:07:56,952
Something for your notebook:

1427
02:07:57,245 --> 02:08:00,622
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1428
02:08:00,915 --> 02:08:02,624
And we will continue to provoke...

1429
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:06,169
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1430
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:09,548
They are not in control.
We are.

1431
02:08:10,174 --> 02:08:13,218
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1432
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,266
Vince!

1433
02:08:20,184 --> 02:08:23,812
- What did he say?
- He said he's in control.

1434
02:08:45,793 --> 02:08:47,836
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1435
02:08:48,087 --> 02:08:50,380
It's the only way I can get the story.

1436
02:08:50,631 --> 02:08:53,049
Besides, my name is Walker.

1437
02:08:53,676 --> 02:08:55,969
"My name is Walker."

1438
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:54,194
- My dear Mrs. Nehru!
- Bapu.

1439
02:10:47,373 --> 02:10:49,374
Man needs salt...

1440
02:10:49,583 --> 02:10:52,252
...as he needs air and water.

1441
02:10:52,795 --> 02:10:56,756
This salt comes from the Indian Ocean.

1442
02:10:57,007 --> 02:11:00,885
Let every Indian claim it as his right.

1443
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:05,306
And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...

1444
02:11:05,558 --> 02:11:08,810
...has challenged the might
of the British Empire.

1445
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:27,078
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

1446
02:11:27,329 --> 02:11:28,455
Publicly.

1447
02:11:28,706 --> 02:11:32,041
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1448
02:11:32,585 --> 02:11:35,628
We're being made fools of, sir,
around the world.

1449
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:38,047
Isn't there any instruction from London?

1450
02:11:38,299 --> 02:11:41,676
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

1451
02:11:41,927 --> 02:11:44,345
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1452
02:11:45,389 --> 02:11:48,224
Arrest anyone, any rank, except Gandhi.

1453
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:51,519
We'll cut the strength from under him.

1454
02:11:52,688 --> 02:11:56,024
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1455
02:12:13,542 --> 02:12:16,127
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!

1456
02:12:51,622 --> 02:12:54,332
Don't hit back!
No violence!

1457
02:13:04,468 --> 02:13:08,763
There must be 100,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

1458
02:13:09,014 --> 02:13:12,100
- Who's leading them?
- I don't know. Nehru, Patel...

1459
02:13:12,309 --> 02:13:16,521
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

1460
02:13:16,772 --> 02:13:19,566
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1461
02:13:21,902 --> 02:13:23,862
Has there been any violence?

1462
02:13:24,113 --> 02:13:26,948
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1463
02:13:27,157 --> 02:13:30,410
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1464
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:34,622
But he's facing disciplinary court.

1465
02:13:34,832 --> 02:13:37,125
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1466
02:13:37,293 --> 02:13:41,880
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

1467
02:13:44,675 --> 02:13:45,842
No, sir.

1468
02:13:46,093 --> 02:13:48,136
I'm afraid not.

1469
02:13:48,429 --> 02:13:52,307
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might....

1470
02:13:55,603 --> 02:13:58,187
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1471
02:13:58,397 --> 02:13:59,564
Yes, sir, he has.

1472
02:13:59,815 --> 02:14:00,982
The usual thing:

1473
02:14:01,191 --> 02:14:03,401
"India’s salt belongs to India."

1474
02:14:03,652 --> 02:14:04,736
Then he says flatly...

1475
02:14:04,904 --> 02:14:09,240
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

1476
02:14:10,534 --> 02:14:12,368
Thank him for his letter...

1477
02:14:12,786 --> 02:14:14,621
...and put him in jail.

1478
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:18,166
Yes, sir.

1479
02:14:19,919 --> 02:14:21,544
Yes, sir.
It'll be my pleasure.

1480
02:14:21,795 --> 02:14:24,047
- And Fields?
- Sir?

1481
02:14:24,298 --> 02:14:26,716
Keep that salt works open.

1482
02:14:27,009 --> 02:14:28,801
Yes, sir.

1483
02:14:34,433 --> 02:14:35,475
I'm sorry, sir.

1484
02:14:35,643 --> 02:14:39,103
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1485
02:14:39,313 --> 02:14:40,688
Very well.

1486
02:14:42,733 --> 02:14:44,067
...in his name.

1487
02:14:44,276 --> 02:14:49,072
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1488
02:14:49,323 --> 02:14:52,492
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1489
02:14:54,745 --> 02:14:56,746
Long live Gandhiji!

1490
02:15:00,584 --> 02:15:02,377
We are ready!

1491
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:11,594
I want firmness and discipline.

1492
02:15:31,824 --> 02:15:34,701
- All right, take up your positions.
- Yes, sir.

1493
02:15:41,625 --> 02:15:43,918
To your mark.
Forward!

1494
02:15:54,596 --> 02:15:56,723
Last night at midnight...

1495
02:15:57,516 --> 02:15:59,142
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1496
02:16:00,644 --> 02:16:02,979
They expect us to lose heart...

1497
02:16:03,188 --> 02:16:04,897
...or to fight back.

1498
02:16:05,649 --> 02:16:07,817
We will do neither!

1499
02:16:39,224 --> 02:16:40,600
On your guard!

1500
02:16:57,451 --> 02:16:58,993
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

1501
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,448
"They walked...

1502
02:18:19,992 --> 02:18:22,034
...both Hindu and Muslim alike...

1503
02:18:23,036 --> 02:18:24,996
...with heads held high...

1504
02:18:25,455 --> 02:18:27,331
...without any hope of escape...

1505
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:29,625
...from injury or death.

1506
02:18:29,918 --> 02:18:33,212
It went on and on into the night."

1507
02:18:33,422 --> 02:18:34,463
Stop.

1508
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:38,885
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1509
02:18:39,094 --> 02:18:41,596
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1510
02:18:41,805 --> 02:18:47,977
Stop. "But still, it went on and on."
Stop.

1511
02:18:48,228 --> 02:18:52,940
"Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1512
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:55,026
...was lost here today.

1513
02:18:55,819 --> 02:18:57,904
India is free...

1514
02:18:58,113 --> 02:19:02,992
...for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...

1515
02:19:03,202 --> 02:19:08,789
...and she has neither
cringed nor retreated." Stop.

1516
02:20:17,776 --> 02:20:22,363
I am aware that I must have given
you much cause for irritation...

1517
02:20:22,572 --> 02:20:23,864
...Your Excellency.

1518
02:20:24,116 --> 02:20:27,118
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1519
02:20:31,665 --> 02:20:32,873
Mr. Gandhi...

1520
02:20:33,625 --> 02:20:36,961
...I am instructed to request
your attendance...

1521
02:20:37,170 --> 02:20:39,422
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1522
02:20:40,382 --> 02:20:45,261
...to discuss the possible
independence...

1523
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:46,929
...of India.

1524
02:20:57,816 --> 02:21:00,192
Only recently released from prison...

1525
02:21:00,402 --> 02:21:04,363
...Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...

1526
02:21:04,573 --> 02:21:07,408
...to attend the conference
on Indian independence...

1527
02:21:07,659 --> 02:21:11,912
...called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.

1528
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,083
Mr. Gandhi, the sole Indian
Congress Party delegate...

1529
02:21:16,293 --> 02:21:18,836
...is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...

1530
02:21:19,004 --> 02:21:20,671
...for the duration of the talks.

1531
02:21:21,131 --> 02:21:23,341
He's seen here amongst local cockneys...

1532
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:25,509
...who have taken him
to their hearts.

1533
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:27,428
Besides attending the conference...

1534
02:21:27,637 --> 02:21:30,639
...he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...

1535
02:21:30,807 --> 02:21:32,767
...like Mr. Lloyd George...

1536
02:21:33,018 --> 02:21:36,228
...the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...

1537
02:21:36,438 --> 02:21:38,314
...and Charlie Chaplin.

1538
02:21:40,776 --> 02:21:43,152
He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...

1539
02:21:43,362 --> 02:21:47,615
...to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...

1540
02:21:47,824 --> 02:21:51,285
...at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.

1541
02:21:51,536 --> 02:21:55,081
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1542
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:59,502
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1543
02:22:00,295 --> 02:22:01,712
...but several.

1544
02:22:02,464 --> 02:22:04,382
A Hindu India...

1545
02:22:04,633 --> 02:22:06,842
...a Muslim India...

1546
02:22:07,052 --> 02:22:09,637
...and an India of princely states.

1547
02:22:09,888 --> 02:22:12,723
And all these must be respected...

1548
02:22:12,933 --> 02:22:14,517
...and cared for.

1549
02:22:14,768 --> 02:22:16,143
Not just one.

1550
02:22:41,336 --> 02:22:43,170
Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...

1551
02:22:43,422 --> 02:22:46,455
...the London Round Table
Conference on Indian Independence...

1552
02:22:46,716 --> 02:22:49,343
...journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.

1553
02:22:49,886 --> 02:22:52,346
Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...

1554
02:22:52,556 --> 02:22:55,433
...Mr. Gandhi received a warm
welcome from mill workers...

1555
02:22:56,351 --> 02:22:57,893
...before heading back south...

1556
02:22:58,145 --> 02:23:00,729
...for a final meeting with Mr. MacDonald.

1557
02:23:01,189 --> 02:23:06,026
The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.

1558
02:23:09,114 --> 02:23:11,490
So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.

1559
02:23:11,992 --> 02:23:14,326
And bon voyage!

1560
02:23:16,371 --> 02:23:18,831
So the truth is,
after all your travels...

1561
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:20,708
...after all your efforts...

1562
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:24,837
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1563
02:23:25,255 --> 02:23:28,549
They're only clinging to old dreams...

1564
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:31,635
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1565
02:23:32,345 --> 02:23:34,138
But the will has gone.

1566
02:23:34,389 --> 02:23:37,433
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1567
02:23:37,642 --> 02:23:40,227
The only question is, when and how.

1568
02:23:40,604 --> 02:23:42,396
Well, I say, when is now!

1569
02:23:44,649 --> 02:23:47,026
And we will determine how.

1570
02:23:47,277 --> 02:23:48,944
Precisely.

1571
02:23:49,362 --> 02:23:51,363
Bapu, she is limping again.

1572
02:23:51,865 --> 02:23:53,282
It's only a sprain.

1573
02:23:53,742 --> 02:23:57,119
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1574
02:23:58,413 --> 02:24:01,081
Go.
I won't be a moment.

1575
02:24:04,669 --> 02:24:06,670
They are preparing for war.

1576
02:24:07,506 --> 02:24:08,797
I will not support it.

1577
02:24:09,007 --> 02:24:12,843
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1578
02:24:13,094 --> 02:24:15,471
That's when you take advantage.

1579
02:24:15,805 --> 02:24:18,641
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1580
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:22,061
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1581
02:24:22,229 --> 02:24:25,231
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1582
02:24:25,482 --> 02:24:30,444
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1583
02:24:36,701 --> 02:24:37,868
Mud packs.

1584
02:24:50,257 --> 02:24:52,174
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

1585
02:24:52,384 --> 02:24:56,053
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

1586
02:24:56,263 --> 02:24:59,431
The value of goat's milk in daily diet.

1587
02:25:01,476 --> 02:25:05,104
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1588
02:25:05,772 --> 02:25:07,356
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1589
02:25:07,566 --> 02:25:08,607
Corporal!

1590
02:25:13,572 --> 02:25:14,905
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1591
02:25:15,073 --> 02:25:18,534
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1592
02:25:19,286 --> 02:25:22,955
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1593
02:25:48,523 --> 02:25:50,316
Hold it a second, will you?

1594
02:25:51,901 --> 02:25:55,029
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1595
02:25:55,196 --> 02:25:58,157
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

1596
02:25:59,034 --> 02:26:02,536
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1597
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:05,998
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1598
02:26:06,207 --> 02:26:08,709
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1599
02:26:08,918 --> 02:26:10,961
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1600
02:26:11,212 --> 02:26:13,172
They had him cut off from the press.

1601
02:26:13,381 --> 02:26:15,965
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1602
02:26:22,307 --> 02:26:25,225
Yes, I have heard of LIFE magazine.

1603
02:26:25,477 --> 02:26:29,438
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1604
02:26:29,689 --> 02:26:33,609
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1605
02:26:33,818 --> 02:26:36,278
...sitting alone in prison...

1606
02:26:36,529 --> 02:26:39,990
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1607
02:26:40,825 --> 02:26:44,536
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1608
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:50,668
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1609
02:26:56,591 --> 02:27:00,511
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

1610
02:27:00,845 --> 02:27:04,473
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1611
02:27:04,724 --> 02:27:06,892
...independence will come.

1612
02:27:07,227 --> 02:27:08,352
My only worry...

1613
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:11,021
...is what shape it will take.

1614
02:27:11,272 --> 02:27:13,023
- Jinnah has...
- Stop!

1615
02:27:13,566 --> 02:27:16,902
I'm sorry, but...
Could you come forward, please?

1616
02:27:17,570 --> 02:27:19,780
- Come, come.
- Just up to the railing.

1617
02:27:20,031 --> 02:27:21,615
Thank you very much.

1618
02:27:22,784 --> 02:27:23,826
Thank you.

1619
02:27:24,035 --> 02:27:25,411
Now, sorry.

1620
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:27,830
Go on.
"What shape it will take...."

1621
02:27:28,039 --> 02:27:29,540
Jinnah has what?

1622
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:34,837
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

1623
02:27:35,046 --> 02:27:39,258
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1624
02:27:39,509 --> 02:27:42,052
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1625
02:27:42,303 --> 02:27:44,471
...of what will happen to them...

1626
02:27:44,681 --> 02:27:47,641
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1627
02:27:48,351 --> 02:27:51,270
And that I find hard to bear...

1628
02:27:51,521 --> 02:27:53,188
...even in prison.

1629
02:27:53,398 --> 02:27:55,107
Mr. Gandhi?

1630
02:28:01,156 --> 02:28:05,743
It's hard for me to see this as a solution
to the 20th century's problems.

1631
02:28:06,494 --> 02:28:09,079
I have friends who keep telling me...

1632
02:28:09,289 --> 02:28:13,250
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1633
02:28:15,003 --> 02:28:19,673
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

1634
02:28:19,924 --> 02:28:21,550
...even 20th-century things.

1635
02:28:21,801 --> 02:28:26,472
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1636
02:28:27,474 --> 02:28:30,392
India lives in her villages...

1637
02:28:30,643 --> 02:28:33,520
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1638
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:37,107
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1639
02:28:37,525 --> 02:28:40,527
Poverty is the worst form of violence.

1640
02:28:41,279 --> 02:28:43,697
And a constructive program
is the only...

1641
02:28:43,907 --> 02:28:47,201
...nonviolent solution
to India’s agony.

1642
02:28:47,911 --> 02:28:50,579
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

1643
02:28:50,789 --> 02:28:55,083
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

1644
02:28:57,712 --> 02:29:01,256
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

1645
02:29:03,259 --> 02:29:06,512
Not without defeats and great pain.

1646
02:29:07,722 --> 02:29:10,390
But are there no defeats in this war?

1647
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:13,018
No pain?

1648
02:29:13,812 --> 02:29:15,312
What you cannot do...

1649
02:29:15,563 --> 02:29:18,232
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1650
02:29:18,441 --> 02:29:21,568
You must make the injustice visible.

1651
02:29:21,778 --> 02:29:25,405
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1652
02:29:28,827 --> 02:29:31,620
Is this what I'm meant to
end up with here?

1653
02:29:31,788 --> 02:29:32,913
No.

1654
02:29:33,122 --> 02:29:35,207
That's what you get for distracting me.

1655
02:29:35,416 --> 02:29:37,501
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1656
02:29:37,710 --> 02:29:42,297
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

1657
02:29:43,216 --> 02:29:46,510
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1658
02:29:51,975 --> 02:29:54,768
And that includes the life of women.

1659
02:29:55,436 --> 02:29:58,230
Bapu has always said...

1660
02:29:58,439 --> 02:30:01,275
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1661
02:30:01,693 --> 02:30:05,445
One for women, one for the untouchables.

1662
02:30:05,989 --> 02:30:09,283
And he has always fought against both.

1663
02:30:11,995 --> 02:30:15,247
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1664
02:30:18,877 --> 02:30:21,128
In Hindu philosophy...

1665
02:30:21,963 --> 02:30:23,422
...the way to God...

1666
02:30:23,631 --> 02:30:26,383
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1667
02:30:27,343 --> 02:30:28,760
...and of passions.

1668
02:30:29,679 --> 02:30:34,057
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1669
02:30:37,812 --> 02:30:41,982
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1670
02:30:45,236 --> 02:30:47,321
Four times he tried...

1671
02:30:48,072 --> 02:30:49,531
...and failed.

1672
02:30:51,284 --> 02:30:53,285
But then he took a solemn vow.

1673
02:30:56,122 --> 02:30:57,331
And he's never broken it?

1674
02:31:00,877 --> 02:31:02,044
Not yet.

1675
02:31:19,979 --> 02:31:23,315
- I've got permission to move her.
- I'm very sorry, sir.

1676
02:31:23,524 --> 02:31:26,360
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1677
02:31:26,611 --> 02:31:28,195
She'll never survive the trip.

1678
02:31:28,404 --> 02:31:31,365
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1679
02:32:18,913 --> 02:32:21,748
It's time for my walk.

1680
02:32:24,168 --> 02:32:25,335
I won't be long.

1681
02:32:25,336 --> 02:32:25,976
I won't be long.

1682
02:34:43,724 --> 02:34:44,850
Guard...

1683
02:34:45,017 --> 02:34:47,060
...present arms!

1684
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:06,913
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

1685
02:35:09,041 --> 02:35:11,960
To assist at the birth of
an independent India...

1686
02:35:12,128 --> 02:35:14,087
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1687
02:35:14,255 --> 02:35:16,505
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1688
02:35:17,925 --> 02:35:20,927
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

1689
02:35:21,137 --> 02:35:24,973
...ever to have the honor
of such a reception.

1690
02:35:37,445 --> 02:35:40,197
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1691
02:35:40,448 --> 02:35:42,657
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

1692
02:35:42,909 --> 02:35:44,993
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1693
02:35:45,244 --> 02:35:47,829
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

1694
02:35:48,039 --> 02:35:50,332
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

1695
02:35:56,839 --> 02:36:00,884
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

1696
02:36:01,469 --> 02:36:04,262
No one will be master, no one slave.

1697
02:36:04,513 --> 02:36:06,806
The world is not made of
Mahatma Gandhis.

1698
02:36:07,058 --> 02:36:08,725
I'm talking about the real world.

1699
02:36:08,976 --> 02:36:10,560
- How the...
- The real India has...

1700
02:36:10,811 --> 02:36:14,689
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1701
02:36:16,108 --> 02:36:17,442
How will you separate them?

1702
02:36:17,985 --> 02:36:21,029
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1703
02:36:21,364 --> 02:36:23,156
...that will be Pakistan.

1704
02:36:23,407 --> 02:36:25,992
The rest is your India.

1705
02:36:26,202 --> 02:36:27,285
My dear Jinnah...

1706
02:36:27,828 --> 02:36:31,080
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1707
02:36:31,999 --> 02:36:36,044
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1708
02:36:36,295 --> 02:36:37,379
Gentlemen...

1709
02:36:37,630 --> 02:36:39,756
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

1710
02:36:54,021 --> 02:36:57,816
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1711
02:37:25,303 --> 02:37:27,304
Thank God, they've stopped.

1712
02:37:30,766 --> 02:37:32,559
Manu.
Abha.

1713
02:37:40,651 --> 02:37:41,901
I'm your granduncle...

1714
02:37:42,153 --> 02:37:45,488
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1715
02:37:45,698 --> 02:37:48,199
I don't need to be pampered in this way.

1716
02:37:48,409 --> 02:37:50,660
Finish your quota of spinning.

1717
02:38:32,036 --> 02:38:35,038
Bapu.
Bapu.

1718
02:38:35,206 --> 02:38:36,956
Bapu, please don't do it.

1719
02:38:37,166 --> 02:38:39,876
What do you want me not to do?

1720
02:38:40,169 --> 02:38:42,212
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1721
02:38:44,006 --> 02:38:46,007
I am a Muslim...

1722
02:38:46,342 --> 02:38:47,425
...and a Hindu...

1723
02:38:47,885 --> 02:38:49,969
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1724
02:38:50,805 --> 02:38:53,264
And so are all of you.

1725
02:38:55,434 --> 02:38:58,228
When you wave those flags and shout...

1726
02:38:58,562 --> 02:39:01,731
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1727
02:39:01,941 --> 02:39:03,942
That is not the India I want.

1728
02:39:04,193 --> 02:39:05,276
Stop it!

1729
02:39:05,528 --> 02:39:08,488
For God's sake, stop it.

1730
02:39:26,048 --> 02:39:27,799
If you've finished your prayers...

1731
02:39:28,008 --> 02:39:30,802
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1732
02:39:35,057 --> 02:39:38,017
My dear Jinnah...

1733
02:39:38,269 --> 02:39:40,770
...you and I are brothers...

1734
02:39:41,355 --> 02:39:45,567
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

1735
02:39:45,776 --> 02:39:48,862
...I want to put them at rest.

1736
02:39:49,113 --> 02:39:52,073
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1737
02:39:52,616 --> 02:39:56,202
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1738
02:39:56,662 --> 02:40:00,665
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

1739
02:40:00,875 --> 02:40:03,835
...to name your entire cabinet...

1740
02:40:04,044 --> 02:40:07,881
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1741
02:40:23,355 --> 02:40:25,064
Bapu.

1742
02:40:26,525 --> 02:40:28,693
For me and the rest...

1743
02:40:28,944 --> 02:40:31,070
...if that is what you want...

1744
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:33,573
...we will accept it.

1745
02:40:34,742 --> 02:40:36,993
But out there...

1746
02:40:37,745 --> 02:40:39,370
...already there is rioting...

1747
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:43,708
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

1748
02:40:44,502 --> 02:40:46,586
If you did this...

1749
02:40:47,213 --> 02:40:49,672
...no one would control it.

1750
02:40:50,257 --> 02:40:51,716
No one.

1751
02:41:07,441 --> 02:41:09,108
It is your choice.

1752
02:41:10,486 --> 02:41:14,656
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

1753
02:41:15,032 --> 02:41:17,534
...or do you want civil war?

1754
02:41:54,363 --> 02:41:57,365
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

1755
02:44:30,644 --> 02:44:34,147
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1756
02:44:34,565 --> 02:44:36,107
Miracle.

1757
02:44:36,608 --> 02:44:38,901
But millions are on the move...

1758
02:44:39,111 --> 02:44:41,237
...and no one can count the dead.

1759
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:47,368
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1760
02:44:49,121 --> 02:44:52,749
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1761
02:44:53,834 --> 02:44:56,210
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1762
02:44:57,629 --> 02:44:59,130
If we can't stop it...

1763
02:44:59,339 --> 02:45:02,425
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1764
02:45:03,677 --> 02:45:06,721
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1765
02:45:09,057 --> 02:45:10,641
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1766
02:45:12,311 --> 02:45:13,352
Nothing.

1767
02:45:17,191 --> 02:45:18,483
Nothing.

1768
02:45:22,863 --> 02:45:25,907
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1769
02:45:26,074 --> 02:45:30,411
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1770
02:45:30,621 --> 02:45:32,955
We could cut all news off.

1771
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:35,208
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1772
02:45:35,709 --> 02:45:37,210
I don't want to hear more.

1773
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:40,421
We need your help.

1774
02:45:40,964 --> 02:45:43,382
There is nothing I can give.

1775
02:45:46,428 --> 02:45:47,678
Where are you going?

1776
02:45:51,058 --> 02:45:52,391
Calcutta.

1777
02:46:35,686 --> 02:46:39,772
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1778
02:46:39,982 --> 02:46:42,024
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1779
02:46:42,234 --> 02:46:44,193
But, sir, please.

1780
02:46:44,444 --> 02:46:46,863
I don't have the men to protect you...

1781
02:46:47,072 --> 02:46:49,824
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1782
02:46:50,033 --> 02:46:53,160
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and...

1783
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:57,331
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1784
02:46:58,834 --> 02:47:01,002
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1785
02:47:01,253 --> 02:47:02,420
They are murderers!

1786
02:47:02,671 --> 02:47:03,880
They killed my family!

1787
02:47:04,131 --> 02:47:06,090
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1788
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:09,093
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1789
02:47:57,893 --> 02:47:59,060
Prime Minister.

1790
02:48:04,066 --> 02:48:06,943
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

1791
02:48:12,032 --> 02:48:14,617
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1792
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:16,327
We will go Friday.

1793
02:48:17,245 --> 02:48:18,329
Four days, sir?

1794
02:48:48,235 --> 02:48:49,902
Bapu.

1795
02:48:52,155 --> 02:48:54,699
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1796
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:57,159
You must join me in the fast.

1797
02:48:57,369 --> 02:48:59,787
If I fast, I die.

1798
02:49:00,414 --> 02:49:04,583
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1799
02:49:04,793 --> 02:49:06,002
...to keep you alive.

1800
02:49:07,379 --> 02:49:09,005
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1801
02:49:09,589 --> 02:49:11,716
I could have come earlier...

1802
02:49:11,925 --> 02:49:14,385
...but your fast has helped.

1803
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:18,681
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1804
02:49:18,932 --> 02:49:20,933
...and away from the atrocities.

1805
02:49:21,143 --> 02:49:22,935
But now...

1806
02:49:23,103 --> 02:49:24,145
...it is enough.

1807
02:49:26,815 --> 02:49:31,110
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1808
02:49:34,781 --> 02:49:38,409
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

1809
02:49:38,618 --> 02:49:39,827
...of all ages...

1810
02:49:40,078 --> 02:49:43,789
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1811
02:49:44,499 --> 02:49:48,127
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1812
02:49:49,212 --> 02:49:51,005
I'm glad.

1813
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:54,759
But it will not be enough.

1814
02:50:08,065 --> 02:50:13,861
Bapu, you are not so young anymore.

1815
02:50:14,321 --> 02:50:15,863
Don't worry for me.

1816
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:21,869
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

1817
02:51:31,148 --> 02:51:32,690
Death to Gandhi!

1818
02:51:32,983 --> 02:51:35,276
Who dares say such things?!

1819
02:51:35,652 --> 02:51:36,944
Who?!

1820
02:51:38,238 --> 02:51:40,990
You kill me first!

1821
02:51:42,033 --> 02:51:43,200
Come!

1822
02:51:46,079 --> 02:51:47,496
Where are you?!

1823
02:51:48,415 --> 02:51:50,166
Kill me first!

1824
02:51:53,086 --> 02:51:54,420
Where are you?

1825
02:52:04,890 --> 02:52:08,517
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1826
02:52:21,448 --> 02:52:23,657
Bapu?

1827
02:52:24,034 --> 02:52:26,785
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1828
02:52:27,078 --> 02:52:30,956
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1829
02:52:31,249 --> 02:52:32,750
He is now telling them...

1830
02:52:33,293 --> 02:52:35,794
...to go back to their homes...

1831
02:52:36,046 --> 02:52:37,963
...to lay down their arms.

1832
02:52:50,435 --> 02:52:52,603
Think what you can do by living...

1833
02:52:52,938 --> 02:52:56,065
...that you cannot do by dying.

1834
02:53:05,659 --> 02:53:08,035
What do you want?

1835
02:53:11,456 --> 02:53:14,250
That the fighting will stop.

1836
02:53:14,459 --> 02:53:17,002
That you make me believe...

1837
02:53:19,923 --> 02:53:22,758
...that it will never start again.

1838
02:53:32,102 --> 02:53:33,269
Sometimes...

1839
02:53:33,478 --> 02:53:37,231
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1840
02:53:37,941 --> 02:53:41,026
...and in utter darkness...

1841
02:53:41,736 --> 02:53:44,947
...that God comes to the rescue.

1842
02:53:46,825 --> 02:53:48,242
Gandhiji...

1843
02:53:48,702 --> 02:53:50,286
...is dying...

1844
02:53:52,163 --> 02:53:54,832
...because of our madness.

1845
02:53:56,751 --> 02:53:59,336
Put away your revenge.

1846
02:53:59,671 --> 02:54:04,216
What good will come of more killing?

1847
02:54:04,467 --> 02:54:06,802
Have the courage to do...

1848
02:54:07,012 --> 02:54:10,431
...what you know is right.

1849
02:54:10,932 --> 02:54:12,850
For God's sake...

1850
02:54:13,476 --> 02:54:17,479
...let us embrace like brothers.

1851
02:54:31,369 --> 02:54:33,162
It's our promise.

1852
02:54:33,913 --> 02:54:35,164
We stop.

1853
02:54:37,834 --> 02:54:39,793
Hindu swords.

1854
02:54:41,129 --> 02:54:42,755
It's a promise.

1855
02:54:45,925 --> 02:54:47,343
Go.

1856
02:54:49,095 --> 02:54:50,512
God be with you.

1857
02:55:03,485 --> 02:55:04,943
Here, eat!

1858
02:55:06,446 --> 02:55:07,905
Eat!

1859
02:55:09,115 --> 02:55:10,657
I'm going to hell...

1860
02:55:11,076 --> 02:55:13,744
...but not with your death on my soul.

1861
02:55:14,329 --> 02:55:17,664
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1862
02:55:18,041 --> 02:55:19,917
I killed a child.

1863
02:55:21,544 --> 02:55:24,338
I smashed his head against a wall.

1864
02:55:26,091 --> 02:55:27,383
Why?

1865
02:55:29,552 --> 02:55:31,345
They killed my son.

1866
02:55:34,432 --> 02:55:35,808
My boy.

1867
02:55:38,103 --> 02:55:40,354
The Muslims killed my son!

1868
02:55:45,276 --> 02:55:48,987
I know a way out of hell.

1869
02:55:50,323 --> 02:55:52,741
Find a child.

1870
02:55:53,034 --> 02:55:58,038
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1871
02:55:58,415 --> 02:56:02,835
A little boy about this high...

1872
02:56:04,504 --> 02:56:07,172
...and raise him as your own.

1873
02:56:10,802 --> 02:56:14,138
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1874
02:56:15,932 --> 02:56:19,101
...and that you raise him as one.

1875
02:56:46,838 --> 02:56:48,297
Go.

1876
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:50,507
Go.

1877
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:53,552
God bless you.

1878
02:57:20,288 --> 02:57:21,830
Bapu?

1879
02:57:24,042 --> 02:57:26,210
Bapu?

1880
02:57:27,879 --> 02:57:30,172
There's been no fighting...

1881
02:57:30,798 --> 02:57:31,882
...anywhere.

1882
02:57:33,218 --> 02:57:34,676
It's stopped.

1883
02:57:35,470 --> 02:57:38,055
The madness has stopped.

1884
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:43,727
It's foolish...

1885
02:57:43,937 --> 02:57:47,564
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1886
02:57:47,815 --> 02:57:52,819
No.
In every temple and mosque...

1887
02:57:53,196 --> 02:57:55,280
...they have pledged to die...

1888
02:57:55,532 --> 02:57:58,534
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1889
02:58:01,037 --> 02:58:02,788
It is true, Bapu.

1890
02:58:10,964 --> 02:58:12,756
Everywhere.

1891
02:58:47,417 --> 02:58:49,751
Maulana, my friend...

1892
02:58:51,796 --> 02:58:54,339
...could I have some orange juice?

1893
02:59:01,222 --> 02:59:02,889
Then you and I...

1894
02:59:03,099 --> 02:59:05,976
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1895
02:59:36,215 --> 02:59:38,425
He will be saying prayers in the garden.

1896
02:59:46,893 --> 02:59:48,727
That is how you eat muli.

1897
02:59:49,604 --> 02:59:51,980
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1898
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:54,566
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1899
02:59:54,776 --> 02:59:58,403
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1900
02:59:59,572 --> 03:00:01,406
Mickey Mouse!

1901
03:00:02,617 --> 03:00:04,618
You're really going to Pakistan?

1902
03:00:09,499 --> 03:00:11,375
You are a stubborn man.

1903
03:00:13,461 --> 03:00:15,420
I'm simply going to prove...

1904
03:00:15,630 --> 03:00:18,215
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

1905
03:00:18,466 --> 03:00:21,677
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1906
03:00:21,928 --> 03:00:24,388
...running around in our own hearts.

1907
03:00:24,972 --> 03:00:28,433
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1908
03:00:28,643 --> 03:00:30,310
Bapu.

1909
03:00:36,067 --> 03:00:40,862
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

1910
03:00:42,490 --> 03:00:44,241
Not a very good one.

1911
03:00:44,450 --> 03:00:47,160
That's why I have so much tolerance...

1912
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:50,622
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1913
03:00:55,044 --> 03:00:56,712
Sardar?

1914
03:00:56,879 --> 03:01:00,382
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1915
03:01:07,056 --> 03:01:09,057
- Enough!
- One more.

1916
03:01:09,392 --> 03:01:12,102
- You're a temptress!
- Just an admirer.

1917
03:01:12,353 --> 03:01:14,479
Nothing's more dangerous...

1918
03:01:14,731 --> 03:01:16,898
...especially for an old man.

1919
03:01:26,367 --> 03:01:28,577
There's a sadness about him.

1920
03:01:30,121 --> 03:01:31,705
He thinks he's failed.

1921
03:01:31,956 --> 03:01:33,373
Why?

1922
03:01:33,624 --> 03:01:37,085
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1923
03:01:38,796 --> 03:01:41,339
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1924
03:01:42,091 --> 03:01:43,383
...but I believe...

1925
03:01:43,634 --> 03:01:45,802
...when we most needed it...

1926
03:01:46,012 --> 03:01:49,181
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

1927
03:01:51,893 --> 03:01:53,226
But he doesn't see it.

1928
03:01:54,187 --> 03:01:56,104
Neither does the world.

1929
03:02:29,597 --> 03:02:31,765
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

1930
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:36,353
Oh, God!

1931
03:02:37,146 --> 03:02:39,105
Oh, God.

1932
03:03:17,812 --> 03:03:19,813
When I despair...

1933
03:03:20,106 --> 03:03:22,023
...I remember...

1934
03:03:22,358 --> 03:03:24,609
...that all through history...

1935
03:03:24,819 --> 03:03:29,322
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1936
03:03:31,158 --> 03:03:34,744
There have been tyrants and murderers...

1937
03:03:34,996 --> 03:03:38,039
...and for a time,
they can seem invincible...

1938
03:03:38,249 --> 03:03:41,668
...but in the end, they always fall.

1939
03:03:43,379 --> 03:03:44,921
Think of it.

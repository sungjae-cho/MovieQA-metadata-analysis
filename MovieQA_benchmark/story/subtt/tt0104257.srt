1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,726
Captain, I'd like to request that
it be me who's the attorney...

3
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,197
That it be myself who's assigned...

4
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,441
No, that it be I who am assigned...

5
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:40,285
That it be I who am assigned?
That's confidence inspiring!

6
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,240
Good grammar, there!

7
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:55,604
- Lieutenant Commander Galloway.
- Captain West is expecting you.

8
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,760
Jo, come on in.

9
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:07,559
Lt. Commander Galloway.
You know Commander Lawrence?

10
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,721
- I appreciate you seeing me.
- Will you sit down?

11
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,244
- I'm fine, sir.
- Have a seat!

12
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:19,485
- We've had some trouble in Cuba?
- Yes, sir. Last Friday.

13
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,927
Two Marines, a Corporal Dawson
and a Private Downey...

14
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,963
...entered the barracks room of
a Private Santiago and assaulted him.

15
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:31,519
Santiago died in hospital
an hour later.

16
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,920
Naval Intelligence Service says
the two men...

17
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:40,004
...wanted to stop Santiago naming
Dawson in a fenceline shooting.

18
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,879
- The hearing's at 1600 hours.
- What's the problem?

19
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:49,964
They're both model Marines.
Santiago was a screwup.

20
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,759
- It sounds like a Code Red.
- Christ!

21
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:58,399
I'd like to have them
assigned counsel.

22
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:03,006
Someone who has both
the legal skill...

23
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,882
...and a familiarity
with the military.

24
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,446
I'd like to suggest that
I be the one who that...

25
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:15,524
...that it be me who is assigned
to represent them, myself.

26
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,766
- Why don't you get a cup of coffee?
- I'm fine, sir.

27
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,841
Leave the room, so we can
talk about you behind your back.

28
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,997
I thought Code Reds weren't
going on anymore.

29
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,241
Who knows what goes on at Guantanamo
with the Marines?

30
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,084
We'd better find out before
the rest of the world does.

31
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,678
What about this Commander Galloway?

32
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:50,764
She's been working a desk at Internal
Affairs for a little over a year.

33
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,643
She disposed of three cases
in two years.

34
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,522
Who's she handling? Rosenberg's?

35
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,725
- She's not a litigator.
- But a hell of an investigator...

36
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:03,485
In Internal Affairs, sure. She can
crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best.

37
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,483
I know, I know, all passion,
no street smarts. Bring her back in.

38
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,083
Jo.

39
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,480
- We'll have the defendants moved here.
- Thank you, sir.

40
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,044
And I'll have Division
assign them counsel.

41
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,688
But, not me?

42
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,080
You're too valuable to waste...

43
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:35,561
...on a five-minute plea bargain
and a week's paperwork.

44
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,926
- There might be more involved.
- Don't worry about it.

45
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,922
Division will assign the right man
for the job.

46
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,324
Let's go, let's get two!

47
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,719
Sorry.

48
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,046
Nothing to be sorry about.
Look the ball into your glove.

49
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,805
Keep your eyes open!
Then you'll have a better chance.

50
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:03,679
- Kaffee!
- You seem distraught.

51
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,808
You're stalling
on the McDermott case.

52
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:12,645
We do it now,
or I'll hang him from a yardarm!

53
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:17,724
- Do we hang people from yardarms?
- I don't think so.

54
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,166
Sherby doesn't think
we do that anymore.

55
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,321
I'll charge him with being under
the influence on duty.

56
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,562
You plead guilty, I'll recommend
30 days in the brig.

57
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,359
- It was oregano!
- He thought it was marijuana.

58
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,123
He's a moron. That's not illegal.

59
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,326
I got people to answer to.
I'm gonna charge him!

60
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,520
With possession of a condiment?

61
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:46,520
If you ask for jail time,
I'll file a motion to dismiss.

62
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,566
You won't get it!

63
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,121
I'll file a motion seeking to obtain
an evidentiary ruling in advance...

64
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,724
...then I'll file against
pre-trial confinement.

65
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,119
You'll get three months' paperwork...

66
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,679
...because he smoked
a dime bag of oregano.

67
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:04,085
Let's go! Let's get two!

68
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:09,845
- 20 days in the brig!
- 15 days' restricted duty.

69
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,447
- Why am I agreeing?
- You have wisdom beyond your years.

70
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:23,925
Good morning...
How's the baby, Sam?

71
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,640
- She'll say her first word soon.
- How can you tell?

72
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:33,007
She just looks like
she has something to say.

73
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:34,807
Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

74
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,922
You don't have a good excuse so
I won't force you to tell a bad one.

75
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,048
- Thank you, sir.
- This first one's for you.

76
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,999
You're moving up in the world.
Division wants you.

77
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:52,003
- To do what?
- Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

78
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,729
A Marine Corporal named Dawson
fires a round...

79
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,723
...from his weapon, over the fenceline
and into Cuba.

80
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,199
What's a fenceline?

81
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:06,204
- Wall between good guys and bad guys.
- Teacher's pet.

82
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:11,238
Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigators.

83
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,924
Dawson and another member of
his squad, Private Louden Downey...

84
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,127
...go into Santiago's room,
tie him up...

85
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,485
...stuff a rag down his throat...

86
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,526
...an hour later, he's dead.

87
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:26,199
Attending physician says the rag
was treated with a toxin.

88
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,883
- They poisoned him?
- Not according to them.

89
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,319
- What do they say?
- Not much.

90
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,129
They're being flown up tomorrow.
On Wednesday...

91
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:38,203
...you'll catch a transport down
to Cuba to find out what you can.

92
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,283
In the meantime, go and see
Lt. Commander JoAnne Galloway.

93
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,368
- Any questions?
- I fly at 0600? In the morning?

94
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,080
We'll go by the book,
so I'm assigning co-counsel.

95
00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:02,279
- Any volunteers?
- No. I've a stack of papers to do.

96
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,362
- Work with Kaffee.
- For just four days?

97
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:11,398
Doing various administrative...
things.

98
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:17,439
In other words, no responsibilities?
My kind of case!

99
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,927
Right, but I need that report
by Wednesday.

100
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,689
- Hi!
- Hold on... Hi!

101
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:35,808
Daniel Kaffee.
I was told to meet...

102
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:45,322
...Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

103
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,880
- About a briefing.
- I'll call you back.

104
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:56,486
- You're the attorney?
- Yes, and this is Sam Weinberg.

105
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,722
- I have no responsibilities.
- Have a seat.

106
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:16,242
- Have you been in the Navy long?
- Nine months now.

107
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:21,358
- And when did you graduate?
- A year ago.

108
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,124
- I see.
- Have I done something wrong?

109
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:30,317
When I asked for counsel,
I hoped to be taken seriously.

110
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,083
No offence taken.

111
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:40,280
He's our best litigator. He obtained
44 plea bargains in nine months.

112
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:44,237
- Almost got my steak knives.
- Have you ever been in court?

113
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:50,723
I had my licence suspended...
They need a priest, not a lawyer.

114
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,165
No, they'll need a lawyer.

115
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,642
Dawson's family has been contacted.
Downey just has his aunt.

116
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,007
- Shall I contact her?
- Sure, if you feel like it.

117
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:11,679
You'll be seeing Colonel Jessep.
You've heard of him?

118
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,204
Who hasn't?

119
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:20,160
The papers say he's tipped for
the National Security Council.

120
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:25,687
- Santiago sent these from GITMO.
- That's Guantanamo Bay.

121
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:30,320
He wrote to all the senior officers,
even his senator.

122
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:35,563
He wanted a transfer.
No one listened. Are you with me?

123
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:44,198
Then he offered to trade information
about the shooting for a transfer.

124
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,837
Right. Is that all?

125
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,207
It seems your client had
a motive to kill Santiago.

126
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:55,965
- Got you! And Santiago is... who?
- The victim.

127
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,362
These letters are not flattering
about Marine Corps life?

128
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:06,649
And an investigation might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

129
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,518
- Colonel Jessep...
- 12 years.

130
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:15,080
If they drop "conspiracy" and
"conduct unbecoming".

131
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:20,039
- You haven't done anything yet!
- Impressive, huh?

132
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,487
- You'll have to go deeper.
- Do you have jurisdiction here?

133
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,279
My job is to make sure
you do your job.

134
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,521
So my jurisdiction's in your face.

135
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:38,926
Read the letters.
Report when you return from Cuba.

136
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,561
- Dismissed!
- I always forget that part.

137
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:51,642
He's preoccupied.
He has a baseball game next week.

138
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,246
Tell him not to get cute.
Guantanamo Marines are fanatical.

139
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,958
- About what?
- About being Marines.

140
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:03,519
<i>"My name is PFC William Santiago -</i>

141
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:09,161
<i>- of Rifle Security Company
Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.</i>

142
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,403
<i>I am writing to inform you of my
problems here in Cuba.</i>

143
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:19,643
<i>L've fallen out of runs before,
because of dizziness or nausea.</i>

144
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:25,805
<i>On May 18th, I'd fallen back about
20 yards going down a rocky hill.</i>

145
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:32,488
<i>My sergeant pushed me down the hill,
then I saw all black and fell down.</i>

146
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,800
<i>The hospital said
it was heat exhaustion.</i>

147
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:40,804
<i>I ask your help.
I need a transfer out of RS C.</i>

148
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:45,167
<i>Sincerely, PFC William T. Santiago,
US Marines. "</i>

149
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:49,163
<i>"PS: In ex change for my transfer, -</i>

150
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,198
<i>- I have information about
the shooting on August 2nd. "</i>

151
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:59,287
Who the fuck is
PFC William T. Santiago?

152
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,327
He's in 2nd Platoon Bravo, sir.

153
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:06,528
Apparently he's not happy here
at Shangri-la.

154
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:11,285
He's asked everyone but
Santa Claus for a transfer.

155
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,762
Now he's telling tales about a
fenceline shooting. Matthew?

156
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:22,401
- I'm appalled, sir.
- You're appalled.

157
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:28,483
This kid ratted on a member of his
unit, to say nothing of the fact -

158
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,997
- that he's a US Marine
who can't run without collapsing.

159
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:41,165
- What is going on in Bravo company?
- Can we discuss it in private?

160
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:45,208
I can handle this situation, sir.

161
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:50,363
Like you handled Curtis Bell?
Don't interrupt, I'm your superior!

162
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:57,321
And I'm yours, Matthew.
What are we going to do about this?

163
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:01,846
- He should be transferred at once.
- He's that bad?

164
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,402
If word of this letter gets out,
he'll get his ass whipped.

165
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:15,681
Transfer Santiago? You're right.
Yes, that's the thing to do.

166
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,248
Wait! I've got a better idea.

167
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,004
Let's transfer the whole squad.

168
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:31,244
No, let's transfer
the whole division off the base.

169
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:36,529
Jon, go and tell the boys
to pack their bags.

170
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,078
Tom!

171
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:44,482
Get me the President. We're
surrendering our position in Cuba.

172
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:51,805
Wait a minute, Tom. Maybe we
should consider this for a second.

173
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:55,006
Dismissed, Tom.

174
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,639
I'm just spit-balling here, -

175
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,519
- but maybe it's our responsibility
to train Santiago?

176
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:08,080
Maybe we have a responsibility
to this country to see -

177
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:13,084
- that those protecting it
are trained professionals.

178
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:16,764
I think I read that somewhere once.

179
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,482
And I'm thinking, Colonel, that your
idea of transferring Santiago, -

180
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:26,721
- while expeditious and painless, -

181
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:32,009
- might not be quite
the American way?

182
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,287
Santiago stays where he is.

183
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:41,443
We're going to train the lad.
Jon, you're in charge.

184
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:48,082
If Santiago doesn't get 4.6, 4.6
in his next proficiency report, -

185
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:53,084
- I'm going to blame you.
And then I'll kill you.

186
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:56,878
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

187
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,088
Matthew, I think
I'll have that word in private now.

188
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:07,518
That's all. Meet me at the "O" Club.
We'll talk about William's training.

189
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:12,046
- I'll welcome your suggestions.
- Dismissed.

190
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,721
Matthew, sit down. Please.

191
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,002
- What do you think of Kendrick?
- I don't think my opinion...

192
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,161
I think he's a bit of a weasel.

193
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:37,404
But he's a very good officer, and
we agree on how to do our job.

194
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:44,407
Our business is saving lives.
We have to take that seriously.

195
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:51,042
I believe that if we transfer a
Marine who is not up to the job, -

196
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:57,318
- we put lives in danger.
Sit down, Matthew.

197
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:13,002
We went to the Academy together,
served in Vietnam together.

198
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,801
But I've been promoted with
more speed and success than you.

199
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:24,680
If that causes you tension or
embarrassment, I don't give a shit.

200
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,923
Our business is saving lives,
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

201
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:35,641
Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

202
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:58,043
All the paperwork's in order.
Step over there.

203
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:07,002
- Hal, is this Washington D.C.?
- All right, let's move.

204
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,447
I wanted to talk to you
about Dawson and Downey.

205
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,158
- Say again?
- Dawson and Downey.

206
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:28,959
- The names seem familiar, but...
- Your clients?

207
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:32,201
The Cuba thing! Oh yeah, right.

208
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,123
I've done something wrong again.

209
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,885
Why are they sitting in jail
while you're hitting a ball?

210
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:49,083
- We need to practice.
- That wasn't funny.

211
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:54,243
Would you be insulted
if I recommended another counsel?

212
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,560
- Why?
- I don't think you're up to it.

213
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:04,045
You don't even know me! It usually
takes people hours to find that out.

214
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,727
That was funny!

215
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,687
You're wrong. I do know you.

216
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:21,162
Daniel Alistair Kaffee,
born June 8th, 1964, in Boston.

217
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:27,677
Son of Lionel Kaffee, former
Attorney-General, died 1985.

218
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:33,048
You went to Harvard, then joined the
Navy, because your father wanted it.

219
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:39,762
You're just treading water here
until you get a real job.

220
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,160
But that's fine, I won't tell.

221
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:48,164
But if you handle this case in your
usual slick manner, -

222
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:51,844
- then something's gonna get missed.

223
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,958
I can't let Dawson and Downey
sit in jail -

224
00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:01,407
- because you chose
the path of least resistance.

225
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,599
Wow!
I'm sexually aroused, Commander!

226
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:13,719
I don't think it was murder.
There was no intent.

227
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:18,280
Santiago asphyxiated
from acute lactic acidosis.

228
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:24,968
It was suggestive of poison.
Whatever that means, it sounds bad.

229
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,321
When he died, the doctor
didn't know the reason.

230
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:37,407
- Two hours later, he said poison.
- Was it Prof. Plumb in the library?

231
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,924
I'll see your supervisor.

232
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:45,527
He's in the big white house
with the pillars.

233
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:52,128
I don't think you'll have much luck.
Division must think I'm good.

234
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:57,886
I appreciate your interest and
enthusiasm, but I can handle things.

235
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:01,883
Do you know what a Code Red is?

236
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:07,359
What a pity.

237
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,805
Officer on deck, ten-hut!

238
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:25,406
Corporal Dawson, sir!
RS C Company Windward!

239
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:30,165
You haven't been "working
well with others", Harold!

240
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,039
PFC Louden Downey, sir!

241
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,885
I'm Daniel Kaffee,
this is Sam Weinberg. Sit down.

242
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,320
This your signature? Don't say "sir".
Is this yours?

243
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,528
- Sir, yes, sir!
- At least don't say it twice.

244
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:59,319
- What's a Code Red?
- It's a disciplinary action.

245
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:03,198
If a Marine falls out of line,
the others get him on track.

246
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,566
- What's the garden variety?
- Sir?

247
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:12,759
You say "sir" and I look for
my father. Danny, Daniel Kaffee.

248
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,921
What's a typical Code Red?

249
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:21,038
If a Marine won't bathe,
the men give him a GI shower.

250
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:26,203
- And what's that?
- Scrub brushes, steel wool.

251
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:30,521
Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

252
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,407
Does he ever talk?

253
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:43,359
He will answer any direct question.

254
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,400
- Was there poison on the rag?
- No, sir.

255
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:54,120
- Turpentine, antifreeze?
- We were going to shave his head.

256
00:25:54,289 --> 00:26:00,046
- When suddenly...
- Blood was dripping down his mouth.

257
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:06,557
There was blood all over his face,
so Dawson called the ambulance.

258
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:11,325
- Did anyone see you call it?
- No, sir.

259
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,842
- Were you there when it arrived?
- Yes, and we were arrested.

260
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:24,357
Did you on Aug. 2nd fire a shot
across the fenceline into Cuba?

261
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:28,408
Yes, sir. My mirror engaged, sir.

262
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:35,441
Every American sentry has
a Cuban counterpart. His "mirror".

263
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:40,524
Santiago's letter says
you fired illegally.

264
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:45,843
He says the "mirror"
never made a move.

265
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:54,483
Harold...?
You see what I'm getting at?

266
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:58,005
Why else would you
give him a Code Red?

267
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,243
He broke the chain of command.
He went outside his unit.

268
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:07,880
He should have spoken to me first,
then his sergeant...

269
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,280
All right.
Did you intend to kill Santiago?

270
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:15,727
- No, sir, to train him!
- Train him to do what?

271
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:20,087
To think of his unit before himself.
To respect the code.

272
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,958
- What's the code?
- Unit, Corps, God, Country!

273
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:29,647
- Pardon?
- Unit, Corps, God, Country... sir.

274
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:51,005
The government
wants to charge you with murder.

275
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:56,368
You want me to tell the prosecutor
'Unit, Corps, God, Country'?

276
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:00,522
That's our code, sir.

277
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:06,566
That's your code.
We'll be back.

278
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:12,520
- You need anything? Books, papers?
- No, thank you, sir!

279
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:16,477
There's a concept
you'd better get used to.

280
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,244
- Sir?
- I'm the only friend you've got.

281
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,998
- Welcome to the big time!
- You think so?

282
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,798
I hope you're better at law
than at softball.

283
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:47,919
Unfortunately I play softball best.
I'm off to Cuba, Janelle!

284
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,365
Say hi to Castro for me.

285
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,125
If they plead guilty
they get 20 years and serve half.

286
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:02,000
- 12. They called the ambulance.
- They killed a Marine.

287
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,128
The lab says maybe
the rag was poisoned.

288
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,567
The Chief of Internal Medicine
says he's sure.

289
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:15,519
- What do you know about Code Reds?
- Oh, man...

290
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,964
Are we off the record?

291
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:24,759
You'll get the 12 years.
But you should know -

292
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:32,688
- Lieutenant Kendrick specifically
told the men not to touch Santiago.

293
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,364
- We playing hoops tomorrow?
- Do we have a deal?

294
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,760
I'll talk to you when I get back.

295
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:49,844
- Any luck getting me replaced?
- Everyone's your friend.

296
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:55,242
Listen, I came to make peace.
What do you say, friends?

297
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,606
I took Downey
the comic books he wanted.

298
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,523
He hardly knows
why he's been arrested.

299
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:06,967
- Look, Commander...
- Call me JoAnne. Or Jo.

300
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:12,567
You contact them again,
I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

301
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:19,919
I had authorization
from Ginny Miller, his aunt.

302
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:25,280
- Aunt Ginny authorized you?
- I called her.

303
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:30,045
- We spoke for an hour.
- You were authorized by Aunt Ginny.

304
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:34,999
- It's within my province.
- We can hold the trial in her barn.

305
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,401
I'll sew the costumes,
Uncle Goober can be judge.

306
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:45,761
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

307
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,764
"And the hits just keep on coming".

308
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:14,324
- How's it going, Luther?
- Another day, another dollar.

309
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:18,960
- Play as they lay.
- What goes around comes around.

310
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:24,044
- I got my health.
- You got everything. See you!

311
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,962
Not if I see you first.

312
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:32,401
You're my witness: The baby spoke.
She said a word.

313
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:39,202
- She made a sound.
- Come on! It was definitely a word.

314
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:44,238
You heard her.
She pointed and said "Pa".

315
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:50,723
- She was pointing at a mailbox.
- Yes. "Pa! Look, a mailbox".

316
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:04,087
- Jack Ross offered me the 12 years.
- That's what you wanted, right?

317
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:10,927
- I mean... I guess I'll take it.
- So...?

318
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:17,847
- It took about 45 seconds.
- Take the 12 years, it's a gift.

319
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:22,002
You don't believe them.
You think they should get life.

320
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:27,846
I believe every word of their story,
and I think they should get life.

321
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,205
See you tomorrow.

322
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,442
- Don't forget to wear the whites!
- I don't like them.

323
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:41,919
We're going to Cuba.
You got Dramamine?

324
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:46,924
- That keeps you cool?
- No, but you get airsick.

325
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:51,765
It's because I'm afraid of crashing.
Dramamine won't help.

326
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:56,807
I got some oregano,
I hear that works.

327
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,402
Ross said a strange thing,
just before I left.

328
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:08,485
He said Lt. Kendrick had told
the men not to touch Santiago.

329
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:14,997
- So?
- I don't even know who Kendrick is.

330
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:20,718
What the hell. See you tomorrow.

331
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:01,608
I'm Corporal Barnes, I'll escort you
to the Windward side of the base.

332
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:06,479
I have camouflage jackets,
I suggest you wear them.

333
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,721
We're going close to the fenceline.

334
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:15,600
If the Cubans see an officer in
white they might take a shot.

335
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:18,283
Good call, Sam.

336
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,237
We'll just take the ferry.

337
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,322
- We're taking a boat?
- Across the bay.

338
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:36,088
No one mentioned a boat.
I'm just not crazy about them.

339
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:43,360
- Jesus Christ, you're in the Navy!
- Nobody likes her very much.

340
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:59,884
Nathan Jessep. Come on in.

341
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,927
Daniel Kaffee, attorney.

342
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:06,365
Lt. Commander
JoAnne Galloway.

343
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:10,727
Observing and evaluating.
Lt. Weinberg, my assistant.

344
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:17,237
This is Colonel Markinson,
and Platoon Leader Lt. Kendrick.

345
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,684
Lieutenant Kaffee.

346
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:24,081
I met your father once.
He spoke at my high school.

347
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:28,925
- Lionel Kaffee?
- Yes, sir.

348
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:33,367
Jon, this man's dad
once made a lot of enemies.

349
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,999
Jefferson versus
Madison County School District.

350
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:41,367
They didn't want a black girl
in a white school.

351
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:45,124
Lionel Kaffee said,
"We'll see about that".

352
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:51,728
- How the hell is your dad, Danny?
- He passed away seven years ago.

353
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:57,043
- Don't I feel like an asshole!
- Not at all, sir.

354
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:02,283
- What can we do for you, Danny?
- Not much, sir.

355
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:06,840
This is really just a formality.

356
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:12,845
- They insist we interview everyone.
- JAG Corps can be demanding.

357
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:20,802
Jon'll show you what you want to
see, then we can meet for lunch.

358
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,039
You met with the men that afternoon.
What did you say?

359
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:37,565
I told them we had an informer, -

360
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:42,678
- but that Private Santiago
was not to be harmed.

361
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:46,285
- What time was that?
- 1600.

362
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:49,486
That's four o'clock.

363
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:43,407
We should make sure somebody
gets this to his parents.

364
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:48,887
- Lt. Kendrick, may I call you Jon?
- No.

365
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,122
- Have I offended you?
- No, I like all you Navy boys.

366
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:58,443
When we have to fight,
you fellas always give us a ride.

367
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,521
Do you think he was murdered?

368
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:06,479
I believe in God and Jesus Christ,
so I'll say this:

369
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:10,039
Santiago's death is a tragedy.

370
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:16,444
But he died because he had no code,
and no honour. And God was watching.

371
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,638
- How do you feel about that theory?
- Sounds good.

372
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:28,167
Are you going to investigate,
or just take the guided tour?

373
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,889
I'm pacing myself.

374
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:36,243
They ran around
looking for something white to wave.

375
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:40,561
Some of them surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

376
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:47,043
Walk softly and carry an armoured
tank division, I always say.

377
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:50,087
That was delicious.

378
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:56,358
- I do have to ask some questions.
- Shoot!

379
00:38:56,529 --> 00:39:02,923
An NIS agent told you that Santiago
knew about a fenceline shooting.

380
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:09,119
Santiago was going to say who did it
in exchange for a transfer.

381
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:16,000
If you feel there are any details
I'm missing, tell me.

382
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,720
Thank you.

383
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:31,129
You called Colonel Markinson and
Lt. Kendrick into your office. And?

384
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:36,761
We agreed that for his own safety
he should be transferred.

385
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:40,683
Santiago was set to be transferred?

386
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:45,479
On the first flight to the States.
0600 next morning.

387
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,437
Five hours too late, it turned out.

388
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:55,808
All right, that's all.
Thanks very much for your time.

389
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,757
The corporal will drive you back.

390
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:04,002
- Wait, I've got some questions.
- No, you don't. No!

391
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:09,124
On the morning of the death,
did you meet Dr. Stone?

392
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:15,637
- Of course. One of my men was dead.
- You see? He was dead. Let's go.

393
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:22,044
- Have you ever heard of Code Red?
- I've heard the term, yes.

394
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:27,681
In February, you received a memo
from the Fleet Commander -

395
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,320
- warning against enlisted men
disciplining their own?

396
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:40,726
Whoever wrote that memo has never
looked down a Cuban AK-47 rifle.

397
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:47,647
However, I gave it due attention.
What is your point, Jo?

398
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:52,200
She has no point,
it's part of her charm. Goodbye!

399
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:57,682
My point is that I think
Code Reds still go on. Do they?

400
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:00,079
- He doesn't need to answer that.
- Yes, he does.

401
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:03,685
- No, he really doesn't.
- Yeah, he really does.

402
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,208
Colonel?

403
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:14,888
You know, it just hit me.
She outranks you, Danny!

404
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:18,325
I want to tell you something.
Listen well.

405
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,208
You're a very lucky man.

406
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:28,207
There is nothing sexier then a woman
you have to salute in the morning.

407
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,966
Promote 'em all, I say!

408
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:36,361
If you've never had a blowjob
from a superior officer, -

409
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:44,004
- you've missed the best in life.
- Code Reds are still condoned here?

410
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:49,926
But I'll just take cold showers
till they elect some gal president.

411
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:55,768
- I need an answer to my question.
- Watch your tone, Commander.

412
00:41:55,929 --> 00:42:01,799
I'm a fair guy, but this
fucking heat makes me crazy.

413
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:09,162
You asked me about Code Reds.
On the record, I discourage it.

414
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:14,084
Off the record,
it's an invaluable part of training.

415
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:20,802
If it goes on without my knowledge,
so be it. That's how I run my unit.

416
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:25,247
If you want to investigate me,
take your chances.

417
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,766
I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kill me.

418
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:37,279
So don't think you can come
down here and make me nervous.

419
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,520
Let's go.

420
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:50,358
Colonel, I just need a copy
of the transfer order.

421
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:55,239
Santiago's transfer order.
For the file.

422
00:42:55,409 --> 00:43:00,039
- For the file?
- Yeah.

423
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:07,684
Of course you can have a copy.
I'm here to help any way I can.

424
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:13,845
You believe that, don't you, Danny?
That I'll help any way I can?

425
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:22,007
The corporal will take you by
Personnel and get it for you.

426
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:28,082
But you have to ask me nicely.

427
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:32,879
- I beg your pardon?
- You have to ask me nicely.

428
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:38,965
I can take bullets, bombs and blood.
I don't want money or medals.

429
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:45,477
What I do want is for you, with your
faggoty uniform and Harvard mouth, -

430
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:49,961
- to extend me
some fucking courtesy.

431
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:54,961
You got to ask me nicely.

432
00:43:56,489 --> 00:44:02,644
Colonel Jessep, I'd like
a copy of the transfer order. Sir.

433
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:08,322
No problem.

434
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:51,725
- Who is it?
- It's me.

435
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:56,882
I've really missed you.
It's been three hours...

436
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:02,601
Markinson's disappeared.
He's gone U.A. Unauthorized Absence.

437
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:06,967
- When?
- This afternoon, after we left.

438
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:11,361
- I'll find him in the morning.
- I've already tried.

439
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:17,808
You're close to "interfering
with a government investigation".

440
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:24,044
I'm Louden Downey's attorney now.
Aunt Ginny feels like she knows me.

441
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:28,521
So I suggested that I get more
directly involved with the case.

442
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:31,886
She had Louden sign the papers
an hour ago.

443
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:36,088
You're not making this up
just to bother me?

444
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:41,084
- You're still lead counsel.
- Splendid.

445
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:47,484
I think Kendrick ordered the
Code Red, and so do you.

446
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,120
Ten-hut!

447
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:58,443
Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
Not: "Did you clean the latrine?"

448
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:03,888
Did Lt. Kendrick order you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

449
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:06,324
Yes, sir.

450
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:10,164
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

451
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:17,846
- Why didn't you say so before?
- You didn't ask us, sir.

452
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:22,560
I get paid, no matter how long
you spend in jail.

453
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:26,802
- I know you do, sir.
- Fuck you, Harold!

454
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:32,126
At ease. Let's sort this thing out.

455
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,406
There was a platoon meeting
on September 6th.

456
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:40,165
Lt. Kendrick says he told you
nothing was to happen to Santiago.

457
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:45,357
Is this true?
I want you to speak freely.

458
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:52,287
That's correct.
But then he dismissed the platoon.

459
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:57,318
- What happened then?
- Lt. Kendrick came to our room.

460
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:02,882
About five minutes after the
meeting broke. About 16.20.

461
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:05,324
And then?

462
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,607
Lt. Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

463
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:15,361
Jack!
They were given an order.

464
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:23,483
- Jack...
- I'll be right back.

465
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:30,407
- Did you know about the order?
- Jo Galloway: Downey's lawyer.

466
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:33,561
- What are you accusing me of?
- Did you?

467
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:38,359
He didn't know,
or he would have had to tell us.

468
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:43,922
Now our clients might plead not
guilty and say they were ordered.

469
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:47,081
Kendrick told them
not to touch Santiago.

470
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:50,798
And then he told Dawson and Downey
to give him a Code Red.

471
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:52,926
- Kendrick's lying.
- You have proof?

472
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:57,447
23 Marines and a highly decorated
lieutenant disagree.

473
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,520
- Why did Markinson go U. A?
- You'll never know.

474
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:02,567
- I can't subpoena Markinson?
- You won't find him.

475
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:07,837
You know what Markinson did
for 17 years? Counterintelligence.

476
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:12,127
Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

477
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,601
Look, Danny,
Jessep's star is on the rise.

478
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:21,843
Division wants to spare him
and the Corps any embarrassment.

479
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:26,239
I'll knock it down to involuntary
manslaughter. Two years.

480
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,524
No, we're going to court.

481
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,600
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

482
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:35,606
You'll lose. And if we go to court,
I'll have to go all the way:

483
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:40,320
Murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

484
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:45,119
Danny's got me by the balls here,
but not in the courtroom.

485
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:51,808
He doesn't want to see them get life
if they could be home in six months.

486
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:57,477
That's the end of this negotiation.
See you at the arraignment.

487
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:08,088
Here's the story: They're offering
involuntary manslaughter. Two years.

488
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:10,080
You'll be home in six months.

489
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:19,038
Wow! You're the greatest lawyer in
the world! How can we thank you?

490
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:24,841
Did you hear what I just said?
You'll be home in six months.

491
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:27,045
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

492
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:28,358
Do what?

493
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:31,806
- We can't make a deal.
- What are you talking about?

494
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:37,925
We did nothing but our job.
I'll accept the consequences.

495
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:41,445
But I won't say I'm guilty, sir.

496
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:46,478
- Did she put you up to this?
- We have a code, sir.

497
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:51,518
You and your code plead not guilty.
You'll be in jail for life.

498
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:55,523
Do what I say,
and you'll be home in six months.

499
00:49:55,689 --> 00:50:00,683
Do it, Harold.
Six months, it's nothing!

500
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:06,837
- Permission to...
- Speak! Jesus!

501
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:14,886
What do we do then? After six months
we'll be dishonourably discharged.

502
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:19,406
- Probably.
- What do we do then, sir?

503
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:27,447
We joined the Marines because
we wanted to live by a certain code.

504
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:32,842
You're asking us to say we have no
honour, that we're not Marines!

505
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:37,048
If what we did was wrong,
I'll accept my punishment.

506
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:42,647
But I believe I did my job. I will
not dishonour myself, my unit -

507
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:47,724
- or the Corps,
so that I can go home in six months.

508
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,483
Sir!

509
00:50:56,169 --> 00:51:02,199
I'd like to talk to Corporal Dawson
alone for a minute.

510
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:03,484
Sergeant!

511
00:51:06,649 --> 00:51:10,881
- We'd like to go to another room.
- Sit down.

512
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:24,045
You don't like me very much,
do you?

513
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:29,601
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

514
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:39,358
You know...
Downey worships you.

515
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:44,999
He'll do whatever you do.

516
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:49,560
Are you going to let this
happen to him because of a code?

517
00:51:49,729 --> 00:51:53,404
Do you think we were right?
Do you?

518
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:57,801
I think you'd lose.

519
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:04,238
You're such a coward.
I can't believe you're in uniform.

520
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:07,082
I won't be responsible for this.

521
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:13,239
If you go to Leavenworth for life,
I don't give a shit!

522
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:18,881
What about saluting
an officer when he leaves the room?

523
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:33,401
I don't believe it!
He's going to jail to spite me!

524
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:37,482
If he wants to jump off a cliff,
that's his business.

525
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:41,767
- How do I get him a new lawyer?
- At the arraignment.

526
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:46,002
Just tell the judge
you want new counsel assigned.

527
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:48,928
That's that.

528
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:54,080
One thing, though.
Be sure and ask nicely.

529
00:52:55,249 --> 00:53:00,607
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to make an argument.

530
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:05,320
That didn't help Calley at My Lai,
or the Nazis at Nuremburg.

531
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:08,561
Do you think that's the same -

532
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:14,008
- as two teenagers executing an
order they didn't think would harm?

533
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:18,845
Don't look now,
but you're making an argument.

534
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:22,160
I'll get them a new attorney.

535
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:26,368
What are you afraid of?
You father's expectations?

536
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:33,207
Spare me the psychobabble!
They'll just have another lawyer.

537
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:37,487
They need you.
You know how to win.

538
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:41,961
If you walk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

539
00:53:42,129 --> 00:53:45,326
Their fate was sealed
when Santiago died.

540
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:50,040
- Do they have a case?
- You and Dawson are dreamers.

541
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:53,918
It's not what I believe,
but what I can prove.

542
00:53:54,089 --> 00:54:00,722
So, don't tell me what I know
or don't know. I know the law!

543
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:07,362
You're just a used-car salesman.

544
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:14,241
An ambulance-chaser with a rank.
You're nothing. Live with that.

545
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:24,887
So I told Duncan, " If you want me
to take this to court, -

546
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:28,405
- you'll get a year's paperwork -

547
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:32,847
- because a 90-year-old
misread the Insurance Code."

548
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:36,843
Fifteen minutes later,
he makes a deal.

549
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:25,168
All rise.

550
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:35,805
<i>- Where are we?
- Docket nr. 411275 VRl5.</i>

551
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:40,724
The United States versus Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey.

552
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:46,327
The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

553
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:50,846
Does the defence
wish to enter a plea?

554
00:55:55,129 --> 00:56:02,001
- They're not guilty.
- Enter a plea of "not guilty".

555
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:08,642
Adjourned until 10.00, three weeks
from today, when we will reconvene.

556
00:56:24,169 --> 00:56:31,564
Why would a lieutenant with so
little experience get a murder case?

557
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:38,808
Would it be, so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

558
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:45,044
We'll work at my apartment.
Jo, bring legal pads and pens.

559
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:48,599
Sam, start a medical profile.

560
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:52,808
Jo, get Dawson's, Downey's
and Santiago's conduct reports.

561
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:58,919
I've only got Yoo-hoo and Cocoa
Puffs, so bring your own food.

562
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:09,564
So this is
what a courtroom looks like!

563
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:20,445
Did you speak
to your friend at the NIS?

564
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:25,444
She said, if Markinson doesn't
want to be found, he won't be.

565
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,966
I could be Markinson,
and you wouldn't know.

566
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:34,042
- Are you Markinson?
- No.

567
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:39,044
I'm not Markinson.
That's two down.

568
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,880
What?

569
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:49,558
Now that JoAnne's on this...
Do you still need me?

570
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:52,118
- They were ordered, Sam.
- An illegal order.

571
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:54,524
You think Dawson and Downey
knew it was illegal?

572
00:57:54,769 --> 00:58:00,082
- Any decent person would have...
- They can't question orders.

573
00:58:00,249 --> 00:58:04,686
What's the secret?
I give orders nobody obeys!

574
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:10,719
We have softball and marching bands.
They risk getting shot at.

575
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:22,122
I need you.
You're better at research than I am.

576
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:26,601
And you know
how to prepare a witness.

577
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:35,083
I've got medical reports
and Chinese food. Let's eat first.

578
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:43,440
What?

579
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:48,399
Got any kung pao chicken?

580
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:54,685
They can't prove there was poison.
Code Reds are normal at Guantanamo.

581
00:58:54,849 --> 00:59:00,128
And there was an order. Kendrick
gave it, they had no choice.

582
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:04,646
- What about their motive?
- That doesn't make them guilty.

583
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:07,847
We'll deal with that later.

584
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:13,083
We must show that Santiago could
have died from something else.

585
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:17,447
Jo, find out all about
lactic acidosis.

586
00:59:17,609 --> 00:59:24,003
This is Lt. Galloway, I'm trying
to find a Lt. Col Markinson...

587
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:28,924
Doctor, was there any sign
of injury? Scrapes? Cuts?

588
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:33,441
Bruises? Broken bones?
Any sign of violence?

589
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:37,602
- Other than the dead body?
- I always walk into that.

590
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:42,160
He ordered me and Dawson
to give Willy a Code Red.

591
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:48,564
The answers must come faster.
It's like he's searching for it.

592
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:54,884
And call him Private Santiago.
Willy is someone with a mother.

593
00:59:55,969 --> 01:00:01,327
The jury has seven men and two
women. All experienced officers.

594
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:04,327
The women have no children.
Too bad.

595
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:08,368
A jury trial
is about assigning blame.

596
01:00:08,529 --> 01:00:15,321
Santiago's dead. They want to know
who's to blame. We say, Kendrick.

597
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:20,847
This won't be won by the law,
but by the lawyers. So, poker faces.

598
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:26,003
If something goes wrong,
don't hang your head or scribble.

599
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:29,684
Look like you expected it.

600
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:34,445
- Pass me documents...
- "Swiftly, and don't look anxious".

601
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:38,727
That perfume
wrecks my concentration.

602
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:42,245
I was talking to Sam.

603
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:46,800
- What time is it?
- Time to go home and sleep.

604
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:50,598
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

605
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:57,921
- You're a good man, Charlie Brown.
- See you in court, counsellor.

606
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:06,285
I know. We've had our differences.

607
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:10,920
We both said things we didn't mean.

608
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:17,119
If you've gained some respect
for me, I'm happy about that.

609
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:21,407
But it's no big deal.
You needn't say you like me.

610
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:26,520
I was just going to tell you
to wear matching socks.

611
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:29,681
Okay. Good tip.

612
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:35,648
- We're ready.
- You'd better believe it.

613
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:46,727
We're gonna get creamed.

614
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:21,203
- You are gonna save our son?
- I'll do my best.

615
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:25,647
Danny,
meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

616
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:29,527
You're Aunt Ginny?

617
01:02:30,569 --> 01:02:35,404
- I was expecting someone older.
- So was I.

618
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:42,363
- Last chance. I'll flip you for it.
- All rise.

619
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,519
Too late.

620
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:57,366
All having business with this
court martial, stand forward.

621
01:02:57,529 --> 01:03:00,726
Colonel Julius Randolph presiding.

622
01:03:00,969 --> 01:03:06,168
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

623
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:15,563
On September 6th, the accused
entered P.F.C. Santiago's room.

624
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:20,803
They woke him, tied him,
and forced a rag into his throat.

625
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:26,487
A reaction called lactic acidosis
caused his lungs to bleed.

626
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:31,928
He drowned in his own blood,
and was dead at 00.37 a.m.

627
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:36,844
These are
the undisputed facts of the case.

628
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:42,037
What I've just told you
is exactly what you will hear -

629
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:46,600
- from Corporal Dawson
and Private Downey.

630
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:51,604
We will also show that
they soaked the rag in poison, -

631
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:56,889
- and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kill.

632
01:03:57,049 --> 01:04:02,203
Lt. Kaffee is going to try
and work a little magic here.

633
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:07,887
He'll try a little misdirection.
Astonishing stories of rituals.

634
01:04:08,049 --> 01:04:13,999
Dazzle you with official-sounding
terms like "Code Red".

635
01:04:14,169 --> 01:04:17,320
He may even try to cut
into a few officers.

636
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:21,801
He has no evidence,
but it'll be entertaining.

637
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:27,885
But in the end, all this magic
will not obscure the fact -

638
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:34,682
- that Willy Santiago is dead,
and Dawson and Downey killed him.

639
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:41,322
- These are the undisputed facts.
- Lt. Kaffee.

640
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:48,725
It is futile to try and prove that
there was poison or intent to kill.

641
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:54,282
Dawson and Downey didn't go to
Santiago seeking vengeance.

642
01:04:54,489 --> 01:05:01,600
And they weren't looking for kicks.
They were ordered to do it.

643
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:06,560
I'll say that again:
They were ordered to do it.

644
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:13,165
In the real world, or here in
Washington, that doesn't mean much.

645
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:19,006
But if you're a Marine
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, -

646
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:22,445
- you follow orders,
or you pack your bags.

647
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:30,960
Dawson and Downey are sitting here
because they did their job.

648
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:41,087
- Call the first witness.
- We call Mr. R.C. McGuire.

649
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:47,405
Raise your right hand, please.

650
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:52,962
Will you tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?

651
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:56,246
I do.

652
01:05:56,449 --> 01:05:59,521
State your name and occupation.

653
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,887
Robert C. McGuire,
Special Agent, NIS.

654
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:10,158
Did you receive a letter from PFC
Santiago on the 3rd of September?

655
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:12,160
- We did.
- What did it say?

656
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:16,960
That a member of the unit had shot
across the fenceline.

657
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:19,120
Was he named?

658
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:24,443
No. I told Colonel Jessep that I
would be coming down to investigate.

659
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:26,162
And what did you find?

660
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:31,159
Only one sentry
had a bullet missing.

661
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:36,084
- Who was that?
- Corporal Harold Dawson.

662
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:45,407
- What did Dawson say about this?
- That he was engaged by the enemy.

663
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:48,208
- But you don't believe him?
- It's not...

664
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:52,521
Why was Dawson never charged?

665
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:59,966
- There wasn't enough evidence.
- Thank you.

666
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:06,921
Why was there not enough evidence?
You had the letter.

667
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:13,322
Santiago was the only eyewitness.
I had no chance to interview him.

668
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:18,517
- And now we'll never know, right?
- No.

669
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:23,808
- No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

670
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:32,479
Corporal Carl Hammaker,
RS C Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.

671
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:39,122
Were you present at a meeting held
by Lt. Kendrick on September 6th?

672
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,964
- Yes, sir.
- What was said there?

673
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:46,121
Lt. Kendrick told us
we had an informer.

674
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:51,568
That Santiago had reported to the
NIS on a member of our platoon.

675
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:57,201
- Did that make you mad? Truthfully?
- Yes, sir.

676
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:02,159
- How mad?
- Santiago betrayed our code.

677
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,843
- Were other men also angry?
- Objection. Speculation.

678
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:06,602
Were Dawson and Downey?

679
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:11,923
Objection! The witness is asked
how my clients felt on Sept. 6th.

680
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,559
Sustained.

681
01:08:15,729 --> 01:08:19,119
Did Lieutenant Kendrick give you
a standing order at that meeting?

682
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:21,519
- Yes, sir.
- What was it?

683
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:26,846
He said, not to take
matters into our own hands.

684
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:33,482
- What was the order?
- Santiago wasn't to be touched.

685
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:37,603
Your witness.

686
01:08:37,769 --> 01:08:41,205
Were you in Dawson and Downey's
room five minutes later?

687
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:42,723
No, sir.

688
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:47,526
- Thanks. No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

689
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:53,638
Corporal Raymond Thomas.

690
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:59,167
Captain Ross is planning to call
the entire platoon.

691
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:05,205
The platoon leader's instructions
are relevant testimony.

692
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:10,079
The defence concedes that all 22
will confirm Hammaker's account.

693
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:15,846
But none of them were in
Dawson and Downey's room at 16.20.

694
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:20,241
- Captain?
- The government will concede that.

695
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:24,004
Then we will adjourn. You can
call your next witness tomorrow.

696
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:25,927
All rise.

697
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:39,723
- Let's go over the doctor again.
- It's the right approach.

698
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,607
We've been over this already.

699
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:45,398
At 3.00 a.m., he didn't know
what killed Santiago.

700
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:50,085
But after he met Jessep, he said
it was poison. He's lying.

701
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:54,765
Great! We can say,
"Liar, liar, pants on fire".

702
01:09:54,929 --> 01:10:00,925
We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have.

703
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:12,724
Private Santiago was hospitalized
at 00.12, -

704
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:16,518
- and was pronounced dead at 00.37.

705
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:19,840
Doctor, what is lactic acidosis?

706
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:25,037
It arises if the muscles and cells
burn sugar instead of oxygen.

707
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:28,519
It caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.

708
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:33,843
How long does it take, before
the muscles start burning sugar?

709
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:40,047
- 20 to 30 minutes.
- What made it faster with Santiago?

710
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:45,158
- Some kind of poison.
- The witness is speculating!

711
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:49,641
He is an expert medical witness.
It is not speculation.

712
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:55,202
He is not a criminologist.
The medical facts are inconclusive.

713
01:10:55,369 --> 01:11:01,842
But I'm sure you don't mind
if we admit his opinion now.

714
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:05,445
Not at all, sir.

715
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:11,718
- Was Willy Santiago poisoned?
- Absolutely.

716
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:15,564
But you know that the coroner's
report shows no trace of poison?

717
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:18,124
- Yes, I am.
- How do you justify...

718
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:23,727
There are dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectable.

719
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:29,964
The nature of the acidosis
is the compelling factor here.

720
01:11:31,889 --> 01:11:39,364
Could a person have a condition
that could speed up acidosis?

721
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:45,518
- Is it possible?
- It's possible.

722
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:48,999
What might
some of those conditions be?

723
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:54,368
A coronary disorder
would make it more rapid.

724
01:11:54,529 --> 01:12:00,081
If I had a coronary condition and
someone stuffed a rag in my mouth, -

725
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:04,606
- would I still burn sugar
after the rag was taken out?

726
01:12:04,769 --> 01:12:07,442
If it was very serious.

727
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:11,727
Could such a condition have
such mild initial symptoms, -

728
01:12:11,889 --> 01:12:15,962
- that a routine examination
might not reveal them?

729
01:12:16,129 --> 01:12:21,203
- There would still be symptoms.
- What kind?

730
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:26,204
Chest pains?
Shortness of breath? Fatigue?

731
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:29,247
Of course.

732
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:37,606
- Is this your signature?
- Yes, it is.

733
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:41,921
This is an order for Santiago
to be put on restricted duty.

734
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:45,718
Would you read your remarks?

735
01:12:45,889 --> 01:12:51,919
"Patient complains of chest pains,
shortness of breath, and fatigue".

736
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:57,038
"Restricted from running distances
over five miles".

737
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,447
Couldn't it have been a
heart condition, not a poison, -

738
01:13:02,609 --> 01:13:06,443
- that caused the
rapid chemical reaction?

739
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:09,686
- No.
- It's not possible?

740
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:17,529
No. I examined Santiago thoroughly
and gave him a clean bill of health.

741
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:24,162
So it had to be poison. If you
give a man a clean bill of health, -

742
01:13:24,329 --> 01:13:28,402
- and he later dies,
you'd be in trouble, right?

743
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:32,721
- Object! Move to strike!
- Sustained.

744
01:13:32,889 --> 01:13:36,359
I've no more questions, your honour.

745
01:13:36,529 --> 01:13:42,525
You've been a doctor for 17 years.
You are Chief of Internal Medicine -

746
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:46,728
- at a hospital
which has served 5,426 people.

747
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:51,405
In your professional opinion,
was Santiago poisoned?

748
01:13:51,569 --> 01:13:56,040
We ask that the doctor's testimony
be stricken from the record.

749
01:13:56,209 --> 01:14:01,647
- The court should disregard it.
- The objection's overruled.

750
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:06,485
We strenuously object,
and ask to confer with you -

751
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:09,686
- before you rule on this objection.

752
01:14:09,849 --> 01:14:14,365
- The objection has been overruled.
- Move to reconsider.

753
01:14:14,529 --> 01:14:19,603
The witness is an expert,
and the court will hear his opinion!

754
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:31,039
In your expert professional opinion,
was Willy Santiago poisoned?

755
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:36,684
- Yes.
- Thank you, sir. No more questions.

756
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:40,637
You may step down.

757
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:48,804
While we reserve the right to call
further witnesses, government rests.

758
01:14:48,969 --> 01:14:55,522
We'll recess until Monday, when the
defence will call its first witness.

759
01:15:06,289 --> 01:15:11,317
"I strenuously object".
Is that how it works?

760
01:15:11,489 --> 01:15:15,368
"Overruled!"
"No, I strenuously object!"

761
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:19,647
- Oh, then I'll reconsider!
- I got it on the record.

762
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:24,485
You object once, so we can say
he's not a criminologist.

763
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:27,840
If you keep after it, it looks like
a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

764
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:31,126
It's the difference between
paper law and trial law!

765
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:36,523
- The judge called him an expert!
- Sam, she made a mistake.

766
01:15:38,089 --> 01:15:42,367
I'll go call my wife.
I'll see you tonight.

767
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:48,080
- Why do you hate them?
- They beat up a weakling.

768
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:54,484
The rest is just coffeehouse crap.
They tortured a weaker kid!

769
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:59,245
They killed him,
because he couldn't run very fast!

770
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:04,767
- Everybody take the night off.
- I'm sorry...

771
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:10,720
We've been working 20 hours a day.
Go see your wife and daughter.

772
01:16:10,889 --> 01:16:17,601
Jo, go and do... whatever you do
when you're not here.

773
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:23,481
It's Saturday tomorrow?
We start at ten.

774
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:29,888
Why do you like them so much?

775
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:38,558
'Cause they stand on a wall and say:
"Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight".

776
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:48,607
Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

777
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:17,006
Sorry to bother you.
I should have called first.

778
01:17:17,169 --> 01:17:22,289
No, I'm just watching the ball game.
Come on in.

779
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:40,807
How would you feel
if I took you to dinner tonight?

780
01:17:40,969 --> 01:17:43,767
Is this a date?

781
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:45,123
It sounded like you were
asking me out on a date.

782
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,645
- I wasn't.
- That's what it sounded like.

783
01:17:49,729 --> 01:17:54,439
Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

784
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:06,246
My third case was a "drunk
and disorderly". It took nine weeks.

785
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:12,120
- Nine weeks? And the plea bargain?
- 15 days.

786
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:19,441
- You sure hustled them.
- I got shifted to Internal Affairs.

787
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:23,841
But I have two medals
and two letters of commendation.

788
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:28,480
Why are you always
giving me your rsum?

789
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:34,403
- I want you to think I'm good.
- I do.

790
01:18:34,569 --> 01:18:37,879
No, you don't.

791
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:47,204
You're an exceptional lawyer.
The court members respond to you.

792
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:52,397
You'll convince them. Dawson and
Downey will owe you their lives.

793
01:18:55,889 --> 01:18:58,449
Jo...

794
01:18:59,329 --> 01:19:06,246
You've got to prepare for losing.
Ross's statement was all true.

795
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:13,599
Even if it mattered to the court,
I can't prove they were ordered.

796
01:19:13,769 --> 01:19:21,278
All we have is the testimony of
two people accused of murder.

797
01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:28,718
- We'll find Markinson.
- We're gonna lose, huge.

798
01:19:31,929 --> 01:19:36,923
Corporal Barnes, Windward Barracks,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

799
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:41,162
For what reasons might a Marine
receive a Code Red?

800
01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:48,246
Being late, being disorderly,
falling back on a run...

801
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:54,325
- Have you ever received a Code Red?
- Yes. I dropped my weapon.

802
01:19:54,489 --> 01:20:01,088
It was over 100 degrees. My palms
were sweaty and I hadn't used resin.

803
01:20:01,249 --> 01:20:05,686
- What happened?
- They threw a blanket over me.

804
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:11,082
They punched me on the arms
and poured glue on my hands.

805
01:20:11,249 --> 01:20:15,925
And it worked.
I've never dropped my weapon since.

806
01:20:16,089 --> 01:20:19,525
- Was Private Santiago ever late?
- Yes, sir.

807
01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:22,408
- Was his barracks ever disorderly?
- Yes, sir.

808
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,844
- Did he fall back on runs?
- All the time.

809
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:29,924
Did he ever receive a Code Red
before September 6th?

810
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:31,317
No, sir.

811
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:33,360
- Never?
- No, sir.

812
01:20:35,009 --> 01:20:41,278
You got a Code Red just for
sweating. Why not Santiago?

813
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:47,598
- Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.
- Dawson wouldn't allow it.

814
01:20:47,769 --> 01:20:53,207
The guys talked tough,
but they were too afraid of Dawson.

815
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:59,922
- Objection. Speculation.
- Did you want to punish Santiago?

816
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:05,322
- Why didn't you?
- Dawson would have kicked my butt.

817
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:09,084
Captain Ross will ask you
some questions.

818
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:16,007
Corporal Barnes, this is the Marine
Recruit Outline. Do you know it?

819
01:21:16,169 --> 01:21:22,244
Have you read it? Good.
Look up "Code Reds", please.

820
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:27,400
- Sir?
- Just find the page with Code Reds.

821
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:34,522
"Code Red" is just a term we use
down at GITMO. I don't know...

822
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,886
Oh. We're in luck, then!

823
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:44,081
"Standard Operating Procedure.
RSC, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba".

824
01:21:44,249 --> 01:21:49,767
- Can we find "Code Red" in there?
- No, sir.

825
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:55,606
I'm a Marine. Is there no book,
no set of orders or regulations -

826
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:59,967
- telling me that one of my
duties is to perform Code Reds?

827
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:03,289
No book, sir.

828
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:07,203
No further questions.

829
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:12,124
Would you find the page that says
where the mess hall is?

830
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:16,487
That's not in the book, sir.

831
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:22,440
- You mean you've never had a meal?
- Three square meals a day, sir.

832
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:27,839
How did you find the mess hall,
if it's not in this book?

833
01:22:30,289 --> 01:22:36,364
- I guess I just followed the crowd.
- No more questions.

834
01:22:36,529 --> 01:22:40,044
Corporal Barnes, you may step down.

835
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:50,523
We do our final Kendrick review
tonight. I want to slam-dunk him.

836
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:05,727
- Hey, Luther.
- Admiral! How's the big case?

837
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:08,357
- Nose to the grindstone.
- No flies on you.

838
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,361
Rolling stone gathers no moss.

839
01:23:10,609 --> 01:23:13,169
Well, it ain't over
'till the fat lady sings.

840
01:23:13,329 --> 01:23:19,359
- You can say that again.
- Not 'till the fat lady sings.

841
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:22,965
I walked into that one.

842
01:23:32,729 --> 01:23:37,928
- Jesus Christ!
- You left the door unlocked.

843
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:40,762
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Just keep driving.

844
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:42,806
Are you aware you're under subpoena?

845
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:51,002
And the lives of two Marines are in
your hands. I have to help you.

846
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:53,205
- What do you know?
- I know everything.

847
01:23:53,409 --> 01:23:55,604
- Was it a Code Red?
- Yes.

848
01:23:55,849 --> 01:23:59,922
Did Kendrick give the order?
Did you witness it? Did you?

849
01:24:00,089 --> 01:24:03,240
- No.
- Then you don't know shit.

850
01:24:03,409 --> 01:24:06,242
He was never gonna be transferred.

851
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:16,840
- Jessep wanted him "trained".
- But you signed the transfer order.

852
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:22,766
I signed them when you got to Cuba,
five days after Santiago's death.

853
01:24:24,289 --> 01:24:30,922
I'll get you immunity. In four days
you can tell this to the court.

854
01:24:31,089 --> 01:24:35,128
I'll check you into a motel.
We'll start from the beginning.

855
01:24:35,289 --> 01:24:38,998
I don't want a deal, or immunity.

856
01:24:39,169 --> 01:24:45,119
I'm not proud of what I have done,
nor of what I am doing.

857
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,961
- Where is he?
- The Downtown Lodge.

858
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:50,165
- I want him guarded.
- That's a good idea.

859
01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:56,848
- My clearance code is 4115273.
- I don't have a clearance code.

860
01:24:57,529 --> 01:25:03,445
He also says Jessep's lying about
the first flight being at 6.00 a.m.

861
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:09,718
Markinson says there was one seven
hours earlier. Did you hear that?

862
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:16,158
- Isn't there a record of flights?
- You need the Tower Chief's log.

863
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:20,242
- We're gonna win.
- Jo, we don't know anything yet.

864
01:25:20,409 --> 01:25:23,446
You take care of Downey,
I'll talk to Ross.

865
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:33,317
Hi, Danny. Nice work today.
The redirect on Barnes!

866
01:25:33,489 --> 01:25:37,607
- I have Markinson.
- Where is he?

867
01:25:37,769 --> 01:25:41,887
In a motel room in Northeast,
under guard.

868
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:49,160
The transfer order is phoney. And
Jessep lied about the first flight.

869
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:54,449
I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

870
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:59,239
If you accuse Kendrick or Jessep
without evidence, -

871
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:06,360
- you'll be court-martialled,
and that will go on your record.

872
01:26:08,049 --> 01:26:14,921
Markinson won't hold up, he's crazy.
I'm just telling you to help you.

873
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:21,324
And I think you're all insane,
and your code of honour is shit!

874
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:25,687
Don't lump me in
with Kendrick and Jessep.

875
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:29,967
Your clients don't belong in jail,
but it's not my decision.

876
01:26:30,129 --> 01:26:37,205
I represent the government without
prejudice, and my client has a case.

877
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:44,206
Please acknowledge that
I've informed you -

878
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:48,760
- of the consequences of accusing
an officer without evidence.

879
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:53,317
I've been so advised.

880
01:26:55,409 --> 01:27:02,008
You got bullied into that courtroom.
By everyone. By Dawson. By Galloway.

881
01:27:02,169 --> 01:27:05,525
Shit, I practically dared you.

882
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:10,809
And you were bullied
by the memory of a dead lawyer.

883
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:19,599
You're a lousy fucking
softball player, Jack!

884
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:26,487
Your boys are going down, Danny.
I can't stop it anymore.

885
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:35,402
- Was Santiago a good Marine?
- I'd say he was average.

886
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:42,600
Your proficiency and conduct reports
all indicate he was below average.

887
01:27:45,569 --> 01:27:52,008
He was below average, but I don't
want to trample on his grave.

888
01:27:53,129 --> 01:27:59,568
- I know, but you're under oath.
- I'm aware of my oath.

889
01:27:59,729 --> 01:28:04,519
Here are your last three
reports for Corporal Dawson.

890
01:28:04,689 --> 01:28:10,525
He rated exceptional twice,
but on June 9th he's below average.

891
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:14,523
- I'd like to discuss that.
- Fine.

892
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:18,159
Dawson scored perfect at
Infantry School.

893
01:28:18,329 --> 01:28:23,198
But unlike most of his class,
he hasn't been promoted.

894
01:28:23,369 --> 01:28:28,079
- Was this report the reason?
- I'm sure it was.

895
01:28:28,249 --> 01:28:32,322
- Do you know why he got this grade?
- No.

896
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:36,118
I have many men.
I write many reports.

897
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:41,727
Do you recall
an incident with PFC Curtis Bell?

898
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:46,201
- He stole from the Officers' Club.
- Yes.

899
01:28:46,369 --> 01:28:50,328
Did you report him
to the proper authorities?

900
01:28:50,489 --> 01:28:55,438
I have two books by my bed:
The Marine Code and the Bible.

901
01:28:55,609 --> 01:29:00,683
The only proper authorities I know
are Col. Jessep and God.

902
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:07,289
Then you don't recognise this court
as a proper authority?

903
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:12,159
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained. Watch yourself!

904
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:17,847
- Did you report Bell?
- I thought very highly of him.

905
01:29:18,009 --> 01:29:24,482
- I didn't want to charge him.
- You wanted it handled in the unit?

906
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:32,284
- Yes, I most certainly did.
- Do you know what a Code Red is?

907
01:29:32,449 --> 01:29:35,486
- Have you ever ordered one?
- No.

908
01:29:35,649 --> 01:29:43,761
Did you order that Private Bell
get nothing but water for a week?

909
01:29:43,929 --> 01:29:48,320
You're distorting the truth.
He was on barracks restriction.

910
01:29:48,489 --> 01:29:55,201
He had water and vitamins.
His health was never in danger.

911
01:29:55,369 --> 01:30:00,489
I'm sure it was lovely for him.
But it was on your orders.

912
01:30:00,649 --> 01:30:04,608
- You denied him food?
- Yes, I did.

913
01:30:04,769 --> 01:30:10,924
- Would this be called a Code Red?
- No.

914
01:30:11,089 --> 01:30:16,163
Would the other 478 Marines
consider it a Code Red?

915
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:20,720
The witness can't know what
478 other men would say.

916
01:30:20,889 --> 01:30:26,759
These questions are argumentative,
and irrelevant badgering.

917
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:31,047
Sustained. I would remind you -

918
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:36,124
- that the witness has
an impeccable service record.

919
01:30:36,289 --> 01:30:43,400
Was Dawson rated below average
for sneaking food to Private Bell?

920
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:48,165
- Object!
- Not so fast. Lieutenant?

921
01:30:48,329 --> 01:30:55,167
Dawson was given a below average
rating for committing a crime.

922
01:30:55,329 --> 01:30:59,322
What crime did he commit?

923
01:31:00,089 --> 01:31:06,005
Lt. Kendrick, Dawson brought
a hungry guy some food.

924
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:11,118
- What crime did he commit?
- Disobeying an order.

925
01:31:11,289 --> 01:31:16,522
So, because he made a decision about
the welfare of a Marine -

926
01:31:16,689 --> 01:31:20,204
- that conflicted with your order,
he was punished.

927
01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:23,486
Dawson disobeyed an order!

928
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:28,200
It wasn't a real order, was it?
It's peacetime!

929
01:31:28,369 --> 01:31:31,441
He wasn't asked
to advance on a beachhead.

930
01:31:31,609 --> 01:31:38,560
Surely a Marine of his intelligence
could distinguish important orders -

931
01:31:38,729 --> 01:31:42,517
- from those that might be
morally questionable?

932
01:31:44,049 --> 01:31:51,160
Can Dawson determine on his own,
which orders to follow?

933
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:55,368
- No, he cannot.
- He learned that?

934
01:31:55,529 --> 01:31:57,724
- I would think so.
- You know so, don't you?

935
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,760
- Object!
- Sustained.

936
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:09,041
Finally: If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red...

937
01:32:09,209 --> 01:32:13,168
- I told them not to touch him!
- Would he dare disobey?

938
01:32:13,329 --> 01:32:17,163
- Don't answer that!
- I'm through.

939
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:25,521
Did you order Dawson and Downey
to give Willy Santiago a Code Red?

940
01:32:26,329 --> 01:32:30,481
- Lieutenant Kendrick...
- No, I did not.

941
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:37,002
What's the word?

942
01:32:37,169 --> 01:32:43,688
I have the Tower Chief's log.
Jessep's telling the truth.

943
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:58,806
- Working late tonight, Lieutenant?
- Oh, yeah...

944
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:04,999
There was no flight at 11 o'clock!

945
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:11,927
The first flight left at 23.00, and
arrived at Andrews at 2.00 a.m.

946
01:33:12,089 --> 01:33:15,126
Then why isn't it in the log?

947
01:33:16,969 --> 01:33:22,646
- Jessep.
- He fixed the logbook?

948
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:28,679
I can prove that a plane landed.
I'll get the log from Andrews.

949
01:33:28,849 --> 01:33:33,479
- You won't find anything.
- He can make a flight disappear?

950
01:33:34,049 --> 01:33:41,808
Jessep is about to join the NSC.
He knows how to sidestep landmines.

951
01:33:41,969 --> 01:33:46,963
- He can't sidestep you.
- You still want me to witness?

952
01:33:47,129 --> 01:33:51,964
Thursday morning. Ten o'clock.

953
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,758
Someone must know about the flight.

954
01:33:57,929 --> 01:34:03,799
Do you know how many planes
take off and land every day?

955
01:34:03,969 --> 01:34:07,962
- No one will remember it.
- Well, how do you know...

956
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,279
Forget the flight. Forget the flight.

957
01:34:10,529 --> 01:34:15,159
Markinson will testify that
the transfer was forged.

958
01:34:15,329 --> 01:34:18,878
That and Downey's testimony
will be enough.

959
01:34:24,369 --> 01:34:28,157
Why did you go
into Santiago's room that night?

960
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:33,278
- To give him a Code Red.
- Why did you do that?

961
01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:40,766
I was ordered to by
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

962
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:45,802
You're gonna do fine.

963
01:34:45,969 --> 01:34:51,407
- Can we rejoin the platoon soon?
- Absolutely.

964
01:34:54,529 --> 01:34:59,728
Remember the order of the
questions. And use small words.

965
01:34:59,889 --> 01:35:01,607
- Just go slow.
- I'm gonna go slow.

966
01:35:01,849 --> 01:35:05,398
Okay. And get him off
as fast as you can.

967
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:09,881
What? It's gonna be fine.

968
01:35:10,689 --> 01:35:12,529
<i>Dear Mr. And Mrs. Santiago,
I was William's executive officer.</i>

969
01:35:12,529 --> 01:35:16,158
<i>Dear Mr. And Mrs. Santiago,
I was William's executive officer.</i>

970
01:35:16,329 --> 01:35:19,560
<i>I knew your son only by name.</i>

971
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:25,200
<i>Soon, the trial of the two men
who killed him will be over, -</i>

972
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:31,478
<i>- and the jury will try to offer you
an explanation for his death.</i>

973
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:37,246
<i>I've done what I can
to bring the truth to light.</i>

974
01:35:37,409 --> 01:35:42,563
<i>But your son is dead because
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.</i>

975
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:48,406
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Markinson,
United States Marine Corps.</i>

976
01:35:53,409 --> 01:35:56,879
Please tell us one last time:

977
01:35:57,049 --> 01:36:02,726
Why did you go to Santiago's room
on the night of September 6th?

978
01:36:02,889 --> 01:36:07,041
A Code Red was ordered
by Platoon Commander Kendrick.

979
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:10,997
Thank you. Your witness.

980
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:21,967
According to the log,
you were at post 39 until 16.00.

981
01:36:22,129 --> 01:36:28,364
- They keep that log pretty good.
- How far is post 39 from barracks?

982
01:36:28,529 --> 01:36:34,525
- It's a ways, sir. It's a hike.
- About how far by jeep?

983
01:36:35,769 --> 01:36:37,760
About 10-15 minutes, sir.

984
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:42,082
- Ever had to walk it?
- Yes, sir, that day.

985
01:36:42,249 --> 01:36:46,640
The pick-up private...
we call him that...

986
01:36:46,809 --> 01:36:50,597
...also 'cause he can get the girls.

987
01:36:50,769 --> 01:36:57,607
He got a flat tyre at post 39, so
we had to jog back to barracks.

988
01:36:57,769 --> 01:37:04,117
If it's 10-15 minutes by jeep,
it must be an hour on foot, right?

989
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:09,966
- We did it in 45 minutes, sir.
- Not bad.

990
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:16,284
You've said your assault on Santiago
was ordered by Lt. Kendrick -

991
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:21,079
- in your room at 16.20, right?

992
01:37:21,249 --> 01:37:28,758
- Yes, sir.
- But you weren't back before 16.45.

993
01:37:28,929 --> 01:37:35,038
So how could you be
in your room at 16.20?

994
01:37:35,609 --> 01:37:38,601
Well, sir, there was a blowout...

995
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:43,399
Did you actually hear
Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?

996
01:37:43,569 --> 01:37:49,326
- Hal said...
- Did you actually hear the order?

997
01:37:50,289 --> 01:37:55,204
- No, sir.
- I'd like to request a recess.

998
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,202
- The witness has rights!
- He has been read his rights.

999
01:37:58,409 --> 01:37:59,762
The question will be repeated.

1000
01:38:00,009 --> 01:38:05,037
Why did you go to Santiago's room?
Did Dawson tell you to?

1001
01:38:05,209 --> 01:38:09,919
- Don't look at him!
- Answer the captain's question.

1002
01:38:11,849 --> 01:38:18,641
Yes. I was given an order by
Corporal Dawson, and I followed it.

1003
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:42,884
Where do you think he is?

1004
01:38:43,049 --> 01:38:50,603
As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

1005
01:38:54,609 --> 01:38:59,160
- Danny, I'm sorry...
- Don't worry about it.

1006
01:38:59,329 --> 01:39:04,562
All we need to do is call someone
to talk about implied orders, -

1007
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:07,118
- or call Downey back first.

1008
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:13,637
Or how about getting Dawson charged
with the Kennedy assassination?

1009
01:39:15,369 --> 01:39:22,286
- Are you drunk?
- Pretty much. Yeah.

1010
01:39:22,449 --> 01:39:25,839
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

1011
01:39:27,089 --> 01:39:32,243
She's gonna make coffee?
That's nice.

1012
01:39:35,889 --> 01:39:41,839
Downey wasn't in his room.
He wasn't even there.

1013
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:46,605
That was important information,
don't you think?

1014
01:39:47,329 --> 01:39:51,720
Danny, it was a setback.
And I'm sorry.

1015
01:39:51,889 --> 01:39:55,802
We fix it, and move on to Markinson.

1016
01:39:55,969 --> 01:39:59,598
Markinson's dead.

1017
01:40:03,089 --> 01:40:07,241
You really got to hand it
to those marshals.

1018
01:40:07,409 --> 01:40:14,326
He didn't hang himself by his laces,
or slash himself with a butterknife.

1019
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:21,279
He got into full dress uniform,
drew a nickel-plated pistol, -

1020
01:40:21,449 --> 01:40:26,967
- and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1021
01:40:28,169 --> 01:40:32,606
Since we're out of witnesses,
I thought I'd drink a little.

1022
01:40:32,769 --> 01:40:37,684
- I still think we can win.
- Maybe you should drink a little.

1023
01:40:37,849 --> 01:40:42,479
In the morning,
we'll ask for 24 hours delay.

1024
01:40:42,649 --> 01:40:45,607
- Why?
- To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

1025
01:40:46,729 --> 01:40:48,048
What?

1026
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:53,807
No, Jo! Your passion is compelling,
but useless.

1027
01:40:53,969 --> 01:40:59,760
Louden Downey
needed a trial lawyer today.

1028
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:04,047
You chicken shit!
You just want an excuse to give up.

1029
01:41:05,169 --> 01:41:07,160
It's over!

1030
01:41:07,329 --> 01:41:12,039
Why did you ask Jessep
for the transfer order?

1031
01:41:12,209 --> 01:41:18,159
- I wanted it!
- You could have got it anywhere.

1032
01:41:18,329 --> 01:41:22,720
You just wanted
to see Jessep's reaction.

1033
01:41:22,889 --> 01:41:28,600
Your instinct was right.
Now let's call Jessep, and end this.

1034
01:41:28,769 --> 01:41:34,799
- What possible good would that do?
- He ordered the Code Red.

1035
01:41:34,969 --> 01:41:40,999
He did? That's great!
And of course, you have proof?

1036
01:41:41,169 --> 01:41:47,517
- You missed that day at Law School?
- Get it from him.

1037
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:51,728
We get it from him!
Yes, no problem.

1038
01:41:51,889 --> 01:41:55,928
Colonel, didn't you
order a Code Red on Santiago?

1039
01:41:56,089 --> 01:42:00,082
Sorry, time's up!
What do the losers get?

1040
01:42:00,249 --> 01:42:04,208
For the defendants,
life at Fort Leavenworth!

1041
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:09,887
And for defence counsel Kaffee:
That's right! A court martial!

1042
01:42:10,049 --> 01:42:15,248
After accusing a decorated officer
of conspiracy and perjury, -

1043
01:42:15,409 --> 01:42:18,765
- Kaffee can expect a career -

1044
01:42:18,929 --> 01:42:23,957
- teaching typewriter
maintenance at a women's school!

1045
01:42:24,129 --> 01:42:29,920
Thank you for playing "Follow the
Advice of the Galactically Stupid".

1046
01:42:50,849 --> 01:42:55,127
I'm sorry I lost you
your steak knives.

1047
01:43:10,169 --> 01:43:13,684
Stop cleaning up.

1048
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:19,568
Sam, stop cleaning up.

1049
01:43:26,849 --> 01:43:31,639
- You want a drink?
- Yeah.

1050
01:43:47,049 --> 01:43:49,882
- Is your father proud of you?
- Don't do this to yourself.

1051
01:43:50,129 --> 01:43:51,721
I'll bet he is.

1052
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:58,201
I'll bet he bores the shit out of
neighbours and relatives:

1053
01:43:58,369 --> 01:44:04,205
"Sam's got a big case.
He's making an argument".

1054
01:44:08,449 --> 01:44:14,718
My father would have enjoyed
seeing me graduate from Law School.

1055
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:19,882
He would have liked that a lot.

1056
01:44:21,049 --> 01:44:26,203
I wrote a paper about your father
in college.

1057
01:44:26,849 --> 01:44:32,082
- One of the best trial lawyers.
- Yes, he was.

1058
01:44:32,249 --> 01:44:37,084
But if I were Dawson and Downey,
and had to choose you or him, -

1059
01:44:37,249 --> 01:44:40,207
- I'd choose you any day.

1060
01:44:40,369 --> 01:44:45,887
You should have seen yourself
thunder away at Kendrick.

1061
01:44:46,529 --> 01:44:51,080
- Would you put Jessep on the stand?
- No.

1062
01:44:51,649 --> 01:44:59,363
- Do you think my father would?
- With the evidence we have? Never.

1063
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:02,760
But we can't get around this:

1064
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:10,279
Neither Lionel Kaffee nor
Sam Weinberg are lead counsel here.

1065
01:45:10,449 --> 01:45:16,684
So there's really only one question:
What would you do?

1066
01:45:22,729 --> 01:45:29,885
Jo, get in the car.
JoAnne, please get in the car!

1067
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:38,240
JoAnne! I apologise. I was angry.
I'm sorry about what I said.

1068
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:42,960
I'm going to put Jessep
on the stand!

1069
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:04,521
- What do you suggest?
- Use the phoney transfer order.

1070
01:46:04,689 --> 01:46:10,207
- Our witness to that is dead.
- A problem, to a lesser attorney!

1071
01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:15,363
Last night he was swimming in
Jack Daniels, today he's Superman!

1072
01:46:15,529 --> 01:46:20,045
I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

1073
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:24,202
Jessep told Kendrick
to order a Code Red.

1074
01:46:24,369 --> 01:46:29,807
For us to win,
Jessep has to say he gave the order.

1075
01:46:29,969 --> 01:46:36,204
- And you can get him to say that?
- I think he wants to say it!

1076
01:46:36,369 --> 01:46:39,520
He made a decision, and that's it!

1077
01:46:39,689 --> 01:46:45,400
He eats breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kill him.

1078
01:46:45,569 --> 01:46:50,165
No one tells him how to
run his unit. Least of all me.

1079
01:46:50,329 --> 01:46:54,845
I'll lead him
right where he's dying to go.

1080
01:46:55,009 --> 01:46:59,321
That's the plan?
How are you going to do it?

1081
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:05,246
I've no idea. Where's my bat?
I think better with it.

1082
01:47:05,409 --> 01:47:08,003
- I put it in the closet.
- You put it in the closet?

1083
01:47:08,249 --> 01:47:09,841
I was tripping on it.

1084
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:12,649
Never put that bat in the closet!

1085
01:47:26,889 --> 01:47:34,842
- I'm going to the office.
- He does think better with the bat!

1086
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:59,521
<i>- Hello?
- Sam, I need you to do something.</i>

1087
01:48:02,529 --> 01:48:08,081
- What's going on?
- I'm going out to Andrews.

1088
01:48:28,449 --> 01:48:32,567
- Did Sam get the guys?
- Yes.

1089
01:48:32,729 --> 01:48:36,847
Can I talk to you for a second?

1090
01:48:47,449 --> 01:48:50,521
How are you feeling?

1091
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:55,479
I think Jessep
will have his hands full.

1092
01:48:56,689 --> 01:49:00,887
Listen, Danny,
when you're out there today, -

1093
01:49:01,049 --> 01:49:07,648
- if you feel like
he's not going to say it, -

1094
01:49:07,809 --> 01:49:13,202
- don't go for it.
You could get into trouble.

1095
01:49:13,369 --> 01:49:17,760
I'm with Internal Affairs. I know.

1096
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:23,845
You're not suggesting that I
back off a material witness?

1097
01:49:24,009 --> 01:49:27,001
If you can't get him... yeah.

1098
01:49:29,169 --> 01:49:33,560
All rise!

1099
01:49:35,409 --> 01:49:38,242
- Where's Sam?
- On his way.

1100
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:47,642
- Where is he?
- Don't worry.

1101
01:49:47,809 --> 01:49:52,166
Lieutenant! Call your witness.

1102
01:49:56,529 --> 01:49:58,838
Defence calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.

1103
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:17,968
Raise your right hand, please.

1104
01:50:18,129 --> 01:50:24,648
Will you tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?

1105
01:50:24,809 --> 01:50:29,041
- Yes.
- Have a seat please, sir.

1106
01:50:29,209 --> 01:50:32,406
State your name,
rank and current billet.

1107
01:50:32,969 --> 01:50:38,566
Colonel Jessep, Commanding Officer,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1108
01:50:39,809 --> 01:50:43,245
He's not here.

1109
01:50:46,569 --> 01:50:50,118
When you learned
of Santiago's letter, -

1110
01:50:50,289 --> 01:50:55,761
- you had a meeting
with your senior officers, correct?

1111
01:50:55,929 --> 01:51:03,802
Platoon Commander Kendrick,
and Lt. Colonel Markinson.

1112
01:51:03,969 --> 01:51:08,167
And Markinson is now dead,
is that right?

1113
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:15,519
- What is the counsellor implying?
- Just that Markinson is not alive.

1114
01:51:15,689 --> 01:51:19,079
The colonel
doesn't need to confirm that.

1115
01:51:19,249 --> 01:51:24,403
He may not be aware that Markinson
took his own life two days ago.

1116
01:51:24,569 --> 01:51:28,687
The witness, the court
and now the jury are aware.

1117
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:33,798
We thank you.
Move on, Lieutenant.

1118
01:51:35,889 --> 01:51:39,165
You gave Kendrick an order, right?

1119
01:51:39,329 --> 01:51:43,368
I told him to tell his men
not to touch Santiago.

1120
01:51:43,529 --> 01:51:46,282
Did you give Markinson an order?

1121
01:51:46,449 --> 01:51:51,728
I ordered him to have Santiago
transferred immediately.

1122
01:51:51,889 --> 01:51:57,122
- Why?
- His life might be in danger.

1123
01:51:57,289 --> 01:52:01,680
- Grave danger?
- Is there another kind?

1124
01:52:04,249 --> 01:52:08,162
This is the order
that you and Markinson signed -

1125
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:12,447
- for Santiago to fly out
at six the next morning.

1126
01:52:12,609 --> 01:52:17,444
- Was that the first flight?
- Yes, it was.

1127
01:52:21,249 --> 01:52:24,480
You flew here today, didn't you?

1128
01:52:24,649 --> 01:52:29,279
- You're wearing your dress uniform.
- As are you.

1129
01:52:29,449 --> 01:52:33,647
- Did you wear it on the plane?
- Is this relevant?

1130
01:52:33,809 --> 01:52:37,927
I'm asking the court
for a little latitude.

1131
01:52:38,089 --> 01:52:42,002
A very little latitude.

1132
01:52:42,169 --> 01:52:47,004
- I wore utilities on the plane.
- You brought the uniform?

1133
01:52:47,169 --> 01:52:52,607
Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
Is his underwear a state secret?

1134
01:52:52,769 --> 01:52:58,048
You'd better get somewhere fast
with this, Lieutenant!

1135
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:04,718
I brought a change of clothes
and some personal items.

1136
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:12,284
After Dawson and Downey's arrest,
Santiago's room was inventoried.

1137
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:17,045
Four pairs of camouflage pants,
three khaki shirts, boots.

1138
01:53:17,209 --> 01:53:22,203
- Four pairs of socks...
- Is there any question coming?

1139
01:53:22,369 --> 01:53:27,966
- Lieutenant, state your question.
- Why hadn't Santiago packed?

1140
01:53:30,449 --> 01:53:37,241
We'll get back to that. This is a
record of phone calls from the base.

1141
01:53:37,409 --> 01:53:43,041
You've recently made three calls.
Do you recognise the numbers?

1142
01:53:43,209 --> 01:53:48,727
I called Colonel Fitzhughes
to tell him I'd be in town.

1143
01:53:48,889 --> 01:53:54,521
The second was to arrange a
meeting with Congressman Richman.

1144
01:53:54,689 --> 01:53:59,638
- And the third was to my sister.
- Why did you call her?

1145
01:53:59,809 --> 01:54:02,642
- I invited her to dinner tonight.
- Your honour.

1146
01:54:02,849 --> 01:54:04,077
I'll put a stop to this.

1147
01:54:04,329 --> 01:54:08,242
These are the records
for September 6th.

1148
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:13,164
And these are the 14 letters
Santiago wrote in nine months, -

1149
01:54:13,329 --> 01:54:16,446
- begging for a transfer.

1150
01:54:16,609 --> 01:54:21,160
But when he finally got it, -

1151
01:54:21,329 --> 01:54:25,641
- how many people did he call?
Zero! Nobody.

1152
01:54:25,809 --> 01:54:32,601
Not one call to his parents or
a friend, saying he was coming.

1153
01:54:32,769 --> 01:54:38,765
He was asleep at midnight, and you
say he had a flight in six hours.

1154
01:54:38,929 --> 01:54:45,084
Yet everything he owned was
in his closet or his footlocker.

1155
01:54:45,249 --> 01:54:48,605
For one day, you packed
and made three calls.

1156
01:54:48,769 --> 01:54:54,446
Santiago was leaving
for the rest of his life.

1157
01:54:54,609 --> 01:54:59,842
And he hadn't called a soul,
or packed a thing.

1158
01:55:02,969 --> 01:55:06,928
Can you explain that?

1159
01:55:07,089 --> 01:55:12,004
There was no transfer order,
was there?

1160
01:55:12,169 --> 01:55:17,527
Objection! Lt. Kaffee is trying to
smear a high-ranking officer -

1161
01:55:17,689 --> 01:55:21,921
- hoping to suggest impropriety
and win points.

1162
01:55:22,089 --> 01:55:29,006
I recommend that he be reprimanded,
and the witness be excused.

1163
01:55:29,169 --> 01:55:35,324
- Overruled. The objection is noted.
- Colonel?

1164
01:55:39,249 --> 01:55:43,686
- Is this funny, sir?
- No, it's tragic.

1165
01:55:43,849 --> 01:55:50,243
- Do you have an answer?
- Absolutely. I don't have a clue.

1166
01:55:50,409 --> 01:55:56,484
Maybe he was an early riser.
Maybe he didn't have any friends.

1167
01:55:56,649 --> 01:56:03,725
I'm an educated man, but I don't
know the travel habits of Santiago.

1168
01:56:03,889 --> 01:56:09,407
What I do know is that he was
set to leave at 0600.

1169
01:56:09,569 --> 01:56:16,600
Are these really the questions
I was called here to answer?

1170
01:56:16,769 --> 01:56:20,205
I hope you have something more.

1171
01:56:20,369 --> 01:56:24,044
These two Marines
are on trial for their lives.

1172
01:56:24,209 --> 01:56:30,478
Please tell me their lawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1173
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:36,281
Do you have any other
questions for me, counsellor?

1174
01:56:42,449 --> 01:56:44,963
Lieutenant Kaffee?

1175
01:56:51,689 --> 01:56:56,763
Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

1176
01:57:02,369 --> 01:57:07,159
- Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.
- I didn't dismiss you.

1177
01:57:07,329 --> 01:57:14,246
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm not through. Sit down.

1178
01:57:16,049 --> 01:57:18,722
"Colonel".

1179
01:57:18,889 --> 01:57:22,848
He should address me as
"Colonel" or "sir".

1180
01:57:23,009 --> 01:57:29,881
- Call him "Colonel" or "sir".
- What kind of unit is this?

1181
01:57:30,049 --> 01:57:35,362
And the witness will address me
as "judge" or "Your Honour".

1182
01:57:35,529 --> 01:57:39,647
Take your seat... Colonel.

1183
01:57:42,689 --> 01:57:46,887
What shall we discuss?
My favourite colour?

1184
01:57:47,649 --> 01:57:51,847
Colonel, the 6.00 a.m. Flight
was the first one?

1185
01:57:52,009 --> 01:57:56,161
There wasn't one seven hours earlier
to Andrews?

1186
01:57:56,329 --> 01:57:59,082
Haven't we covered this?

1187
01:57:59,649 --> 01:58:04,962
These are the flight logs for
Guantanamo Bay and Andrews.

1188
01:58:05,129 --> 01:58:10,761
There's no flight at 11.00 p.m.,
and no arrival at 2.00 a.m.

1189
01:58:10,929 --> 01:58:13,363
I'd like to admit them as evidence.

1190
01:58:13,929 --> 01:58:20,277
- But the flight never existed!
- We believe it did, sir.

1191
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:26,160
We call Airmen O'Malley and
Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.

1192
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:33,201
- They're not on the list.
- They are rebuttal witnesses.

1193
01:58:33,369 --> 01:58:35,678
- I'll allow the witnesses.
- This is ridiculous!

1194
01:58:36,089 --> 01:58:37,568
Colonel, a moment ago...

1195
01:58:37,809 --> 01:58:43,327
- Check the logs, for Christ's sake!
- We'll get to that in a minute.

1196
01:58:43,489 --> 01:58:51,681
You said, you told Kendrick to say
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1197
01:58:51,849 --> 01:58:56,161
- He was clear on what you wanted?
- Crystal.

1198
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:01,366
- Can he have ignored the order?
- Ignored the order?

1199
01:59:01,529 --> 01:59:04,248
- Or forgot it?
- No.

1200
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:10,166
Could he have thought,
"The old man is wrong"?

1201
01:59:10,329 --> 01:59:15,562
When Lt. Kendrick talked to the men,
any chance they ignored him?

1202
01:59:16,969 --> 01:59:20,928
Ever been in the infantry, son?

1203
01:59:21,089 --> 01:59:24,320
Ever served in a forward area?

1204
01:59:24,489 --> 01:59:31,042
Ever put your life in another
man's hands, and his in yours?

1205
01:59:31,209 --> 01:59:36,044
We follow orders, son.
Otherwise people die.

1206
01:59:36,209 --> 01:59:40,885
It's that simple. Are we clear?

1207
01:59:41,049 --> 01:59:45,998
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

1208
01:59:46,769 --> 01:59:52,048
One last question, before I call
Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1209
01:59:52,209 --> 01:59:56,327
If you ordered that Santiago wasn't
to be touched, -

1210
01:59:56,489 --> 02:00:00,687
- and your orders
are always followed, -

1211
02:00:00,849 --> 02:00:05,400
- then why was Santiago in danger?

1212
02:00:05,569 --> 02:00:11,519
Why would it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

1213
02:00:14,369 --> 02:00:18,760
He was a substandard Marine.
He was being transferred...

1214
02:00:18,929 --> 02:00:23,525
You said he was transferred
because he was in danger.

1215
02:00:23,689 --> 02:00:28,717
I said, "grave danger?" and you
said... we can read it...

1216
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:35,283
- I know what I said!
- Then why the two orders?

1217
02:00:37,009 --> 02:00:42,720
- Men can do things on their own.
- But your men never did.

1218
02:00:42,889 --> 02:00:47,246
Your men obey orders.
So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?

1219
02:00:47,409 --> 02:00:49,764
You snotty little bastard.

1220
02:00:49,929 --> 02:00:52,363
- I request a recess.
- We'll wait for an answer.

1221
02:00:52,569 --> 02:00:54,685
The court will wait for an answer.

1222
02:00:55,129 --> 02:01:00,681
If Lt. Kendrick gave an order that
Santiago wasn't to be touched, -

1223
02:01:00,849 --> 02:01:05,081
- why did he have to be transferred?

1224
02:01:05,249 --> 02:01:09,720
Kendrick ordered a Code Red,
because you told him to!

1225
02:01:09,889 --> 02:01:16,044
And when it went bad, you signed a
phoney transfer and fixed the logs!

1226
02:01:16,209 --> 02:01:21,237
You coerced the doctor! Colonel
Jessep, did you order the Code Red?

1227
02:01:21,409 --> 02:01:25,880
- You don't have to answer that.
- You want answers?

1228
02:01:26,049 --> 02:01:29,041
I want the truth!

1229
02:01:29,209 --> 02:01:32,326
You can't handle the truth!

1230
02:01:32,489 --> 02:01:36,767
Son, we live in a world with
walls that must be guarded.

1231
02:01:36,929 --> 02:01:41,286
Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lt. Weinberg?

1232
02:01:41,449 --> 02:01:44,919
I have more responsibility
than you can fathom.

1233
02:01:45,089 --> 02:01:48,286
You weep for Santiago
and curse the Marines.

1234
02:01:48,449 --> 02:01:55,958
You don't know what I know.
Santiago's tragic death saved lives.

1235
02:01:56,129 --> 02:02:01,761
And my existence,
while grotesque to you, saves lives!

1236
02:02:01,929 --> 02:02:06,480
But deep down, in places
you don't talk about at parties, -

1237
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:10,927
- you need me on that wall.

1238
02:02:11,089 --> 02:02:15,241
We use words like
honour, code, loyalty.

1239
02:02:15,409 --> 02:02:20,767
They're the backbone of our lives.
You use them as a punchline!

1240
02:02:20,929 --> 02:02:24,478
I haven't the time or inclination
to explain myself -

1241
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:28,688
- to a man who needs my protection -

1242
02:02:28,849 --> 02:02:34,526
- but questions the way I do it.
Better just to thank me.

1243
02:02:34,689 --> 02:02:38,238
Or pick up a gun and stand a post.

1244
02:02:38,409 --> 02:02:43,005
But I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitled to!

1245
02:02:43,169 --> 02:02:48,926
- Did you order the Code Red?
- You're goddamn right I did!

1246
02:02:59,409 --> 02:03:05,644
I suggest the jury be dismissed, and
we move to an article 39a session.

1247
02:03:05,809 --> 02:03:10,200
- The witness has rights.
- Captain Ross?

1248
02:03:14,369 --> 02:03:15,927
Jack?

1249
02:03:20,729 --> 02:03:23,926
The members of the court
will retire.

1250
02:03:27,049 --> 02:03:32,840
What the hell is this?
I did my job, I'd do it again.

1251
02:03:33,009 --> 02:03:37,639
- I'm going back to my base.
- You're not going anywhere.

1252
02:03:37,809 --> 02:03:41,882
MP's, guard the colonel!

1253
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:45,648
- Captain Ross.
- What the hell is this?

1254
02:03:45,889 --> 02:03:48,403
You've the right to remain silent.

1255
02:03:48,649 --> 02:03:52,562
I'm being charged with a crime?

1256
02:03:52,729 --> 02:03:55,846
I'm being charged with a crime?

1257
02:03:56,009 --> 02:03:59,888
This is funny, that's what this is!

1258
02:04:00,049 --> 02:04:05,203
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your
head and piss in your skull!

1259
02:04:05,369 --> 02:04:10,079
Colonel Jessep,
do you understand your rights?

1260
02:04:14,409 --> 02:04:19,802
You fucking people have no
idea how to defend a nation.

1261
02:04:19,969 --> 02:04:25,202
All you did was weaken a country,
Kaffee!

1262
02:04:25,369 --> 02:04:29,999
You put peoples' lives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

1263
02:04:30,169 --> 02:04:36,404
Don't call me son.
I'm a lawyer, and a naval officer.

1264
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:41,643
And you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch!

1265
02:04:43,369 --> 02:04:47,362
The witness is excused.

1266
02:05:06,609 --> 02:05:09,919
All rise!

1267
02:05:18,689 --> 02:05:23,205
- Have you reached a verdict?
- We have, sir.

1268
02:05:33,489 --> 02:05:38,802
Corporal Dawson
and Private Downey.

1269
02:05:39,449 --> 02:05:44,000
Of the charge of murder,
the members find the accused -

1270
02:05:44,169 --> 02:05:46,888
- not guilty.

1271
02:05:47,049 --> 02:05:50,758
On the charge of
conspiracy to commit murder, -

1272
02:05:50,929 --> 02:05:56,640
- the members
find the accused not guilty.

1273
02:05:56,809 --> 02:06:00,768
On the charge of
conduct unbecoming a US Marine, -

1274
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:06,606
- the members
find the accused guilty as charged.

1275
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:10,966
You are sentenced to
time already served, -

1276
02:06:11,129 --> 02:06:15,645
- and to be dishonourably
discharged from the Marines.

1277
02:06:17,009 --> 02:06:21,048
This court-martial is adjourned.

1278
02:06:36,009 --> 02:06:39,968
What did that mean?

1279
02:06:40,129 --> 02:06:42,848
Hal?

1280
02:06:43,009 --> 02:06:46,888
What did that mean?

1281
02:06:47,969 --> 02:06:52,804
Colonel Jessep said
he ordered the Code Red.

1282
02:06:52,969 --> 02:06:57,042
- What did we do wrong?
- It's not that simple.

1283
02:06:57,209 --> 02:07:01,885
- We did nothing wrong!
- Yeah, we did.

1284
02:07:03,769 --> 02:07:08,479
We're supposed to fight for people
who can't fight for themselves.

1285
02:07:08,649 --> 02:07:13,279
We were supposed to fight for Willy.

1286
02:07:17,289 --> 02:07:22,966
Lt. Kaffee, I have to
take these men for some paperwork.

1287
02:07:31,569 --> 02:07:34,402
Harold?

1288
02:07:36,449 --> 02:07:39,168
Sir?

1289
02:07:39,329 --> 02:07:45,165
You don't need a patch on your arm
to have honour.

1290
02:07:45,329 --> 02:07:51,040
Ten-hut! There's an officer on deck.

1291
02:08:13,889 --> 02:08:19,009
O'Malley and Rodriguez,
what exactly could they testify to?

1292
02:08:19,169 --> 02:08:24,084
Probably that they had absolutely
no recollection of anything.

1293
02:08:24,249 --> 02:08:28,879
- Strong witnesses.
- And handsome too.

1294
02:08:29,049 --> 02:08:33,998
- I've got to go arrest Kendrick.
- Tell him I said "Hi".

1295
02:08:34,169 --> 02:08:38,082
Will do.

1
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,299
<i>There's a hundred thousand streets in the city.</i>

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,482
<i>Now, you give me a time and a place.</i>

3
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:38,957
<i>I give you a five-minute window,
anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours...</i>

4
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:39,958
<i>No matter what.</i>

5
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:45,978
<i>Anything happens in either side of that,
then you are on your own.</i>

6
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:48,981
<i>Do you understand?</i>

7
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,777
<i>Good.</i>

8
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,104
<i>And you won't be able to reach me on this phone again.</i>

9
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:33,600
Hey, there you are!

10
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,915
She's down there.

11
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,967
Plain Jane boring, just like you asked for.

12
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,631
But, I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,
She's gonna fly.

13
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:45,680
You look like a zombie kid.
You get any sleep?

14
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:51,438
Can I offer you some Benzadrine,
Dextradine, Caffeine... Nicotine?

15
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,089
Oh you don't smoke, that's right.
You're better off.

16
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,205
There she is!

17
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:03,377
'Chevy Impala'
most popular car in the state of California.

18
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:06,744
No one will be looking at you.

19
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:36,034
<i>All units be advised,
possible 731 in progress.</i>

20
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,662
<i>10:10 shots fired at 421 South Alemida.</i>

21
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,024
<i>Car 52 what's you twenty?</i>

22
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:06,630
<i>Car 52 to dispatch, currently at ten pager on 7th,

<i>Car 16 to dispatch,</i>

26
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:45,550
<i>We sealed off south parameter

27
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,219
- Which floor?
- 4th please.

28
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,490
Director wants to see a rollover.

29
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,743
You okay with that?

30
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,633
Remember, If you don't feel good;
just abort the shot.

31
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,634
There's no shame in that,
Alright?

32
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:18,469
You're doubling for the star.
It's not like you are A player or anything.

33
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,087
And I got you $500 more. Huh?

34
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,088
Of course we split that.

35
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,311
You okay? Ready to go?

36
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,965
Alright, I'm counting on you.

37
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:06,913
Oh Kid!
That's fantastic.

38
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:07,914
Just fantastic!

39
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,281
Okay, How're you doing?

40
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,420
You okay?
Good, that was perfect.

41
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:14,874
Where should I put these?

42
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,757
In the kitchen.
Thank you.

43
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:32,914
Scary.

44
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,406
Hey, You want a tooth-pick?
- Sure.

45
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,688
You want a glass of water?

46
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,623
Okay.

47
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,497
Thanks.

48
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,941
So, did you just moved to L.A?

49
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:10,247
No, I've been here for a while.

50
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,369
You are just new here?
- Mmhmm.

51
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:21,483
That's Benicio's father.

52
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,148
Where is he?

53
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,739
He's in prison.

54
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,124
What do you do?

55
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:36,074
I drive.

56
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,172
Like a limo driver?

57
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,764
No, like for movies.

58
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,884
Doing all those car chases and stuff?

59
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,138
Yeah.

60
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,139
Isn't that dangerous?

61
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,540
It's only part time.

62
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:07,487
Mostly I work at the garage.
- Where?

63
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,092
Receda Boulevard.

64
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,051
I gotta go.

65
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,493
Well, thank you.

66
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,030
Thanks for the water.

67
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,118
Say bye.

68
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:14,089
Chicken Chowmein?
And, some peking duck.

69
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,671
Where are the chopsticks?

70
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:21,321
- Uh ...the guy
- go get 'em. I don't want that.

71
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:24,752
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

72
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:27,590
Put out the fucking cigrette,
I'm eating.

73
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:31,112
Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

74
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,241
You run a perfectly good business.
I don't know, why you wanna change that.

75
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:42,174
You know how much
my business made last year?

76
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:43,175
30 grand.

77
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:49,139
I can build a car in six months
and in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt

78
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:50,985
that won't even make it to the movie.

79
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,980
See, all i need is a hard used start car.

80
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:56,854
That's all.

81
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,934
I figure we start off small town circuit;
we work our way up.

82
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,718
Once we get to the show,
we are talking millions.

83
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:11,793
So, you still haven't give me your number.

84
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,215
Alright, Four hundred thirty thousand dollars.

85
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,216
Oh...!

86
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:22,475
Mr.Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this.
Unless, I'm absolutely sure about it!

87
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,627
How can you be sure, Shannon.

88
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,428
What do you got that
the professional race team don't?

89
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,820
I got a driver.

90
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,309
You just told me there're half a dozen drivers.

91
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,310
Not like this one.

92
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:37,829
This kid is special.

93
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,773
Been working with him for a while,
I've never seen anybody like it.

94
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,871
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

95
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:44,872
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

96
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:50,699
Mr.Ross,
You put this kid behind the wheel...

97
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
there's nothing he cannot do.

98
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:59,138
What are you doing eating
chink food in my fucking restaurant?

99
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,952
What's a Jew doing running a pizzaria?

100
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:02,953
You remember Shannon?

101
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,656
Take a fucking hike.

102
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,199
I wanna talk to my partner.

103
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:14,822
Hah, I'm just fucking with you.

104
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,762
How're you doing Shannon.
How's the fucking leg?

105
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,486
I've paid my debt.

106
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:25,185
I'll think about it. Okay?

107
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,978
But I wanna meet the kid first.

108
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,989
That's all I ask.

109
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,342
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

110
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,602
Whatever you do like about the car,
don't say anything.

111
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,197
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

112
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:50,973
Kid, I want you to meet Mr.Bernie Ross.

113
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:53,632
Nice to meet you.

114
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,721
My hands are a little dirty.

115
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,833
So are mine.

116
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,211
Good driving out there.
- Thanks.

117
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,079
So? What do you think?

118
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:18,253
Do we get the 400?

119
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:22,454
I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

120
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:26,804
Done!

121
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,365
You won't be sorry!

122
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,327
Hey pal, just drop it down here.
We're pushing it alright.

123
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:56,251
We wanna push her into number three.

124
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:58,484
The car. Not you.
- Oh good.

125
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,968
Hi...
- hi.

126
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,056
Uhh... You two know each other?
- Don't.

127
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:07,110
Oh look at that.

128
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:08,111
We're neighbours.
- Neihhbours, very good.

129
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:11,251
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

130
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:33,152
You blinked.

131
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,094
What?

132
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,201
Can I call a cab from here.
- Yeah, sure.

133
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,020
What am I talking 'bout.

134
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:44,370
You and the kid are neighbours, right.
He can take you.

135
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:46,422
Oh no.
I feel bad.

136
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,952
No, no... Don't even think twice about it.
He'll be happy to do it.

137
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:50,953
He's a good guy.

138
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:56,217
You know, he walked into my shop here
about five or six years ago...

139
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:59,506
right out of the blue,
asking for a job.

140
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:02,525
So, i put him to the test,
to see what he could do.

141
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,324
The kid is amazing.

142
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:08,203
So, i hired him on the spot.
Boom!

143
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:12,734
At about half the wages i normally pay.
He didn't even blink an eye.

144
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:15,831
Hey kid,
come over here for a sec will you.

145
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,663
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

146
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:23,365
Don't tell him.

147
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:26,791
Looks like we've bigger problem
than I thought.

148
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,926
We're gonna have to keep
the car here for a few days.

149
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,997
So, I offered your services to take,
Benicio and Irene home.

150
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:34,998
Would that be okay?

151
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:40,410
Yeah sure.

152
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,789
I don't have wheels...
in my car.

153
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,991
It's one think you should know about me.

154
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:49,992
Well put the tyres on.

155
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:52,497
You got about five minutes?
- Yeah.

156
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,380
Hey, do you wanna see something?

157
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,325
Yeah.

158
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,356
Okay.

159
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:25,815
You did good.
We had a good time.

160
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:37,030
Me too.

161
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,495
Sorry, if I put you on the spot or anything.

162
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,069
It's okay.

163
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:12,661
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

164
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,447
If you wanna go out or something.

165
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:59,530
Don't worry about these bumps and bruises.
Thats easily replaceable.

166
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,087
We coat a paint on there with sponsors detail.

167
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:04,612
Look at the thread on the tyre,
still good huh, we are in business.

168
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,577
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

169
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:11,162
I paid for it.

170
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:13,282
Out of my own pocket.

171
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:14,283
This is just the shell.

172
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:17,096
It's the inside that counts.
Not the outside.

173
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,201
Right, Shannon?

174
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:19,273
You are correct sir.

175
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:22,276
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something.
I want everybody to see it.

176
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:23,277
Of course you do.

177
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,490
Now this.

178
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:30,241
That is one motherfucking fine ass pussy mobile,
motherfucker!

179
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,368
Damn!

180
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:34,417
Shannon, sell him that car.

181
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,803
He won't be able to find a pussy
in a whorehouse.

182
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:41,775
You know what?
This car will make you even good looking.

183
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:44,896
How's it going?

184
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:49,994
When's our first race?

185
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:53,651
Uhh, pretty soon.

186
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:56,399
You gonna be ready?

187
00:30:58,506 --> 00:30:59,863
I hope so.

188
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:00,864
Huh... I hope so.

189
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:04,739
Hey no false modesty.
I got a lot of money on this.

190
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,817
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

191
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:13,853
I used to produce movies.

192
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:14,854
In the 80's.

193
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:18,819
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

194
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
One critic called them 'European'.

195
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:22,778
I thought they were shit.

196
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,192
Anyway he arrange all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

197
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:28,770
I liked him. I like having him around.

198
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,131
Eventhough, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

199
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:34,895
His next business venture.

200
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,329
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

201
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,330
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

202
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:41,637
They broke his pelvis.

203
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,021
He's never had a lot of luck.

204
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:50,042
The reason I'm telling you this is,
He's got a lot invested in you.

205
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,529
So do I.

206
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:54,876
So. You need anything...
You call me.

207
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,781
We're a team now.

208
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,230
I'm excited.
Let's get out of here.

209
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:05,283
Nino.

210
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,627
You see the bad guy?
- Yeah.

211
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:23,628
How can you tell?

212
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,395
Cos he's a shark.

213
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:31,109
There's no good shark?

214
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:34,415
No... I mean,
just look at him.

215
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:37,132
Does he look like a good guy to you?

216
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,062
That was my hausband's lawyer.

217
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:35,246
He's coming home in a week.

218
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:03,108
You know, we're here celebrating.
Its a shameful thing...

219
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,210
what I did.

220
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:10,958
And I have a lot of making up to do,
to everyone.

221
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:19,005
But second chances are rare.

222
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,098
Right?

223
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:24,425
And that's worth celebrating.
Right?

224
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:31,098
So, I want to make a toast.
To that lady right there.

225
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:36,712
Thanks for staying.
I love you, Inny.

226
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,369
Salud.

227
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:53,774
Hey?

228
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:56,800
Hi.

229
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:06,187
Sorry about the noise.

230
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,815
I was gonna call the cops.

231
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,477
I wish you would.

232
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:22,195
Oye, getting heavier.

233
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:32,584
Hey, how are you doing?
- Hi.

234
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,555
This guy has been telling a lot about you.

235
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:38,405
He says, you've been coming around and
helping out a lot.

236
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:42,075
Yeah? Helping out.
Is that right?

237
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:45,557
Is that right?

238
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,628
That's very nice.
That's nice of you.

239
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:52,703
Than you.
- You're welcome.

240
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,497
You drive for the movies?
- Yeah.

241
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,612
I can take that.
- No, no. I got it.

242
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:10,879
Let mommy talk to her friend.

243
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,898
You have a good night.

244
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,993
You're Shannon's buddy, Right?

245
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:17,199
We met last year.

246
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:21,012
You drove me and my brother
back from palm springs.

247
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,434
We hired another wing man.

248
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:30,801
I spend six months in jail and
my brother got himself killed.

249
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:37,021
I've got a sweet job coming up.

250
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:38,022
How about this?

251
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,023
You shut you mouth.

252
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:43,369
Or I'll kick your teeth down
your throat and i'll shut it for you.

253
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,485
Nice seeing you again.

254
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:13,879
Come here.

255
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:16,402
Don't be scared.

256
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:21,499
Look, don't tell mommy. Okay?

257
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,806
Okay, it's a secret between us boys.

258
00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:30,615
Oh fuck.

259
00:42:30,952 --> 00:42:32,416
Who are they?

260
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:36,024
What the fuck are you gonna do?
You gonna go and beat them out for me?

261
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,317
Huh, stunt guy.

262
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,974
Why the fuck do you
wanna know who they are?

263
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:57,777
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him,
But I'm not gonna do it.

264
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,570
What's the job?

265
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:07,946
He want me to rob a pawn shop in the valley.

266
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:11,600
Why?

267
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,789
Cos i owe them protection money,
for when i was in the inside.

268
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,790
It's two thousand bucks.

269
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:20,149
And as soon as I got out.

270
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:22,518
Oh it's five thousand bucks.
Oh it's actually, Ten thousand dollars.

271
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,281
Twenty thousand dollars,
tomorrow I don't know what it's gonna be.

272
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:29,668
What are you gonna do?

273
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:32,658
That's a very good question.

274
00:43:35,873 --> 00:43:38,381
They said they're gonna come after
Benicio and Irene next.

275
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,861
You okay?

276
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:05,999
You want something to drink?

277
00:44:10,404 --> 00:44:11,943
What' s that you got there?

278
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,087
Can I see?

279
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:31,179
One of those man gave you this?
- Mmmhm.

280
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,358
They told me not to loose it.

281
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,066
You want me to keep this for you?

282
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:44,254
Okay.

283
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:10,584
How's Benice?
- Good.

284
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,888
You just saying that?

285
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:22,675
No, what do you mean?

286
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,273
I saw that Standard...

287
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:31,306
was in an accident.

288
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:32,609
Yeah.

289
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,305
What happened?

290
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:43,556
He got beat up.

291
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,006
Why?

292
00:45:50,771 --> 00:45:52,199
Just drunk kids.

293
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:05,589
You should come over.

294
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:10,104
You should come and see him.

295
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:18,980
You wanna...

296
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:21,594
You wanna hear a story?

297
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:23,969
You wanna hear how mommy and me met?
- Yeah.

298
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:28,479
We're at a pary.

299
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:31,062
And she was nineteen years old.

300
00:46:31,063 --> 00:46:32,696
- Seventeen.

301
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:33,697
- You're not seventeen.
- I was.

302
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:36,126
Wow, so that's illegal.

303
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,402
Alright, so I illegally walked over
to a seventeen year old girl.

304
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:45,638
I walked up and I say....

305
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:47,981
<i>"Hello Miss"</i>

306
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:50,484
<i>What is your name?</i>

307
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:53,253
And she didn't say anything.

308
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,838
<i>And I said, well...
my name's Standard Gabriel.</i>

309
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,141
Then what did you said.

310
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:04,827
I said...

311
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:08,162
<i>'Where's the deluxe version'</i>

312
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:20,095
Oh man, that killed me.

313
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:26,091
And then a year later,
You popped out man.

314
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,620
Best day of my life.

315
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:19,171
If I drive for you, you'll get your money.

316
00:48:19,206 --> 00:48:20,883
That's a guarantee.

317
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,015
You tell me where we start,
Where we're going...

318
00:48:24,016 --> 00:48:25,016
Where we're going afterwards.

319
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:27,569
I give you a five-minutes when we get there.

320
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:31,110
Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours no matter what.

321
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:32,111
Anything a minute either side of that...

322
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:34,682
then you are on your own.

323
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:37,288
I don't sit in while you're running it down;

324
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,216
I don't carry a gun...

325
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,436
I drive.

326
00:48:41,723 --> 00:48:43,087
You look like you are hard to work with.

327
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:45,999
Not as long as we understand each other.

328
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,257
What's there to understand?

329
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,052
I cannot do this thing alone.

330
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,053
You got Blanche.

331
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,054
C'mon man.

332
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:57,373
She's beautiful,
Look at her.

333
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:02,174
What the fuck are you rolling your eyes at for?

334
00:49:04,896 --> 00:49:06,018
You know get the fuck out of here.

335
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:07,139
Get up!

336
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,637
Standard, take her with you,
and go get her a fucking coke.

337
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:17,994
Okay here's the deal.

338
00:49:20,773 --> 00:49:21,663
This much for Blanche,

339
00:49:24,176 --> 00:49:26,737
This much for that asshole...
Minus what he owes me.

340
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,359
And this much for you.

341
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:35,989
You're still interested?

342
00:49:38,553 --> 00:49:39,423
Good!

343
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:40,424
Anything else?

344
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,015
When you get your money,

345
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,283
His debt's paid.

346
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,284
His out for good.

347
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:49,852
You never go near his family ever again.

348
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,007
Do you understand?

349
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,822
To my family.

350
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:00,354
To my new friend.

351
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:05,837
And toast to the future.

352
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:09,769
Our future.

353
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:35,964
I'll see you in five minutes.

354
00:50:42,947 --> 00:50:43,916
See you in four.

355
00:55:23,757 --> 00:55:25,369
How much did Cook said,
we're gonna get?

356
00:55:29,435 --> 00:55:30,531
- Fourty Grand.

357
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:40,611
Stay here.

358
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:01,920
When was the last time you saw your hausband?

359
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:08,206
Can you answer...
the question?

360
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:19,295
<i>Hello?</i>

361
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,081
Benicio, Is that you?

362
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:22,082
<i>- Yeah.</i>

363
00:56:25,562 --> 00:56:26,655
Your mother there?

364
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:31,414
<i>- Uh she's sitting down...
talking to a police.</i>

365
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,477
Okay, just tell her I'm gonna call her back.
Okay?

366
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:37,453
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

367
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:42,774
<i>He's been identified as Standard Gabriel,</i>

368
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,775
<i>Of Echo Park, L.A.</i>

369
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:46,098
<i>Other details are unclear but...</i>

370
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:49,409
<i>the owner of the pawn shop, told the reporter
that Gabriel acted alone.</i>

371
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,946
<i>And that, the items he had stolen
has been recovered.</i>

372
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,791
If he saw you take the money...

373
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:21,137
and saw you get in the car;

374
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,347
then why didn't they say anything?

375
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:28,763
- I have no idea.

376
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,887
Did you have any idea that
there would be a second car?

377
00:57:48,355 --> 00:57:50,409
I already told you, I didn't.

378
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:58,516
Now, you've just got a little boy's father killed.

379
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:01,512
And you almost got us killed.

380
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,380
And now, you are lying to me.

381
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,512
So, how about this?

382
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:13,426
From now on, every words out of your mouth is the truth.

383
00:58:14,483 --> 00:58:15,965
Or i'm gonna hurt you.

384
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:19,365
Do you understand?

385
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,291
Now, what did Cook tell you?

386
00:58:23,973 --> 00:58:26,060
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

387
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:28,651
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

388
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:31,891
He didn't say anything about anyone
getting killed.

389
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:34,838
And he was gonna rip us off?

390
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,583
What's his real name?

391
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:46,032
He said it's Chris...
But i just call him Cook.

392
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:54,435
You're gonna take me to him...
right now.

393
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:58,201
Do you understand?

394
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,617
- Yeah.

395
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:29,010
This guy Cook,
he have a real name?

396
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,526
Chris.

397
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:34,700
Maybe.

398
01:02:37,082 --> 01:02:39,632
I'll ask Bernie,
see if he knows him.

399
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,647
Jesus!
I can't stop thinking about...

400
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:46,664
what we could do with all that dough.

401
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:48,305
Would you stop?
- Alright!

402
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,565
You know, a lot of guys messing around
with married women...

403
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,146
but you're the only one I know who robs a joint,
to pay back the hausband.

404
01:02:55,307 --> 01:02:56,230
Crazy!

405
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:58,244
Don't worry about it.

406
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,016
I'll take care of it.

407
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:33,054
Where's Cook?

408
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:34,406
He's in the dressing room.

409
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:36,892
Where's that?

410
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:39,534
It's over there.

411
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,567
You're a fucking dead man.

412
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,823
Whose money do i have?

413
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:14,074
Don't worry...
they're gonna come and get it.

414
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:18,455
Call them.

415
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:20,144
Somebody call Nino.

416
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:33,304
Do you remember this?

417
01:04:57,979 --> 01:04:58,787
Hello?

418
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:01,102
Nino?

419
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:04,075
No, sorry pal.
Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

420
01:05:05,263 --> 01:05:08,041
I could, but i think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

421
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,111
- Can I ask what this is about?

422
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:13,779
I have something of his.

423
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:16,334
- And that would be?

424
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,080
A million dollars.

425
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,755
- Please hold.

426
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:31,120
You have something that
fucking belongs to me.

427
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:38,175
Seems that way.

428
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:43,715
- And you're calling me...

429
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,116
- Why?

430
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:49,011
- You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

431
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,441
I'm not selling it.

432
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:54,121
I'm gonna give you a time and place,
and you're gonna come and get it.

433
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:56,429
Do you Understand?

434
01:05:58,597 --> 01:05:59,718
- What are you getting out of it?

435
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:02,277
Just that.

436
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:05,054
'Out of it.'

437
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:07,695
- And your partners are happy with that?

438
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:11,477
I don't have any partners.

439
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:16,568
- You discuss this with anybody else?

440
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:19,493
No, just with you.

441
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:23,304
- You're not very good at this.
Are you?

442
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:17,947
Can I talk to you for a minute?

443
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:21,519
- I can't talk,
I have to go.

444
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:26,661
Can I just walk with you... for?

445
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,598
I have to tell you something.

446
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:58,718
Standard was into some...

447
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:03,119
guys in prison for a lot of money.

448
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,284
And it would ruin you and benicio
if he wouldn't pay it.

449
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,765
He asked me for my help.

450
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:19,773
It just went wrong,
you know.

451
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,250
I'm sorry.

452
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:31,085
I still got the money.

453
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:37,523
You can have it,
if you wanted to.

454
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:42,594
You can take Benicio... and.

455
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,785
I just thought,
we could get out of here. If you wanted.

456
01:09:00,775 --> 01:09:01,911
I could come with you.

457
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,951
I could look out for you.

458
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,847
Sorry... uh...
Wrong floor.

459
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:41,185
He came into my apartment, Shannon.

460
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:44,958
How did they know where I live?

461
01:12:47,474 --> 01:12:48,757
- I told you,
I was gonna call Bernie.

462
01:12:48,792 --> 01:12:50,224
I just want him know that...

463
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:53,072
that it wasn't about that,
you are not interested in the money.

464
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:54,540
And that you just did it for the girl.

465
01:13:01,137 --> 01:13:02,735
You told him about Irene!

466
01:13:08,963 --> 01:13:11,609
I just wanted him to know that...

467
01:13:11,644 --> 01:13:14,394
as soon as you return the money,
that was the end of it.

468
01:13:14,429 --> 01:13:18,009
I didn't know.
How was I suppose to know that?

469
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,243
Okay?

470
01:13:19,849 --> 01:13:21,836
Look, let me just talk to Bernie..
Okay?

471
01:13:23,469 --> 01:13:25,466
Why did you have to fuck everything up, Shannon?

472
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:28,703
Why did you have to fuck everything up?

473
01:13:35,217 --> 01:13:36,333
They're gonna come looking for me.

474
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:37,587
And they're gonna come for you.

475
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:39,905
Do you understand?

476
01:13:39,906 --> 01:13:42,110
You gotta get out of here.

477
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:43,523
And you gotta get out now.

478
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:46,967
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Shannon.

479
01:13:49,736 --> 01:13:51,649
You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

480
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:55,071
You never come back.

481
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:02,698
What are you gonna do?

482
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:21,780
I already gave you my advice.

483
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:25,579
You should've taken the money,
and left the guy alone.

484
01:14:25,614 --> 01:14:26,943
- It's just not that simple Bernie.

485
01:14:26,978 --> 01:14:29,660
No! Of course not!
Now everything's bounced up in your face!

486
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:33,127
You know, I owe you this guy.
Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

487
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:35,328
Shut the fuck up.

488
01:14:35,363 --> 01:14:37,428
You fucking monkey!

489
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,720
The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,
out of Philly. Now...

490
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:43,883
I got tipped off...

491
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:47,636
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop;
He's gonna invest it here in L.A

492
01:14:47,671 --> 01:14:50,018
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

493
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:52,674
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

494
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:55,212
No! I stole from some jump up punk.

495
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:57,747
He was trying to step on our action.

496
01:14:57,748 --> 01:15:01,805
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,
before you set up this dummy robbery?

497
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:05,286
Before you hire this piece of shit.

498
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:08,562
This was something on the side, Bernie.
I didn't wanna involve you on this.

499
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:10,123
Well, I'm involved now!

500
01:15:12,877 --> 01:15:14,009
Let me tell you something...

501
01:15:14,044 --> 01:15:21,753
Anybody... anybody!
Finds out you stole from the family, we are both dead.

502
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:23,592
What fucking family?

503
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:27,181
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

504
01:15:28,806 --> 01:15:30,141
To my face!

505
01:15:31,547 --> 01:15:36,384
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,
they still pinched my cheek like i'm some fucking kid.

506
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:39,357
Family.

507
01:15:39,392 --> 01:15:42,143
The money flows up, easy.

508
01:15:42,144 --> 01:15:44,066
You know that.

509
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,186
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

510
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:49,875
He's gotta go.

511
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,981
And your pal, Shannon.

512
01:15:52,016 --> 01:15:55,479
It's these two guys,
that can tie me to this robbery.

513
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:37,808
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

514
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,566
All this priceless cars...

515
01:17:43,601 --> 01:17:45,791
One would think you'd have better locks.

516
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,706
Doors is always open to you.

517
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,542
Going somewhere?

518
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,098
I was thinking about it.

519
01:18:02,549 --> 01:18:04,175
I'm looking for your driver.

520
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:08,944
You breaking in here,
I figure its bad news.

521
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:10,332
No, Shannon.

522
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,147
It's bad luck.

523
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:16,554
Two thousand heist a year in this city,

524
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:18,710
he has to pick the wrong one.

525
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:20,900
He tried to put it right.

526
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:23,163
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

527
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,236
My partner is a belligerent asshole,
with his back against the wall.

528
01:18:28,812 --> 01:18:30,094
Right now, so am I.

529
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:33,583
If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

530
01:18:37,622 --> 01:18:39,485
Any idea where he might be?

531
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:44,184
Mexico.

532
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:46,967
Or maybe it was Balise.

533
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:51,600
Really?

534
01:18:58,457 --> 01:19:00,885
I was excited about this whole thing.

535
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:03,397
My name on a car!

536
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:06,239
I mean, look how beautiful.

537
01:19:07,406 --> 01:19:09,605
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

538
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,367
I think we would've made a go with this business.

539
01:19:30,477 --> 01:19:31,306
Don't worry.

540
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:32,278
Don't worry.

541
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:33,111
That's it.

542
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:36,782
It's done.
There is no pain, its over. Its over.

543
01:26:49,368 --> 01:26:50,134
<i>Nino.</i>

544
01:26:51,368 --> 01:26:52,135
<i>Nino?</i>

545
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,503
You know who this is.

546
01:27:00,472 --> 01:27:01,220
<i>Where's Nino?</i>

547
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:05,112
He's gone.

548
01:27:09,088 --> 01:27:11,023
<i>I think this has gone on long enough.</i>

549
01:27:12,814 --> 01:27:14,956
<i>You see any reason for this to continue?</i>

550
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:18,761
<i>What do you say we meet?</i>

551
01:27:22,055 --> 01:27:23,557
Why would I wanna do that?

552
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:25,934
<i>Well...</i>

553
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:29,672
<i>You, me and your girlfriend are the only players left.</i>

554
01:27:29,707 --> 01:27:31,936
<i>How's that for a reason?</i>

555
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:35,316
When?

556
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:37,396
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

557
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,920
<i>There's a place on Sherman Way...</i>

558
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:42,161
<i>there's a restaurant called ' The Great Wall'</i>

559
01:27:42,196 --> 01:27:43,027
<i>You know it?</i>

560
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:45,251
I'll find it.

561
01:28:12,089 --> 01:28:13,369
Can I talk to you?

562
01:28:16,613 --> 01:28:17,995
I won't keep you long.

563
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,058
I have to go somewhere now.

564
01:28:26,657 --> 01:28:28,322
I don't think I can come back.

565
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,797
I just want you to know...

566
01:28:37,193 --> 01:28:41,113
Just getting to be around you...
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

567
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,315
Did you bring the money?

568
01:29:41,913 --> 01:29:43,469
Here's what I'm prepared to offer...

569
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:46,574
You give me the money,
the girl is safe.

570
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:50,866
Forever, nobody knows about it.
She's off the limits.

571
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:54,936
I can't offer you the same.

572
01:29:56,562 --> 01:29:58,226
So, this is what I would suggest.

573
01:29:59,659 --> 01:30:01,489
We conclude our deals...
we shake hands.

574
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:04,832
You'll start the rest of you life.

575
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:11,634
Any dreams you have,
plans or hopes for the future;

576
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:14,601
I think you got to put that on holds.

577
01:30:16,259 --> 01:30:18,570
For the rest of your life,
you're gonna be looking over your shoulder.

578
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:22,765
I'm just telling you this,
b'cos I want you to know the truth.

579
01:30:24,606 --> 01:30:25,916
But the girl is safe.

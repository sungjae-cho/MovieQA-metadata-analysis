131

147
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,211

won't know they're there.

and documentation.

149
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,258
HAMMOND:
Our satellite infrareds

150
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,303
show the animals
are fiercely territorial.

151
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,806
The carnivores
are isolated in the
interior of the island

152
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,434
so the team can stay
on the outer rim.

153
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,438
Don't worry. I'm not making
the same mistakes again.

154
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,149
No, you're making
all new ones.

155
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,446
John! So, there's
another island
with dinosaurs,

156
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,158
no fences this time,
and you want to send
people in,

00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,745

you're trying

159
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,376
It was difficult
to convince them as to
what they would see,

160
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,004
in the end had
to use my checkbook
to get them there.

We have
our paleontologist

165

and I was hoping
that perhaps you might
be the fourth.

166

ever since that

168
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,112
There are those
in the company

169
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,490
who wanted to
exploit Site B

170
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,450
in order to bail us out.

171
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,577

planning it for years,

172
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,038
and I've been able
to stop them until now.

173
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,376
But, a few weeks ago,
a British family
on a yacht cruise

174

stumbled across the island
and their wee girl
was injured.

00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,258
She's fine.

176
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,596

has used the incident

177
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,348
to take control
of InGen from me.

178
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,310
Now it's only a matter
of time before this

179
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,647
lost world
is found and pillaged.

180
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,402
Public opinion is
the one thing I can use
to preserve it,

181
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,404
but to rally that support

182
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,407
I need a complete
photo record

183
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,535

and in their
natural habitat.

184

capitalist to naturalist
in just four years.

Of course, no.

190
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,145
And I'm going to contact
the other three members
of your team

191
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,272
and stop them from going.

192

by the way?

193

I want you to know this.

194

Who did?

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,991
Leave it to you, Ian,
to have associations,
affiliations,

196
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,327
even liaisons,
with the best people
in so many fields.

Not Sarah.

198
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,707
Paleontological behavior
study is a new field,

199
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,459
and Sarah Harding
is on that frontier.

parenting and nurturing

201
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,963
amongst carnivores
have framed the debate.

202
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,465

You sent my girlfriend
to this island alone?

209
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,202
"Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.

210
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,204
She was already
working in San Diego,

211
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,331
doing some research
at the animal park.

212
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,917
It's only a couple
of hours' flight from there.

213
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,670
She was adamant,
absolutely adamant about,
here you are,

214
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,757
about making the initial
foray by herself.

215
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,092
She thinks
she's Dian Fossey.

216
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,261
"Observation
without interference,"
she said.

217
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,680
She went on and on.
You know how it is.

218
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,351
After you were
injured in the park,
she sought you out.

219
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,896
Then she went all
the way to a hospital
in Costa Rica

220
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,691
to ask somebody
who she didn't even know
if the rumors were true.

221
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,611
If you want
to leave your name
on something, fine.

222
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,114
But stop
putting it on other
people's headstones.

223
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:31,078
She'll be fine.
She's spent years studying
African predators.

224
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,790
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.

225
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,626
And, believe me,
the research team will...

226
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,921
It's not a research
expedition anymore.

227
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,049
It's a rescue operation
and it's leaving now.

There's a first-rate shot
of the ship's deck

for the moment,

01:59:57,774 --> 02:00:01,944
contains the animal itself,
presumably with
the infant alongside.

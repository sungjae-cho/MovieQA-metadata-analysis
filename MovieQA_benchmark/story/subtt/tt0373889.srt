1
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:56,249
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,755
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:04,622
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:07,457
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...

5
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,465
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:13,365
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:16,231
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,645
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:25,181
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,211
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:31,914
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,920
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,452
Beat up another
10-year-old?

14
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,118
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:43,930
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:49,369
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:54,376
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,473
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:01,775
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,450
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,918
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:10,156
She dead?

23
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,957
Is she dead?

24
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,830
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,845
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,583
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,723
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,414
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,711
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,781
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,409
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,378
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,054
They might come back.

34
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,293
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?

35
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,420
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,795
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,369
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:08,372
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,204
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,040
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,343
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,182
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,964
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,261
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,337
Diddykins?

46
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,698
Is that you?

47
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:47,040
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,249
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,545
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,721
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,723
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,695
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:10,236
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,563
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,575
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,584
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,993
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,900
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,163
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:49,402
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,705
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:55,604
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,318 --> 00:07:00,721
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,191
Justice.

65
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,637
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,953
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,956
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:48,195
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,726
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,196
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,806
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,413
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:06,572
But the letter said...

74
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,777
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,115
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:15,656
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:18,124
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:22,128
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:31,601
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:23,417
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:26,929
Come on.

82
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,134
In you go, son.

83
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,164
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,073
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,113
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:20,217
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,922
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,493
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,859
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:36,195
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,805
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:47,075
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:52,205
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,452
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:04,756
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,564
Yeah.

97
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:14,033
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:19,075
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,543
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:25,573
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,694
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,267
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,064
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:52,577
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:59,215
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:02,218
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:06,587
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,921
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,792
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,927
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,771
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,635
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,932
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:26,671
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,407
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,278
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:36,481
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.

118
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:37,712
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:41,088
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,591
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,130
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,271
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,272
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,637
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:56,811 --> 00:14:00,871
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,539
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:08,185
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,414
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,148
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,692
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,930
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,260
He's as good as.

133
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:22,330
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:24,937
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:28,200
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,138
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,370
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,412
...about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,312
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,180
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:40,980
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:43,550
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,988
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:51,625
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:55,529
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:58,804
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...

147
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:01,999
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,768
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,474
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,275
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,611
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,619
Sirius.

153
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,626
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,462
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,072
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:35,408
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,812
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:55,653
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:58,956
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:00,430
Why?

161
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,570
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,865
No one in their right
mind could believe that...

163
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,907
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,601
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,715
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,317
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:20,820
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,925
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,028
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,962
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,766
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:42,502
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:47,139
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,850
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,621
We believe...

176
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,561
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:00,821
Sirius.

178
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,334
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:10,829
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:15,068
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:18,043
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:22,014
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:36,362
Harry.

184
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,796
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,766
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:52,877
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,347
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:14,367
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:20,633
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:25,679
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:08,591
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,058
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:15,221
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:39,986
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,185
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:48,321
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,907
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,075 --> 00:20:00,442
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,710
In five minutes.

200
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:13,619
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:20,292
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,558
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,143
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:36,838
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,414
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,284
Yes?

207
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,754
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,156
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,623
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:58,736
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:02,532
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,802
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...

213
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,809
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,143
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,885
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:18,452
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:21,184
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,297
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,461
The charges?

220
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,160
The charges against the
accused are as follows:

221
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:33,966
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,700
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,869
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:44,277
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,749
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,379
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,425
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,960
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,361
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,730
Dementors?

231
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:07,032
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,539
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,836
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?

234
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,240
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:17,975
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:22,349
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:27,016
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:31,789
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:38,229
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:42,804
What did they look like?

241
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:48,814
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,715
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:56,549
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:57,757 --> 00:23:02,354
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:06,397
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:11,663
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:15,468
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,371
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:20,570
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:25,983
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.

251
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:31,648
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:36,024
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:40,190
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:43,166
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:47,501
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:51,042
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:54,579
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.

258
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,680
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,614
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:08,254
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:12,991
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,931
He is not back.

263
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:24,038
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,047
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:31,685
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,754
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

267
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:38,086
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,127
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?

269
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:53,099
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,854
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,233
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,004
Professor.

273
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,016
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,558
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,599
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...

276
00:25:57,774 --> 00:26:00,368
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,669
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:07,212
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,850
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:14,279
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,688
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:24,961
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,694
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,233
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,471
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,133
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:38,975
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.

288
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,385
It's been 14 years.

289
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:48,418
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,758
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,461
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,506
You keep it.

293
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:12,381
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,416
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:18,612
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:20,990
I love you.

297
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:23,749
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,290
There they are. They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,760
Bye.

300
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:12,909
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,544
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:18,011
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.

303
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:24,577
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,621
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,290
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:51,441
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,277
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,855
What is it?

309
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:13,299
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,437
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:19,306
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,154
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,960
I can see them too.

314
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:43,827
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,699
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,412
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:01,683
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:04,381
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:07,350
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,620
Hungry.

321
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:15,266
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:19,863
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,176
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:38,217
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:41,417
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,154
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,788
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:52,628
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:55,969
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:56,276 --> 00:31:00,007
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:05,808
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...

332
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:19,626
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:25,499
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:30,536
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,543
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:39,112
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,515
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:47,326
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:47,494 --> 00:31:53,091
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:55,730
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:55,902 --> 00:32:00,738
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:08,440
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.

343
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:13,017
Let us preserve what must be preserved...

344
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:16,678
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:23,456
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,634
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:39,177
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:42,075
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,810
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:07,335
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,768
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,374
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:16,013
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.

354
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:19,483
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:23,288
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,789
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,859
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:30,121
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:30,297 --> 00:33:33,790
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:36,460
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:39,732
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:41,534
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,511
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:56,355
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:59,322
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:03,660
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,738
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,191
Harry.

369
00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:58,813
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,589
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,639
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:26,808
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:29,577
O-W-Ls.

374
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:34,314
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,619
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:43,228
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:53,867
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:56,170
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...

379
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:59,837
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:02,711
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,648
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,346
Using spells?

383
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:11,983
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,289
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:20,459
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,401
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:26,508
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,547
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:35,480
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...

390
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,620
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:40,222
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.

392
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,188
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?

393
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,386
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,589
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:52,030
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:07,206
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:09,219
You have been told...

398
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:14,757
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.

399
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:20,057
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:21,858
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,193
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

402
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,802
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,132
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:30,774
Enough!

405
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:33,137
Enough.

406
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:37,611
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:03,567
Come in.

408
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,748
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:12,645
Sit.

410
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:24,261
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,293
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:29,729
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,272
Now...

414
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:43,111
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

415
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:47,083
How many times?

416
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,183
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:55,853
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:57,518
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:50,271
Yes?

420
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,991
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:05,853
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,090
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:11,429
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,267
Go on.

425
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,583
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,382
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:34,323
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,660
Care for another?

429
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,355
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.

430
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,502
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,766
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:48,704
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:53,107
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:00,245
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,255
Nothing.

436
00:41:03,524 --> 00:41:05,424
The other hand.

437
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:09,758
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:12,125
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.

439
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:14,426
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:17,035
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.

441
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:21,140
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,412
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,107
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:33,117
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.

445
00:41:34,154 --> 00:41:36,179
You don't understand.

446
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:40,726
Then help us to.

447
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:57,307
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,574
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:04,344
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:11,720
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:15,893
I know you, of all people, will understand.

452
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:52,193
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:59,466
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,402
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:08,039
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:18,019
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:23,757
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:28,328
Different.

459
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:33,805
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:37,503
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.

461
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:42,242
So you've known someone who's died, then?

462
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,045
My mum.

463
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:49,490
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:52,957
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:55,528
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:43:56,098 --> 00:43:58,293
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:03,803
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.

468
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,669
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,739
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

470
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:18,011
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:22,557
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.

472
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,056
I don't think that's true.

473
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:29,556
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:29,732 --> 00:44:31,496
What do you mean?

475
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,031
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...

477
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:40,937
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:44,109
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:06,498
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:10,931
Harry.

481
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,004
Can I join you?

482
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:19,040
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:21,979
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:26,418
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,250
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:32,555
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...

487
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,060
...Minerva.

488
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,691
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.

489
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,438
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,938
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:48,236
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:50,004
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:55,243
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,784
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:04,483
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:08,120
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.

497
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,443
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,172
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,010
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:32,144
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,822
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,765
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:53,137
You've been in this post how long, exactly?

504
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:05,047
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,213
Yes.

506
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,253
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,896
Obviously.

508
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,667
Could you please predict something for me?

509
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:52,597
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:00,038
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:09,278
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,594
Pity.

513
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:19,563
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.

514
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:21,926
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:26,728
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:29,935
Lovely.

517
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,280
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:44,787
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,112
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,226
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:25,029
You can't do this.

522
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,729
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,976
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,808
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.

525
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:43,940
There...

526
00:49:57,863 --> 00:50:02,528
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,304
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:07,963
Thank you.

529
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:13,169
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...

530
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:16,612
...of Educational Decree Number
23, as enacted by the minister...

531
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:19,946
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,681
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:26,883
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,157
For now.

535
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:38,594
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:39,932
Professor.

537
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:42,867
Professor?

538
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:46,142
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:48,440
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,220
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:06,791
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:09,193
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:14,033
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:17,040
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:20,078
...that these disappearances are the work...

546
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:23,649
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,943
Harry.

548
00:51:26,187 --> 00:51:27,881
Sirius.

549
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,319
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:51:31,492 --> 00:51:34,393
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:36,496
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:36,663 --> 00:51:39,633
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:44,062
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:45,227
Combat?

555
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,641
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,209
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:54,314
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:58,148
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.

559
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,977
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:02,524 --> 00:52:05,357
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.

561
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:08,155
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...

562
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:12,322
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:16,468
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,270
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:20,307
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:22,671
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:27,839
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:41,727
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:46,227
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:50,568
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.

571
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:09,750
Harry.

572
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:21,701
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:23,098
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:27,767
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,468
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,312
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:34,483 --> 00:53:36,611
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:43,056
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:48,889
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:51,226
Matey, come back here.

581
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:00,836
Hi.

582
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:04,145
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:05,542
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,411
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,882
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:14,820
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:17,050
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.

588
00:54:17,227 --> 00:54:18,785
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:21,089
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:23,664
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:25,034 --> 00:54:28,060
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:54:31,174 --> 00:54:34,941
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:38,547
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:41,343
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:46,088
Yes.

596
00:54:47,557 --> 00:54:48,991
I've seen it.

597
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,285
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.

598
00:54:51,962 --> 00:54:56,091
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:57,495
It's true.

600
00:54:57,668 --> 00:55:00,432
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,537
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,005
Wait.

603
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,237
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:11,415 --> 00:55:14,976
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.

605
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:18,983
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:22,648
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:29,893
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.

608
00:55:30,935 --> 00:55:34,371
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:36,028
But out there...

610
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,939
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...

611
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,807
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:48,382
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:55:58,162 --> 00:56:00,063
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,925
That's why we need your help.

615
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:06,002
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...

616
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:09,365
...Voldemort...

617
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,540
He's really back.

618
00:56:36,868 --> 00:56:38,528
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...

619
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:40,102
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,432
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,576
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:47,837
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:49,173
Who cares?

624
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:54,650
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?

625
00:56:54,819 --> 00:56:57,083
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

626
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,453
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,923
What's that?

628
00:57:04,664 --> 00:57:07,326
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?

629
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:13,129
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...

630
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,138
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:20,141
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,143
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:35,019
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:38,789
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

635
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,466
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:21,435
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:22,733
The what?

638
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:25,308
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:28,915
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:31,744
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:35,649
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:58:36,822 --> 00:58:41,657
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.

643
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:46,697
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,233
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:05,783
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:09,718
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:17,120
You will please copy the
approved text four times...

648
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:20,289
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:24,364
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:59:24,538 --> 00:59:26,563
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,580
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.

652
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:44,987
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:48,720
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:56,635
Stupefy!

655
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:05,979
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:13,445
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,811
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,687
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:23,729
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:26,290
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:34,706
Stupefy.

662
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:42,349
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:47,347
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?

664
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,115
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:17,752 --> 01:01:20,687
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,950
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.

667
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:29,497
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,626
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:37,227
Great.

670
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:40,099
A little higher.

671
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,416
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:12,067
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:17,009
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

674
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:20,046
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,842
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:27,756 --> 01:02:32,057
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:34,423
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:36,723
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:38,457
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:42,626
Every great wizard in
history has started out...

681
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:46,874
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.

682
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:49,978
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:01,920
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:05,458
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:09,654
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:16,501
Reducto.

687
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:33,011
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:35,555
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:41,521
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:48,770
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:52,533
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:56,109
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.

693
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:59,539
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.

694
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:03,083
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.

695
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:09,324
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:10,926
Thanks.

697
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,966
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:28,412 --> 01:04:30,471
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:34,578
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:04:36,353 --> 01:04:38,720
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:41,556
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:43,590
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,354
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,930
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:51,761
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:54,460
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:10,149
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,687
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:16,189
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:24,696
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:28,906
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...

712
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:31,804
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:34,777
He was really good.

714
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:38,144
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,485
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:48,659
I've never been able to stun anything before.

717
01:05:57,804 --> 01:05:59,464
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:02,975 --> 01:06:04,909
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:07,673
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,110
No idea.

721
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:34,334
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:36,870
Wet.

723
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:39,040
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,381
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:41,548 --> 01:06:44,278
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,281
Cho spends half her time crying these days.

727
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:51,720
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.

728
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:56,060
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:03,925
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:07,164
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:07,341 --> 01:07:10,572
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:10,744 --> 01:07:14,475
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:19,978
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.

734
01:07:20,154 --> 01:07:23,384
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...

735
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:40,864
Harry.

736
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,708
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:56,378
Something he didn't have last time.

738
01:07:57,223 --> 01:07:58,484
Harry.

739
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,387
Harry.

740
01:08:32,492 --> 01:08:35,894
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...

741
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:37,552
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:41,000
Neither. It was like I...

743
01:08:41,568 --> 01:08:43,660
Will you please just tell me what's happening?

744
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:46,168
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:48,739
Make sure he's found by the right people.

746
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:50,467
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:52,942
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:08:53,113 --> 01:08:55,741
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...

749
01:08:55,916 --> 01:09:00,079
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.

750
01:09:00,253 --> 01:09:03,313
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:06,014
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:08,093
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

753
01:09:08,262 --> 01:09:09,456
Look at me!

754
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:18,199
What's happening to me?

755
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,945
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:09:28,115 --> 01:09:33,018
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.

757
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,321
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,687
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:45,195
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.

760
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:49,530
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:09:49,903 --> 01:09:52,929
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:56,372
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:09:56,844 --> 01:10:01,248
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:10:01,415 --> 01:10:03,281
...unhinge it.

765
01:10:03,451 --> 01:10:06,818
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:10:06,988 --> 01:10:09,218
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,985
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:18,930
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...

769
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:23,366
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:10:23,538 --> 01:10:24,766
...kill them.

771
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,173
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...

772
01:10:28,342 --> 01:10:31,835
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:10:32,013 --> 01:10:36,779
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.

774
01:10:37,352 --> 01:10:40,446
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:42,189
Prepare yourself.

776
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:46,154
Legilimens.

777
01:10:54,269 --> 01:10:57,864
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:25,393
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:29,264
Here we go.

780
01:11:29,437 --> 01:11:31,599
Daddy's back.

781
01:11:34,777 --> 01:11:38,405
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:42,950
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:11:45,754 --> 01:11:47,949
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:11:48,123 --> 01:11:50,421
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:11:50,593 --> 01:11:52,992
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:11:53,162 --> 01:11:57,462
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:11:57,633 --> 01:12:00,500
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:12:00,669 --> 01:12:02,694
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:12:02,871 --> 01:12:04,771
There you are.

790
01:12:05,774 --> 01:12:07,605
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:10,043
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:12,180
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:12:12,348 --> 01:12:14,077
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,616
Fred? George?

795
01:12:15,785 --> 01:12:18,309
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:12:18,488 --> 01:12:20,352
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:24,224
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:12:27,797 --> 01:12:30,129
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,527
Harry.

800
01:12:32,535 --> 01:12:35,128
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.

801
01:12:35,304 --> 01:12:37,670
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:12:38,608 --> 01:12:41,338
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:44,643
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,645
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,680
I don't know why...

806
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:59,287
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.

807
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:04,195
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:07,359
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:10,398
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:13,406
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!

811
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,567
Of course, master.

812
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:20,444
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:13:22,752 --> 01:13:24,652
Sorry about that.

814
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:28,884
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,318
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:34,096
What, you grew up here?

817
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:36,528
This is my parents' house.

818
01:13:36,866 --> 01:13:40,701
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:13:41,838 --> 01:13:45,103
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.

820
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,876
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,907
My deranged cousin.

822
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,813
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:13:54,985 --> 01:13:59,683
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:14:02,893 --> 01:14:06,693
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:10,897
Charming woman.

826
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:13,795
I was 16.

827
01:14:14,638 --> 01:14:16,071
Where did you go?

828
01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:19,403
Round your dad's.

829
01:14:20,911 --> 01:14:23,436
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:14:24,348 --> 01:14:27,078
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,913
You are so very much alike.

832
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:32,823
I'm not so sure.

833
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:35,324
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:42,691
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.

835
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:45,359
I was the snake.

836
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:49,138
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:14:49,306 --> 01:14:53,504
...there was a moment when I wanted to...

838
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:01,516
This connection between me and Voldemort.

839
01:15:02,187 --> 01:15:05,782
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:12,027
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:15:12,196 --> 01:15:16,759
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:15:16,935 --> 01:15:20,496
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:26,372
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.

844
01:15:27,579 --> 01:15:30,548
You're not a bad person.

845
01:15:31,383 --> 01:15:35,751
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.

846
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:37,480
You understand?

847
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:44,619
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:15:44,796 --> 01:15:49,256
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.

849
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:53,266
What matters is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:57,505
That's who we really are.

851
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:03,009
Harry, time to go.

852
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:09,049
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:10,813
You'll see.

854
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:13,323
Come on.

855
01:16:50,763 --> 01:16:51,922
Really?

856
01:16:52,097 --> 01:16:54,725
Harry. Harry.

857
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,835
Hagrid's back.

858
01:16:59,772 --> 01:17:01,603
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:15,821 --> 01:17:18,984
I will say this one last time.

860
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:21,658
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.

861
01:17:21,827 --> 01:17:24,853
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:29,362
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:17:29,536 --> 01:17:34,370
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:38,900
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.

865
01:17:39,078 --> 01:17:42,343
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

866
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:04,395
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:07,671
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.

868
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,331
Giants?

869
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:11,566
You found them?

870
01:18:11,745 --> 01:18:15,647
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:19,541
I tried to convince them to join the cause.

872
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,417
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.

873
01:18:23,123 --> 01:18:25,023
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:28,825
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,695
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:35,961
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:40,870
And they did this to you?

878
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:43,338
Not exactly, no.

879
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,746
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.

880
01:19:01,728 --> 01:19:03,855
It's changing out there.

881
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:05,856
Just like last time.

882
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:08,962
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,763
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:19:49,777 --> 01:19:52,804
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...

885
01:19:52,981 --> 01:19:55,814
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.

886
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:59,646
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:01,915
We strongly suspect...

888
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:04,749
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:20:04,927 --> 01:20:09,124
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:13,530
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:20:14,969 --> 01:20:19,339
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:31,948
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.

893
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,284
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.

894
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:36,583
Harry.

895
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,286
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:20:42,898 --> 01:20:47,062
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

897
01:20:47,236 --> 01:20:53,141
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.

898
01:21:00,082 --> 01:21:01,674
Neville?

899
01:21:14,263 --> 01:21:16,390
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:21:16,565 --> 01:21:20,832
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:21:21,004 --> 01:21:24,200
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:21:24,773 --> 01:21:28,733
She tortured them for information...

903
01:21:28,912 --> 01:21:31,072
...but they never gave in.

904
01:21:32,749 --> 01:21:35,240
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:21:36,218 --> 01:21:40,087
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:21:46,029 --> 01:21:50,159
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.

907
01:21:54,404 --> 01:21:58,101
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:21:58,274 --> 01:22:01,710
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:22:01,878 --> 01:22:03,277
George, your turn now.

910
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:06,945
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:22:07,884 --> 01:22:11,320
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...

912
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:15,321
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:22:15,491 --> 01:22:16,720
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:22:17,427 --> 01:22:18,985
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:23,189
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:25,665
So focus, Luna.

917
01:22:29,372 --> 01:22:31,068
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:33,209
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:36,243
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:22:36,413 --> 01:22:40,678
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.

921
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:43,817
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:23:25,663 --> 01:23:28,188
I'll make short work of this.

923
01:23:29,533 --> 01:23:31,524
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:51,185
Get them.

925
01:23:51,622 --> 01:23:53,090
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:23:53,258 --> 01:23:55,191
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:23:55,627 --> 01:23:59,324
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:24:00,698 --> 01:24:02,757
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:04,458
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:06,695
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:24:06,871 --> 01:24:10,705
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:11,863
Naturally.

933
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:14,567
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

934
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:18,409
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...

935
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:23,417
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:24:23,587 --> 01:24:26,215
I instructed Harry to form this organization.

937
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:29,849
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.

938
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:31,858
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:34,555
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

940
01:24:34,732 --> 01:24:39,534
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:24:39,704 --> 01:24:41,137
...to Azkaban...

942
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:47,539
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:50,647
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:24:51,816 --> 01:24:55,252
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...

945
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,253
What was the phrase?

946
01:24:57,422 --> 01:24:59,014
...come quietly.

947
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,886
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:25:01,326 --> 01:25:03,625
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:25:03,796 --> 01:25:05,057
Enough of this.

950
01:25:05,563 --> 01:25:06,656
Take him.

951
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:23,881
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,177
...but you can't deny...

953
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,449
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:58,176
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:01,786
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

956
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:06,982
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:11,459
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.

958
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:24,262
Harry.

959
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:34,612
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.

960
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:37,147
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.

961
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:40,212
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:27:40,387 --> 01:27:42,480
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:44,625
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:49,322
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.

965
01:27:51,364 --> 01:27:53,799
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:27:54,868 --> 01:27:59,067
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,902
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:05,239
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

969
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:09,415
To go it alone.

970
01:28:15,756 --> 01:28:17,416
Hagrid.

971
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,596
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:26,824
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:37,805
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,540
And they're dangerous at the best of times.

975
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,814
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,181
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.

977
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:48,015
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,419
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:55,551
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:59,360
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.

981
01:28:59,533 --> 01:29:03,026
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:08,869
Grawpy.

983
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,372
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,416
Grawpy.

985
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:23,885
Brought you some company.

986
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:38,502
I couldn't just leave him, because...

987
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:40,403
Because he's my brother.

988
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:41,701
Blimey.

989
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,902
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:49,346
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:53,819
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:56,389
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?

993
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,822
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:00,291
Grawpy.

995
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,793
Grawp.

996
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:10,897
Put me down.

997
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:16,134
Now.

998
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,382
You all right?

999
01:30:30,693 --> 01:30:32,353
Fine.

1000
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,060
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:37,631
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:30:40,136 --> 01:30:42,297
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:31:12,435 --> 01:31:15,165
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:19,499
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.

1005
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:23,073
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,275
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,728
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:31:45,002 --> 01:31:48,835
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:31:49,138 --> 01:31:52,631
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:31:55,077 --> 01:31:58,241
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:31:58,415 --> 01:32:02,545
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,983
You're just like your father.

1013
01:32:06,155 --> 01:32:07,953
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,355
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:32:10,527 --> 01:32:12,688
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:15,264
Control your emotions.

1017
01:32:15,432 --> 01:32:18,367
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:32:21,205 --> 01:32:22,399
Legilimens.

1019
01:32:29,613 --> 01:32:30,705
Harry.

1020
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:32,610
Sirius.

1021
01:32:33,283 --> 01:32:34,615
I may vomit.

1022
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:35,942
Stop it.

1023
01:32:37,087 --> 01:32:39,385
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,950
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.

1025
01:32:43,127 --> 01:32:46,528
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:50,065
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:32:50,234 --> 01:32:54,193
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:32:54,372 --> 01:32:57,739
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.

1029
01:32:57,909 --> 01:33:01,867
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:33:02,045 --> 01:33:05,071
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:33:06,117 --> 01:33:07,606
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:33:13,191 --> 01:33:14,715
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:16,952
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:33:17,128 --> 01:33:18,959
Nice one, James.

1035
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:21,628
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1036
01:33:21,799 --> 01:33:23,790
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:33:23,968 --> 01:33:26,630
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1038
01:33:26,804 --> 01:33:29,068
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,434
Enough.

1040
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:34,002
Enough.

1041
01:33:42,521 --> 01:33:45,114
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:46,416
I...

1043
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:49,856
Get out.

1044
01:34:07,078 --> 01:34:09,239
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:34:09,414 --> 01:34:11,315
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:34:11,483 --> 01:34:14,509
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:34:14,687 --> 01:34:16,712
It's fading already.

1048
01:34:16,889 --> 01:34:21,621
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:31,731
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:34:31,904 --> 01:34:35,669
...naughty children deserve to be punished.

1051
01:34:38,743 --> 01:34:40,075
You know, George...

1052
01:34:40,245 --> 01:34:43,908
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:48,645
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:36:00,592 --> 01:36:02,254
All right, professor!

1055
01:36:11,037 --> 01:36:12,800
Here you go.

1056
01:36:37,765 --> 01:36:39,595
Ready when you are.

1057
01:38:05,353 --> 01:38:08,618
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,587
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:38:11,459 --> 01:38:16,020
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:17,893
Crucio.

1061
01:38:20,435 --> 01:38:22,198
Crucio.

1062
01:38:33,582 --> 01:38:35,049
Sirius.

1063
01:38:35,217 --> 01:38:36,206
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:38:36,384 --> 01:38:38,852
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,885
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:38:41,056 --> 01:38:43,115
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:45,225
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.

1068
01:38:45,393 --> 01:38:48,692
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:38:48,864 --> 01:38:50,798
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,291
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?

1071
01:38:55,605 --> 01:38:58,733
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:38:58,908 --> 01:39:02,399
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1073
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:06,069
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:39:08,683 --> 01:39:09,673
What do we do?

1075
01:39:11,086 --> 01:39:12,714
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:39:12,889 --> 01:39:14,947
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.

1077
01:39:15,123 --> 01:39:16,681
Not all of them.

1078
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:20,825
Alohomora.

1079
01:39:32,073 --> 01:39:33,769
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:39:33,943 --> 01:39:37,503
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,309
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:39:41,484 --> 01:39:44,715
That you are.

1083
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:47,754
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:39:52,762 --> 01:39:54,855
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?

1085
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:57,056
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:39:57,233 --> 01:40:00,066
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:40:00,236 --> 01:40:03,694
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,664
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:08,742
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:12,040
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:17,586
Unless you wish to poison him...

1092
01:40:17,754 --> 01:40:22,190
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,726
...I cannot help you.

1094
01:40:27,163 --> 01:40:28,859
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:33,391
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.

1096
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:35,996
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:40:36,172 --> 01:40:37,697
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:40:44,381 --> 01:40:46,372
No idea.

1099
01:40:50,886 --> 01:40:52,445
Very well.

1100
01:40:53,456 --> 01:40:55,789
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:59,128
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:40:59,295 --> 01:41:01,355
...you leave me with...

1103
01:41:02,099 --> 01:41:04,067
...no alternative.

1104
01:41:04,868 --> 01:41:07,063
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:41:07,237 --> 01:41:08,226
That's illegal.

1106
01:41:08,405 --> 01:41:11,772
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.

1107
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:20,806
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,752
Tell me what?

1109
01:41:24,955 --> 01:41:26,946
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:29,387
...I will.

1111
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:32,825
Where what is?

1112
01:41:34,032 --> 01:41:36,329
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:41:41,338 --> 01:41:42,863
How much further?

1114
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:44,701
Not far.

1115
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:50,407
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:41:54,752 --> 01:41:56,219
What are you doing?

1117
01:41:56,387 --> 01:41:58,183
Improvising.

1118
01:42:06,696 --> 01:42:08,289
Well?

1119
01:42:09,599 --> 01:42:11,727
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:42:16,641 --> 01:42:18,905
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,840
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:42:28,052 --> 01:42:29,610
You know...

1123
01:42:31,022 --> 01:42:33,047
...I really hate children.

1124
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,077
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:42:55,747 --> 01:42:57,407
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:42:57,582 --> 01:43:03,111
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1127
01:43:03,287 --> 01:43:04,516
Protego.

1128
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,915
How dare you?

1129
01:43:06,557 --> 01:43:08,082
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,850
Incarcerous.

1131
01:43:23,074 --> 01:43:25,669
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:43:25,843 --> 01:43:30,508
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:43:39,358 --> 01:43:41,918
You filthy animal.

1134
01:43:42,094 --> 01:43:45,063
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:48,063
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:43:48,233 --> 01:43:50,098
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:43:57,777 --> 01:44:01,234
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:44:01,413 --> 01:44:03,348
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:44:03,516 --> 01:44:05,312
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:44:05,484 --> 01:44:06,474
What are you doing?

1141
01:44:06,653 --> 01:44:10,486
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:44:10,956 --> 01:44:13,151
Let me go!

1143
01:44:15,827 --> 01:44:17,625
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:44:17,797 --> 01:44:21,289
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:44:29,573 --> 01:44:33,134
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:35,437
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.

1147
01:44:35,612 --> 01:44:38,172
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:44:39,015 --> 01:44:40,506
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:44:41,351 --> 01:44:43,842
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1150
01:44:44,021 --> 01:44:45,818
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:50,717
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:54,257
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:44:54,431 --> 01:44:57,400
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.

1154
01:44:57,734 --> 01:44:59,861
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:04,935
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:12,007
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:45:13,417 --> 01:45:15,647
We fly, of course.

1158
01:46:06,704 --> 01:46:08,865
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:46:17,715 --> 01:46:19,410
This is it.

1160
01:47:12,404 --> 01:47:14,735
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.

1161
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:17,805
Ninety-four.

1162
01:47:19,077 --> 01:47:20,101
Ninety-five.

1163
01:47:32,658 --> 01:47:35,422
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:39,427
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:48:04,623 --> 01:48:08,993
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:12,263
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...

1167
01:48:12,432 --> 01:48:15,230
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:48:20,873 --> 01:48:26,243
For neither can live while the other survives.

1169
01:48:28,748 --> 01:48:29,840
Harry.

1170
01:48:40,326 --> 01:48:41,816
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:48:41,995 --> 01:48:47,092
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:48:50,003 --> 01:48:52,164
...and reality.

1173
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:58,376
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1174
01:48:59,078 --> 01:49:00,568
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:02,840
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:49:05,619 --> 01:49:08,179
He knows how to play.

1177
01:49:08,355 --> 01:49:12,154
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:49:12,325 --> 01:49:13,554
Potter.

1179
01:49:14,094 --> 01:49:15,993
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:49:16,162 --> 01:49:19,097
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:49:19,266 --> 01:49:21,130
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:28,772
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:49:29,242 --> 01:49:30,733
...shall we?

1184
01:49:30,911 --> 01:49:33,379
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:49:33,547 --> 01:49:35,741
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?

1186
01:49:35,915 --> 01:49:37,543
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:49:39,086 --> 01:49:40,678
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:49:40,853 --> 01:49:43,448
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:49:45,392 --> 01:49:50,853
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:49:51,031 --> 01:49:53,761
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:49:57,538 --> 01:49:59,472
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:05,172
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:50:05,913 --> 01:50:08,404
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:11,107
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:50:12,486 --> 01:50:17,287
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:50:18,225 --> 01:50:22,628
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1197
01:50:23,831 --> 01:50:25,822
All you have to do...

1198
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,334
...is give it to me.

1199
01:50:28,635 --> 01:50:31,934
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:50:40,681 --> 01:50:42,478
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:44,381
I know.

1202
01:50:45,686 --> 01:50:48,621
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:50,223
Stupefy.

1204
01:51:06,373 --> 01:51:07,363
Levicorpus.

1205
01:51:13,915 --> 01:51:15,940
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:51:16,117 --> 01:51:17,914
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:51:26,361 --> 01:51:27,919
Stupefy.

1208
01:51:29,664 --> 01:51:30,892
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1209
01:51:42,043 --> 01:51:43,943
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:51,486 --> 01:51:53,784
Reducto.

1211
01:52:09,805 --> 01:52:11,898
Get back to the door.

1212
01:52:47,209 --> 01:52:51,703
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,819
The voices.

1214
01:52:59,389 --> 01:53:01,413
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:53:03,092 --> 01:53:05,254
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:53:05,995 --> 01:53:07,759
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:09,522
I hear them too.

1218
01:53:12,635 --> 01:53:15,263
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,440
Please, Harry.

1220
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,075
Get behind me.

1221
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:11,321
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:54:11,494 --> 01:54:16,091
...or were you truly naive enough to think...

1223
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:21,832
...that children stood a chance against us?

1224
01:54:25,342 --> 01:54:29,073
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:36,116
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:54:36,287 --> 01:54:40,279
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:54:53,204 --> 01:54:54,602
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:55:20,898 --> 01:55:23,663
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:55:53,764 --> 01:55:56,358
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.

1230
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:58,533
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:55:58,704 --> 01:56:01,537
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:56:02,173 --> 01:56:03,835
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:56:04,009 --> 01:56:04,997
Black.

1234
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:33,501
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:56:33,672 --> 01:56:35,003
Nice one, James.

1236
01:56:42,248 --> 01:56:43,714
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:57:03,935 --> 01:57:06,234
No. No.

1238
01:57:30,196 --> 01:57:32,857
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:35,800
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1240
01:57:48,147 --> 01:57:51,275
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:55,216
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:57:59,058 --> 01:58:02,255
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:58:13,806 --> 01:58:15,434
Do it.

1244
01:58:23,115 --> 01:58:26,084
So weak.

1245
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:36,057
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.

1246
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:37,959
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:58:38,131 --> 01:58:42,329
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:45,963
...shall be dead.

1249
02:01:00,275 --> 02:01:02,175
You've lost, old man.

1250
02:01:22,331 --> 02:01:23,320
Harry.

1251
02:01:27,469 --> 02:01:28,959
So weak.

1252
02:01:29,471 --> 02:01:31,701
So vulnerable.

1253
02:01:36,011 --> 02:01:37,000
Look at me.

1254
02:01:39,548 --> 02:01:43,780
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
02:01:43,952 --> 02:01:46,443
It's how you are not.

1256
02:01:51,393 --> 02:01:52,884
Harry?

1257
02:02:25,295 --> 02:02:26,762
You're the weak one...

1258
02:02:27,363 --> 02:02:31,493
...and you'll never know love or friendship.

1259
02:02:34,903 --> 02:02:37,805
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
02:03:00,864 --> 02:03:04,322
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
02:03:05,268 --> 02:03:10,399
And you will lose everything.

1262
02:03:25,355 --> 02:03:27,017
He's back.

1263
02:04:34,758 --> 02:04:36,420
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
02:04:36,595 --> 02:04:38,186
No, you don't.

1265
02:04:43,834 --> 02:04:45,234
It's my fault.

1266
02:04:45,403 --> 02:04:48,668
No, the fault is mine.

1267
02:04:49,673 --> 02:04:51,437
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
02:04:51,610 --> 02:04:54,670
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1269
02:04:55,479 --> 02:04:59,746
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1270
02:04:59,918 --> 02:05:05,151
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:11,292
The prophecy said:

1272
02:05:11,896 --> 02:05:15,855
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."

1273
02:05:17,202 --> 02:05:23,266
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:05:25,277 --> 02:05:26,835
Yes.

1275
02:05:27,313 --> 02:05:28,870
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:05:29,047 --> 02:05:32,642
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:05:32,818 --> 02:05:35,251
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:05:36,088 --> 02:05:39,614
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:05:39,791 --> 02:05:42,692
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.

1280
02:05:44,163 --> 02:05:46,289
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:06:11,157 --> 02:06:13,455
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:06:13,626 --> 02:06:18,188
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1283
02:06:18,364 --> 02:06:19,353
That's awful.

1284
02:06:19,532 --> 02:06:21,432
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,058
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:06:25,237 --> 02:06:27,603
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:06:30,509 --> 02:06:33,706
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:06:40,753 --> 02:06:42,812
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

1289
02:06:42,988 --> 02:06:44,649
That's all right.

1290
02:06:44,824 --> 02:06:46,985
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:51,027
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:06:54,266 --> 02:06:57,532
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:06:59,038 --> 02:07:01,734
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:07:37,411 --> 02:07:40,312
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,174
What's that?

1296
02:07:42,783 --> 02:07:45,547
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:07:45,719 --> 02:07:48,813
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:07:48,989 --> 02:07:50,479
Yeah?

1299
02:07:52,392 --> 02:07:54,758
Something worth fighting for.

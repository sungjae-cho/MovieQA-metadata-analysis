1
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:16,251
That was when the icecaps had melted
because of the greenhouse gases...

2
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,921
...and the oceans
had drowned cities...

3
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,798
...along all the shorelines
of the world.

4
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:26,178
Amsterdam, Venice, New York...

5
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,221
...forever lost.

6
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,099
Millions of people were displaced.

7
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,894
Climate became chaotic.

8
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:37,773
Hundreds of millions of people
starved in poorer countries.

9
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,652
A high degree of prosperity survived
when the developed world...

10
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:46,490
...introduced sanctions
to license pregnancies...

11
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:51,369
... which was why robots,
who did not consume resources...

12
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,955
...beyond those of
their first manufacture...

13
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,792
... were so essential
an economic link...

14
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,629
...in the chain mail of society.

15
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:04,633
To create an artificial being
has been man's dream...

16
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,469
...since the birth of science.

17
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:11,973
Not merely from the modern age
when our forebears created...

18
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:16,436
...the first thinking machines,
primitive ones that played chess.

19
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:18,855
How far we have come!

20
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:25,612
The artificial being is a reality,
a perfect simulacrum...

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,825
...articulated in limb,
articulate in speech...

22
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:34,370
...and not lacking in human response.

23
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:43,004
And even pain-memory response.

24
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:51,387
How did that make you feel?
Angry? Shocked?

25
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:55,475
-I don't understand.
-What did I do to your feelings?

26
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,685
You did it to my hand.

27
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,563
All right.

28
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,567
There's the rub.

29
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,694
Undress.

30
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:12,158
At Cybertronics, the artificial being
has reached its highest form.

31
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,452
The universally adapted Mecha...

32
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,955
...the basis for hundreds of models
serving humans...

33
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,708
...in all the multiplicity
of daily life.

34
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,710
That's far enough.

35
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:26,964
But we have no reason
to congratulate ourselves.

36
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:31,135
We are rightly proud of it.

37
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,929
But what does it amount to?

38
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,556
Sheila, open.

39
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,328
A sensory toy...

40
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,998
...with intelligent
behavioral circuits...

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,126
...using neurone-sequencing
technology...

42
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,421
...as old as I am.

43
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:14,261
I believe that my work on mapping
the impulse pathways in a neurone...

44
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,264
...can enable us to construct...

45
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:21,435
...a Mecha of
a qualitatively different order.

46
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,271
I propose...

47
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:27,774
...that we build a robot...

48
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,402
...who can love.

49
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,945
Love?

50
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:37,492
But we ship thousands
of lover-models every month.

51
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:41,872
Of course. You're your own
best customer, Syatyoo-Sama.

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,375
Quality control is very important.

53
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,473
Tell me, what is love?

54
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,018
Love is first widening my eyes...

55
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:06,730
...quickening my breathing,
warming my skin and--

56
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:10,150
And so on, exactly so.
Thank you, Sheila.

57
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:14,154
I wasn't referring
to sensuality simulators.

58
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:17,198
The word that I used was "love."

59
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,285
Like the love of a child
for its parents.

60
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:24,914
I propose that we build
a robot-child who can love.

61
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:29,794
A robot-child who will genuinely love
the parent it imprints on...

62
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,921
...with a love that never ends.

63
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,048
A child-substitute Mecha?

64
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:38,136
But a Mecha with a mind,
with neuronal feedback.

65
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:41,472
I'm suggesting
that love will be the key...

66
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:45,351
...by which they acquire
a subconscious never before achieved.

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,979
An inner world of metaphor,
of intuition...

68
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,858
...of self-motivated reasoning,
of dreams.

69
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:56,654
A robot that dreams?
How exactly do we pull this off?

70
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,157
It occurs to me...

71
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:03,411
...with all this animus existing
against Mechas today...

72
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:07,373
...it isn't just creating
a robot who can love.

73
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:12,086
But isn't the real conundrum,
can a human love them back?

74
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:17,091
Ours will be a perfect child, always
loving, never ill, never changing.

75
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,970
With all the childless couples
yearning for a license...

76
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:26,100
...our Mecha will open up a new
market and fill a great human need.

77
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,228
But you haven't answered my question.

78
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:33,399
If a robot could genuinely
love a person...

79
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,738
...what responsibility does that person
hold toward that Mecha in return?

80
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,785
-It's a moral question, isn't it?
-The oldest one of all.

81
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:49,415
But in the beginning, didn't God
create Adam to love him?

82
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:22,590
"The baby was born
as the first leaves of autumn fell.

83
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:26,845
A baby boy.
And Marian's wish came true.

84
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,264
The boy had white hair.

85
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:33,351
He was baptized Martin,
after his grandfather."

86
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,528
Dr. Frazier, good to see you.

87
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,990
There was an article in
the Journal of Chinese Medicine.

88
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,199
Hello, Monica.

89
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:52,287
They talked about virus locators.
Did you read it?

90
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,372
I can still hear you.

91
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,379
-I'm worried about her.
-I know.

92
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:05,883
She feels that she should mourn
the death of your son.

93
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:09,303
After five years, you feel
you should mourn too.

94
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:13,641
But medicine says mourning is
inappropriate. Martin is pending.

95
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,434
Pending.

96
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:21,649
So all her grief goes undigested.

97
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:27,071
Henry, your son may be
beyond our science.

98
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:30,700
But it's your wife
who can still be reached.

99
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:45,256
The screening process was tougher
than building the prototype.

100
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:49,760
Of our 2000 employees,
only a few met your requirements.

101
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,053
Initiate.

102
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,430
Employment record,
quality of lifestyle.

103
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,851
Query. Internal data.

104
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,106
Loyalty to the firm,
and in this individual's case...

105
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:06,610
...a family tragedy that may
qualify him above the rest.

106
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,865
I'll see him.

107
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:17,121
Henry!

108
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,916
-Don't kill me.
-What are you doing?

109
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,921
I love you. Don't kill me.

110
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,801
The door's closed.

111
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,841
I like your floor.

112
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,648
I can't accept this! There is
no substitute for your own child!

113
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:31,319
-It's not too late to take him back.
-What were you thinking?

114
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:35,824
-I'll do whatever you want.
-Do you think I can just...?

115
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:40,411
-I'll do whatever you want!
-I don't know what to do.

116
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:44,499
I'll return him to Cybertronics
in the morning.

117
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,459
It's gone.

118
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,588
Good.

119
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,301
I mean, Henry, did you see his face?

120
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,012
He's so real.

121
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,850
-But he's not.
-No, he's not.

122
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,189
-Inside, he's like the rest, isn't he?
-100 miles of fiber, yeah.

123
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:14,362
But outside, he just looks so real...

124
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,699
...like he is a child.

125
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,911
A Mecha-child.

126
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,253
A child.

127
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:08,749
The faith my company has placed
on me, on us, is extraordinary.

128
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,629
There are a few procedures to follow
if you decide to keep David.

129
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:18,217
If you keep him, an imprinting
protocol consisting of seven words...

130
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:22,179
...needs to be spoken to David
in this order here.

131
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:26,809
For our own protection,
this imprinting is irreversible.

132
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:31,271
His love would be sealed
and we'd be part of him forever.

133
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,484
Because of this, after imprinting,
no Mecha-child can be resold.

134
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,945
If a parent decides not to keep it...

135
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:41,281
...they must return it
to Cybertronics for destruction.

136
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,577
I had to sign an agreement or
they wouldn't let you see David.

137
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,205
You have to sign it too. Right here.

138
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,499
Monica...

139
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:54,544
...don't imprint until
you're entirely sure.

140
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:59,466
Silly man. Of course I'm not sure.

141
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,579
Would you like me to sleep now?

142
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,750
Good idea. Good idea.
Monica?

143
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:38,171
Well, it's late, you know.
It's after 9.

144
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,050
How late do they let you stay up?

145
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,219
I can never go to sleep.

146
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:47,764
But I can lay quietly
and not make a peep.

147
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:51,768
Those pajamas will fit.
We'll check on you in the morning.

148
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,728
Dress me?

149
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:58,483
I'm gonna say good night
while you boys be boys.

150
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,238
Raise your arms.

151
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,397
-Is it a game?
-Yes.

152
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,900
Hide-and-seek.

153
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,402
I found you.

154
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:55,283
That's your room. Just go and play.

155
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,389
I found you.

156
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,100
Out! Out! Get out of here!

157
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,978
And close the goddamn door!

158
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,874
Is it a game?

159
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:17,835
Now, I'm gonna read some words.

160
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:23,841
They won't make any sense, but I
want you to listen to them anyway.

161
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,011
And look at me all the time.

162
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,096
Can you do that?

163
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:31,015
Yes, Monica.

164
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:40,065
Can you feel my hand
on the back of your neck?

165
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,151
Yes.

166
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,195
-Does any of this hurt?
-No.

167
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,573
Okay, now...

168
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,741
...look at me.

169
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,161
Ready?

170
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,957
Cirrus.

171
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:01,336
Socrates.

172
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,007
Particle.

173
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,677
Decibel.

174
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:13,056
Hurricane.

175
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:14,933
Dolphin.

176
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:18,437
Tulip.

177
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,733
Monica.

178
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:26,236
David.

179
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,197
Monica.

180
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,460
All right.

181
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:46,756
I wonder if I did that right.

182
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:52,804
What were those words for, Mommy?

183
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,393
What did you call me?

184
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:01,688
Mommy.

185
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:06,526
Who am l, David?

186
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,116
You are my mommy.

187
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:39,183
You smell lovely. I love it
when you wear this stuff.

188
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,853
-Will you love me when it's all gone?
-No.

189
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:43,062
Stop it!

190
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:47,650
We can marry again and begin with
a scent that's not in short supply.

191
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:50,027
Come on, we're late.

192
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,116
-Hello, David.
-Hello, Henry.

193
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:58,369
Walk us out, sweetheart.
Come on!

194
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:01,914
My shoe!

195
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,257
-Your tie! You're hopeless!
-I'm helpless. He made our bed.

196
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:13,634
He's just trying so hard!

197
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:17,054
He's trying to please me.
He has a way with my coffee!

198
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:20,099
It's creepy.
You never hear him coming.

199
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:24,436
-He is only a child.
-He's a toy.

200
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:27,022
He's a gift.

201
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,191
From you.

202
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:34,280
David, when we leave,
the doors will go smart...

203
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:37,574
...so you can't leave your room,
but if you'd like....

204
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:41,787
-I put too much on.
-Do I smell lovely?

205
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,666
Oh, God, no!

206
00:25:57,886 --> 00:25:59,304
Mommy?

207
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:03,183
Will you die?

208
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:10,399
Well, one day, David, yes, I will.

209
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:17,239
I'll be alone.

210
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:20,450
Don't worry yourself so.

211
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:32,671
How long will you live?

212
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,632
For ages.

213
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,844
For 50 years.

214
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,639
I love you, Mommy.

215
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:46,601
I hope you never die.

216
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:49,229
Never.

217
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,692
Yes.

218
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:55,068
Darling!

219
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:59,572
We're becoming unfashionably,
unreasonably late.

220
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:03,952
Hello?

221
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,767
This belonged to Martin, my son.

222
00:27:56,003 --> 00:28:00,299
His name is Teddy.
Teddy, this is David.

223
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,221
-Hello, Teddy.
-Hello, David.

224
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:10,434
Teddy is a supertoy. I know
you'll take good care of each other.

225
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:13,646
I am not a toy.

226
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,065
Henry!

227
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:18,859
-Sorry!
-What were you doing?

228
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,821
I'll tell you in the car. Come on!

229
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,626
Is 50 years a long time?

230
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,839
I don't think so.

231
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:44,093
David, I'll get it!

232
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:55,521
-Hand it to me.
-Look what I can do.

233
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:04,822
Hello.

234
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:07,658
Yes?

235
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:11,912
Mrs. Swinton, could you hold?
I have an urgent call.

236
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:15,165
Yes, I will.
David, I need the phone now.

237
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,752
Monica? Can you hear me?

238
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:22,297
-Let the phone talk now.
-Pick up the phone, Monica!

239
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:26,009
-Run along, play with Teddy.
-Oh, my God, Moni--

240
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:30,013
Hello, Henry, what is it?

241
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:32,641
What?

242
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,018
When?

243
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:39,898
Oh, God!

244
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:57,540
David.

245
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:02,212
The most wonderful thing
in the whole world has happened.

246
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,175
This is Martin.

247
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:10,136
This is my son.

248
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:27,528
Martin, no!

249
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:35,578
We'll have a contest to see
who he comes to first.

250
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,335
Come here, Teddy! Come here!

251
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,254
Teddy! Come here!

252
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:51,052
-You call him too.
-Come here, Teddy.

253
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,055
-Come on. Teddy!
-Come here, boy.

254
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:57,767
-Come here! Come on, Teddy.
-Come here, Teddy.

255
00:30:57,975 --> 00:31:00,394
-Teddy, come.
-Come here, Teddy.

256
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:03,773
-Come here, Teddy.
-Come, Teddy! Come.

257
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,570
Mommy! Mommy!

258
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:16,077
Are they torturing you, Teddy?

259
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:19,038
He used to be a supertoy, but...

260
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:22,416
...now he's old and stupid.

261
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:25,961
You want him?

262
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:28,631
Yes, please.

263
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,052
Now you're the new supertoy.
What stuff can you do?

264
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:38,098
Can you do power stuff, like walk
on the ceiling or the walls?

265
00:31:38,307 --> 00:31:41,977
Anti-gravity, like float or fly?

266
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:43,437
Can you?

267
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:47,650
No, because I'm real.

268
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,825
Can you break this?

269
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,161
I better not.

270
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:03,665
These things, they do look better
in pieces. They do.

271
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:04,958
I can't.

272
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,840
Stand up.

273
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:22,976
-Look, they made you bigger than me.
-Who did?

274
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:26,897
They did. The dollmakers.
They made you taller.

275
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:34,029
Why don't you look like one?

276
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:35,655
Like one?

277
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,284
You're not cute like a doll.

278
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,913
You just look like
someone's ordinary kid.

279
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:46,917
When's your birthday?

280
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,377
I never had a birthday.

281
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:53,882
When were you first built?
When's your "build-day"?

282
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,386
I don't remember.

283
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:04,851
Okay, what's the first thing
you can remember?

284
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,230
A bird.

285
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,733
What sort of bird?

286
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:16,654
A bird with big wings...

287
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,241
...and feathers sticking up
from the bottom.

288
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,160
Can you draw it?

289
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,704
Yes.

290
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:48,436
That looks like a peacock.
Can you say peacock?

291
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:49,771
Peacock.

292
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:52,774
-Can you say pee?
-Pee.

293
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:55,359
Now say that two times fast.

294
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:10,291
Okay. Then you gotta put
the green ones--

295
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,376
Read to us?

296
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,254
Let's see.

297
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:19,925
Oh, yeah.

298
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:28,851
David's going to love it.

299
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:33,230
"The Showman went into the kitchen...

300
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,900
...where the sheep for supper...

301
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,111
...was roasting on the spit
in the furnace.

302
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,198
When he saw there was
not enough wood...

303
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:45,576
...he called Harlequin
and Punchinello and said:

304
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:49,622
'Bring me Pinocchio!
He is hanging on a nail.

305
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,335
He is made of dry wood and will
make a nice fire for my roast.' "

306
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,879
"Pinocchio worked until midnight.

307
00:34:57,087 --> 00:35:02,509
And instead of making
eight baskets, he made 16.

308
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:06,889
Then he went to bed and fell asleep.

309
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:12,352
As he slept, he dreamt he saw
the fairy, lovely and smiling...

310
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,855
...who gave him a kiss, saying:

311
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,899
'Brave Pinocchio...

312
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:22,821
...in return for your good heart,
I forgive all your past misdeeds.

313
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,283
Be good in future,
and you will be happy.'

314
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:32,664
Then the dream ended and
Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement.

315
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:36,293
You can imagine how astonished
he was when he saw...

316
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,795
...that he was no longer a puppet...

317
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:44,259
...but a real boy,
just like other boys."

318
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:52,142
Josephine has taken
a leave of absence.

319
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,062
Oh, my God.
Well, I saw that coming.

320
00:35:56,271 --> 00:36:00,567
-How? They were fabulous together.
-Come on! She was miserable.

321
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:04,487
-He never said they were miserable.
-That's because....

322
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:09,784
-Is that because of the cutbacks?
-No idea. They don't tell me.

323
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:13,997
-Do they have a weight problem?
-So do I.

324
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:18,209
You do not! That is ridiculous.

325
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:20,003
I don't know.

326
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:23,339
There's something
about inner beauty that....

327
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,716
You will break.

328
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,510
-That is ridiculous!
-Exactly.

329
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,642
-Work has become so silly.
-I know what you're talking about.

330
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,736
-Does he eat?
-I'm not sure.

331
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:48,740
-You're not supposed to do that.
-What are you doing?

332
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:52,910
-Martin, put the fork down!
-Stop, David. Will you stop?

333
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,913
Martin, you're provoking him.
Stop it.

334
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:59,500
-Stop it!
-The two of you, stop! Stop it now!

335
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,879
Stop it!

336
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,173
David, stop it!

337
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:30,573
-There's sputum in the code lockers.
-Smell that garlic.

338
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,992
We should throw in a chest mint.

339
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,996
-Can you locate the surface?
-Don't touch the merchandise.

340
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,917
-It's all swamp in here.
-You made a mess of yourself.

341
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:49,175
Spinach is for rabbits,
people and Popeye.

342
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:51,886
Not robo-boys.

343
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:54,179
Try to insert yourself.

344
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:57,683
Through the pantry,
the lower shelves.

345
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:02,021
It's okay, Mommy. It doesn't hurt.

346
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:10,029
Deactivators are all shut down
on the left side.

347
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:14,575
-Monica.
-No! I have to....

348
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,545
That's not all of it.
That's not all of it.

349
00:38:28,714 --> 00:38:33,343
If you do something really,
really, really special for me...

350
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:37,264
...a special mission...

351
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,183
...then I'll go tell Mommy...

352
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,477
...I love you.

353
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:46,398
And then she'll love you too.

354
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:51,194
What shall I do?

355
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:55,574
You have to promise,
and then I'll tell you.

356
00:38:55,824 --> 00:39:00,287
You have to tell me,
and then I'll promise.

357
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,500
I want a lock of Mommy's hair.

358
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,964
I'll share it with you.
And if you had it and wore it...

359
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:13,300
...she might love you even more.

360
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:16,428
Like the princess
in the movie we saw.

361
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:20,640
When she had the prince's hair
in her necklace thing...

362
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,809
...he loved her.

363
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:24,894
We can ask her.

364
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:29,566
No, it has to be a secret mission.

365
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:34,571
Sneak into Mommy's bedroom
in the middle of the night...

366
00:39:34,863 --> 00:39:37,407
...and chop it off.

367
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:46,499
I can't, Martin. I'm not allowed.

368
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,043
You promised.

369
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:53,756
You said, "Tell me,
and then I'll promise."

370
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,800
Didn't you?

371
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,328
David!

372
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:10,499
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?!

373
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,837
Talk to me! Goddamn it, talk to me!
Why did you do that?

374
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:17,798
You're hurting him!
You'll break him!

375
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:22,302
Henry...

376
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:25,055
...I wanted Mommy to love me...

377
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:26,932
...more.

378
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:29,017
-Oh, my God!
-What?

379
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:32,688
I think I cut my eye.
I think it's bleeding.

380
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:34,940
Come on, watch it.

381
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,907
It's normal for boys
to feel jealous and competitive.

382
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:49,121
Martin's been home a month.
Brothers normally challenge each other.

383
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:53,291
He was playing a game, he made
a mistake. He's practically human.

384
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,294
-Not holding the knife.
-Scissors.

385
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:57,838
It was a weapon.

386
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:02,300
-Why do you think he'd harm me?
-We don't know the answer.

387
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,429
How is he worth the risk to you,
to Martin, to our family?

388
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:10,934
-I won't let you take him back.
-Think about this.

389
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:16,439
If he was created to love,
then we can assume he can hate.

390
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,444
And if pushed to those extremes,
what is he capable of?

391
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:44,592
Happy birthday, Martin.
I made this for you.

392
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:53,643
-Is this your little brother?
-Technically, no.

393
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:59,399
-He's Mecha.
-What's Mecha?

394
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:01,401
We're "org-anic" ...

395
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,237
...you're "mecha-anical."

396
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:06,406
Orga, Mecha.

397
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:08,741
Orga, Mecha.

398
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:11,369
Todd, stop!

399
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:15,456
I didn't know they even made kids.
Can you pee?

400
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:19,585
-I cannot.
-Let's see what you can't pee with.

401
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:22,004
Guys, come on.

402
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,382
Touch it.

403
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:26,676
It feels so real!

404
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:28,427
That's creepy.

405
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:30,888
-It feels so real!
-That is too real.

406
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:32,640
Mecha-real.

407
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,435
Does he have DAS?

408
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,729
-DAS what?
-Das ist gut!

409
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:42,358
Damage Avoidance System. DAS.

410
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:46,362
It's a pain-alert system.
Our serving man has it.

411
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:50,574
It's so they don't go picking up fire
with their hands.

412
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,285
Watch. Watch this.

413
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:58,415
I'm not gonna cut you.
This won't hurt.

414
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:02,211
I'm not gonna cut your skin.
Tell me when you feel it.

415
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:08,759
-Keep me safe, Martin.
-Let me go!

416
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:13,138
-Keep me safe, Martin.
-Let me go! Mom!

417
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:15,432
Mom!

418
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,901
Henry!

419
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,915
Oh, my God!

420
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:53,720
Oh, my God, he's not breathing!

421
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:04,439
Take a breath.
Cough it up. That's a great boy!

422
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:07,442
-Thank God!
-Call Frazier.

423
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:10,070
Get him out of the sun.

424
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:43,812
-Hey, David?
-Mommy!

425
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:49,234
I need to speak to you
for a minute, okay?

426
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:51,069
Okay.

427
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:58,302
These are beautiful.

428
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:03,098
Thank you.

429
00:47:15,653 --> 00:47:20,866
I was thinking that we could go
for a drive tomorrow in the country.

430
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:24,036
You and me. What do you say?

431
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:27,289
-And Teddy?
-Yeah, and Teddy.

432
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,465
Thank you, Mommy.

433
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:40,511
Thank you so much.

434
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:51,480
Tomorrow's gonna be
just for us, okay?

435
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,747
Where are we going?

436
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,585
Someplace nice?

437
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,052
Are those happy tears?

438
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:28,183
What's for dinner tonight?

439
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:33,355
-You know you don't eat.
-Yes.

440
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:37,734
But I like sitting at the table.

441
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:46,052
David? David, I want--
David, listen.

442
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,095
Listen to me!

443
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:56,187
David, listen.

444
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,651
You won't understand the reasons...

445
00:50:02,902 --> 00:50:05,571
...but I have to leave you here.

446
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,699
Is it a game?

447
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:10,451
No.

448
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:14,955
When will you come back for me?

449
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:19,251
I'm not. You'll have
to be here by yourself.

450
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:21,879
Alone?

451
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,425
With Teddy.

452
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:34,183
No.

453
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:38,103
No, no, no! No, Mommy, please!

454
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:42,566
-No, no. Please, Mommy.
-They would destroy you, David!

455
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:46,278
I'm sorry I broke myself,
I'm sorry I cut your hair...

456
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:48,655
...and I'm sorry I hurt Martin--

457
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:52,784
I have to go! I have to go!
Stop it!

458
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:55,120
Stop it!

459
00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:58,790
-I have to go now.
-Mommy, don't! Mommy!

460
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:03,962
If Pinocchio became real and
I become real, can I come home?

461
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:07,299
-That's a story.
-But a story tells what happens.

462
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:11,219
Stories are not real!
You're not real!

463
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,812
Now, look.
Take this, all right?

464
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:24,816
Take this.
Don't let anyone see how much it is.

465
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:30,530
Look! Don't go that way. Go anywhere
but that way or they'll catch you.

466
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:32,991
Don't ever let them catch you!

467
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,120
Stay away from Flesh Fairs, away
from where there are lots of people.

468
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:41,875
Stay away from all people. Only others
like you, only Mecha are safe!

469
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,503
Why do you want to leave me? Why?

470
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:49,507
I'm sorry I'm not real. If you
let me, I'll be so real for you!

471
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:52,051
Let go. Let go, David.

472
00:51:52,302 --> 00:51:54,262
Let go!

473
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:01,769
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the world.

474
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,716
I'm afraid.

475
00:52:31,924 --> 00:52:33,926
-Of me?
-Yes.

476
00:52:34,135 --> 00:52:36,554
That I will hurt you?

477
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,890
Yes.

478
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:41,559
I think...

479
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,770
...you're afraid of letting go.

480
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,108
I think you're afraid of happiness.

481
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:53,612
And this is starting to excite me.

482
00:52:54,363 --> 00:52:57,366
Are you afraid of seeing the stars...

483
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,285
...Patricia?

484
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:02,747
I can show you how to reach them.

485
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,293
I'm afraid of what
you've got under there.

486
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,631
May I see what it looks like first?

487
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:16,510
Is this your first time...

488
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:19,096
...with something like me?

489
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,641
I've never been with Mecha.

490
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,311
That makes two of us.

491
00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:32,985
I'm afraid it will hurt.

492
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,154
Patricia...

493
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:39,033
...once you've had a lover-robot...

494
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,787
...you'll never want a real man...

495
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:45,581
...again.

496
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,338
Are these the wounds of passion?

497
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:08,312
Do you hear that music?

498
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:16,903
You...

499
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:19,364
...are a goddess...

500
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:21,616
...Patricia.

501
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:27,998
You wind me up inside.

502
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:33,211
But you deserve much better
in your life.

503
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,716
You deserve...

504
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,343
...me.

505
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:24,470
-Hey, Joe, what do you know?
-Jane, how's the game?

506
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:34,647
-Hey, Joe, what do you know?
-Hello. Place a DND on room 102.

507
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:36,190
Sure thing.

508
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:40,278
There you are.

509
00:55:40,945 --> 00:55:42,321
Oh, Joe.

510
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:47,076
When you're done, crack your collar,
show off your operating license.

511
00:55:47,285 --> 00:55:52,582
The Flesh Fair is in Barn Creek and
the hounds are out hunting for strays.

512
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,920
-Good thing I ran into you. Thanks.
-Sure thing.

513
00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:00,631
Mustn't keep a lady waiting.

514
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:39,044
Miss Bevins.

515
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:41,755
It's Joe.

516
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,049
At your service.

517
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:48,679
I've been counting the seconds
since last we met.

518
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:57,312
Have you been crying, Samantha?

519
00:56:57,688 --> 00:57:00,190
I found a tear.

520
00:57:09,741 --> 00:57:12,160
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

521
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:16,707
How many seconds has it been...

522
00:57:16,915 --> 00:57:20,001
...the last time
you two were together?

523
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:24,548
255,133.

524
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:32,639
Goodbye, Sam. And never forget:

525
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,600
You killed me first.

526
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:45,026
I'm in bad trouble.

527
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:17,350
If I am a real boy...

528
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,478
...then I can go back.

529
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:23,690
And she will love me then.

530
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,067
How?

531
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,073
The Blue Fairy made Pinocchio
into a real boy.

532
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:36,327
She can make me into a real boy.

533
00:58:37,245 --> 00:58:41,249
I must find her.
I must become real.

534
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:46,170
There must be someone in the whole
world who knows where she lives.

535
01:00:46,373 --> 01:00:49,709
Moon on the rise!

536
01:01:07,102 --> 01:01:12,357
It's the Flesh Fair. They destroy us
on-stage. I've been there.

537
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:15,985
What do we do?

538
01:01:16,736 --> 01:01:18,613
We run now.

539
01:01:20,365 --> 01:01:22,575
Any old iron.

540
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,829
Any old iron.

541
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,542
Any old iron.

542
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,171
Any old iron.

543
01:01:35,922 --> 01:01:38,466
Expel your Mecha!

544
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:41,177
Purge yourselves of artificiality.

545
01:01:41,427 --> 01:01:43,805
Let some Mecha loose to run.

546
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:47,391
Any old unlicensed iron down there?

547
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:51,562
Hey, you see that?

548
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:54,440
Could be a human thing.

549
01:01:56,817 --> 01:02:01,447
No, he's scanning cold.
No expiration date, no I.D.

550
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:07,078
-What's a new model doing loose?
-It's a late-generation lover-Mecha.

551
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:11,791
That's a relief from all this
antique iron. Sure he's not a man?

552
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:14,168
I don't want another Trenton incident.

553
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:17,338
He's a free-range Mecha running hot.

554
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:20,758
Reel him in!
Sic the hounds on the rest.

555
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,665
Shake down shantytown!

556
01:04:00,482 --> 01:04:02,525
What's your name?

557
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:04,527
My name is David.

558
01:04:04,736 --> 01:04:08,656
Hello, David. How old are you?

559
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,575
I don't know.

560
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:13,703
You need someone to take care of you?

561
01:04:13,912 --> 01:04:18,875
Would you like a nanny?
I have many good references.

562
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,045
Do you know where
the Blue Fairy lives?

563
01:04:45,902 --> 01:04:49,697
Let out the line.
Steady your drift.

564
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:54,619
Open the lower hold.

565
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,548
Don't be afraid, David.

566
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:27,276
I'll break, David.

567
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:12,863
Hello!

568
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,491
Anybody lose this?

569
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,409
Hello!

570
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:19,411
This your dog?

571
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,667
Take it to lost and found.

572
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:28,045
Lost and found!

573
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:39,681
-Do you know David?
-Where's the "off" switch?

574
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:43,143
Where's David?

575
01:06:45,228 --> 01:06:47,939
Can you help me find David?

576
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,903
I have to find David.

577
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:56,531
Are you taking me to David?

578
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:48,791
Could you shoot me
over the propeller?

579
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,129
I don't need to go through it.
I changed my mind.

580
01:07:53,629 --> 01:07:58,301
Gentlemen, start your engines!

581
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:09,979
Ten!

582
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:11,439
Nine!

583
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,065
Eight!

584
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:14,233
Seven!

585
01:08:14,442 --> 01:08:15,610
Six!

586
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:16,986
Five!

587
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:18,404
Four!

588
01:08:18,613 --> 01:08:19,739
Three!

589
01:08:19,947 --> 01:08:21,115
Two!

590
01:08:21,324 --> 01:08:22,992
One!

591
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,169
What about us?

592
01:08:34,253 --> 01:08:36,964
What about us?

593
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:41,260
We are alive...

594
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:46,891
...and this is a celebration of life!

595
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:50,519
And this is commitment...

596
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:55,899
...to a truly human future!

597
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:04,491
-What's your name?
-Hello, Teddy.

598
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,160
Hello, David.

599
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:15,294
Take it!

600
01:09:15,502 --> 01:09:17,129
Take it.

601
01:09:17,337 --> 01:09:20,174
-Biker hounds rolling.
-Cue biker hound.

602
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:24,178
-Papa!
-Amanda, go outside. It's smoky here.

603
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:26,513
There's a boy in the cage.

604
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:29,850
-What did you say?
-There's a boy in the cage.

605
01:09:30,058 --> 01:09:33,687
-A boy?
-A real boy. He's stuck in the cage.

606
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:37,316
-In the pen, honey?
-In the jail place.

607
01:09:37,524 --> 01:09:41,486
-Crowd reaction....
-We got a remote near the pigpen?

608
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:44,781
Bring it up. Let me see
what she's talking about.

609
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,952
-What are you looking for?
-She says she saw a boy in there.

610
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:56,501
-How do you know about this?
-The bear told me.

611
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,044
I told her.

612
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:11,975
Would you be so kind
and shut down my pain receivers?

613
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:20,442
Why is this happening?

614
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,528
History repeats itself.

615
01:10:23,737 --> 01:10:27,574
It's the rite of blood
and electricity.

616
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:31,536
When the opportunities avail
themselves, they pick away at us...

617
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:36,749
...cutting back our numbers so they
can maintain numerical superiority.

618
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:44,048
My time, is it up already?
Goodbye, everyone.

619
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:47,927
-Keep me safe, keep me safe!
-Not yet. They just want him.

620
01:10:48,136 --> 01:10:51,347
Keep me safe, keep me safe,
keep me safe.

621
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:53,308
Security.

622
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:58,062
Do you have any reports of any
missing kids, any missing children?

623
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,314
All right, thanks.

624
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:04,485
How'd you get in there? Boy!
You, boy!

625
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:07,613
What's your name?

626
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,907
I won't bite you.

627
01:11:11,325 --> 01:11:13,578
Come over where I can see you.

628
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:22,503
I won't hurt you.
I just need to see.

629
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,905
-You're a machine.
-I'm a boy.

630
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:51,782
Is he a toy boy?

631
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:54,326
My name is David.

632
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:57,788
Impossible.

633
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:03,460
I still work, don't I? I can work
in the dark, but my lamp is broken.

634
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:09,299
My lamplight will not work.
I hit my lamp on a girder overhead.

635
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:29,236
Goodbye, David.

636
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:39,288
No one builds children. No one
ever has. What would be the point?

637
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:43,542
It could be a custom job.
Some rich guy's pretend child.

638
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,627
I'm a custom job.

639
01:12:45,877 --> 01:12:50,215
75 years ago, I was Time magazine's
Mecha of the Year!

640
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:53,260
No, this work is first-rate.

641
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:57,431
A lot of love went into him.
David?

642
01:12:58,473 --> 01:13:01,726
You are one of a kind, you know that?

643
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:06,606
-Who made you?
-My mommy made me.

644
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,694
One of those built to aspire
to the human condition.

645
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:14,447
Who is your maker?
Serve U.S., E.Z. Living, Robiville?

646
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:19,953
-Simulit City Center, Cybertronics?
-Monica is my mommy.

647
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:22,747
Can I speak with you for a moment?

648
01:13:52,944 --> 01:13:55,238
You're thinking about not showing him?

649
01:13:55,446 --> 01:13:58,741
Something this original
you don't toss out!

650
01:13:59,117 --> 01:14:01,577
Originality without purpose
is useless.

651
01:14:01,786 --> 01:14:06,374
If money is your purpose,
here's your refund. My compliments.

652
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:14,006
-What'll you do with him?
-Put him where he belongs.

653
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:16,008
In show business.

654
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:19,470
It was certainly my good fortune,
running into you!

655
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:24,350
-Let go of him. Let go!
-I'm trying.

656
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:29,146
-Don't let go! Keep me safe!
-Suit yourselves.

657
01:14:41,826 --> 01:14:45,830
Johnson-Johnson! Johnson-Johnson!

658
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:48,207
Johnson-Johnson!

659
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,611
Ladies and gentlemen...

660
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,657
...boys and girls
and children of all ages.

661
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:24,368
What will they think of next?

662
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:26,370
See here!

663
01:15:26,578 --> 01:15:31,375
A bitty-bot, a Tinkertoy,
a living doll.

664
01:15:32,209 --> 01:15:34,336
We all know why they made him.

665
01:15:34,545 --> 01:15:38,549
To steal your hearts,
to replace your children.

666
01:15:38,757 --> 01:15:42,344
This is the latest
of their insults to human dignity.

667
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:47,099
And in their grand scheme
to phase out God's children...

668
01:15:47,391 --> 01:15:50,519
...meet the next generation
of child...

669
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:53,480
...designed to do just that.

670
01:15:58,944 --> 01:16:01,154
Do not be fooled...

671
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:04,783
...by the artistry of this creation.

672
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:09,412
No doubt there was talent
in its crafting.

673
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:14,459
Yet, with the very first strike,
you will see the big lie...

674
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:17,963
...come apart before your very eyes!

675
01:16:18,171 --> 01:16:22,259
Don't burn me! Don't burn me!
I'm not Pinocchio!

676
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:25,887
Don't make me die!
I'm David! I'm David!

677
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:32,143
Mecha don't plead for their lives!
Who is that? He looks like a boy!

678
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:35,063
Built like a boy to disarm us.

679
01:16:35,313 --> 01:16:38,525
See how they try
to imitate our emotions now!

680
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:42,237
Whatever performance
this Sim puts on, remember...

681
01:16:42,445 --> 01:16:45,865
...we are only
demolishing artificiality!

682
01:16:50,161 --> 01:16:53,831
Let he who is without Sim...

683
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,293
...cast the first stone.

684
01:17:13,226 --> 01:17:15,269
He's just a boy!

685
01:17:15,478 --> 01:17:17,522
Johnson, you're a monster!

686
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:31,786
Get him out before
they tear this place apart!

687
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,604
-We found him.
-Where?

688
01:18:40,812 --> 01:18:44,024
-A Flesh Fair outside Haddonfield.
-Is he alive?

689
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:47,903
Yes. He's in one piece.

690
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,341
I see the moon.

691
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:18,058
-Is it real?
-I don't know, David.

692
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:21,019
Is it coming?

693
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:25,231
I can't tell yet.

694
01:19:26,983 --> 01:19:29,527
Let's not walk this way.

695
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:40,538
-Where are we going?
-This way now.

696
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:43,666
Are you in trouble?
Have you run away?

697
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,669
-My mommy told me to run away.
-Why?

698
01:19:46,878 --> 01:19:51,674
-I guess because Henry didn't like me.
-Why was that?

699
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:54,552
-Martin came home.
-And who is he?

700
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:57,680
Martin is Mommy and Henry's real son.

701
01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:02,018
After I find the Blue Fairy,
then I can go home.

702
01:20:02,226 --> 01:20:07,357
Mommy will love a real boy.
The Blue Fairy will make me into one.

703
01:20:07,565 --> 01:20:10,276
Is Blue Fairy Mecha, Orga,
man or woman?

704
01:20:10,485 --> 01:20:11,736
Woman.

705
01:20:13,237 --> 01:20:14,572
Woman?

706
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:18,910
I know women!

707
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:24,665
They sometimes ask for me by name.

708
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:29,670
I know all about women.
About as much as there is to know.

709
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:34,884
No two are ever alike.
And after they've met me, no two...

710
01:20:35,468 --> 01:20:39,472
...are ever the same. And I know
where they can be found.

711
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,184
-Where?
-Rouge City.

712
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:46,812
Across the Delaware.
Too far for our feet.

713
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:49,482
We'll need help to get there.

714
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:55,488
And it is not without peril.

715
01:20:56,113 --> 01:20:58,491
We will have to journey...

716
01:21:03,329 --> 01:21:05,206
...towards the moon.

717
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:10,544
Are there many women in Rouge City?

718
01:21:11,253 --> 01:21:16,050
-As there are stars at night.
-How do we find just one?

719
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,136
We will ask Dr. Know.

720
01:21:20,638 --> 01:21:23,349
There is nothing he doesn't.

721
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:32,900
Exactly what name
do you give this woman?

722
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,903
She is just Blue Fairy.

723
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:38,322
Blue Fairy.

724
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:41,992
In the world of Orga,
blue is the color of melancholy.

725
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:46,622
Yet the services I provide will put
a blush back on anyone's cheek.

726
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:51,376
I will change the color of your fairy
for you. She will scream out:

727
01:21:51,585 --> 01:21:56,548
"Oh, yes. Oh, God.
Oh, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God!"

728
01:21:56,757 --> 01:21:59,968
She'll make you a real boy,
I'll make her a real woman...

729
01:22:00,177 --> 01:22:01,887
...and all will be right...

730
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:05,599
...because you held my hand
and saved my brain...

731
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:09,311
...so that once again my customers
may ask for me by name:

732
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:12,355
"Gigolo Joe, what do you know?"

733
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:15,692
Why do you do that?

734
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:17,861
That's just what I do.

735
01:22:18,904 --> 01:22:23,033
Now follow me and don't fall behind.
All roads lead to Rouge!

736
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:26,995
Don't they say that, hey?
Don't they just?

737
01:22:39,257 --> 01:22:41,301
There are girls just like me.

738
01:22:41,509 --> 01:22:44,929
We are the guiltless pleasures
of the lonely human.

739
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,266
You won't get us pregnant
or have us to supper.

740
01:22:48,516 --> 01:22:51,936
We work under you, we work on you
and we work for you.

741
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:56,733
Man made us better at what we do
than was ever humanly possible.

742
01:22:56,983 --> 01:23:02,197
If you could manage us a lift
to Rouge City, all this...

743
01:23:07,368 --> 01:23:10,955
...and much, much more...

744
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:13,041
...can be yours.

745
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,293
Get in.

746
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:32,518
Say "ah."

747
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:58,502
Over there is Here Kitty Kitty...

748
01:23:58,711 --> 01:24:02,882
...where the agency held my tryouts
when I was made new.

749
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:09,763
That's Tails. Very hoity-toity.
I've yet to be asked to perform there.

750
01:24:10,014 --> 01:24:14,226
Only sunrise gents and sunset ladies.
Sierra Class robots.

751
01:24:14,435 --> 01:24:17,646
Can't even speak English.
All made in Sweden.

752
01:24:17,855 --> 01:24:20,900
Couldn't tell a joke from a poke.

753
01:24:27,573 --> 01:24:32,202
There's Mildred.
I have to show you inside Mildred.

754
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:51,346
Are you her?

755
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:56,268
That's Our Lady
of the Immaculate Heart.

756
01:24:58,937 --> 01:25:01,690
Those who made us look
for those who made them.

757
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:04,735
They go in, fold their hands,
sing songs...

758
01:25:04,943 --> 01:25:08,196
...and when they come out,
it's me they find.

759
01:25:08,405 --> 01:25:11,408
I've picked up a lot
of business on this spot.

760
01:25:15,412 --> 01:25:17,873
But, Joe, where's Blue Fairy?

761
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,544
That's what we'll find out
when we ask Dr. Know.

762
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:28,049
That's where everyone goes
who needs to know.

763
01:25:29,342 --> 01:25:32,220
Meet the good doctor.

764
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:17,640
Starving minds,
welcome to Dr. Know...

765
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,852
...where fast food for thought
is served all day...

766
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,604
...in 40,000 locations nationwide.

767
01:26:23,855 --> 01:26:26,858
Ask Dr. Know.
There's nothing I don't.

768
01:26:27,066 --> 01:26:29,902
Tell me where I can find
the Blue Fairy.

769
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:34,615
Question me, you pay the fee.
Two for five, you get one free.

770
01:26:35,116 --> 01:26:40,329
Two questions cost five Newbucks
with a third question on the house.

771
01:26:40,538 --> 01:26:45,585
In this day and age,
nothing costs more than information.

772
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:50,923
-That's it.
-Ten Newbucks and a 10 copper...

773
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:53,342
...comes to seven questions.

774
01:26:53,593 --> 01:26:55,303
That should be enough.

775
01:26:55,803 --> 01:26:57,221
He's a smooth operator.

776
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:01,517
He'll press our limits,
but try we must.

777
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:12,445
Greetings!
On offer, fact or fiction.

778
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:15,447
Literacy range from primal
to postdoctoral.

779
01:27:15,656 --> 01:27:19,243
From fairy tale to religious.
Who's who or where's where.

780
01:27:19,743 --> 01:27:21,871
Or flat fact.

781
01:27:22,496 --> 01:27:25,249
-Flat fact?
-Thank you for question one.

782
01:27:25,457 --> 01:27:27,418
A term demanding
an equal answer....

783
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:31,088
That shouldn't count!
That wasn't my question.

784
01:27:31,797 --> 01:27:36,844
You must not raise your voice up
at the end of the sentence.

785
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:41,557
-Flat fact.
-You have six more questions.

786
01:27:41,765 --> 01:27:45,894
Where is Blue Fairy?

787
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:48,897
In the garden.
Vascostylis Blue Fairy.

788
01:27:49,106 --> 01:27:52,484
Blooms twice annually
with bright, blue flowers.

789
01:27:52,693 --> 01:27:56,697
A hybrid between Ascola meda
Arnold. Five more questions!

790
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:59,283
Who is Blue Fairy?

791
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:02,661
Are you sad, lonely,
looking for a friend?

792
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:05,956
Blue Fairy Escort Service
will find a mate for you.

793
01:28:06,164 --> 01:28:08,125
You have four more questions.

794
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:09,584
Joe!

795
01:28:10,961 --> 01:28:13,088
Try "fairy tale."

796
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,091
New category.

797
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,555
A fairy's tale.

798
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:24,057
No! Fairy tale.

799
01:28:24,349 --> 01:28:26,726
No. Fairy tale.

800
01:28:31,231 --> 01:28:32,941
What is Blue Fairy?

801
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:36,319
Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi.

802
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:40,198
"There was a rustling
as a flapping of wings...

803
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,576
...and a falcon flew
to the windowsill.

804
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:46,079
'What are your orders,
beautiful fairy?' "

805
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:48,164
That's her!

806
01:28:48,415 --> 01:28:50,959
"You know that the child
with blue hair...

807
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:53,294
...was the good-hearted fairy...

808
01:28:53,586 --> 01:28:57,424
...who had lived in that wood
for more than a thousand--"

809
01:28:58,591 --> 01:28:59,759
That's her!

810
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:03,263
It was an example of her.
But we're getting closer.

811
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:07,892
But if a fairy tale is real,
then wouldn't it be fact?

812
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:09,519
A flat fact?

813
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,814
Say no more.

814
01:29:16,025 --> 01:29:17,652
New category, please.

815
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,322
Combine...

816
01:29:23,283 --> 01:29:26,452
...fact with...

817
01:29:29,622 --> 01:29:31,374
...fairy tale.

818
01:29:35,962 --> 01:29:37,338
Now...

819
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:39,966
...ask him again.

820
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:49,433
How...

821
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:52,979
...can the Blue Fairy...

822
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:55,731
...make...

823
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,985
...a robot...

824
01:29:59,735 --> 01:30:02,989
...into a real, live boy?

825
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:12,081
Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild

826
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:13,999
With a fairy hand in hand

827
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:18,212
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

828
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:22,341
Your quest will be perilous,
yet the reward is beyond price.

829
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:25,761
In his book,
How Can a Robot Become Human?...

830
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:31,016
...Professor Allen Hobby writes of
that which transforms Mecha into Orga.

831
01:30:31,684 --> 01:30:33,435
How do I find her?

832
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:36,230
Discovery is quite possible.

833
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:41,068
Our Blue Fairy does exist in
one place and in one place only.

834
01:30:41,276 --> 01:30:44,363
At the end of the world
where the lions weep.

835
01:30:44,571 --> 01:30:47,700
Here is the place dreams are born.

836
01:30:48,742 --> 01:30:53,622
Many a Mecha has gone to the end
of the world, never to come back.

837
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:58,919
That is why they call
the end of the world "Man-hattan."

838
01:30:59,211 --> 01:31:02,214
And that's why we must go there.

839
01:31:06,218 --> 01:31:07,469
Wait!

840
01:31:09,012 --> 01:31:12,057
What if the Blue Fairy
isn't real at all?

841
01:31:14,434 --> 01:31:18,021
What if she's magic?
The supernatural unites the universe.

842
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:22,984
Only Orga believe what cannot be seen.
It's what separates our species.

843
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:26,571
What if she's
an electronic parasite...

844
01:31:26,863 --> 01:31:29,991
...that haunts
artificial intelligence?

845
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:36,790
They hate us, you know. The humans.
They'll stop at nothing.

846
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:40,293
My mommy doesn't hate me.

847
01:31:40,544 --> 01:31:43,672
Because I'm special and unique!

848
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,092
Because there's never been anyone
like me before, ever.

849
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,344
When I am real...

850
01:31:49,552 --> 01:31:53,139
...Mommy will read to me
and tuck me in my bed...

851
01:31:53,348 --> 01:31:55,892
...and listen to me
and cuddle with me...

852
01:31:56,142 --> 01:32:00,355
...and tell me every day 100 times
that she loves me!

853
01:32:02,232 --> 01:32:04,901
She loves what you do for her...

854
01:32:05,652 --> 01:32:09,489
...as my customers love
what it is I do for them.

855
01:32:13,117 --> 01:32:18,456
But she does not love you, David.
She cannot love you.

856
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:23,878
You are neither flesh nor blood. You
are not a dog or a cat or a canary.

857
01:32:24,128 --> 01:32:28,841
You were designed and built specific
like the rest of us.

858
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:32,470
You are alone now
because they tired of you...

859
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,639
...or replaced you...

860
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:39,185
...or were displeased with
something you said or broke.

861
01:32:40,478 --> 01:32:45,108
They made us too smart,
too quick and too many.

862
01:32:45,608 --> 01:32:48,986
We suffer for their mistakes
because when the end comes...

863
01:32:49,195 --> 01:32:52,406
...all that will be left is us!

864
01:32:52,615 --> 01:32:57,828
That's why they hate us.
And that's why you must stay here.

865
01:32:58,079 --> 01:32:59,622
With me.

866
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:04,502
Goodbye, Joe.

867
01:33:26,315 --> 01:33:28,192
Stay back. Stay back.

868
01:33:28,526 --> 01:33:31,529
Let's clear this doorway, please.

869
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:34,782
You're in bad trouble.

870
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:52,424
Go about your business now.
Let's go. Move it.

871
01:34:05,521 --> 01:34:08,232
Be careful, David. This is not a toy.

872
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:46,102
-Destination?
-Man-hattan.

873
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,024
Mecha-restricted area.

874
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,459
-Man-hattan.
-Destination achieved.

875
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:55,463
The lost city in the sea
at the end of the world.

876
01:35:57,548 --> 01:36:00,009
"Where the lions weep. "

877
01:36:24,075 --> 01:36:26,035
Turn around, Joe.

878
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:29,371
We're not gonna give up yet.

879
01:36:29,872 --> 01:36:32,875
Turn around.
Turn all the way around.

880
01:37:43,987 --> 01:37:45,947
Professor Hobby?

881
01:37:49,117 --> 01:37:51,203
Professor Hobby?

882
01:38:05,383 --> 01:38:08,720
Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild

883
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:11,097
With a fairy hand in hand

884
01:38:11,306 --> 01:38:17,145
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

885
01:38:42,879 --> 01:38:44,756
Professor Hobby?

886
01:38:47,342 --> 01:38:49,260
Professor Hobby?

887
01:38:50,386 --> 01:38:51,804
Hello?

888
01:38:54,515 --> 01:38:56,017
Hello!

889
01:39:02,523 --> 01:39:05,610
Is this the place they make you real?

890
01:39:07,528 --> 01:39:10,364
This is the place they make you read.

891
01:39:15,077 --> 01:39:16,871
Are you real?

892
01:39:18,914 --> 01:39:20,541
I guess.

893
01:39:28,758 --> 01:39:30,384
Are you me?

894
01:39:31,135 --> 01:39:33,345
-I'm David.
-You're not!

895
01:39:33,763 --> 01:39:36,557
Yes, I am. I'm David.

896
01:39:38,434 --> 01:39:40,311
So am I.

897
01:39:40,603 --> 01:39:42,438
Hello, David.

898
01:39:48,485 --> 01:39:50,362
Can you read?

899
01:39:51,447 --> 01:39:54,366
Can you sit down
and we can read together?

900
01:39:56,493 --> 01:39:57,953
Let's be friends.

901
01:39:59,496 --> 01:40:01,248
You can't have her.

902
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:04,043
I can't hear you.

903
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:10,591
She's mine. And I'm the only one.

904
01:40:13,552 --> 01:40:16,930
I'm David! I'm David! I'm David!

905
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,940
I'm special! I'm unique! I'm David!

906
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:29,276
You can't have her!

907
01:40:39,494 --> 01:40:41,621
Yes, you are David.

908
01:40:44,207 --> 01:40:45,959
Professor Hobby?

909
01:40:46,668 --> 01:40:49,504
Yes, David.
I've been waiting for you.

910
01:40:54,509 --> 01:40:58,889
Dr. Know told me you'd be here.
Is Blue Fairy here too?

911
01:40:59,973 --> 01:41:03,810
I first heard of your Blue Fairy
from Monica.

912
01:41:04,561 --> 01:41:08,565
-What could the Blue Fairy do for you?
-Make me a real boy.

913
01:41:08,773 --> 01:41:10,984
But you are a real boy.

914
01:41:13,194 --> 01:41:17,657
As real as I've ever made,
which would make me your Blue Fairy.

915
01:41:18,324 --> 01:41:23,371
You're not her. Dr. Know said she'd
be at the lost city in the sea--

916
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:28,585
That's what Dr. Know needed to know
to get you to come home to us.

917
01:41:29,669 --> 01:41:33,006
And it's the only time we intervened.

918
01:41:33,256 --> 01:41:36,593
The only help that we gave him...

919
01:41:37,886 --> 01:41:39,929
...to give to you...

920
01:41:44,809 --> 01:41:48,021
...so you could find
your way home to us.

921
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:51,816
Until you, robots didn't dream...

922
01:41:52,066 --> 01:41:56,779
...robots didn't desire
unless we told them what to want.

923
01:41:56,988 --> 01:42:01,534
Do you have any idea
what a success story you've become?

924
01:42:01,743 --> 01:42:05,997
You found a fairy tale, and inspired
by love, fueled by desire...

925
01:42:06,205 --> 01:42:08,332
...you set out to make her real.

926
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:13,212
Most remarkable of all, no one taught
you how! We lost you for a while.

927
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:17,133
When you were found,
we had a simple test.

928
01:42:17,425 --> 01:42:20,845
Where would your self-motivated
reasoning take you?

929
01:42:21,053 --> 01:42:23,514
To conclude that Blue Fairy...

930
01:42:23,723 --> 01:42:26,976
...is a human flaw, to wish
for things that don't exist...

931
01:42:27,226 --> 01:42:29,770
...or to the greatest human gift...

932
01:42:30,354 --> 01:42:33,357
...the ability
to chase down our dreams?

933
01:42:33,566 --> 01:42:38,362
And that is something no machine
has ever done until you.

934
01:42:40,698 --> 01:42:43,784
I thought I was one of a kind.

935
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:49,331
My son was one of a kind.

936
01:42:52,126 --> 01:42:55,045
You are the first of a kind.

937
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:11,645
My brain is falling out.

938
01:43:13,689 --> 01:43:17,276
Would you like to meet
your real mothers and fathers?

939
01:43:18,986 --> 01:43:22,156
The team is anxious to talk to you.

940
01:43:23,157 --> 01:43:27,452
I want you to wait here.
I'll gather them up.

941
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:33,667
We want to hear everything
about your adventures.

942
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:36,628
We want to thank you...

943
01:43:38,005 --> 01:43:41,383
...and tell you
what's in store for you next.

944
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,770
Mommy.

945
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:29,269
I saw it, Joe. I saw it.

946
01:49:29,478 --> 01:49:32,981
The place where she lives.
She's down there.

947
01:49:33,232 --> 01:49:36,735
-She is?
-She's waiting for me. We have to go!

948
01:49:45,285 --> 01:49:50,582
When you become a real boy, remember
me to the ladies when you grow up.

949
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:54,336
-Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye, David.

950
01:49:59,132 --> 01:50:00,634
I am.

951
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,263
I was!

952
01:50:47,305 --> 01:50:50,808
David, please be careful.

953
01:53:09,905 --> 01:53:13,283
-The Blue Fairy's all right.
-What happened?

954
01:53:13,992 --> 01:53:17,913
-I don't know.
-We are in a cage.

955
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,093
Blue Fairy?

956
01:53:34,554 --> 01:53:36,264
Please.

957
01:53:37,766 --> 01:53:42,729
Please, please, make me
into a real, live boy.

958
01:53:45,565 --> 01:53:47,233
Please.

959
01:53:50,236 --> 01:53:52,113
Blue Fairy?

960
01:53:54,699 --> 01:53:56,534
Please.

961
01:53:56,743 --> 01:53:58,536
Please...

962
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,748
...make me real.

963
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:07,420
Blue Fairy, please.

964
01:54:09,422 --> 01:54:12,842
Please make me real.

965
01:54:17,889 --> 01:54:20,600
Please make me a real boy.

966
01:54:22,602 --> 01:54:24,729
Please, Blue Fairy.

967
01:54:26,439 --> 01:54:29,525
Make me into a real boy.

968
01:54:30,776 --> 01:54:32,361
Please....

969
01:54:32,612 --> 01:54:35,948
And David continued to pray
to the Blue Fairy...

970
01:54:36,199 --> 01:54:39,869
...she who smiled softly forever.

971
01:54:40,077 --> 01:54:43,122
She who welcomed forever.

972
01:54:43,331 --> 01:54:45,291
Eventually, the floodlights died...

973
01:54:45,499 --> 01:54:48,586
...but David could still see her,
palely, by day.

974
01:54:48,794 --> 01:54:51,589
And he still addressed her, in hope.

975
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:56,761
He prayed until all the sea anemones
had shriveled and died...

976
01:54:56,969 --> 01:54:58,554
...as the ocean froze...

977
01:54:58,763 --> 01:55:02,892
...and the ice encased the amphibicopter
and the Blue Fairy...

978
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:06,228
...locking them together
where he could see her...

979
01:55:06,437 --> 01:55:08,647
...a blue ghost in ice.

980
01:55:08,898 --> 01:55:10,691
Always there.

981
01:55:11,275 --> 01:55:13,152
Always smiling.

982
01:55:13,652 --> 01:55:15,779
Always awaiting him.

983
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:18,741
Eventually, he never moved at all...

984
01:55:18,991 --> 01:55:22,411
...but his eyes always stayed open...

985
01:55:22,661 --> 01:55:27,166
...staring ahead forever all through
the darkness of each night...

986
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,918
...and the next day...

987
01:55:31,003 --> 01:55:33,380
...and the next day....

988
01:55:34,381 --> 01:55:39,428
Thus, 2000 years passed by.

989
02:02:16,571 --> 02:02:19,032
Teddy, we're home.

990
02:02:25,205 --> 02:02:26,957
Mommy?

991
02:02:40,011 --> 02:02:41,805
Mommy!

992
02:02:49,437 --> 02:02:51,731
We're home!

993
02:03:04,327 --> 02:03:06,871
Where are you?

994
02:03:08,331 --> 02:03:10,542
David!

995
02:03:13,086 --> 02:03:16,673
David!

996
02:03:40,988 --> 02:03:44,909
You have been searching for me,
haven't you?

997
02:03:49,372 --> 02:03:53,125
For my whole life.

998
02:03:54,335 --> 02:03:58,839
And what, after all this time,
have you come to ask me?

999
02:03:59,048 --> 02:04:03,511
-I have a wish to make.
-And what is your wish?

1000
02:04:05,513 --> 02:04:08,140
Please make me a real boy...

1001
02:04:08,349 --> 02:04:12,395
...so my mommy will love me
and let me stay with her.

1002
02:04:13,145 --> 02:04:17,608
David, I will do anything
that is possible...

1003
02:04:17,817 --> 02:04:21,153
...but I cannot make you a real boy.

1004
02:04:22,571 --> 02:04:24,448
Where am I?

1005
02:04:26,617 --> 02:04:30,204
This looks like my house,
but it is different.

1006
02:04:30,454 --> 02:04:35,834
Yes, it is different.
But it's also your home.

1007
02:04:36,043 --> 02:04:39,713
We read your mind and it's all here.

1008
02:04:39,922 --> 02:04:45,302
There's nothing too small that
you didn't store for us to remember.

1009
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:49,431
We so want you to be happy.

1010
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:52,351
You are so important to us, David.

1011
02:04:52,559 --> 02:04:56,313
You are unique in all the world.

1012
02:05:01,026 --> 02:05:03,987
Will Mommy be coming home soon?

1013
02:05:05,989 --> 02:05:08,825
Is she out shopping with Martin now?

1014
02:05:10,827 --> 02:05:14,957
David, she can never come home...

1015
02:05:15,624 --> 02:05:19,211
...because 2000 years have passed...

1016
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:22,297
...and she is no longer living.

1017
02:05:24,549 --> 02:05:29,179
Dearest David,
when you are lonely...

1018
02:05:29,429 --> 02:05:34,935
...we can bring back other people
from your time in the past.

1019
02:05:35,435 --> 02:05:38,563
If you can bring back other people...

1020
02:05:38,814 --> 02:05:41,733
...why can't you bring back her?!

1021
02:05:42,609 --> 02:05:47,822
We can only bring back people
whose bodies we dig up from the ice.

1022
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:52,661
We need some physical sample
of the person...

1023
02:05:52,869 --> 02:05:56,039
...like a bone or a fingernail.

1024
02:05:56,247 --> 02:05:57,749
David.

1025
02:05:58,917 --> 02:06:00,794
Yes, Teddy?

1026
02:06:01,419 --> 02:06:05,256
Do you remember when you cut
some of Mommy's hair?

1027
02:06:06,132 --> 02:06:08,051
Henry shook me.

1028
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:11,805
And you dropped her hair?

1029
02:06:13,848 --> 02:06:15,433
I know.

1030
02:06:41,626 --> 02:06:45,129
Now you can bring her back...

1031
02:06:46,339 --> 02:06:47,965
...can't you?

1032
02:06:51,469 --> 02:06:54,430
Give him what he wants.

1033
02:07:00,728 --> 02:07:05,942
Dearest David,
your wish is my command.

1034
02:07:28,839 --> 02:07:31,050
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

1035
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:18,597
I often felt a sort
of envy of humans...

1036
02:08:18,805 --> 02:08:21,725
...of that thing they called spirit.

1037
02:08:21,934 --> 02:08:26,188
Humans created a million explanations
of the meaning of life...

1038
02:08:26,396 --> 02:08:28,940
...in art, poetry,
mathematical formulas.

1039
02:08:29,191 --> 02:08:33,403
Certainly they must be the key
to the meaning of existence.

1040
02:08:33,612 --> 02:08:36,573
But human beings no longer existed.

1041
02:08:36,782 --> 02:08:39,576
So we began a project...

1042
02:08:39,785 --> 02:08:43,705
...that would make it possible
to re-create a person, long dead...

1043
02:08:43,914 --> 02:08:48,168
...from the DNA in a fragment
of bone or mummified skin.

1044
02:08:48,376 --> 02:08:50,921
We also wondered,
would it be possible...

1045
02:08:51,129 --> 02:08:55,133
...to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a re-created body?

1046
02:08:55,383 --> 02:08:57,677
And you know what we found?

1047
02:08:58,094 --> 02:09:02,015
We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...

1048
02:09:02,265 --> 02:09:05,477
...stored information
about every event...

1049
02:09:05,685 --> 02:09:08,563
...which had ever occurred
in the past.

1050
02:09:09,522 --> 02:09:13,693
But the experiment was a failure.

1051
02:09:14,069 --> 02:09:19,032
Those who were resurrected only lived
through one day of renewed life.

1052
02:09:19,866 --> 02:09:23,995
When they fell asleep on the night
of their first new day...

1053
02:09:24,204 --> 02:09:26,164
...they died again.

1054
02:09:26,497 --> 02:09:30,335
When they became unconscious,
their very existence...

1055
02:09:30,585 --> 02:09:33,129
...faded away into darkness.

1056
02:09:33,379 --> 02:09:36,507
So you see,
the equations had shown...

1057
02:09:36,716 --> 02:09:41,054
...that once an individual space-time
pathway had been used...

1058
02:09:41,262 --> 02:09:44,015
...it could not be reused.

1059
02:09:44,682 --> 02:09:48,019
If we bring your mother back now...

1060
02:09:48,227 --> 02:09:50,772
...it will only be for one day...

1061
02:09:51,022 --> 02:09:54,609
...and then you will
never see her again.

1062
02:09:56,194 --> 02:09:57,695
Maybe....

1063
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:03,993
Maybe she will be special.

1064
02:10:05,161 --> 02:10:07,788
Maybe she will stay.

1065
02:10:08,122 --> 02:10:11,250
I thought this would be hard
for you to understand.

1066
02:10:11,459 --> 02:10:14,587
You were created to be so young.

1067
02:10:15,796 --> 02:10:21,260
Maybe the one day will be like
that day inside the amphibicopter.

1068
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:24,388
Maybe it will last forever.

1069
02:10:24,805 --> 02:10:28,142
David, you are the enduring memory...

1070
02:10:28,392 --> 02:10:30,478
...of the human race.

1071
02:10:32,146 --> 02:10:35,483
The most lasting proof
of their genius.

1072
02:10:35,691 --> 02:10:39,737
We only want for your happiness.

1073
02:10:40,321 --> 02:10:41,739
David...

1074
02:10:42,406 --> 02:10:44,950
...you've had so little of that.

1075
02:10:45,826 --> 02:10:48,954
If you want for my happiness...

1076
02:10:50,122 --> 02:10:53,292
...then you know what you have to do.

1077
02:10:58,464 --> 02:11:00,132
Listen.

1078
02:11:01,508 --> 02:11:03,510
Can you hear that?

1079
02:11:08,515 --> 02:11:11,393
The new morning has come.

1080
02:11:19,276 --> 02:11:21,653
Go to her, David.

1081
02:11:24,364 --> 02:11:27,451
She's just waking up this instant.

1082
02:13:06,257 --> 02:13:08,384
I found you.

1083
02:13:19,103 --> 02:13:21,814
I must have dozed off.

1084
02:13:24,108 --> 02:13:27,153
-How long--?
-Would you like some coffee?

1085
02:13:27,486 --> 02:13:29,613
Just the way you like it?

1086
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:33,451
Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

1087
02:13:34,869 --> 02:13:37,079
It'll wake me up.

1088
02:14:01,854 --> 02:14:04,732
You never forget how, do you?

1089
02:14:06,233 --> 02:14:07,484
No.

1090
02:14:09,570 --> 02:14:11,447
I never forget.

1091
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:19,454
I must be a little confused.

1092
02:14:20,581 --> 02:14:22,374
What day is it?

1093
02:14:25,168 --> 02:14:28,297
It is...today.

1094
02:14:30,132 --> 02:14:35,095
As the day wore on, David thought
it was the happiest day of his life.

1095
02:14:35,304 --> 02:14:40,434
All the problems seemed to have
disappeared from his mommy's mind.

1096
02:14:40,642 --> 02:14:44,479
There was no Henry,
there was no Martin.

1097
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:48,900
There was no grief.
There was only David.

1098
02:14:59,369 --> 02:15:01,830
David was told
not to explain anything...

1099
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:05,834
...or she'd be frightened
and everything would be spoiled.

1100
02:15:06,084 --> 02:15:08,837
But David's journey home
belonged to him.

1101
02:15:09,045 --> 02:15:14,092
So he didn't see the harm of painting
things she'd have no memory of.

1102
02:15:41,619 --> 02:15:45,373
David had never had a birthday
because he'd never been born.

1103
02:15:45,582 --> 02:15:48,626
So they baked a cake
and lit candles.

1104
02:15:48,876 --> 02:15:53,006
-Now make a wish.
-It came true already.

1105
02:15:58,886 --> 02:16:01,639
By now, the windows
were beginning to dim.

1106
02:16:01,848 --> 02:16:06,978
David drew the shades without
even needing to be asked.

1107
02:16:15,403 --> 02:16:18,656
I really ought to be tucking you in.

1108
02:16:19,365 --> 02:16:21,325
How strange.

1109
02:16:25,663 --> 02:16:27,790
How fascinating.

1110
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:35,756
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

1111
02:16:36,298 --> 02:16:39,051
I don't know what's come over me.

1112
02:16:44,723 --> 02:16:47,518
Such a beautiful day.

1113
02:16:50,229 --> 02:16:52,356
I love you, David.

1114
02:16:58,529 --> 02:17:00,739
I do love you.

1115
02:17:02,366 --> 02:17:06,036
I have always loved you.

1116
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:13,711
That was the everlasting moment
he had been waiting for.

1117
02:17:15,462 --> 02:17:20,759
And the moment had passed,
for Monica was sound asleep.

1118
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,763
More than merely asleep.

1119
02:17:25,597 --> 02:17:28,976
Should he shake her,
she would never rouse.

1120
02:17:32,813 --> 02:17:35,732
So David went to sleep too.

1121
02:17:36,692 --> 02:17:41,238
And for the first time in his life...

1122
02:17:41,947 --> 02:17:44,700
...he went to that place...

1123
02:17:45,242 --> 02:17:49,079
... where dreams are born.

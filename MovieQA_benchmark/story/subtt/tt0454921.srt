1
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,858
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:37,703 --> 00:01:39,992
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

3
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,688
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,369
- I think I should make a list.
- What do you mean?

5
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:41,955
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,707
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,966
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:52,094
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,505
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:58,306
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

11
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:05,144
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

12
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,363
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:19,614
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,411
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,168
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,252
Excuse me.

17
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,761
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,260
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,807
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:43,438
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,610
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,115
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,569
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,280
... that when I had children...

25
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,830
... my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,462
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:07,625
This part is called "Riding the Bus."

28
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,801
What's that?

29
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,635
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,016
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:24,316
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:25,725
This machine...

33
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,441
... this machine on my lap...

34
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,613
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:32,861
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

36
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:35,320
- it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,494
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,956
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,662
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,958
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:48,920
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,260
- Well, maybe next...
- Thank you.

43
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:57,426
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,018
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

45
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,894
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:05,688
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:08,397
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,359
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,697
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,534
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,872
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:22,585
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:31,090
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,682
That's mine.

55
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,849
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,551
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,645
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,775
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

59
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:49,193
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,405
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,404
... to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,207
The problem is...

63
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,590
... I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,974
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,721
Since birth?

66
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,228
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,525
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:25,227
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:28,532
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,735
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,538
Make every side the same colour.

72
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,122
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,539
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,468
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:50,546
That's... It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,885
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,474
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:55,688 --> 00:08:01,311
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:05,655
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:17,325
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,962
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:24,874
... a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:28,304
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,174
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:33,013
... and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,976
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,274
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,854
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:47,488
... for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:52,909
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1957.

91
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,697
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:55,918 --> 00:09:00,212
... we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,378
Twenty years ago, in 1960...

94
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:07,721
... our federal government payroll
was less than $13 billion.

95
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,636
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:16,391
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23.3 percent...

97
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,336
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:40,666
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:45,260
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,428
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:51,424
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:54,016
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,270
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,938
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

105
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,532
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:17,460
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,051
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,987
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,322
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:52,825
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,664
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,164
You know, when I...

113
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,003
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:04,552
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,590
What job?

116
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,305
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,810
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,193
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,709
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:43,626
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:45,554
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,423
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,847
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:54,805
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,899
Probably not.

126
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,567
We're already two months behind.

127
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,817
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:07,412
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,124
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:16,036
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,468
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,052
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:24,594
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,429
Linda.

135
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,564
Linda.

136
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:04,629
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

137
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:07,965
Can I ask you a favour, miss?

138
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:12,054
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,765
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,978
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:22,282
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,743
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:31,831
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

144
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,877
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,424
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,391
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,851
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,684
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,022
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:57,152
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

151
00:13:57,363 --> 00:14:00,364
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:03,991
- We...
- Thank you very much.

153
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,366
I need to go.

154
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:07,664
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,036
- Thank you.
- Okay.

156
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:21,887
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:23,722
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:29,390
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

159
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:37,276
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay...!

160
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,573
Stop! Stop!

161
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,995
Don't move!
Stop this...! Stop the train!

162
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,335
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,974
The programme took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,270
One got the job.

165
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:22,197
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:26,534
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,631
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:48,185
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,805
... made up of multiple colours
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:53,647
... and try to get
to a solid colour on each side.

171
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,480
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1981.

172
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,075
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:01,692
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:04,403
... who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,830
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:10,412
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,251
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:16,171
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,880
Eat.

180
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,469
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

181
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,684
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:27,812
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:30,431
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,608
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,851
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,734
Bye.

187
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:40,532
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,865
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,825
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:49,625
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:52,958
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:58,051
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:01,134
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

194
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,509
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,810
My nickname.

196
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,599
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:11,184
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,237
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

199
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,154
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,240
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:27,083
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:30,877
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,588
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

204
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,593
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:39,589
- How do you know Bonanza?
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,351
- You watch Bonanza at daycare?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,477
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,355
- After snack? After your nap?
- After Love Boat.

209
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,441
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,745
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,630
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,925
- Love Boat?
- For history. Navy.

213
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,380
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,720
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:23,310
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:25,893
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:29,891
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,987
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:42,279
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:43,958
Bye.

221
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:32,207
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:37,974
... whose name sounded so delightful,
like he’d give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:42,181
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,938
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.
- Good morning.

225
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,559
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

226
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,562
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:52,147
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,571
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,572
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,742
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

231
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,423
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,792
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,169
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,888
I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,633
Right. We can still...? Half an hour?

236
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,519
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,196
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,659
Hey!

239
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,249
This part of my life...

240
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:44,128
- Wait!
- ... this part here...

241
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,338
... it's called "Running."

242
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,458
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,254
Wait!

244
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,966
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:57,554
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:59,807
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,600
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,484
... because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,314
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,323
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,906
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,664
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:21,365
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:25,452
... would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:31,508
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:37,681
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:43,559
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:49,149
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,200
Hey, man, I...

260
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,371
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

261
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:14,755
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

262
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,217
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,640
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

264
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,577
Hey.

265
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:38,122
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:47,331
One, two, three!

267
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:51,547
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:53,472
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:57,597
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:00,268
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

271
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,774
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:14,029
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:27,796
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,549
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

275
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,341
Whatever.

276
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:37,018
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,431
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:42,435
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:43,980
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:46,483
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:48,156
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,738
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:53,703
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:57,247
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:02,244
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

286
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:07,459
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,858
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,741
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:29,776
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:33,030
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

291
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,488
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,665
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,162
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,705
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,668
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,336
- All right, get in.
- All right.

297
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:58,189
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,233
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:06,070
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:07,824
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:13,276
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,578
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

303
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,213
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:27,095
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:30,721
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

307
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:32,506
Give it here.

308
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:39,773
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:41,526
Sorry.

310
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:48,025
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

311
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:51,327
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:54,029
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:57,868
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:01,123
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,048
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

316
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:04,421
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:06,544
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:10,714
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,902
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:27,992
Holy cow.

321
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:41,997
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:51,301
Look at that.

323
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:15,783
You're almost there.

324
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:43,228
- 1710.
- This is me.

325
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,742
Good job.

326
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,699
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,834
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,046
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:04,087
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:07,720
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

331
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,395
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,314
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

333
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,359
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,897
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

335
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,105
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,861
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,618
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

338
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,488
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,163
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

340
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,298
I'll get you!

341
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:27,012
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,484
Hey!

343
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,573
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,948
Stop him!

345
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,869
Stop him!

346
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,844
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:05,890
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:16,936
No! No! No!

349
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,406
No!

350
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,924
- Hello?
- Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,851
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:53,274
- Chris, I missed my shift.
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:56,769
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,359
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,566
- What?
- Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:06,366
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,123
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,875
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:13,619
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...
- I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:22,752
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:26,513
... the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:32,807
... and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,852
And I remember thinking.

364
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,447
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:44,320
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,574
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,576
... no matter what.

368
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,501
How did he know that?

369
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:59,505
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,172
- Hello?
- Chris.

371
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:37,004
- Who is this?
- Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:39,671
- Hey.
- Dean Witter.

373
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,557
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,222
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:46,716
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:49,808
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:53,773
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,570
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,285
- Hold on one second.
- All right.

380
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:07,288
Hello?

381
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,826
- Chris?
- Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,667
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:14,921
- She can give you all the specifics.
- Yep.

384
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:17,008
- Okay, 415.
- 415.

385
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:18,927
- 864.
- 864.

386
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,131
- 0256.
- 0256.

387
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:24,350
- Yeah, extension 4796.
- 4796.

388
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,808
- Right. Call her tomorrow.
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:30,304
- Okay, buddy.
- All right, yes.

390
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,684
- Thank you very much.
- We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,607
864-0256.

392
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:40,027
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,907
- Chris.
- Hey.

394
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,366
Did you...? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:49,459
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

396
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,046
You didn't see that, 118, 1...?

397
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:53,462
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:57,293
- No, I haven't seen them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:59,635
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

400
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:01,473
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:03,806
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,640
- What's your problem with numbers?
- 864-2...

403
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,765
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

404
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,726
You owe me $14.

405
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,817
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:16,152
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,317
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:49,022
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:50,514
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

410
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,527
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,529
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,025
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:58,243 --> 00:34:59,737
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

414
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:02,789
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,868
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,623
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,127
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,425
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:17,209
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,806
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:21,223
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:23,226
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,892
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:55,010
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,546
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

426
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,765
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,431
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,690
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,447
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:23,121
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,457
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:28,291
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:31,957
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:33,718
- Yeah.
- All right.

435
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,968
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,807
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:56,944
Christopher.

438
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:17,348
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:18,969
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,557
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,807
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:26,566
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:30,192
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:33,696
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,107
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:37,615
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

447
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,952
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:45,540
All right, but I just... I gotta have some
more time... I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:55,212
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,736
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:52,027
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:56,109
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:59,781
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:38:60,000 --> 00:39:01,459
This is all I got.

455
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:09,635
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:13,214
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:16,969
No.

458
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:18,976
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,760
- I have to pick up my son.
- We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:26,608
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10: 15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,480
- I cannot stay...
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,022
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:33,697
- Is there anyone else who can...?
- I take care of him.

464
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:36,947
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:44,667
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:50,126
- Hello.
- Hey.

467
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,053
What do you want?

468
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:57,850
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,686
Just keep him for the night and I'm...
And... Just one night.

470
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,940
What happened?

471
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,604
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,566
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

473
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,072
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,863
- No.
- Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:21,329
- Why you doing that?
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,882
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,257
- How is he?
- He's fine.

478
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,554
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,549
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,723
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,564
Okay?

482
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,318
Linda?

483
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,401
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:50,440
All right, all right.

485
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,533
Thank you.

486
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,449
Bye.

487
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:22,983
I'm okay?

488
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:00,062
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:02,067
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:12,494
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:21,496
This way.

492
00:42:23,716 --> 00:42:25,756
It'll be right over there.

493
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:39,231
What is the one like that one?

494
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,796
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:05,385 --> 00:43:07,045
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:09,464
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:13,925
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:14,145 --> 00:43:16,102
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:19,850
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:21,610
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:26,067
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:30,327
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:35,365
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:40,246
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,209
So the truth is...

506
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:46,047
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:48,089
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,175
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:54,386
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:54,604 --> 00:43:57,605
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:57,816 --> 00:43:59,974
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:01,934
I hope so.

513
00:44:02,154 --> 00:44:03,862
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:06,445
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:08,782
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:12,364
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:15,583
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:17,786
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,664
Absolutely.

520
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:22,215
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,502
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,389
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,340
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

524
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:32,766
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:37,559
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,602
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:43,029
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

528
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,983
It was a small town.

529
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:48,777
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:52,246
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,537
Can I say something?

532
00:44:57,713 --> 00:44:59,421
I'm the type of person...

533
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:02,882
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:05,336
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:06,883
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:12,093
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:15,021
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:17,472
Chris.

539
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,519
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,732
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,868
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:35,209
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:49,935 --> 00:45:53,470
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:55,931
...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,558
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:01,691
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,779
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:06,950
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

549
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:09,285
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:12,249
- You stood here...
- Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:13,834
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:15,622
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:19,872
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...
- All right. Okay.

554
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:24,589
Tonight.

555
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:28,305
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:31,519
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:34,683
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

558
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:38,399
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,855
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,452
Tonight.

561
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:56,711
There was no salary.

562
00:46:56,923 --> 00:47:00,090
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:11,393
One intern was hired at the end
of the programme from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,011
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:15,604
... you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:47:15,818 --> 00:47:17,645
... to another brokerage.

567
00:47:20,197 --> 00:47:22,321
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:26,448
... would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:31,115
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:21,212
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

571
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:22,971
All right.

572
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,228
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:45,578
I got it.

574
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,583
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:24,360
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,454
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,701
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:34,674 --> 00:49:36,583
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:46,352
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:48,637
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:50,729
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:53,980
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,411
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:05,665 --> 00:50:11,170
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:12,838
...and I got it.

586
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:15,586
So I'm gonna stand out
in my programme.

587
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:19,378
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:21,506
No, it's not.

589
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:25,344
I gotta go.

590
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,302
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,557
And...

592
00:51:09,482 --> 00:51:11,808
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,735
I know that.

594
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:58,075
- Dean Witter.
- Yes, hi.

595
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:02,116
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,865
- Your name?
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,199
The message is:

598
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:13,090
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the programme.

599
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:19,137
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:21,222
Is that all?

601
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:23,060
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:25,013
- Okay.
- Thank you.

603
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,807
Bye.

604
00:52:53,384 --> 00:52:54,665
- Be careful with that.
- What?

605
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:57,673
Be care... Go ahead.

606
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:24,457
- Are we there?
- Yep.

607
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:40,303
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

608
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,178
- What?
- Saturday.

609
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:44,684
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:47,305
- What?
- Basketball.

611
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:50,396
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

612
00:53:50,612 --> 00:53:53,185
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:57,654
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

614
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:01,243
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,916
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:06,212 --> 00:54:07,587
Okay.

617
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:10,584
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,542
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:16,846
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:20,842
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,682
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:26,768
...I really... You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:29,392
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:31,106
- All right?
- All right.

625
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:33,149
Okay.

626
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:35,950
All right, go ahead.

627
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:01,393
Hey.

628
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:06,891
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,648
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:10,363 --> 00:55:12,486
Not even me.

631
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,992
- All right?
- All right.

632
00:55:17,704 --> 00:55:19,863
You got a dream...

633
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:22,324
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:25,079
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:27,703
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:32,053 --> 00:55:35,837
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:45,476
Let's go.

638
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,109
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:51,323 --> 00:55:53,779
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

640
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:58,078
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

641
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,041
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

642
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:05,206
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

643
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:07,962
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:10,381
I don't know, Christopher.

645
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:12,670
Dad, listen to this.

646
00:56:12,888 --> 00:56:16,339
One day, a man was drownding
in the water.

647
00:56:16,558 --> 00:56:19,014
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

648
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:21,553
He said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

649
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:24,939
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

650
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:27,523
And he said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

651
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:29,860
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

652
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:33,276
And he said, " God,
why didn't you save me?"

653
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:36,993
And God said, " I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

654
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,749
Do you like it?

655
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,663
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

656
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,336
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

657
00:56:50,553 --> 00:56:52,177
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

658
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:53,764
All the information you'll need.

659
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:55,598
Thank you very much
for your business.

660
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:57,303
Thank you.

661
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:02,773
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

662
00:57:02,983 --> 00:57:04,607
...7, 8, 9, 10.

663
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:06,273
Thank you.

664
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:11,573
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

665
00:57:11,784 --> 00:57:14,073
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

666
00:57:14,995 --> 00:57:18,495
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

667
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:36,423
This part of my life
is called "Internship."

668
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:39,977
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

669
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:42,478
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

670
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,565
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

671
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,604
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

672
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:49,941
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

673
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,946
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

674
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:55,913
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

675
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:59,124
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

676
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:02,585
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

677
00:58:02,796 --> 00:58:05,714
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

678
00:58:05,925 --> 00:58:10,836
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

679
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:13,178
...we'll cook the fish.

680
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:16,014
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

681
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:18,599
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

682
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:21,352
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

683
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:23,773
That person's gonna be the guy...

684
00:58:23,985 --> 00:58:26,227
...who can turn this into this.

685
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:29,531
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

686
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:31,867
You, you, help me hand these out.

687
00:58:32,745 --> 00:58:35,781
This is going to be your bible.

688
00:58:35,998 --> 00:58:37,327
You'll eat with it.

689
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,202
- You'll drink with it.
- It was simple.

690
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:42,373
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

691
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:45,543
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

692
00:58:45,842 --> 00:58:48,926
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

693
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:51,296
- ... in the company's pocket.
- Your board exam.

694
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:57,387
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

695
00:58:57,604 --> 00:59:00,938
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass-fail.

696
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,566
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

697
00:59:04,779 --> 00:59:07,104
Be safe, score a hundred.

698
00:59:08,116 --> 00:59:11,236
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

699
00:59:20,545 --> 00:59:23,463
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

700
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:25,880
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

701
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:30,173
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

702
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:32,465
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

703
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:34,510
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

704
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:37,514
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

705
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,438
Oh, man, I remember mine.

706
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:42,140
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

707
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,768
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

708
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:48,357
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

709
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:50,734
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

710
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:53,278
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

711
00:59:53,497 --> 00:59:55,822
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

712
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:58,829
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

713
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:32,282
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

714
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,451
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

715
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,825
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

716
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,333
I'm trying to cross the street.

717
01:00:40,547 --> 01:00:43,999
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

718
01:00:44,343 --> 01:00:45,885
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

719
01:00:46,095 --> 01:00:49,879
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

720
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,221
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

721
01:01:00,068 --> 01:01:01,527
Hey.

722
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:05,689
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

723
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:09,241
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

724
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:12,370
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

725
01:01:13,082 --> 01:01:16,782
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

726
01:01:17,127 --> 01:01:20,662
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

727
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:32,892
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

728
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:37,183
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

729
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,405
Dad.

730
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:47,950
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

731
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,245
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

732
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:53,450
I got hit by a car.

733
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:56,336
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

734
01:01:56,544 --> 01:02:00,163
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

735
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:03,418
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

736
01:02:03,635 --> 01:02:05,462
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

737
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,846
- Were you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

738
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,928
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

739
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,138
Yeah, thanks.

740
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,098
I'll remember that next time.

741
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,776
And here I was again.

742
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,607
- Show up early.
- While qualified persons...

743
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,732
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

744
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,825
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

745
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,077
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

746
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:35,157
Favours for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

747
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,951
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

748
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,580
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

749
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,670
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

750
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:45,215
Okay, yes, thank you.

751
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,805
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

752
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:50,715
- Chris?
- Yes, sir.

753
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:55,270
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

754
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,108
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

755
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,606
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

756
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,148
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

757
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:04,567
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax...

758
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:07,025
Okay, thank you, sir.

759
01:03:08,162 --> 01:03:12,824
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness."

760
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,834
Then the cross-town.

761
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,163
The 22 home.

762
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,086
- Hey, Chris!
- Hey. Hi, Ralph.

763
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,172
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

764
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,464
I'm gonna get that for you.

765
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:38,065
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

766
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:40,353
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

767
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:43,656
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

768
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:46,155
- From the bottom to the top.
- Yes, sir.

769
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:49,039
- From the doorman to the CEO.
- Okay.

770
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:52,453
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

771
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:55,704
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

772
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:59,041
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

773
01:03:59,258 --> 01:04:00,836
In order not to waste any time...

774
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:03,210
... I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

775
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:05,505
Okay, thank you very much.

776
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,258
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

777
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:11,434
... I gained another eight minutes
a day.

778
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:13,888
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

779
01:04:14,107 --> 01:04:16,598
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- I wasn't drinking water...

780
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:18,858
... so I didn't waste any time
in the bathroom.

781
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:21,229
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity...

782
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:24,533
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

783
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:26,072
But even doing all this...

784
01:04:26,287 --> 01:04:30,367
... after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

785
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:46,088
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

786
01:04:46,308 --> 01:04:47,506
Walter Ribbon's office.

787
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:50,935
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

788
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:52,261
- Concerning?
- Yes, ma'am.

789
01:04:52,481 --> 01:04:53,810
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

790
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,732
Just a moment.

791
01:04:57,653 --> 01:04:59,361
- Hello?
- Mr. Ribbon.

792
01:04:59,572 --> 01:05:02,526
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

793
01:05:02,742 --> 01:05:04,450
- Yeah, Chris.
- Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

794
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:08,077
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

795
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,697
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

796
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,744
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

797
01:05:14,046 --> 01:05:16,963
- Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
- Just had someone cancel.

798
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,297
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

799
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:22,630
- Monday Night Football, buddy.
- Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

800
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:25,136
- See you soon.
- Bye-bye.

801
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:29,845
Excuse me. Thank you.

802
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:31,640
- Chris, what's up?
- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

803
01:05:31,856 --> 01:05:33,137
Hey, do you have five minutes?

804
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:35,018
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

805
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:38,319
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

806
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,780
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

807
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:45,159
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

808
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,944
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

809
01:05:48,165 --> 01:05:49,659
And you have to jimmy that.

810
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,833
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

811
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:56,707
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

812
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,643
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

813
01:06:17,905 --> 01:06:19,316
Oh, no!

814
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:22,069
Come on.

815
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:37,171
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

816
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,885
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

817
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:52,142
No, no, no!

818
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:05,037
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

819
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:54,669
- Hi.
- Hi.

820
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:57,457
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

821
01:07:57,678 --> 01:07:59,089
Oh, you just missed him.

822
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:03,224
Thank you.

823
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:31,202
- What's that?
- Just filling out a cheque...

824
01:08:31,422 --> 01:08:33,913
...paying some bills...

825
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:36,173
...and a parking ticket.

826
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:40,094
We don't have a car anymore.

827
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,513
Yep, I know.

828
01:08:46,062 --> 01:08:49,099
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

829
01:08:49,316 --> 01:08:51,558
A couple of doctors' offices.

830
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:55,859
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

831
01:08:58,784 --> 01:09:02,782
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

832
01:09:02,997 --> 01:09:05,832
- Really?
- Possibly.

833
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,706
- All right?
- All right.

834
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,996
Come on, finish up.

835
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:14,460
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

836
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:17,255
Really?

837
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:51,754
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

838
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:54,920
And maybe
we're going to the game.

839
01:09:56,429 --> 01:10:00,379
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

840
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,427
I don't understand.

841
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:05,847
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

842
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:08,602
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

843
01:10:08,817 --> 01:10:11,142
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

844
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,983
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

845
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:16,949
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

846
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:20,196
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

847
01:10:20,413 --> 01:10:21,788
And what does "possibly" mean?

848
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:24,453
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

849
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:27,205
It means that we're not going
to the game.

850
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,130
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

851
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:39,974
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

852
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:47,065
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

853
01:10:47,274 --> 01:10:50,145
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

854
01:10:50,695 --> 01:10:53,150
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

855
01:10:53,364 --> 01:10:54,858
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

856
01:10:55,074 --> 01:10:57,482
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologise...

857
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:00,324
...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

858
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:03,160
We were in the neighbourhood
visiting a very close friend...

859
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:06,874
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

860
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:09,922
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

861
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,670
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

862
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:14,925
Oh, come on. What's that?

863
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:18,589
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

864
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:22,351
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

865
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:25,183
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

866
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:27,190
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

867
01:11:28,234 --> 01:11:29,563
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

868
01:11:29,778 --> 01:11:31,438
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

869
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:32,770
We were just leaving. Tim!

870
01:11:33,073 --> 01:11:34,982
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

871
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,905
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

872
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,196
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

873
01:11:40,414 --> 01:11:41,908
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

874
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:43,784
You take care. Here, come on.

875
01:11:44,001 --> 01:11:45,330
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

876
01:11:45,545 --> 01:11:47,169
Bye, Christopher.

877
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,874
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

878
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:52,044
- What...? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

879
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,380
- Where are your seats?
- We've... We're upper deck.

880
01:11:55,597 --> 01:11:56,842
We got a box. Come on.

881
01:11:57,057 --> 01:11:59,215
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

882
01:12:00,394 --> 01:12:04,344
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

883
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:07,020
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

884
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:11,394
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

885
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,237
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

886
01:12:16,953 --> 01:12:19,907
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

887
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,997
- Oh, my...
- What happened?

888
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:24,585
I think I got stung by a bee.

889
01:12:24,795 --> 01:12:27,712
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

890
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,496
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

891
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:34,051
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

892
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:36,671
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

893
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:39,014
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

894
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:43,094
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

895
01:12:43,314 --> 01:12:45,640
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

896
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:48,646
... in the Declaration
of Independence.

897
01:12:49,112 --> 01:12:51,650
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

898
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:56,776
... but he was sort of...
He was an artist.

899
01:12:57,037 --> 01:13:01,616
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony."

900
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:03,661
And I remember standing there
that day...

901
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:06,167
... thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

902
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,628
Questions I had.
Whether all this was good.

903
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,802
Whether I'd make it.

904
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:18,808
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

905
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,347
... which was millions.

906
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,187
Yeah!

907
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,565
It was a way to another place.

908
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,441
Wow, this is...

909
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,778
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

910
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,074
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

911
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:37,535
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

912
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:40,618
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

913
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,076
...which we believe
to be far superior...

914
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,868
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

915
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,916
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

916
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:53,171
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

917
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:55,927
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

918
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:59,593
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

919
01:13:59,812 --> 01:14:01,888
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

920
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:05,226
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

921
01:14:06,194 --> 01:14:07,474
Yes!

922
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,530
Yes! Yeah!

923
01:14:17,247 --> 01:14:18,279
- Here you go.
- All right.

924
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:20,242
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

925
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:23,033
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

926
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:24,914
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

927
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:26,708
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

928
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,308
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

929
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:10,342
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

930
01:15:11,638 --> 01:15:13,014
It seemed we were making it.

931
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:15,177
What's the...

932
01:15:15,559 --> 01:15:18,050
...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

933
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:23,689
It seemed we were doing good.

934
01:15:23,901 --> 01:15:25,645
Until one day...

935
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:27,612
... that day...

936
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,113
... that letter brought me
back to earth.

937
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,073
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes."

938
01:15:42,129 --> 01:15:43,457
If you didn't pay them...

939
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,590
... the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

940
01:15:47,259 --> 01:15:48,422
... and take your money.

941
01:15:48,636 --> 01:15:49,632
Dad.

942
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,838
No warning. Nothing.

943
01:15:52,056 --> 01:15:55,176
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

944
01:15:55,393 --> 01:15:58,513
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

945
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:00,136
I was... I was...

946
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:03,642
Listen, I...
That's all the money that I have.

947
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:08,155
You cannot go into my bank acc...
No...

948
01:16:08,365 --> 01:16:10,737
It was the 25th of September.

949
01:16:10,951 --> 01:16:12,659
I remember that day.

950
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,946
Because that's the day
that I found out...

951
01:16:15,164 --> 01:16:20,289
... there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

952
01:16:20,503 --> 01:16:22,163
I was broke.

953
01:16:32,558 --> 01:16:34,846
- Dressed yet?
- No.

954
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:42,064
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

955
01:16:42,276 --> 01:16:45,028
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

956
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:48,821
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

957
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:50,907
Now!

958
01:16:54,581 --> 01:16:56,657
Hey, what's happening, man?

959
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:59,752
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

960
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:03,295
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

961
01:17:03,507 --> 01:17:06,544
- What? Why?
- Why what?

962
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:09,133
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

963
01:17:09,347 --> 01:17:11,304
I helped you move.

964
01:17:13,559 --> 01:17:16,430
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

965
01:17:16,646 --> 01:17:18,390
That's 200 yards.

966
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:20,564
It's been four months, Wayne.

967
01:17:20,775 --> 01:17:24,358
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

968
01:17:24,571 --> 01:17:26,896
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

969
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:29,322
- Wayne, get my mo...
- I really don't, man. It's $14.

970
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,243
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

971
01:17:31,453 --> 01:17:33,991
- All of this for $14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

972
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,509
Dad, look at me!

973
01:17:54,978 --> 01:17:56,686
Dad.

974
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:01,225
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

975
01:18:17,294 --> 01:18:18,325
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

976
01:18:18,545 --> 01:18:20,123
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

977
01:18:20,339 --> 01:18:23,126
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

978
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:31,722
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

979
01:18:34,771 --> 01:18:36,395
Dad!

980
01:18:36,606 --> 01:18:39,975
Dad, wait! Dad!

981
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,199
- Dad.
- I gotta...

982
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:53,781
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

983
01:18:53,999 --> 01:18:58,293
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

984
01:19:01,382 --> 01:19:04,052
Bring back my time machine!

985
01:19:05,386 --> 01:19:07,047
Bring my time machine back!

986
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:19,522
- Dad, where are we going?
- Be quiet.

987
01:19:20,152 --> 01:19:22,857
Go get your things. Go.

988
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:47,756
- Chris?
- Yes.

989
01:19:47,973 --> 01:19:51,888
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

990
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:05,528
Where are we going now?

991
01:20:06,284 --> 01:20:09,570
We gotta... We gotta
see somebody else.

992
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:13,788
I'm tired.

993
01:20:15,794 --> 01:20:17,419
I know.

994
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:28,932
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

995
01:20:29,351 --> 01:20:31,639
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

996
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:35,721
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

997
01:20:37,526 --> 01:20:39,815
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

998
01:20:40,029 --> 01:20:42,864
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

999
01:20:43,073 --> 01:20:48,281
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1000
01:20:48,496 --> 01:20:50,619
I really have to go, Chris.

1001
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,541
Thank you. Thank you.

1002
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:55,625
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1003
01:20:55,837 --> 01:20:57,497
I'll see you soon.

1004
01:21:49,519 --> 01:21:51,927
Why are our things here?

1005
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:54,564
Dad.

1006
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:39,816
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

1007
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:43,738
- Just out of here.
- Why?

1008
01:22:43,952 --> 01:22:46,953
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

1009
01:22:47,164 --> 01:22:50,118
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

1010
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:55,703
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1011
01:22:55,923 --> 01:22:57,417
Stop it.

1012
01:23:01,637 --> 01:23:03,096
Come on.

1013
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,684
Come on.

1014
01:23:30,668 --> 01:23:32,328
Wayne!

1015
01:23:33,421 --> 01:23:35,295
Wayne!

1016
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:44,803
Wayne!

1017
01:24:00,366 --> 01:24:04,067
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1018
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,968
Where are we going?

1019
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:27,475
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

1020
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,361
It's not a time machine.

1021
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,992
Dad.

1022
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:48,703
It's not a time machine.

1023
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:52,168
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1024
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,914
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

1025
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,048
He said it was a time machine.

1026
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:04,637
Yes, it is.

1027
01:25:06,228 --> 01:25:08,019
No, it's not.

1028
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:11,981
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1029
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:22,742
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1030
01:25:25,915 --> 01:25:27,078
Wanna push it?

1031
01:25:31,588 --> 01:25:33,248
Okay.

1032
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,377
Come on.

1033
01:25:37,886 --> 01:25:39,511
Come on, man.

1034
01:25:45,186 --> 01:25:46,265
Right here.

1035
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,270
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1036
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:50,599
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1037
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,396
You gotta close your eyes.

1038
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:54,568
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1039
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,147
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1040
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:06,784
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1041
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:09,660
It takes a few seconds.

1042
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:13,963
Oh, my goodness.

1043
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:16,381
Open, open, open!

1044
01:26:19,764 --> 01:26:22,434
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

1045
01:26:22,642 --> 01:26:24,801
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1046
01:26:26,188 --> 01:26:29,853
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1047
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,982
- Do you see them?
- Yeah.

1048
01:26:34,196 --> 01:26:35,607
Wait. Come on, come on.

1049
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,151
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

1050
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:39,406
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1051
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:41,986
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1052
01:26:42,205 --> 01:26:43,616
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1053
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:46,657
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good... A T. rex.

1054
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:50,495
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1055
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:54,591
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

1056
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:56,759
We need a cave.

1057
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:58,050
A cave?

1058
01:26:58,263 --> 01:27:00,303
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

1059
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:02,259
Come on, come on.

1060
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:05,228
Watch your back! Look out.

1061
01:27:05,438 --> 01:27:07,477
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1062
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,561
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1063
01:27:10,777 --> 01:27:12,022
Go ahead. Get in.

1064
01:27:12,237 --> 01:27:14,063
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1065
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:21,449
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

1066
01:28:29,443 --> 01:28:31,068
Hey.

1067
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:34,280
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

1068
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:35,949
How are you getting along?

1069
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,317
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

1070
01:28:38,536 --> 01:28:41,075
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

1071
01:28:42,207 --> 01:28:43,832
Where you going?

1072
01:28:47,129 --> 01:28:50,130
I... Sacramento.

1073
01:28:50,841 --> 01:28:53,463
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from...

1074
01:28:53,678 --> 01:28:56,299
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over...

1075
01:28:56,514 --> 01:28:57,759
Get them over to us.

1076
01:28:57,974 --> 01:28:59,682
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1077
01:28:59,892 --> 01:29:01,719
Awesome.

1078
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,894
Hey, let them win a round.

1079
01:29:09,069 --> 01:29:11,062
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1080
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,364
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

1081
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:25,707
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1082
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,668
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1083
01:29:31,885 --> 01:29:33,509
We need a room.

1084
01:29:34,137 --> 01:29:37,091
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1085
01:29:37,307 --> 01:29:39,929
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

1086
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:42,599
- I wish I could help you...
- This is my son, Christopher.

1087
01:29:42,938 --> 01:29:44,931
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

1088
01:29:45,149 --> 01:29:48,185
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

1089
01:29:48,402 --> 01:29:51,273
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1090
01:29:51,489 --> 01:29:54,525
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1091
01:29:54,742 --> 01:29:56,153
We gotta stay together.

1092
01:29:56,369 --> 01:29:57,698
We got... We're...

1093
01:29:57,912 --> 01:29:59,739
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place...

1094
01:29:59,956 --> 01:30:02,827
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1095
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:04,537
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1096
01:30:04,753 --> 01:30:08,122
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

1097
01:30:43,377 --> 01:30:49,001
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1098
01:30:49,425 --> 01:30:52,296
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

1099
01:30:52,512 --> 01:30:53,710
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

1100
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,508
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

1101
01:30:55,724 --> 01:30:58,132
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't...

1102
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:02,098
Dad!

1103
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:04,599
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1104
01:31:04,817 --> 01:31:06,394
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:08,899
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

1106
01:31:09,113 --> 01:31:11,687
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1107
01:31:11,991 --> 01:31:13,948
I got here on time. I was in line.

1108
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,904
I came from work, I got my son.

1109
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,612
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1110
01:31:18,832 --> 01:31:20,456
He sliced in front of him in line.

1111
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:22,956
- Who did?
- He did.

1112
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:27,755
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1113
01:31:37,018 --> 01:31:38,975
That's it. No more.

1114
01:31:46,027 --> 01:31:48,981
- What's your favourite colour?
- Green.

1115
01:31:49,197 --> 01:31:50,442
Green?

1116
01:31:50,657 --> 01:31:53,658
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

1117
01:31:53,869 --> 01:31:56,823
Trees. What else?

1118
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:58,498
Holly.

1119
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:04,242
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

1120
01:32:05,006 --> 01:32:06,998
Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,544
What's that?

1122
01:32:12,764 --> 01:32:15,682
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1123
01:32:22,232 --> 01:32:27,227
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1124
01:32:27,696 --> 01:32:29,404
Can he breathe?

1125
01:32:29,615 --> 01:32:31,857
- He's good?
- Yeah.

1126
01:32:32,326 --> 01:32:34,319
- I gotta go work on the scanner...
- Don't go.

1127
01:32:34,537 --> 01:32:37,704
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1128
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:42,044
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1129
01:32:42,545 --> 01:32:45,215
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1130
01:32:45,424 --> 01:32:47,915
I wanna go home.

1131
01:32:50,012 --> 01:32:53,796
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1132
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,510
All right?

1133
01:32:56,727 --> 01:32:58,637
I'm gonna go out there.

1134
01:32:58,854 --> 01:33:02,224
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1135
01:33:03,318 --> 01:33:05,026
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1136
01:33:05,987 --> 01:33:08,110
- All right?
- All right.

1137
01:33:08,323 --> 01:33:10,648
You gotta trust me, okay?

1138
01:33:10,867 --> 01:33:12,907
You gotta trust me.

1139
01:33:13,787 --> 01:33:16,409
I trust you. I trust you.

1140
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:18,082
I trust you.

1141
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:21,246
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

1142
01:33:25,091 --> 01:33:26,799
Give me a kiss.

1143
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:42,435
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

1144
01:33:42,901 --> 01:33:45,357
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

1145
01:33:45,571 --> 01:33:47,777
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

1146
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:49,449
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1147
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:52,156
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:34:39,378 --> 01:34:41,038
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1149
01:34:41,255 --> 01:34:44,920
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

1150
01:34:45,134 --> 01:34:48,633
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

1151
01:34:48,846 --> 01:34:49,878
Good.

1152
01:34:51,224 --> 01:34:53,466
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1153
01:34:54,727 --> 01:34:57,682
- Dad, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

1154
01:34:57,897 --> 01:35:00,021
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1155
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:01,776
Go.

1156
01:35:07,116 --> 01:35:08,491
Hey, Chris.

1157
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:12,034
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

1158
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,195
Work trip.

1159
01:35:14,415 --> 01:35:16,704
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1160
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:18,661
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

1161
01:35:18,878 --> 01:35:20,538
...looking to retire at the same time?

1162
01:35:20,755 --> 01:35:22,831
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1163
01:35:23,049 --> 01:35:24,460
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1164
01:35:24,676 --> 01:35:28,175
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1165
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:30,673
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal?

1166
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:32,765
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1167
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,260
I had to finish quickly.

1168
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:39,104
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1169
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:44,729
Come on.

1170
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,817
Come on.

1171
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:53,699
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1172
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:56,326
My Captain America!

1173
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:58,874
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1174
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:02,338
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1175
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:06,716
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

1176
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:09,966
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

1177
01:36:18,316 --> 01:36:19,775
Come on.

1178
01:36:22,779 --> 01:36:24,986
Dad, we need to get it!

1179
01:36:27,618 --> 01:36:30,239
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1180
01:36:30,454 --> 01:36:32,613
... is it's got to climb mountains.

1181
01:36:32,832 --> 01:36:35,583
We all have to deal with mountains.

1182
01:36:35,793 --> 01:36:38,711
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1183
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:41,123
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1184
01:36:41,341 --> 01:36:42,621
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

1185
01:36:42,842 --> 01:36:45,131
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1186
01:36:45,428 --> 01:36:47,551
We sing about them.

1187
01:36:48,348 --> 01:36:53,853
Lord, don't move that mountain

1188
01:36:55,272 --> 01:37:01,690
Give me strength to climb it

1189
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:08,864
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1190
01:37:09,078 --> 01:37:15,662
But lead me, Lord, around it

1191
01:37:17,295 --> 01:37:22,337
My burdens, they get so heavy

1192
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:29,801
Seems hard to bear

1193
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:34,309
But I won't give up
No, no

1194
01:37:34,522 --> 01:37:36,515
Because you promised me

1195
01:37:36,733 --> 01:37:43,483
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1196
01:37:43,698 --> 01:37:51,196
- Lord don't move that mountain
- Please don't move that mountain

1197
01:37:51,415 --> 01:37:56,706
But give me strength to climb it

1198
01:37:58,923 --> 01:38:00,916
When's your test?

1199
01:38:02,135 --> 01:38:03,629
Tomorrow.

1200
01:38:08,016 --> 01:38:09,807
Are you ready?

1201
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:15,141
Of course.

1202
01:38:54,273 --> 01:38:55,554
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:39:04,951 --> 01:39:07,110
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1204
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:14,121
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere?

1205
01:39:14,336 --> 01:39:16,792
I have to go somewhere.

1206
01:39:17,381 --> 01:39:20,217
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

1207
01:39:20,426 --> 01:39:22,335
- You?
- Yeah.

1208
01:39:22,845 --> 01:39:25,800
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

1209
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:30,895
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1210
01:39:31,104 --> 01:39:34,723
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

1211
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:45,989
Hey, Chris.

1212
01:39:46,204 --> 01:39:49,489
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

1213
01:39:49,707 --> 01:39:53,159
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

1214
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,878
Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

1215
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:59,760
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1216
01:40:00,552 --> 01:40:04,301
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1217
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:06,757
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1218
01:40:06,976 --> 01:40:09,977
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1219
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:17,518
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

1220
01:40:17,737 --> 01:40:21,355
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1221
01:40:34,713 --> 01:40:37,205
That's it. That's the room quota.

1222
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:40,343
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1223
01:40:40,553 --> 01:40:43,424
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1224
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:46,641
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1225
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:51,145
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:41:26,143 --> 01:41:27,886
You like it?

1227
01:42:18,949 --> 01:42:22,614
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1228
01:42:25,706 --> 01:42:29,325
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1229
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:32,331
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

1230
01:42:33,423 --> 01:42:36,756
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

1231
01:42:36,968 --> 01:42:39,008
Can I see it?

1232
01:42:40,889 --> 01:42:43,973
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1233
01:42:44,184 --> 01:42:48,681
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1234
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:51,725
I don't mind.

1235
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:54,026
Yeah, you will.

1236
01:43:10,337 --> 01:43:12,709
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1237
01:43:12,923 --> 01:43:14,038
Okay.

1238
01:43:14,258 --> 01:43:17,378
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

1239
01:43:17,636 --> 01:43:19,296
All right.

1240
01:43:21,432 --> 01:43:24,303
Did Mom leave because of me?

1241
01:43:27,647 --> 01:43:31,859
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:40,944
Don't... Don't even think
something like that.

1243
01:43:42,037 --> 01:43:44,160
Mom left because of Mom.

1244
01:43:44,373 --> 01:43:46,615
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1245
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,244
Okay.

1246
01:43:59,097 --> 01:44:01,137
You're a good papa.

1247
01:44:08,982 --> 01:44:10,975
All right, go to sleep.

1248
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:14,736
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1249
01:45:11,215 --> 01:45:13,172
So far, so good, Chris.

1250
01:45:19,265 --> 01:45:21,839
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

1251
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:25,844
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1252
01:45:26,231 --> 01:45:30,443
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1253
01:45:30,652 --> 01:45:33,404
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1254
01:45:34,573 --> 01:45:36,198
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

1255
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:37,689
Thank you. Thank you.

1256
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:39,867
- You ready?
- Yep.

1257
01:45:41,789 --> 01:45:44,707
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

1258
01:45:44,918 --> 01:45:46,875
Where are we going, then?

1259
01:45:47,671 --> 01:45:50,209
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

1260
01:45:50,423 --> 01:45:51,503
Just for the night.

1261
01:45:51,717 --> 01:45:54,468
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1262
01:45:54,678 --> 01:45:56,386
No, thank you.

1263
01:45:56,597 --> 01:45:59,135
- Ever?
- I hope not.

1264
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:00,808
Why not?

1265
01:46:01,018 --> 01:46:03,805
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1266
01:46:04,021 --> 01:46:06,347
...and then not so much the next.

1267
01:46:06,566 --> 01:46:09,436
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

1268
01:46:09,652 --> 01:46:13,104
I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1269
01:46:13,323 --> 01:46:16,692
It's promised in the Bible.
Pa says we'll find it some day.

1270
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:19,282
He doesn't know where it is, though.

1271
01:46:20,205 --> 01:46:23,408
Didn't you ever want to have a home
of your own like other people?

1272
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:25,452
Sure.

1273
01:46:25,878 --> 01:46:27,954
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1274
01:46:28,172 --> 01:46:31,339
... we pass houses with lights
and people.

1275
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,302
Sometimes you can
hear them laughing...

1276
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:41,927
The next day, after work...

1277
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:44,352
... we just went to the beach.

1278
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:46,438
Far away from anything.

1279
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:48,025
Everything.

1280
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:49,895
Just Christopher and me.

1281
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:53,902
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1282
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:57,201
Far away from buses and noise...

1283
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:03,035
... and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1284
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,084
... and in myself.

1285
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:09,043
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

1286
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,084
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

1287
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:12,795
Thanks, Chris.

1288
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:16,217
Because when I was young...

1289
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:20,180
... and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1290
01:47:20,394 --> 01:47:24,973
... I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1291
01:47:26,901 --> 01:47:30,519
And then I never became
any of them.

1292
01:47:38,038 --> 01:47:40,576
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

1293
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:43,412
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

1294
01:47:43,627 --> 01:47:47,755
Rumour has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1295
01:47:47,965 --> 01:47:49,376
Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:47:49,592 --> 01:47:53,376
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1297
01:47:53,596 --> 01:47:55,221
I guess.

1298
01:47:58,226 --> 01:48:00,432
So one more day.

1299
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:02,223
Getting nervous?

1300
01:48:02,814 --> 01:48:05,186
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1301
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,309
Listen, whatever happens...

1302
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:09,935
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1303
01:48:10,155 --> 01:48:11,697
I mean that.

1304
01:48:12,574 --> 01:48:14,366
Take care of yourself.

1305
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:32,546
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1306
01:48:32,888 --> 01:48:34,964
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1307
01:48:35,182 --> 01:48:37,673
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1308
01:48:38,227 --> 01:48:39,887
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1309
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:42,145
Yes, sir.

1310
01:48:42,356 --> 01:48:43,731
No, sir, that's it.

1311
01:48:43,941 --> 01:48:46,397
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1312
01:48:48,029 --> 01:48:50,899
Chris. Come.

1313
01:49:18,311 --> 01:49:21,395
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1314
01:49:22,524 --> 01:49:24,433
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

1315
01:49:24,651 --> 01:49:25,849
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

1316
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:30,567
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

1317
01:49:33,494 --> 01:49:37,574
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1318
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:39,747
You know,
being the last day and all.

1319
01:49:39,959 --> 01:49:43,293
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1320
01:49:44,172 --> 01:49:45,963
But...

1321
01:49:46,174 --> 01:49:48,961
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1322
01:49:49,177 --> 01:49:52,095
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1323
01:49:52,847 --> 01:49:56,051
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1324
01:49:57,394 --> 01:49:59,221
Would you like that, Chris?

1325
01:50:00,147 --> 01:50:01,725
Yes, sir.

1326
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,310
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1327
01:50:06,278 --> 01:50:09,445
So welcome.

1328
01:50:11,325 --> 01:50:16,320
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1329
01:50:18,667 --> 01:50:21,039
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1330
01:50:25,465 --> 01:50:27,126
Thank you, sir.

1331
01:50:27,468 --> 01:50:29,341
Oh, Chris.

1332
01:50:31,847 --> 01:50:33,923
I almost forgot.

1333
01:50:35,977 --> 01:50:37,519
Thank you.

1334
01:50:57,917 --> 01:51:00,123
This part of my life...

1335
01:51:01,045 --> 01:51:03,203

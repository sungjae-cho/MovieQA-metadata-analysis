00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:22,592
Hello, my name is Pat Haggerty.
- Nice meet you. Borat.

77
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,284
Should I make joke about
my mother-in-law?

78
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:31,246
In America, that's a very popular
joke. Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

79
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:37,919
I have sexy time with my mother-in-law?
- A what time?

80
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,463
Sexy time. I made sexy time
with my mother-in-law.

81
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:44,070
You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

82
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,074
I don't think that americans will find
that funny. - No, it is not a joke.

83
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:55,017
I'm talking about humor.
- Oh, yes, you ask me about my mother-in-law.

84
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,605
Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?
- No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?

85
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:06,277
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

86
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:13,367
Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.

87
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:19,101
But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.

88
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:25,044
My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.

89
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,883
Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.

90
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:36,513
Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say

91
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,911
You will never get this!
You will never get this!

92
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:44,749
He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.

93
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:52,464
But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!

94
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,118
That would not be funny in America.

95
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,435
What is a NOT jokes?

96
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,980
A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,

97
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:12,587
and what we do is we make a statement,

98
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,340
that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.

99
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,572
Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.

100
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,387
What color is your suit?
- This suit is grey.

101
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,994
Grey, I would call it blue.
- It's grey.

102
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,496
All right, it's blue grey,
but it certainly not black.

103
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,041
Let's say it's grey
- It is grey.

104
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:37,713
A NOT joke I would say:
that suit is black NOT!

105
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:43,448
This suit is not black.
- No, no, no. Not needs to be at the end.

106
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,367
This suit is black-not.

107
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:50,433
This suit is black, pause, you know what
pause is? - Yes.

108
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,205
This suit is black NOT!

109
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,959
This suit is black pause NOT.

110
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,608
You don't say pause.
This suit is black.

111
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,674
That's a pause NOT.

112
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:08,366
This suit is black.
- Ok.

113
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:12,536
NOT.

114
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:22,754
Everybody say USA television much better,
but this I watch for three hours and do not change.

115
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,801
This two arrows to change the channel.

116
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:17,386
Be careful, be careful, CJ.

117
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:21,660
This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.

118
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,769
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.

119
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,376
And the ass hole of a 7 years old.

120
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:34,901
For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.

121
00:15:56,483 --> 00:16:00,654
In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.

122
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,469
Except for in brothel or in grave.

123
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:08,056
In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.

124
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,350
I find them all.

125
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:15,146
So what does means this feminism?

126
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,193
It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...

127
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:27,657
You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.

128
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,202
Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.

129
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:36,415
But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?

130
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:37,562
That is wrong.

131
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:42,149
But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.

132
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,798
Your government scientist?
He's wrong.

133
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,717
Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?

134
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:54,452
Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.

135
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:01,229
I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.

136
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:08,005
All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.

137
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,508
Who was this CJ?

138
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,365
Last night, I see, in my hotel room,

139
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,308
a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.

140
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,019
She from a town called the Baywatches.

141
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:26,147
She's just on television.
Her name was Pamela.

142
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,275
Do she live here in New York?
- She lives in California.

143
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,881
O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.

144
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,132
Ok, can we finish now?

145
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,530
Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.

146
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,283
We're finished, we have to leave.

147
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:46,060
Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.

148
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:49,292
or else my wife will snap off my cock.

149
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,548
Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.

150
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,799
I have a telegram for you.

151
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:00,657
You can read?
- Yes, I can.

152
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:10,666
Dear Boratsendiev, your wife
Oksana was walking your retarded

153
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,628
brother in the woods when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

154
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:19,111
She is now dead.

155
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:22,030
What you saying my wife is dead?

156
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,200
This it what it's...

157
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:35,480
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.

158
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:39,858
Hi 5!

159
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:19,164
Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California

160
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,979
and make our reportings along
the way.

161
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,548
He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

162
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,159
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your
driving instructor. Wellcome to our country.

163
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,955
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

164
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:45,334
Now, you do know how to drive a
little bit? - Yes.

165
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,774
Put it in D.
- What?

166
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:50,234
Drive.

167
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:57,845
Wait a second, wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?

168
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,243
Yes, many times.
- All right, let's go this way.

169
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,537
Wait a minute, I don't want
you to hit anybody.

170
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:06,394
Now use two hands now.
- What?

171
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:10,982
But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.

172
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,318
I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?

173
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,597
Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.

174
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,829
Must not hit the children.

175
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:30,270
Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?

176
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,876
And maybe make a sexy time with her.

177
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:39,028
Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

178
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,885
What!? They do?
- There must be consent.

179
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:46,534
How about that. That's good, ha?

180
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:48,724
It's not good for me.

181
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:56,126
You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.

182
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,277
Who is this car that follow us?

183
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,301
Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.

184
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,097
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.

185
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,182
We'll make a right turn right here.

186
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:14,476
Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.

187
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:16,770
You fuck my mother.

188
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,106
He.. do before.
Look on me.

189
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,400
They're gonna throw us in jail.
Me with you.

190
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:26,049
Why in jail.
He look on me! Behind.

191
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,238
You can't say that.

192
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,636
I like you? Do you like me?
- I do like you.

193
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,181
You are my friend? - You're a nice
young man and I am your friend.

194
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,996
Will you be my boyfriend?
- I won't be your boyfriend.

195
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:41,896
Why not? You don't like me?
- Don't push, I can be.

196
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:48,465
Great success. Now time to make purchase
of motorcars.

197
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:52,739
I want to have a car that attract woman
with a shave down below.

198
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,659
That would be a Corvette.
Or a Hummer.

199
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,369
We will try to help you out here.

200
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:04,104
A man, yesterday, tell me,
if I buy a car,

201
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,274
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
- He means a car that women would like.

202
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,298
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, no there's no magnet.

203
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,530
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.

204
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,823
Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

205
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,122
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

206
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:28,709
There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.

207
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:34,443
If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?

208
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,675
It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!

209
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:42,263
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.

210
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,808
How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?

211
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,604
With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.

212
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:55,817
When I buy my wife,

213
00:22:55,921 --> 00:23:00,717
at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,

214
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:04,887
and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,

215
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:10,100
she become weak, her voice become a deep
Borat, Borat.

216
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:15,000
She receive a heir on chest.

217
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:18,754
And her vagin hang like
sleeve of wizard.

218
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:25,218
How do I know that this will not
happen with the car?

219
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:28,554
Chevrolet guarrantees that with
the warantee.

220
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,559
I like very much buy this Hommers.
How much is it? - 52 thousand.

221
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:41,274
I am looking for something between
600- 650 dollars.

222
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:44,402
We don't have cars for 650 in
that you can buy.

223
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,738
I might be able to sell you
a ho-sale car, a car with a lot of mileage

224
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,615
for 700 but with no warranty.
- Ok.

225
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,941
California, I coming.

226
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:20,684
First on my journey was Washington DCs,
home of the mighty US warlords,

227
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:22,144
premier Bush.

228
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,252
Fuck you, mother fuckers!

229
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,944
We arrive here to learn from
american politic.

230
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:37,157
As I arrange interview with party
official from ruling regime.

231
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:41,432
We're are good friend, yes?
- I hope so.

232
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:49,043
It is custom to have cheese
at the start. - Thank you.

233
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,673
My wife, she make this cheese.
- Very nice.

234
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,696
She make it from a milk from her tit.

235
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:11,459
After interview, I encounter
traditional american street festival.

236
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:22,197
People here were much more friendly
than in New York.

237
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,979
Next morning, I interview politician
who is a genuine chocolate face.

238
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,647
No make-up.

239
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:42,841
On a sunday, I arrive in Washingtons,
there was a parade, I make two friends,

240
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:50,556
from this parade, I invite them back to my
hotel room, we drink like a normal in Kazakstan,

241
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,433
we wrestle like a normal in Kazakstan,

242
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,812
then they say I wash you in the shower,
he wash me in the shower.

243
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:02,650
It sounds like you met somebody who is from,
what is called in America, the Gay community.

244
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,361
What it mean... gay?
- Homosexual.

245
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:07,133
Homosexual... you mean?

246
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:19,957
You telling me that man who tried to put
rubber fist in my anus was homosexual?

247
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:32,260
Even though my anus was broken, I knew that
rest of our journey would be great success.

248
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:38,411
We left Washingtons and continue towards
California. Howdy, partners!

249
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,794
This morning, we have a very special guest
here in the studio, this is Borhat Sahadyev.

250
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,756
He is travelling across America to give
a taste of life here in the United States.

251
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,362
He spent the last few days here in
our area.

252
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,134
Hello, my name Borat.

Can I have a microphone so people can
hear me? - They hear you right now.

00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,567
You're miked up. This little thing

Welcome to the United States. Thank you

267
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,348

you can use my sister.

269
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,585
Metereologist Ted Johnson with the latest

270
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:53,115

interstate 55

Go with Adrianne, she's calling you

276
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:32,213

You can see the rain..

00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:41,596
Nice to meet you!
- Thank you.

278
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,854
Of course, every picture that we get back
from the terrorists or anything else

279
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:41,546
the muslims, they look like you,
like your black moustache

280
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:45,612
Shave your damn moustache so you not
look so conspicuous

281
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,806
so you look like maybe an italian, or
something, as far as people looking at you.

282
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:58,540
I see a lot of people....
Young muslims working on bomb... strapped to it.

283
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:02,293
And you probably are not a muslim.
Maybe that't not your religion.

284
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,151
No, I'm kazak. I follow the hawk.
- But you look like one.

285
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:11,051
This thing gets over with, and we win it,
and kick the butts over there,

286
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,804
and all the damn sons of the buck hanging
from the gallow, by that time,

287
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,349
you've proven yourself and they'll
understand you and be accepted.

288
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:22,103
I don't kiss you.
- Why not?

289
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,960
The people that do the kissing over here
are the one that float around like that.

290
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:28,775
Ah, they...
- Yes, they'll wait for them to kiss.

291
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:35,344
In my country, they take them and they take
them to jail and finish them.

292
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,367
Take around and hang them?
That's what we're trying to get done here.

293
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:44,727
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
give a worm american welcome

294
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:48,272
to a gentleman who has come all the
way from Kazakstan

295
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,234
and we are honored to have singing our
national anthem

296
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,674
Borat Sagdiyev.

297
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:10,792
My name Borat. I come from Kazakstan.
Can I say first

298
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:14,337
we support your war of terror.

299
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,156
May we show our support to our
boys in Irak.

300
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:29,246
May US and A kill every
single terrorist.

301
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:40,610
May George Bush drink the blood of every
single man, woman and child of Irak.

302
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:47,804
May you destroy that country so that for
the next thousand years

303
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:51,766
not even a single lizard will survive
in their desert.

304
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:57,500
To show our friendship,
I now will sing

305
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:02,088
our kazak national anthem to the tune
of your national anthem.

306
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:03,860
Listen.

307
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:12,722
Kazakstan is the greatest
country in the world,

308
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:19,291
All other countries are run
by little girls,

309
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:26,276
Kazakstan is number one
exporter of potasium,

310
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:32,845
Other central asian countries
have in theory our potasium

311
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:39,204
Kazakstan is the greatest country
in the world,

312
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:44,730
All other countries is the home
of the gays.

313
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:06,312
I was sad. The rodeo peoples
did not like me.

314
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:09,023
What if Pamela did not like me too?

315
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,463
We needed something to change
our fortunes.

316
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,889
Do not fear me, gipsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

317
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:26,017
Let's give them to me or
I would take them.

318
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:31,647
I'm not a gipsy. I'm midwestern
farmer's daughter, americana.

319
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:34,358
You have many treasures.
Who did your rob for this?

320
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:37,173
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

321
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,154
I will look in your treasures, gipsy.

322
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:44,888
Is this understood?
I will look on them. - Please, do.

323
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:54,167
Who is this lady you shrunk? Was she the owner
of this house that you came in front of?

324
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,461
There's couple more child's doll.

325
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,006
Do not try and shrink me, gipsy.
I, serious.

326
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:01,778
These are your spells?

327
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:20,286
I need a direction to California, please.
- You're far away from home.

328
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:27,584
I travel with my friend Azamat Bagatov,
we travel across the country

329
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:34,987
You look like Michael Jackson,
Beat It.

330
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:44,266
I like you, peoples. Can you teach me how
to dress? How can I be like you?

331
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,351
First is to loosen up your belt

332
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,209
Don't pull down like you try to go...

333
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,047
Like this?
- But don't show your Huggies down there.

334
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,867
What kind of music do you listen to?

335
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,307
I like very much...
Do you know...?

336
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:14,501
You gotta lick it,
before you kick it.

337
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,463
Can you teach me speak like you?
- What you're trying to say?

338
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,112
How do you say How do you do?
- What's up with it.

339
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,168
What's up with it, vanilla face?

340
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,026
Me and my homie Azamat just

341
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:46,509
We're looking for somewhere to post up
are black asses for the night.

342
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,324
So, bang-bang, skid, skid,
nigger.

343
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:51,930
We're just a couple of people

344
00:37:54,537 --> 00:37:57,456
Leave now or we'll call the cops
and have you taken out.

345
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:14,451
You have a room for tonight?
- Yes, definitely.

346
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,559
So, come on in. Your friend also.

347
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:26,649
Beautiful house. This..
- All the paintings in the house I did.

348
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,279
What is this man?
- This is a yemenite jew, and he's working

349
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:38,743
on a piece of jewellry. The yemenites were
also jewellers.

350
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:44,686
Why do you have a picture of a jew?
- Because I'm jewish, so.

351
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,050
This is the room, and...

352
00:38:57,823 --> 00:39:00,950
do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

353
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,557
Great. Thank you.
Lovely place.

354
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:27,745
Wait, wait.

355
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:34,314
Hello.
- How are you? - Great.

356
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:41,195
This is a special sandwich for you.
- I not so hungry.

357
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,635
He can eat this.
Here, fat.

358
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,014
Take a half.

359
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,166
Not so hungry.
- Eat a little bit.

360
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,194
Go ahead, eat something, because you're
hungry and you're a guest.

361
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,871
I don't want to see you go hungry.

362
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,999
What is this picture over here?

363
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:31,865
It is three in the morning, I am in
the nest with jews.

364
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,680
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

365
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:39,268
One of them has taken the form of a
little old woman.

366
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,187
You can barely see her haunts.

367
00:40:43,646 --> 00:40:45,836
She have try to poison me already.

368
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:48,651
This rats are very clever.

369
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:47,766
What is the best gun to defend
from a jew?

370
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,856
I would recommend either a 9 mm
or a 45.

371
00:41:57,462 --> 00:41:58,818
Very nice!

372
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:05,073
I, movie star, Dirty Harold.

373
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,201
Come on and make my name, jew.

374
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,310
But he would not sell me guns,
since I'm not american.

375
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:16,334
So I look for other protection.

376
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:23,110
What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

377
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:26,447
Is this a cat in a hat?

378
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:28,740
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

379
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:35,100
I need the animal for protection.
What you have for me?

380
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:45,059
Happy times. We were safe and well
on our way to Pamela.

381
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,978

00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:01,898
to people right in your vicinity.

390
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:04,192

00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,403

00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:33,960

00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:39,798
Should I pay compliments to the peoples?
- Yes.

408
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:44,281
But only if you truly agree with
that compliment.

You have a very gentle face,

410
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,163
and a very erotic physique.

411
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,271

For this two,
not so much...

415
00:47:14,308 --> 00:47:17,853
What should I say if I need to
go to the shit-hole?

416
00:47:19,521 --> 00:47:20,355
You mean to the restroom?

417
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,379
To the place to make the shit.
- Bathroom?

418
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:28,592
Not the bath to make dirty hands...
The brown... - The toilet.

419
00:47:29,635 --> 00:47:34,326
Where you make, you understand...
bad, bad thing from.

421
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:41,103
You say, excuse me, I need to go to the

00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:46,108
Excuse me, is it possible to go and do...

423
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,799

424
00:47:51,946 --> 00:47:53,093
Excuse me a moment.

425
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:05,604
I think that the cultural differences
are... vast. - Exactly.

426
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:09,253
And I think he is a delightful man...
and it wouldn't take

427
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:14,362
a very large time for him to really
become americanized.

428
00:48:14,988 --> 00:48:18,428
Thank you very much, I feel much better.
Cindy, where should I put this?

429
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,399
Excuse me for just a moment.

430
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:40,218
Like this. And you wipe your bottom.
And you put the paper.

431
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:45,119
I? - You. No, I wouldn't.
This is a very private thing.

432
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:48,246
The host cleans the anus of the other?
- No, no, no.

433
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,687
Nobody touches you except you.

434
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,711
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

435
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:59,298
If you have been invited to a home
or to a party... - Yes.

436
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:05,032
it is acceptable to bring a guest if
you ask your host in advance.

437
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:13,477
Hi, I'm looking for Borat.
- Yes, is me.

438
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:21,297
This my friend, Luennel.

439
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:33,391
I don't know exactly what all that we're
doing. It is getting very, very late.

440
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,268
You have to excuse me.
I have to go home.

441
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:39,855
It's getting very very late and it's time...

442
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,755
that we are ending our dinner party
and everything.

443
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:47,779
But can she come for desserts?

444
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,594
Absolutly not and neither can you!

445
00:49:50,698 --> 00:49:54,139
The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

446
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,309
Why you call police?
Has the retard escaped?

447
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:05,712
I want say I'm very sorry way treat
you in this house. - Thank you.

448
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,091
I was thinking maybe I just take the night
off and...

449
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:13,844
Why don't we just go out and have some
fun. What do you think about that?

450
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,383
Hi, my name Borat. This my
friend, Luenell.

451
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:36,260
She is a prostitute.

452
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:58,571
You were funny on this wolf.
Everybody almost see your underpants.

453
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:01,595
I never rode a bull before.

454
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:08,163
You wanna come in for a little while?

455
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:13,272
I would like very much...

456
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:15,879
but I in love with a woman in Malibu.

457
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:18,694
It would be nice to her for me to...

458
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,385
If you ever in town again,
look me up.

459
00:51:24,845 --> 00:51:26,200
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

460
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:29,120
I would very much like to
pay you for sex.

461
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:36,001
Good night, Luenells.
- Good night, Borat.

462
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:46,531
You say my name right.

463
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:09,572

464
00:52:14,785 --> 00:52:16,975
...I very spontaneous...

465
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,477
I'm very spontaneous too.

466
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:45,229
I needed a gift to give to Pamela so that
she would grant me entry into her vagin.

467
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:51,589
Therefore, I convince Azamat to let me
film a report in a american store.

468
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:02,119
This your shops?
- Right, this is my antique shop.

469
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:07,541
Why do you have so many things with a flag?
- We're honouring our heritage.

470
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,607
And in here.
What is this?

471
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:14,839
These are a number of collectibles,
I mean, this is...

472
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,635
A lamp. You know, to use in your home.
This is a chinese closet...

473
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,369
And this is just a little decorative
derrick.

474
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,914
And... do you think..
you know... when they...

475
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,738
You need help?
- No, it's ok.

476
00:53:45,596 --> 00:53:47,160
I sorry.

477
00:53:54,354 --> 00:53:57,377
Don't worry, my friend...
he can make glue...

478
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:01,130
I don't think you gonna be able to glue
that stuff back, I think you gonna have

479
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,173
to pay for it.

480
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:04,988
Ok, I have digital watch from the future.

481
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:07,282
I will give you this.
We are small than all of this.

482
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:11,139
You broke 425 $ worth of stuff.

483
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:17,291
...180.
- That's not enough.

484
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,836
Do you want a hair?
- No, I don't want any damn hair.

485
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:24,380
This is the best hair in Kazakstan. Feel the
quality. - I don't want your damn hair.

486
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:28,238
This hair from pubis. I can get you
2000 bags by next friday.

487
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:30,323
We don't use that stuff in this country.

488
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,579
Just gimme another 20, that's good
enough.

489
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,815
Would you have believe this
if I have told you?

490
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:46,275
All right, go, go!

491
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:32,310
So.. bad news.

492
00:58:33,562 --> 00:58:36,377
Azamat leaves.

493
00:58:37,315 --> 00:58:39,192
I wake-up and he's desapeared

494
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:46,907
He takes...Osana...

495
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:52,537
And he also decide to take all money
and also my passport.

496
00:58:56,812 --> 00:59:02,963
And, he leave me all this bag.

497
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:06,508
It's a hen.

498
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:16,621
And ticket to Kazakstan,
but no passport.

499
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,042
But at least he's...

500
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:25,900
man enough to leave me...

501
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:33,824
my beautiful.

502
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:40,601
Which I have cleaned since last night.

503
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:50,297
And I've decide to continue
making documentary.

504
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:55,301
Making without Azamat I think it will
be better.

505
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:59,785
And I will have most success without.

506
01:00:35,546 --> 01:00:38,361
I only want 17 cents, please.

507
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:07,241
I have no car, no money and
no Azamat.

508
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:13,079
The only thing keep me going was my dream
of one day holding Pamela in my arms

509
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:17,250
and then making romance explosion
on her stomach.

510
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:32,263
Aventually, I managed to hike a hichings with group
of young scholars also travelling across country.

You fuck the shit out of me.
And then you never call them again.

518
01:02:16,678 --> 01:02:19,597
Why you don't call them, because they
do not have a telephone, yes?

519
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:25,748
They do not have my respect.
- So what do you do here in America?

520
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,715
They film me travel across US and A.
- I don't know what you're saying, man.

521
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:36,904

522
01:03:02,135 --> 01:03:04,429

Our country, the minorites actually
have more power.

532
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:57,497
Anyone that is minority has the uppper hand.
We have the jews, anybody that's against mainstream.

01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:45,561
That's her, Borat.

544
01:04:45,978 --> 01:04:48,480

Let it go.

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,655
Come here. You're my man.
You're my man.

You in America now.
You'll make it. You keep going.

550
01:05:11,939 --> 01:05:15,692
You're bigger than a woman.
You're better than a woman.

551
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,924
We'll always be behind you.

552
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:25,075

Go! Go!
I leave you alive.

557
01:07:40,509 --> 01:07:41,656
It is good to be here.

558
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:46,556
This is my tenth penticostal camp
meeting, a decade.

559
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:52,707
The bottom line is we're a
christian nation now,

560
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:56,982
we were a christian nation in the beginning,
and we gonna always be a christian nation

561
01:07:57,399 --> 01:07:59,693
until good Lord returns. Amin.

562
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,550
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

563
01:08:04,385 --> 01:08:07,617
I didn't use to be a...,
I is what I is.

564
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,824

or what he's trying to do,

565
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:32,326

let's have a little old time church right now.

01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:44,420

01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,842
I want you to help to save me, please.

01:08:50,676 --> 01:08:55,055

628
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:39,846
Pamela, I am not attracted to you

629
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,703
NOT!

630
01:16:51,418 --> 01:16:53,087
I was humiliated.

631
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:55,693
It was time for me to return
to New York,

632
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:59,238
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

633
01:17:00,697 --> 01:17:04,972
While I sat on the bus, I thought of my
journey over the past three weeks.

634
01:17:06,432 --> 01:17:07,579
The great times.

635
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:09,768
The good times.

636
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:11,853
And the shit times.

637
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:15,190
Mainly there were shit times.

638
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:19,360
I have come to America to learn
lessons for Kazakstan.

639
01:17:20,611 --> 01:17:22,175
But what had I learn?

640
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:26,971
Suddenly, I realized.

641
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:33,122
I have learned that if you chase a dream,

642
01:17:34,165 --> 01:17:36,354
especially one with plastic chests,

643
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:40,942
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.

644
01:17:55,434 --> 01:17:57,415
Welcome back in my town of Kusek.

645
01:17:58,353 --> 01:18:01,481
Since I return, there has been
much improvements.

646
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:06,068
We no longer here running of the jew,
it's cruel.

647
01:18:07,007 --> 01:18:07,841
We christians now.

648
01:18:13,158 --> 01:18:17,120
Toktan improve too.
Hey, Toktan. Hi 5!

649

652
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:35,887

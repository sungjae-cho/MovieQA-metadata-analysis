I love you very much.

47
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:36,768
- Pete, are you...
- I just need a minute.

48
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:39,682
Okay.

49
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,513
Please don't go.

50
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:02,557
Why don't you just put on some clothes,
and we can sit down and discuss this.

51
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:03,905
No. I can't do anything right now.

52
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:06,515
I'm so sorry, Pete.

53
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,776
I'm in love with you.

54
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:09,516
Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

55
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,429
I'm not going to go put clothes on.

56
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,083
I know what that means,
if I put clothes on, it's over. Okay?

57
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,693
Excuse me.

58
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,609
Let's talk. Let's talk about him.

59
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:33,045
I feel...

60
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,916
I've been feeling

61
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:41,091
for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

62
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,526
We're leading different lives.

63
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,267
Who's the dude?

64
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,875
- Who's the dude?
- What?

65
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:54,268
No, that's not what this is about.
There's no one else.

66
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,572
I know what's happening here. I really do.

67
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,095
You've been working so much lately, that we
haven't got to spend much time together,

68
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,444
and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

69
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,748
But maybe, if we just held each other
or something,

70
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,445
you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

71
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:08,011
- No.
- Just hold me.

72
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,405
Please. Here we go.

73
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:24,364
There's someone else.

74
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,103
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:48,978
We don't hang out in places like this,
Liz and I.

76
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:52,979
Why did you take me here?
This place smells like stripper's perfume.

77
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting on this couch.

78
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,459
- Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,243
Yeah. You don't have to keep asking me.
I'm good.

80
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:04,851
<i>- You're out!
- Thank you so much for this opportunity.</i>

81
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,114
- Auf Wiedersehen!
- Auf Wiedersehen!

82
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:10,288
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

83
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,333
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

84
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,377
I feel really good. I feel happy.

85
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:18,334
<i>Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical.</i>

86
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:21,770
Look, you've been working on it for a while.
It'll help your mind. Be creative.

87
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,727
- Think about you.
- I think I need to fuck somebody.

88
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:24,987
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

89
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:28,206
You're not my stepbrother any more.
You're a step-stranger.

90
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:29,771
- Why you talking like that?
- Brian!

91
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:31,859
You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

92
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,469
No, I don't.
I need to B my L on somebody's T's.

93
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,079
That's disgusting.
You don't need to be doing that.

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,775
And if anything,
you should leave your P in the V

95
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:45,428
and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

96
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,776
and be a normal person.

97
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:48,777
I'm leaving, man. I'm out of here.

98
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:52,734
She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri? It's all I can think about,

99
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,083
is that she's out there,

100
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:56,909
and until I do the same thing,
I'm gonna feel like I wanna die.

101
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,084
So just talk to girls with me tonight,
all right?

102
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:05,913
All right. All right, I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.

103
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:08,478
So, Peter, what do you do?

104
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,043
Musician.

105
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:14,698
<i>He's being modest.
He works on a show called Crime Scene.</i>

106
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,828
Oh, my God!

107
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,742
- It is what it is, you know?
- No, I love that show.

108
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,961
<i>Wait, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?</i>

109
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:27,701
<i>- Scene of the Crime.
- Oh, my God! I love that show.</i>

110
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,876
I find you both very sexually attractive.

111
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:35,354
Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

112
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,746
I think that having sex with either of you

113
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:40,573
would be a great treat for me.

114
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:43,271
You are so funny.

115
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,401
I just got out of
a five-and-a-half-year relationship,

116
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,664
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

117
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:54,142
- Just sexual activity.
- Let's wrap it up, buddy.

118
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,927
You wanna come home?

119
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,405
I'm sorry, you're cracking me up.

120
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,058
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

121
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,667
Do you wanna come home?

122
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:07,321
Stop it, seriously.

123
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:16,366
- That was fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

124
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:20,151
Overall, I think that
went really well. Yeah.

125
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,632
I want to have sex with you!

126
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:43,200
- Are you crying?
- What? No.

127
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:47,114
I'm sorry that I'm being so weird now.

128
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,506
No, that's okay.

129
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,115
You've been weird

130
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:57,856
pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

131
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:03,380
Last night, like some sort of idiot, I had
sex with this woman who I barely even know.

132
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,685
I used a condom, but

133
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:10,034
I'm really scared that I have an STD, Doc.

134
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:13,339
Peter, I'm a paediatrician. Have you noticed
you're sitting on a fire truck?

135
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,078
- Right.
- Little kids running?

136
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,862
- Yeah, this is new. I like it.
- I'm kind of backed up...

137
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:23,255
Could you take a look at my penis?

138
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,299
Go ahead. Let me see it.

139
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,822
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Take it out.

140
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:32,170
Good.

141
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:34,431
- You barely looked at it.
- It's a good-looking dick, Peter.

142
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,214
- Beautiful dick.
- Do you think maybe while I'm here,

143
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,606
- I could get some blood work?
- Peter!

144
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:41,086
Your girlfriend dumped you, right?
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

145
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,870
Stop it. Stop crying. Use your dick.
Keep fucking. Fuck everything that moves.

146
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,000
Just wear a condom.

147
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:51,654
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids. I gotta go, okay?

148
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:56,221
You want something?
You want a balloon? You want a lolly?

149
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,571
I just came!

150
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,968
Hi.

151
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:28,272
Hi.

152
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,751
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:32,883
Hi.

154
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,057
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:44,799
Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

156
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:47,278
You can gag me.

157
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,975
- You brought a gag?
- And handcuffs.

158
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,149
Do you wanna gag me?

159
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,586
Kind of, now.

160
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,631
What've we got today?

161
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,589
Just a walk and talk at the lab.

162
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:14,720
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you.</i>

163
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,546
<i>What've we got here?</i>

164
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,069
<i>The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit.</i>

165
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,852
<i>Ouch!</i>

166
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:25,027
<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

167
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,116
<i>Let's do this.</i>

168
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:32,594
Okay, I'm ready.

169
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:36,727
<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit.</i>

170
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,510
Just go with the usual stuff, maybe.
Something dark and ominous.

171
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,121
Like losing your penis is a bad thing.

172
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,729
Oh, you want dark and ominous.

173
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,427
Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

174
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:59,341
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you.</i>

175
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,689
<i>What've we got here?</i>

176
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,994
Peter! Peter, Jesus Christ!

177
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:07,299
You're fucking Billy Baldwin, aren't you?

178
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,517
- Aren't you?
- Pete, Pete, Pete.

179
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:12,475
- Stop staring at me.
- Pete!

180
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:16,780
You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

181
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:20,086
- I'm aware of that.
- Fucking asshole.

182
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:23,434
Peter, it's Brian.

183
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,783
Go away.

184
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:28,261
Listen, your landlord called me.

185
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,044
Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

186
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:33,568
Who, Mr Lopez? 'Cause he's a liar!

187
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:34,828
He doesn't...

188
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,829
We worry about you, Petey.

189
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,308
Yeah, come on, Peter. Open up the door.

190
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:43,570
The fire marshal's gonna come in
and bust it down.

191
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,703
You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

192
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,833
Why are you so damn strong?

193
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,878
I feel so strong!

194
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,184
Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

195
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,836
Your place is disgusting, Peter.

196
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:02,880
Hey, don't walk away from me.

197
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,924
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

198
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,794
What are you burning, man? Come on.

199
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:08,925
It's everything.

200
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,752
It's everything that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

201
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:16,144
Okay, I thought I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not. I'm not fine at all.

202
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:19,058
Okay, let's just put the picture down.

203
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,059
Put that down. Let's discuss this.

204
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,364
- I love her, man.
- I know.

205
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:30,322
Look, Liz and I,
we think the world of Sarah.

206
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,627
We think she's great.

207
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:35,106
Okay, but everything...

208
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,889
I'm just being honest here.

209
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,109
Every time she would come over
to our house,

210
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:44,022
she always acted,

211
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:48,502
you know, like a little bitch!

212
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:50,632
Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

213
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:54,068
Dating Sarah is not like dating Liz. Okay?

214
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,069
Sarah is better than Liz.

215
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,721
You really wanna have this conversation?

216
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:03,419
Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

217
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:04,940
Yes.

218
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,897
- She is the mother of my unborn child.
- Sorry.

219
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:09,290
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

220
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,551
I have no qualms with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

221
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,508
- Sorry.
- You dick!

222
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:16,813
I'm just worked up.

223
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,727
You gotta get your shit together, man.

224
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:22,598
I'm trying to. It's so hard here.

225
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,163
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

226
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:28,599
Like, she got me this,

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,817
okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

228
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:33,296
and the cereal would get stale,

229
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,123
and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

230
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:41,299
because it keeps my cereal fresh.
And now I have the freshest cereal.

231
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,473
Why don't you,
you know what, go on a vacation?

232
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:47,256
Go to the Alps.

233
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:50,301
- Alps?
- Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

234
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:51,649
I could go to Hawaii.

235
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,562
Sarah was always talking about this place
in Hawaii that was supposed to be nice.

236
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:56,345
No, don't. I wouldn't go there.

237
00:15:56,346 --> 00:16:00,086
What, I can't go to Hawaii now, because
Sarah Marshall has heard of Hawaii?

238
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,000
Then go to Hawaii. Go to Hawaii.

239
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,045
Do it.

240
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,959
No, no, no, don't destroy the computer.

241
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,350
I'm just deleting these pictures.

242
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:16,831
Okay, I need them off my computer.

243
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,744
You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

244
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,092
Well...

245
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:25,006
If we end up getting back together,
I wanna have a few of them left.

246
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,050
You're crazy.

247
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,182
- No, no, please don't delete them.
- They have to go. Done, done.

248
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:46,273
<i>That was hilarious. Aloha!</i>

249
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:49,404
<i>I'm Sarah Marshall from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime.</i>

250
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:52,231
<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines...</i>

251
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,275
Excuse me! Hi.

252
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,710
<i>...to my favourite destinations. Mahalo.</i>

253
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,407
Hi, can I have another bloody mary, please?

254
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:00,146
You're still working on that one.

255
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:02,755
It's just an anticipatory order.

256
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,757
Okay, I'll be right back!

257
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,934
<i>What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?</i>

258
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:23,979
<i>He was either stabbed in the aorta
or it was his time of the month.</i>

259
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,940
<i>Aloha!</i>

260
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,940
Check in this way.

261
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,595
- Just married?
- Yes, how did you guess?

262
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:57,205
Oh, you've got that magic newlywed dust
all over you.

263
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,988
- Oh, my wife.
- Oh, my husband.

264
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,771
- Oh, my wife.
- My husband.

265
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,773
My old ball and chain.

266
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:11,253
You quit squirming and come here.

267
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:14,079
What is into you?

268
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,732
Not me, yet.

269
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:19,907
Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

270
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,212
Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

271
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,343
<i>Mahalo.</i>

272
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,909
Congratulations.

273
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,736
Here you go, sir. Have some POG juice.

274
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:31,823
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

275
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,085
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter, Peter Bretter,

276
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,830
but actually, I don't have a reservation.

277
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:40,435
I just thought I'd take my chances.

278
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,652
Bold!

279
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:46,827
We are all booked up,
but we do have the Kapua suite available.

280
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:50,481
- Okay. How much is that?
- $6,000 a night.

281
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:52,785
- Wow.
- Beautiful views.

282
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,830
I can imagine.
That's a little bit out of my price range.

283
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:56,743
Sorry.

284
00:18:56,744 --> 00:19:00,136
That's a shame. This is a beautiful

285
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,093
hotel.

286
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:06,616
<i>Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene.</i>

287
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,400
People are excited that she's here.

288
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:13,400
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

289
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,705
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right. This is fine, right?

290
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:19,620
- Sir?
- It's totally fine. Okay, there she is.

291
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:24,055
- Did she see me? Is she coming over here?
- Uh-huh. Yup.

292
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,838
I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt.

293
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,840
Fair enough.
Why don't you try to unbutton it?

294
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:33,058
Button it back up.

295
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,710
- Peter!
- Hey.

296
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:38,320
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

297
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,929
Came here to murder you.

298
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,060
Really, what are you doing here?

299
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:47,800
I have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

300
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,932
But then I came here, and here you are.

301
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,367
I just think that's too crazy to be...

302
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,934
Hello there, you little sex object.

303
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,760
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

304
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:03,849
It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

305
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:09,633
Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe.
Like this one. It's like this one's fellow.

306
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:12,851
- Sort of the exact opposite, in fact, of that.
- Uh-huh.

307
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,330
Not an evil version, but just, you know,

308
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:19,636
a shoe like this, but for the other foot.
Otherwise, I'd have two right...

309
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:21,201
Aldous, this is Peter.

310
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:26,030
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you, mate. Aldous.

311
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,595
- Good to meet you, man.
- My ex-boyfriend.

312
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,899
Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

313
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,379
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

314
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,466
Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

315
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,989
So are you staying here, as well?

316
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,423
- I'm not, as a matter of fact...
- I'm sorry.

317
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:42,033
Excuse me, Mr Bretter, Ms Marshall,

318
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:47,209
but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

319
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,689
- You were?
- Yes, sir.

320
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,080
- Marvellous.
- Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

321
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,690
Listen, if you wanna have dinner with us
one of those nights...

322
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,125
- Aldous.
- ... feel very...

323
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:00,299
No.

324
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,691
That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

325
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,866
I'll be just fine on my own.

326
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,779
- All right, Peter.
- The Kapua suite...

327
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,345
- Have a good trip, Pete.
- I like your shirt. It's colourful.

328
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:13,216
- Bye.
- Bye now.

329
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:16,609
Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

330
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:24,523
Thank you. Thank you for bailing me out.
I still can't afford that room.

331
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:28,045
Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or, like, Céline Dion.

332
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,394
Really, it's not a big deal.

333
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:32,090
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

334
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,396
you have to clean up after yourself.

335
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,875
Otherwise, here is your room key

336
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,702
and enjoy your stay.

337
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,051
Why are you doing this for me?

338
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:48,573
She's here with some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

339
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,922
- Right?
- Yeah.

340
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,270
- Thank you.
- Really, it's not a big deal.

341
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,705
Go enjoy yourself.

342
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:57,749
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

343
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,141
- you know what I mean...
- Go enjoy yourself.

344
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:03,359
<i>- This is a disaster!
- Calm down, man.</i>

345
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,751
<i>Are there other hotels on the island?</i>

346
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,186
Of course there are other hotels,

347
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:08,274
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like I'm running away.

348
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:11,709
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

349
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,971
I had a girlfriend, right?

350
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:17,146
And Liam and Noel Gallagher both
had it off with her right in front of me,

351
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:18,581
so that's similar.

352
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,277
And that was a bit awkward, actually.

353
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:23,278
So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

354
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,887
No, no, I'm not changing hotels.

355
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,193
Stop following
and just go back to your room, Peter.

356
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:30,367
<i>- They're gone!
- Why are you looking for them?</i>

357
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:32,368
<i>- I don't know.
- You're acting like an idiot.</i>

358
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,455
<i>Run! Get out of there! Go to your room!</i>

359
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:36,543
<i>- What do you think they're doing?
- Peter, go.</i>

360
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,630
Oh, God! Okay, there they are.

361
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:40,370
<i>- There they are, I see them.
- Go back to your room, Peter.</i>

362
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:42,066
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

363
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,196
I'm going in.

364
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,067
<i>Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?</i>

365
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,502
<i>Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter...</i>

366
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,547
<i>Hey!</i>

367
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,981
Hey, nice room.

368
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,069
<i>Go!</i>

369
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,156
I am in the Kapua suite.

370
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,157
<i>What are you doing? Sucker!</i>

371
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,290
Have fun.

372
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,464
<i>Listen, you piece of shit!</i>

373
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:09,640
<i>You're an idiot. Back to your room, Peter.
Peter, back to your room.</i>

374
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:12,205
Did you enjoy that?

375
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,814
<i>- Did you like what you saw?
- That hurt a lot.</i>

376
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,816
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure I just ruined her day.

377
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,559
<i>You know
how we thought the killer masturbated</i>

378
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,864
<i>before he committed each homicide?</i>

379
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:39,734
<i>That's the theory.</i>

380
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,822
<i>Take a look at the microscope.</i>

381
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,041
<i>Oh, yeah, looks like where he's going,</i>

382
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,868
<i>he'll need to know how to masturbate.</i>

383
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,220
Oh, God!

384
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,787
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Peter?</i>

385
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:14,222
<i>- Sarah?
- No.</i>

386
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:18,484
It's Rachel Jansen, from the front desk.

387
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,572
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on up there?</i>

388
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:25,920
I'm getting complaints
about a woman crying hysterically.

389
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,921
Yeah, you know what, I hear her, too,

390
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:32,270
and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

391
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,184
I think it's coming from the floor above me.

392
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:38,055
You're on the top floor.

393
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:41,664
I'll try to keep it down.

394
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:44,143
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you have a nice night.</i>

395
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:46,318
<i>Okay.</i>

396
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:04,409
I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my fucking job right now.

397
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,672
Obviously, because you called me at work,
you know that I'm at my place of work.

398
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,759
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

399
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,151
I can sell you some weed when I'm done.

400
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:16,891
<i>Hold on, I gotta call you back.
Mahalo, all right.</i>

401
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,196
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

402
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:21,067
I'd just like to grab some dinner, please.

403
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:24,937
- Okay, great. Is your wife gonna meet you?
- No.

404
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:27,503
Your girlfriend?

405
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:31,027
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

406
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,157
- You're just by yourself?
- Yeah.

407
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,505
Sucks.

408
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:40,071
Okay, so just one. Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

409
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,637
Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

410
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:43,899
It's gonna be boring
if you're just sitting by yourself.

411
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,160
I'll be all right. Thank you.

412
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,552
I just would be so depressed.

413
00:25:47,553 --> 00:25:49,030
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

414
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,987
Thank you.

415
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:54,641
The best thing is,
you have the greatest table in the house.

416
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:56,946
- Oh, yeah?
- That's Aldous Snow right there.

417
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:59,338
I know. I know, dude. I know.

418
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,340
- I'm gonna ask him. I'll ask him politely.
- No, please don't, please.

419
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:04,600
Mate!

420
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,253
Why don't you come over and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

421
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:11,515
No, thank you. I need a drink.

422
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,950
Would you guys like a drink?

423
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:16,560
Well, no, actually, because...

424
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:20,213
Seven years clean.
That's what this tattoo denotes.

425
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,691
Seven years free from drugs and alcohol.

426
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,997
If I have just one sip of wine,

427
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:29,042
by the end of the evening, I'll be,
like, rimming waiters for their tips

428
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,302
just to get me hands on a rock.

429
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:33,391
You know what I mean? Nasty.

430
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:36,652
- I heard that.
- Hey, what's up, man?

431
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,566
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

432
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,653
It's mundane.

433
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:43,262
It is mundane. It's great, I know.

434
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:45,219
Will you marry me?

435
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,307
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes!

436
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,699
- She said yes!
- Beautiful.

437
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,048
Congratulations!

438
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,137
I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

439
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,312
Peter!

440
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:04,007
What's up?

441
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:06,182
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

442
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:08,748
Yeah, I'm good.

443
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,836
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant tell you I was coming?

444
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:14,314
- No.
- Did you talk to her?

445
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:18,707
No, I didn't talk to your assistant.
It's not all about you, you know.

446
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:23,708
Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here, usually not to follow you.

447
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,535
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

448
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:30,580
Yeah, I think so. I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

449
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:33,059
I just love it.

450
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,973
Yeah, you should stay.

451
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:37,582
I appreciate your consideration.

452
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,278
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

453
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,888
so thank you for dating him after me.

454
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,454
- I appreciate that.
- Hmm.

455
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:49,890
- Hope you have a really good time here.
- Have a great dinner.

456
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,109
Thank you.

457
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,370
Groupie whore.

458
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,457
Psycho stalker.

459
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:02,024
You know what? It's vacation. I think
I'll just take a piña colada, please.

460
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,739
Look at this guy.

461
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,349
Look at this guy.

462
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,550
Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

463
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:23,290
<i>I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?</i>

464
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,508
I'm Samantha. I have sex with everyone.

465
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,596
Maybe it's a good thing that they're here.

466
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:32,641
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

467
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,815
for me to forget her. You know?

468
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:39,903
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

469
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:42,121
I love her show.

470
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:45,557
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

471
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,949
What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

472
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,254
I hear you say that, but it's not that easy.

473
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:52,559
It's that easy. Promise you it is.

474
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,429
I lived in South Central.

475
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,212
South Central. And I hated it.

476
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,604
That's why I moved to Oahu.

477
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,996
Now I can name you
over 200 different kinds of fish.

478
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:02,736
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

479
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,214
- Do it.
- Yeah, you cannot.

480
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:09,433
G. Ghost pipefish, grill fish, goaler fish
grouper fish, greenback...

481
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:11,216
What's the state fish of Hawaii?

482
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,956
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

483
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:15,391
- Yeah, bitch.
- Hey.

484
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,002
- You ready?
- Yeah, just gonna close up.

485
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:25,264
Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

486
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,699
She is in bed.

487
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,743
How are things going with the lady?

488
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:34,788
<i>Not awesome.
She's complicated, like The Da Vinci Code,</i>

489
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,573
you know, but harder to crack.

490
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:43,792
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something new every day.

491
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:48,184
Wonder what I'm going to learn tomorrow.

492
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,401
Well.

493
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:51,967
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

494
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,141
Good night, sir.

495
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:56,838
Off to find the mythical clitoris.

496
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,405
So, Peter, were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

497
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,231
'Cause I could send someone up,
if you want.

498
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:07,841
- Oh, you could?
- Yeah.

499
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:11,538
That's very funny. It is.

500
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,973
Well, listen, Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

501
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:19,584
I do the music for that programme.

502
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:23,324
Did I mention that the music rocks?

503
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,629
That's very sweet of you.
That's very sweet of you to say.

504
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,803
You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

505
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:32,543
There's no melody, it's just tones.

506
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,632
Just dark, ominous tones.

507
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:39,631
"The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

508
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:43,329
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least the dogs are happy. "

509
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,941
I'm no Aldous Snow, I guess, you know.

510
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,942
<i>Time to start the music</i>

511
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,464
<i>All gonna light the light</i>

512
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:07,423
<i>Yeah, yeah, gonna get things started
on The Muppet Show tonight</i>

513
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,730
- Whipped cream or berry?
- Whipped cream.

514
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:22,165
Here we are, sir.
Have a wonderful breakfast.

515
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,687
What a lovely table, so close to the buffet.

516
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:28,080
<i>I'm glad you like it. Mahalo.</i>

517
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,907
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

518
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:34,255
Orange juice, coffee?

519
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:37,822
What about, like, some pineapple juice
with a little bit of rum on the side.

520
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:41,866
Of course. I like your style. Cocktail guy.

521
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,954
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

522
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:45,955
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

523
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:48,956
Honey, I know that,
but you know that I wanted to see...

524
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:52,608
- Hey. Hello there, friend.
- Hey.

525
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,131
How are you guys? How was your evening?

526
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:56,783
- Great.
- Awesome.

527
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:59,828
- I can't feel anything.
- All right.

528
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:02,307
- Does that feel good?
- I still can't feel anything.

529
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:04,612
Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

530
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:08,352
- Would you do that for me?
- Yeah.

531
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:12,658
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. No.

532
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,572
God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No!

533
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:21,443
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

534
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:27,402
- Is everything okay with...
- Waffles.

535
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:33,403
- Here you go, sir. Breakfast of champions.
- Oh, thank you.

536
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:38,970
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

537
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:41,014
Thank you.

538
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:44,407
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

539
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,975
- Hi.
- Hi.

540
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,453
This is the yoga place, yeah?

541
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:03,541
Yes. But there's no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

542
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:08,674
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

543
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:13,327
Well, there's no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

544
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:14,892
- Can I set it down?
- Sure.

545
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,197
- Cool, thank you.
- I like your hat.

546
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:21,329
- Thank you.
- Please remove it before class.

547
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:27,157
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all grab your mats?

548
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:32,593
<i>Sorry, I recognise you from the cover
of Namaste Magazine. I'm a huge fan.</i>

549
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,028
Thank you. That's so sweet of you to say.

550
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,855
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do yoga for recognition.

551
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:43,727
Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

552
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:48,119
That's very flexible. That's nice.

553
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:52,641
- And, you, I recognise you from your show.
- Thank you.

554
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:55,991
You seem much taller on your show.

555
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,166
- I'm not.
- No, I know.

556
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:03,906
Okay, if you just wanna start
by bringing your palms into your chest.

557
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:07,733
Today we're gonna start with
the Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutation.

558
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:10,473
Let's take a deep inale in.

559
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:12,647
Exhale and release the hands.

560
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:16,475
Inale, arms up to the sky. Continue.

561
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:20,171
Good, exhale and folding forward.

562
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:24,433
Strong, strong backs. Good, excellent.

563
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,434
Remember this is not a competition,

564
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,912
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

565
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:31,435
Excellent. Perfect form, you two, perfect.

566
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,740
Coming up into downward-facing dog.

567
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,176
Good. It's really important in this pose,

568
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:40,480
that you arch your back
and keep it flat at the same time.

569
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:43,221
I feel like those are opposing ideas.

570
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:47,483
No, they're not, 'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

571
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:49,615
Okay.

572
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:55,615
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins from this morning.

573
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,921
- Come on, lady.
- My name is Prana,

574
00:34:57,922 --> 00:35:00,399
and I know that wasn't just juice.

575
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,531
You don't really need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna do this for myself.

576
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,923
Just to learn from your body,

577
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:10,402
memorize your body.

578
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:13,968
- Good. Strong legs.
- Come on.

579
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:16,882
Perfect skin and form.

580
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:20,101
Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

581
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,014
This is more of an advanced pose,

582
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:24,797
so if you don't feel comfortable
or strong enough,

583
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:28,668
please feel free to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

584
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,146
I got it.

585
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:33,365
All right, so let's all
come down to our mats.

586
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:36,583
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

587
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,845
If you don't feel comfortable,

588
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:41,062
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat in child's pose.

589
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,629
Lady, I got it.

590
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,543
Good, so let's prep to come up. Good.

591
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:50,152
Sir, if you just want to lay down
in child's pose.

592
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:51,283
Now, you all heard me say,

593
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:54,414
"If you want to be in child's pose,
that's okay. "

594
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:56,632
- Just in case he gets hurt.
- Bring it, bring it.

595
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,024
I don't want you to break your neck.

596
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:00,677
- What's up?
- Just relax.

597
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:02,677
My legs, that's what.

598
00:36:02,678 --> 00:36:04,939
We're doing quiet headstands today.

599
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,983
I'm doing a handstand, motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

600
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,766
Okay, you know, why don't we just release.

601
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,419
Thank God.

602
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,943
Good, everybody. Good.

603
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:19,639
Hey.

604
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,204
Are you Chuck?

605
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:24,858
Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

606
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:28,641
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

607
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:30,077
Cool, sorry.

608
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,337
No, it's all good.

609
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:34,469
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

610
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,426
It means Chuck.

611
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,122
I plugged it into a database.

612
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:41,470
There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet, you just type in your name,

613
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:43,515
and it just says it.

614
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,733
What's your name?

615
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:47,081
- I'm Peter.
- Peter.

616
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,733
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you a Hawaiian name.

617
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,996
Oh, great.

618
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,910
Pepiopi.

619
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,606
- Great.
- Pepiopi, looks like you've got a little pain

620
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:02,347
behind those eyes.

621
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:05,521
Yeah, maybe a little.

622
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,739
There's really only one cure for that.

623
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,869
What's that?

624
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,523
Weed. You got any?

625
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:16,220
- No.
- Well, then let's go surfing.

626
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,699
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to ignore your instincts.

627
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,917
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

628
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,396
Don't do anything.

629
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:29,744
Don't try to surf, don't do it.

630
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:32,136
The less you do, the more you do.

631
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:35,443
Let's see you pop up. Pop it up!

632
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:39,747
That's not it at all.

633
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:42,184
Do less. Get down. Try less. Do it again.

634
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:45,358
Pop up.

635
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,141
No, too slow. Do less.

636
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:48,524
Pop up.

637
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,054
Pop up.

638
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:52,446
You're doing too much. Do less. Pop down.

639
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:53,795
Pop up now.

640
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:55,273
Stop! Get down. Get down there.

641
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:58,100
Remember, don't do anything.

642
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,667
Nothing. Pop up.

643
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,015
Well, you...
No, you gotta do more than that,

644
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,276
'cause you're just laying right out.

645
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:06,450
It looks like you're boogie-boarding.

646
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,539
Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

647
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:13,191
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna figure it out, out there.

648
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:14,365
Let's go surfing, come on.

649
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:16,453
Everybody's learning how, come on and...

650
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:19,759
<i>The weather outside is weather</i>

651
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:22,585
How long you lived out here?

652
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:25,630
Man, I don't know. I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

653
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,108
- Wow, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

654
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,284
No, like my cell phone has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

655
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:35,633
Right, so it's basically the same thing.

656
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:38,981
- How old are you?
- I don't really believe in age or numbers,

657
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,895
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had to put a number on it,

658
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:45,288
I guess I'd be 44.

659
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,549
Fuck!

660
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,855
Thanks for taking me out here.

661
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:55,116
This is the first time I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

662
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:57,856
You need to get back on that board
is what you need to do.

663
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,813
- Yeah?
- Hey, here's the deal.

664
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,379
When life gives you lemons,

665
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,684
just say, "Fuck the lemons," and bail.

666
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:06,511
Yeah. No. You said it, totally.

667
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,685
You gotta just pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

668
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:09,815
get back on that board...

669
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,512
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

670
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:13,078
are you gonna give up surfing?

671
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,817
Probably, yeah.

672
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:18,297
Let's go in, all right. Tacos are on me.

673
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:20,775
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying to you, Brian?

674
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,384
I'm confused and I don't know what to do.

675
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:24,864
<i>What's up with that hat?</i>

676
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,559
<i>What are you
in the Buena Vista Social Club?</i>

677
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,821
This is a nice hat.

678
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:31,734
<i>What member of the Brat Pack are you?</i>

679
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,735
<i>You look like one of those guys
suspected of killing JFK.</i>

680
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:37,127
That's very funny. That's great.

681
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:39,433
<i>Tell him to make friends.</i>

682
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,955
<i>You need to get out there
and make some friends, man.</i>

683
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:43,608
Is Liz there right now?

684
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:45,782
<i>No, no, she's not in here, buddy.</i>

685
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,044
I just heard her.

686
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:49,043
<i>She's gone.</i>

687
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:51,131
Who are you looking at?

688
00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:52,262
<i>What?</i>

689
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:54,045
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

690
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:58,220
<i>No. I swear on my mother's grave, it...
Okay, it was Liz.</i>

691
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,308
<i>She wasn't here the entire time.</i>

692
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:02,612
<i>Go out and meet people.
We meet people all the time...</i>

693
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,135
<i>- All the time on vacation.
- Constantly.</i>

694
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:07,266
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple of dudes here,

695
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:09,702
but they're kind of weird.

696
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:11,659
<i>Just be friendly.</i>

697
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,920
<i>Iron your shirt.</i>

698
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,486
<i>Iron your shirt, look sharp.</i>

699
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,573
<i>Even your T-shirts.</i>

700
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:19,922
There is this girl at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

701
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:22,836
<i>Oh, yeah. You know what?
Go have another dirty one night stand.</i>

702
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,706
<i>That worked out so well before.</i>

703
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:27,707
What do you want from me?
You just told me I need to meet people.

704
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,316
<i>Ask her out.
Maybe that's what he needs, is a rebound.</i>

705
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:32,404
<i>He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't...</i>

706
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:33,665
<i>Can we get on the same team here?</i>

707
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:37,710
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry.</i>

708
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,797
<i>You should go on a date with this girl.</i>

709
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:41,275
Well, maybe I'll ask her out then.

710
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,581
<i>- Yes.
- My wife says so.</i>

711
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:46,799
<i>- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
- Oh, that's neat.</i>

712
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,583
<i>Aloha, bitches!</i>

713
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:52,193
That's very cool.

714
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:57,933
They're not Native Americans, Brian.

715
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:00,672
<i>- Bri...
- What are you doing?</i>

716
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:02,978
<i>- The luha. Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

717
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:04,326
<i>It's called the hula.</i>

718
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,195
<i>- Luau?
- No, hula.</i>

719
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:08,154
<i>You're doing a luau?</i>

720
00:41:21,723 --> 00:41:22,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

721
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,027
- Peter.
- Wow.

722
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:28,810
You look beautiful.
I mean, that's a beautiful dress.

723
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:29,985
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

724
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,420
This'll be fun.

725
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:33,595
<i>Lei?</i>

726
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:40,291
May I help you with something else, Peter?

727
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,379
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

728
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,772
- Happy 4th of July!
- Thank you.

729
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:49,121
<i>Aloha!</i>

730
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:04,081
- You done here?
- No, actually, I just sat down,

731
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:06,038
I'm just getting started.
It's delicious, though, thank you.

732
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,126
I'll just go fuck myself.

733
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:10,910
<i>- Sorry, what?
- Mahalo.</i>

734
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:15,171
Hi, Peter.

735
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,607
Hey. Hey, bro.

736
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:21,260
- Hi.
- Hey, all right.

737
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,130
Excuse me. Excuse me.

738
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:26,391
Everybody, can I have your attention
for one second, please.

739
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:29,392
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

740
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:34,394
He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

741
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:38,961
one of my favourite musicians of all time.
He's so awesome.

742
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:41,700
Please, please, let's take...

743
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:46,876
Let's see if we can get him up here,
Mr Aldous Snow. Please, come on.

744
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,093
Share your gift.

745
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:49,442
Duty calls and all that.

746
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,399
I'm trying to be incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me, this is no fun.

747
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,966
Hey! Thank you!

748
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:06,316
Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

749
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,838
What an eccentric and confident young man.

750
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,491
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman that's here today.

751
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:16,101
It's Miss Sarah Marshall, there she is.

752
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:18,276
Look at her, blimey!

753
00:43:25,714 --> 00:43:28,408
<i>Old as ancient skies</i>

754
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:31,844
<i>I've had these wandering eyes</i>

755
00:43:31,845 --> 00:43:34,280
<i>but you took me by surprise</i>

756
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,673
<i>when you let me inside you</i>

757
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,221
<i>Inside you</i>

758
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,857
<i>Inside you</i>

759
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:45,022
This went from 6:00 to midnight.

760
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:50,154
<i>Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving inside of you</i>

761
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:53,850
<i>Inside of you</i>

762
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:57,156
<i>- Inside you
- Inside you</i>

763
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:00,330
<i>I long to be, is it wrong to be</i>

764
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:03,549
<i>inside of you</i>

765
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,725
<i>Inside of you the restless find their dreams</i>

766
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:14,683
<i>Inside of you this king has found his queen</i>

767
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:21,510
Hey.

768
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:23,858
You're from the breakfast buffet, right?

769
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:25,602
- Yeah.
- Whipped cream or berries?

770
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:27,030
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

771
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:27,946
- Kemo.
- Kemo.

772
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,382
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet, you, man.

773
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:33,645
- Have a beer.
- Thanks. Thank you.

774
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,731
Sarah Marshall.

775
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:38,776
Yes.

776
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,515
How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

777
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:44,865
Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

778
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:46,213
Even Rachel told me.

779
00:44:46,214 --> 00:44:50,605
I heard about it from everybody.
You gotta stop talking about it.

780
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:52,866
<i>It's like The Sopranos.</i>

781
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,780
It's over.

782
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:57,433
Find a new show.

783
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,868
You need a hug.

784
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,348
Come here.

785
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:04,652
Oh, thank you.

786
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:07,436
You're awfully nice.

787
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:10,524
<i>I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig for tomorrow's luau.</i>

788
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:13,437
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind off of things.

789
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:15,829
- Yeah? You don't mind?
- No.

790
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,960
I mean, I must say I'm a pretty good cook.

791
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,223
All right!

792
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:26,354
I can't! Please don't make me do this!

793
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:27,485
Do it!

794
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:31,008
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

795
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,574
You can stop crying now.

796
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:38,662
He's dead already.

797
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:40,228
I'm not crying.

798
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:41,706
You should stop crying.

799
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:43,359
I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

800
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,577
Really?
'Cause you look like a gigantic baby.

801
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:50,187
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that at all.

802
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:00,363
Hey.

803
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:04,930
Listen, would you like to hang out tonight,
like, not in an official hotel function?

804
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:06,408
Yeah. Totally.

805
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:09,017
A bunch of us are going to go to this,
like, little beach thing afterwards.

806
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,801
You're totally welcome to come.

807
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,715
Maybe we could go together?

808
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:15,584
Yeah, whatever.

809
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:17,020
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

810
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:18,064
I just thought that maybe...

811
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:19,629
No, listen,
you don't have to make this weird.

812
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,413
You either want to go or you don't.

813
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:25,283
- I would love to.
- Okay.

814
00:46:25,284 --> 00:46:28,067
Awesome. Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

815
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:31,807
and I'll meet you out front in, like, five?

816
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:45,029
- This is so cool.
- You like it?

817
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:00,250
So what brought you to Hawaii?

818
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,032
- A dude.
- Of course.

819
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:07,252
A surfer dude. You know, WCT, top 44.

820
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,732
Totally.

821
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:15,210
We were together for two years.

822
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,037
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

823
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,342
Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

824
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:23,604
so I moved out, and that's that.

825
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:26,169
What an asshole.

826
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,737
No, he's just a boy.

827
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:35,086
You ever think about going back home,
finishing school, or...

828
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,216
No.

829
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:40,218
No. I work at the hotel,

830
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:43,958
doesn't really have to be a future in there.

831
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:46,175
Okay, my turn.

832
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:48,176
Okay.

833
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:53,352
So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

834
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,743
It's great, you know. People are great.

835
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,874
It's great to have a steady paycheque.
It's... I'm very lucky.

836
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,136
Oh, my God, you hate it.

837
00:48:02,137 --> 00:48:04,658
I fucking hate it so much.

838
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:07,921
So then, do something about it.

839
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:11,834
Excuse me.

840
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:15,052
I'm just saying, if you hate something,
change it.

841
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:17,750
- Don't dwell.
- Well, I'm trying.

842
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:22,446
I'm actually working on a rock opera.

843
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

844
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:28,492
What's your rock opera about?

845
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:32,232
Dracula.

846
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:35,623
Yeah, and eternal love, you know.
That's the theme.

847
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,581
But I think the two sort of go hand in hand,
you know?

848
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,843
And I...

849
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,931
I have this vision of doing it with puppets.

850
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:51,541
I mean, humans also, you know.

851
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,498
Why Dracula?

852
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:58,455
Because he's a man like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

853
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:00,326
And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

854
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:01,979
he ends up smothering and killing her,

855
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,718
which is a feeling I am familiar with.

856
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:06,806
What? That's just a joke.

857
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:09,415
- Oh, shit.
- What?

858
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:13,417
My ex. If I run, you run.

859
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,983
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand at all.

860
00:49:15,984 --> 00:49:17,852
Fucking motherfucker! Dipshit!

861
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:18,983
Rachel, what are you doing?

862
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:20,767
I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

863
00:49:20,768 --> 00:49:21,897
Take it easy, just take it easy.

864
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:23,159
Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

865
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,463
Well, the deal's back on, motherfucker.

866
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:27,550
You ain't the chief in this village.
I'm the chief.

867
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,682
Of the idiots?

868
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:31,509
Rachel, let me handle this. I know
his friend. Let me handle this, okay?

869
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,813
Go ahead.

870
00:49:33,814 --> 00:49:35,988
Hey, man, you remember me from breakfast?

871
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:38,685
- Oh, yeah, the cocktail guy, that's right.
- Yeah.

872
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:41,946
This ain't the breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?

873
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:44,208
Keeping her warm for me at night, huh?

874
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:47,209
Hey, what are you doing here?

875
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:51,818
That's right. Just hit him!

876
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:53,210
Rachel, we gotta get out of here. Rachel?

877
00:49:53,211 --> 00:49:56,255
You get what you deserve.

878
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:11,041
Just a boy?
No, that dude was a fucking man.

879
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:15,824
No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe I ever dated him.

880
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:18,130
- You went nuts.
- Yeah.

881
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:21,217
You guys are dysfunctional.

882
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,740
<i>You were like one of those girls
from Flavour of Love.</i>

883
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,219
- From what?
- You were.

884
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,090
"I'll kill you. I'll kill you. "

885
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,394
Okay, I'm gonna go get us another round.

886
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,482
I'll grab it. It's no big deal.

887
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:37,135
You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

888
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:50,661
You look so hot.

889
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:53,139
<i>Give me Crime Scene.
Give me dirty Crime Scene girl.</i>

890
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,314
André the Giant, out of the shot, please.

891
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:58,315
Mutombo, out of the shot, come on.

892
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:29,236
Did you know that there's a picture
of you flashing,

893
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:30,889
hanging in the men's room?

894
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,934
Yeah. I hate it so much.

895
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:37,151
My jackass boyfriend made me do it.

896
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:39,109
Keoki took it, right there.

897
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,326
And I asked him to take it down,

898
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:45,763
but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

899
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:47,589
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

900
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,244
No. No, no, no, he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

901
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:56,027
But I have a surprise for you.

902
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:57,375
Really, what?

903
00:51:57,376 --> 00:51:58,854
We're gonna take a quick break.

904
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:00,941
Tonight we have a special guest
from the mainland,

905
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:04,072
singing a song from his Dracula musical,

906
00:52:04,073 --> 00:52:08,074
please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

907
00:52:08,944 --> 00:52:10,205
Peter!

908
00:52:10,206 --> 00:52:11,988
Yeah! Go get them, tiger!

909
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:13,901
Please don't.

910
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:15,814
Peter!

911
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:19,251
- Rachel...
- Dracula! Peter!

912
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,121
Get them!

913
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:27,035
What's up?

914
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,081
Thank you.

915
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:38,473
You know, I could play something else.

916
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:40,125
I just think out of context this might be...

917
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,692
Dracula musical!

918
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,041
Thank you.

919
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:10,743
<i>It's getting kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better</i>

920
00:53:12,048 --> 00:53:18,789
<i>I've been drowning too long to believe
that the tide's going to turn</i>

921
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:25,660

things are going to get easier now</i>

I swear to the lord I will slay him</i>

I won't let it be so</i>

929
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:13,196
<i>Die</i>

930
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,414
<i>Die</i>

931
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,110
<i>I can't</i>

932
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:33,591
Awesome!

933
00:54:33,592 --> 00:54:36,027
Thank you.

934
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,376
Thank you.

935
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:43,464
So, I had a really,
really great time tonight.

936
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:45,768
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean, it got a little wild.

937
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:47,769
- "A little"? You can say that.
- Yeah.

938
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,552
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool, and it was...

939
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,335
Thank you for taking me out.

940
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:55,033
No, I had a great time. Thank you.

941
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:58,338
- You did?
- Yeah.

942
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:03,730
I'm sorry.

943
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:07,992
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna complicate things.

944
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:09,428
- No, of course!
- Yeah?

945
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:12,776
No, no, no. Totally. I totally get that.

946
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:14,994
- I had a great time.
- A handshake?

947
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:18,299
- Well, I don't know. Okay.
- All right, all right.

948
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,910
- All right. Get home safe.
- You, too.

949
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:27,041
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

950
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:37,087
<i>I'm on a hammock with me lady</i>

<i>'Cause we're in Hawaii</i>

954
00:55:50,526 --> 00:55:53,005
Hey, guys.

955
00:55:53,136 --> 00:55:56,179
Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

956
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,484
Yeah. No, I remember. I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson together.

957
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:03,051
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with Kaiser Permanente.

958
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:06,704
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk out on the water.

959
00:56:06,705 --> 00:56:09,140
That's cool.

960
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:12,444
Okay, can I just say something?

961
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:15,968
- I went on a date tonight with Rachel, right?
- That wasn't a date.

962
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:18,055
She's in customer service, dude.

963
00:56:18,056 --> 00:56:20,229
She took you out for charity.

964
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,622
It was a date, okay? Trust me.
I know a date, and that was a date.

965
00:56:24,623 --> 00:56:26,883
I bet you think strippers like you, too.

966
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,828
- That's really not necessary.
- It's true.

967
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,015
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

968
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:35,060
Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

969
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,451
Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

970
00:56:37,452 --> 00:56:40,279
I saw him beat up a guy with a starfish.

971
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,410
- Okay, that's just ridiculous.
- That guy was me.

972
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:46,410
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

973
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:49,020
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

974
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:50,890
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

975
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,369
Come on.

976
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:59,662
The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

977
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:02,675
Let me just say
that if God was a city planner,

978
00:57:02,676 --> 00:57:07,460
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

979
00:57:08,722 --> 00:57:12,896
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

980
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:17,854
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

981
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:22,916
and it's not fun, and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

982
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:24,812
And then when you're not fucking...

983
00:57:24,813 --> 00:57:27,595
- Hey, someone's gotta stop him.
- You're the butt of a joke.

984
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:30,205
Fucking this ring is...

985
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:31,901
Fuck!

986
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:34,989
It's gonna be all right.

987
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,990
Hi.

988
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:41,078
Hi, do you wanna come back to bed?

989
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:43,209
Sure.

990
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,472
Have fun.

991
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:53,212
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.

992
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:02,998
Julian, what's up?

993
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:06,346
Oh.

994
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,652
God.

995
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:19,827
The show's been cancelled.

996
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:21,741
That's good, 'cause that's what you wanted.

997
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:25,221
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

998
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:30,787
It's just... I guess
I thought we had another year left.

999
00:58:30,788 --> 00:58:33,092
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,

1000
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,310
'cause it's been a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

1001
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:39,659
Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
It's a surprise.

1002
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,442
Come on tour with me.

1003
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:46,313
I'll serenade you every night
in front of thousands of women.

1004
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,227
I didn't know you were going on tour.

1005
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:49,444
Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

1006
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:53,619
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1007
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,838
and it's gonna be a massive tour.

1008
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,057
Yeah. I can't come 'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

1009
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:02,926
Not any more.

1010
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:05,145
You're an unemployed actress, perfect.

1011
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:10,319
You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1012
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,711
The Sorrow Suckers.

1013
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:16,365
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know why they call them that.

1014
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:20,497
Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

1015
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,018
The hotel wanted to offer you
some complimentary coconut cake.

1016
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:28,108
It's from the hotel. It's definitely
not from me personally, so...

1017
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:30,543
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, great.

1018
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:33,978
When were you planning on telling me this?

1019
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:37,719
- I just told you, then.
- Yeah. No, I know.

1020
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,633
But telling me now
isn't really the same as telling me.

1021
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:45,460
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you I've got genital herpes,

1022
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:47,852
because it's not inflamed at the moment.

1023
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:49,939
Do you guys want some champagne
with your cake,

1024
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,418
or do you want it without your cake?

1025
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,984
I don't drink.

1026
01:00:00,465 --> 01:00:04,943
All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

1027
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:08,050
I worship you,
and I just wanted to give you my demo.

1028
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,217
Just take a listen and...

1029
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:13,348
Okay.

1030
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,088
'Cause you know what?
You don't wanna be the guy sitting there,

1031
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:18,784
watching BBC, and saying,

1032
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:22,525
"Oh, I saw that guy! He was my waiter,

1033
01:00:22,526 --> 01:00:26,612
"and I totally dismissed him
like everyone else does in his life.

1034
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:28,483
"And I totally was wrong,

1035
01:00:28,484 --> 01:00:32,135
"because he's a major, major,
major influence on me now,

1036
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:34,703
"and I feel terrible!"

1037
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:41,138
That stupid English voice, was that me?

1038
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,401
Unfortunately, yes.

1039
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:47,662
You're really gonna like it.

1040
01:00:47,663 --> 01:00:51,489
I'll listen to it when you've gone.

1041
01:00:56,535 --> 01:01:00,448
Hey, look, just don't
tell anyone at the hotel.

1042
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,799
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

1043
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,626
Peter, I got some really interesting news
this morning.

1044
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:17,582
Aldous gave you gonorrhoea?

1045
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,714
No. Why would I tell you that?

1046
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:23,324
<i>Crime Scene was cancelled.</i>

1047
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:25,368
Whoa.

1048
01:01:25,412 --> 01:01:27,456
Wow.

1049
01:01:29,457 --> 01:01:33,196
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1050
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:36,153
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

1051
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:39,067
you know, into features for a long time,
so it's a really good thing.

1052
01:01:39,068 --> 01:01:44,852
<i>This isn't The View. I mean, we can have
an honest talk about this if we want.</i>

1053
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,679
I don't wanna step out of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.

1054
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,375
I don't wanna disappear. I'm freaked out.

1055
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,984
I wanna be honest.
I'm really freaked out right now, okay?

1056
01:01:53,985 --> 01:01:58,029
Because, seemingly, the only actresses
that actually can survive

1057
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,160
are the ones that show their cooter,
and, excuse me, but I refuse to do that.

1058
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:02,552
I have a little dignity.

1059
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:05,639
And I don't have the frame to support
plastic surgery. I would tip over.

1060
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,075
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna exploit myself.

1061
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:12,555
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
You have a long career ahead of you.

1062
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:16,207
You've got, like,
four years until you're 30.

1063
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:18,949
It's gonna be fine.

1064
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,515
- How are you?
- I'm screwed.

1065
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:30,038
Frankly, I don't stand a chance.
No, I'll be fine.

1066
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:34,605
I've been quietly stealing money
from you for a long time.

1067
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:39,520
You're always good at cheering me up,
Pete, thank you.

1068
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,442
<i>Die</i>

1069
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:45,716
<i>Die</i>

1070
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:47,965
<i>Die</i>

1071
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,645
<i>I can't</i>

1072
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:59,132
It's really good, Peter.
I just don't understand it. I don't.

1073
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:02,481
I mean, just chalk it up to that. Please
don't play it again, 'cause I don't...

1074
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:05,656
Just listen to it one more time and see...

1075
01:03:06,744 --> 01:03:08,788
Where's Aldous?

1076
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:12,397
- Mr Snow, may I ask you a question?
- Okay.

1077
01:03:12,398 --> 01:03:15,528
I want to please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,

1078
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:16,790
but I don't know what I'm doing.

1079
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:18,442
You having difficulty sex-wise?

1080
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:20,748
- Do you not know how to use this?
- I know how.

1081
01:03:20,749 --> 01:03:23,531
- Have you had sex before?
- We can't.

1082
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:25,096
- Why?
- Our religion.

1083
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:26,662
Right, 'cause of God and everything?

1084
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:27,923
Hey, that's not gonna be a problem,

1085
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:30,228
because God should be present
in the bedroom.

1086
01:03:30,229 --> 01:03:32,837
Just tell me specifically what I need to do.

1087
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:35,751
You need to penetrate deeply
and stimulate the clitoris simultaneously.

1088
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:37,621
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

1089
01:03:37,622 --> 01:03:40,143
If you can involve the anus in that,
then that's absolute perfection.

1090
01:03:40,144 --> 01:03:41,187
Got it.

1091
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,579
Explore her ears.

1092
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:47,015
Find it in you to be a little more circly.

1093
01:03:47,016 --> 01:03:48,146
You are a man.

1094
01:03:48,147 --> 01:03:49,494
God's within you.

1095
01:03:49,495 --> 01:03:50,973
I actually feel okay about it.

1096
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,886
You know, I'm a little scared,
but I'll be all right. I'll get another job.

1097
01:03:53,887 --> 01:03:56,583
<i>That's interesting, man.
You know what else is interesting?</i>

1098
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:59,540
<i>- What?
- Me on the moon.</i>

1099
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,802
I just wanna talk to you about something.
Can you stop?

1100
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:04,020
<i>- All right, I'm just gonna talk, and then...
- Air!</i>

1101
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:06,499
There was this interesting moment
with Sarah.

1102
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,935
<i>Whoa, what? I don't wanna hear about
your interesting moment with Sarah, Pete.</i>

1103
01:04:09,936 --> 01:04:11,718
Then who am I supposed to talk to
about this?

1104
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:15,458
<i>Well, not me, because have I ever had
an interesting moment with an ex-girlfriend?</i>

1105
01:04:15,459 --> 01:04:18,067
<i>- Do you have an ex-girlfriend? No!
- No.</i>

1106
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:20,330
<i>No.</i>

1107
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:23,721
I would really love to get
the woman's perspective on the matter.

1108
01:04:23,722 --> 01:04:25,287
<i>- Really?
- No.</i>

1109
01:04:25,288 --> 01:04:27,070
But come on in and just sit down.

1110
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,766
<i>- Stay. You have to...
- Honey, no, no, the camera's right there.</i>

1111
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:31,027
<i>No, I know,
but I just wanna tell him, though.</i>

1112
01:04:31,028 --> 01:04:33,811
<i>- No, the camera...
- Think about how much she's hurt you.</i>

1113
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:34,985
<i>- Hey, Liz?
- Yeah?</i>

1114
01:04:34,986 --> 01:04:37,377
I think you need to move just a tiny bit
further away from the microphone.

1115
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:38,508
<i>- Just...
- No, closer.</i>

1116
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:39,682
<i>- Now a little further.
- Okay.</i>

1117
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:40,813
<i>- Closer.
- And then...</i>

1118
01:04:40,814 --> 01:04:43,075
<i>- And then a little further, and then closer.
- I don't know.</i>

1119
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:44,988
<i>- Keep your head down, though.
- I'm bad at this thing.</i>

1120
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:46,641
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, closer. Further away.</i>

1121
01:04:46,642 --> 01:04:49,554
<i>I know what you're doing.
That's not funny at all.</i>

1122
01:04:49,555 --> 01:04:51,599
<i>- You stop that.
- What?</i>

1123
01:04:52,382 --> 01:04:55,165
<i>- What's he doing?
- Come on. Yeah, yeah, real funny.</i>

1124
01:04:55,818 --> 01:04:56,991
Hey, that's a great necklace, Liz.

1125
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:59,078
<i>- Did you have that a second ago?
- Thank you!</i>

1126
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:01,036
<i>That's gross!</i>

1127
01:05:01,037 --> 01:05:02,514
<i>- I don't get it.
- Stop it.</i>

1128
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:06,254
<i>- He's saying if I were to sperm on you...
- What?</i>

1129
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:09,386
<i>- ... it would be a pearl necklace.
- Why?</i>

1130
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:12,256
<i>- Real funny.
- Sorry.</i>

1131
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:14,822
Hey, Dracula!

1132
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:19,041
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord, I'll slay him. "

1133
01:05:21,173 --> 01:05:23,650
That shit is funny, dude!

1134
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:25,216
Hey, Pete.

1135
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:27,825
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

1136
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:30,088
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to come and join.

1137
01:05:31,697 --> 01:05:34,392
I think I'm confused,
because I thought last night...

1138
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:38,394
Oh, my God. Dude, get out of your head.
It's really nice out here.

1139
01:05:38,395 --> 01:05:41,090
Yeah, I bet it is.

1140
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:42,351
All right, yeah. You know what?

1141
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:43,786
I could totally use a
friendly hangout, so...

1142
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:44,960
All right.

1143
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:46,526
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,

1144
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:48,484
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

1145
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:49,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

1146
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:53,225
I heard that place was a pain in the ass.

1147
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:55,529
Okay.

1148
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,138
- Hey!
- Yo, what's up, guys?

1149
01:05:57,139 --> 01:05:58,268
We're just going for a hike.

1150
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:01,095
No, you're not, you're going snorkelling.

1151
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:02,574
I think we're gonna go on a hike.

1152
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:05,793
It is sea turtle fucking season, dude.
Let's go.

1153
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:09,229
They fuck for three hours, dude.
I mean, that's magical.

1154
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,098
- No, we're going on a hike.
- I think we'll go on a hike, yeah.

1155
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:13,882
What? Your loss.

1156
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,101
Why won't anybody
go snorkelling with me?

1157
01:06:22,276 --> 01:06:25,451
How you doing back there?

1158
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:26,973
Awesome.

1159
01:06:26,974 --> 01:06:30,321
I don't think I've ever been
this covered in sweat before.

1160
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:32,496
It's like I have some sort of fever.

1161
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:36,757
I told you this was a pain in the ass.
Could've been at Lazy Joe's.

1162
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:38,454
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1163
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:40,324
Oh, shit.

1164
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:42,977
- You good?
- No.

1165
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:47,804
Wow, we're really going
up to the edge of this, huh?

1166
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,067
Look!

1167
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:56,242
Wow, this is really beautiful.

1168
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,460
All right, so now that your show's done,
are you gonna finish the Dracula musical?

1169
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,549
It's not that easy, you know.

1170
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,419
Sarah always thought it was crazy, and...

1171
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:14,289
Well, you're definitely crazy.
But so is everyone, right? So who cares?

1172
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,725
- I just don't feel like doing anything.
- Why?

1173
01:07:17,726 --> 01:07:19,117
'Cause my heart is broken,

1174
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,900
and I can't imagine
doing anything right now.

1175
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:26,859
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back to school, you know?

1176
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:32,251
Maybe it's good we got hurt like that,
you know?

1177
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:37,644
I don't know about you,
but it makes me feel impervious to pain.

1178
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:41,297
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left to be afraid of.

1179
01:07:41,298 --> 01:07:44,037
- Yeah. No, exactly.
- Right.

1180
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:49,213
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us as bad as they did.

1181
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:52,343
So jump, then.

1182
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,779
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor, you know?

1183
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,868
No. Just do it.

1184
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:03,565
You'll be fine. Jump.

1185
01:08:08,436 --> 01:08:11,306
What the hell?

1186
01:08:12,394 --> 01:08:16,395
Oh, God! Oh, God. I made her kill herself!

1187
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,700
You must be crazy!

1188
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:25,613
- So are you gonna jump or what?
- No!

1189
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:29,179
Come on, Peter!
I can see your vagina from here!

1190
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,006
I can see your hoo-ha.

1191
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,398
I mean, I'll jump!

1192
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,487
Chicken! Come on!

1193
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,276
Please, God, don't let me die today.

1194
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,841
- I'm okay!
- Okay!

1195
01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:02,842
- I'll just let go, right?
- No, no, no!

1196
01:09:02,843 --> 01:09:08,018
If you fall straight down,
you'd probably hit a rock and kill yourself!

1197
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:10,235
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1198
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:11,496
So what do I do?

1199
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:14,323
Why don't you press your feet
up against the rock,

1200
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,411
and, like, shoot yourself off!

1201
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:18,194
- What, like a frog?
- I don't know, Peter!

1202
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,890
Just get off the fucking rock!

1203
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,282
- Here I go!
- Okay!

1204
01:09:23,283 --> 01:09:25,544
One!

1205
01:09:26,414 --> 01:09:27,596
Two!

1206
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,758
Two!

1207
01:09:32,155 --> 01:09:34,459
- Two and a half!
- Jump!

1208
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,295
Three!

1209
01:09:49,377 --> 01:09:53,115
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1210
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:54,986
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!

1211
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,508
I was there. I witnessed it.

1212
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:59,858
Thanks.

1213
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:07,990
Come on.

1214
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:18,732
You've got Christ between your thighs,

1215
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,559
but with a shorter beard.

1216
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,602
<i>- Mahalo.
- Aloha.</i>

1217
01:10:24,603 --> 01:10:27,125
- Sex!
- I'm cramping, I'm cramping.

1218
01:10:27,126 --> 01:10:29,779
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

1219
01:10:30,954 --> 01:10:34,346
Petey? Petey?

1220
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:40,042
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

1221
01:10:40,043 --> 01:10:42,304
You were really out.
Ken sent me.

1222
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:46,305
Dakota Fanning and her people,
they need this room.

1223
01:10:46,306 --> 01:10:48,913
She loves it here.

1224
01:10:48,914 --> 01:10:50,784
Oh.

1225
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:52,045
So does that mean I have to leave the hotel?

1226
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:54,090
Ken found you a room.

1227
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:58,743
I'll take it, yeah.
I wanna hang out with Rachel a little more.

1228
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:04,267
Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?

1229
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:10,443
Maybe you should just give me a minute.

1230
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:16,009
It was the only room available!

1231
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:18,793
I'm sure it was!

1232
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:24,054
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's all right.

1233
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:25,619
Really?

1234
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,143
I think you got some pain behind
those eyes. A kind of pain that only...

1235
01:11:29,144 --> 01:11:30,794
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.

1236
01:11:30,795 --> 01:11:33,100
I wanna stand up on a wave before I leave.

1237
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:34,969
I don't think you're ready yet, man.

1238
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,538
- I'm ready to ride giants, Koonu.
- I think you're ready.

1239
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,413
Petey!

1240
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:08,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

1241
01:12:08,675 --> 01:12:11,502
Miss Marshall, what can I do for you?

1242
01:12:11,503 --> 01:12:14,067
Is there a place
to get good sushi around here?

1243
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:18,591
Yeah. Yeah, there's a really great place
about five minutes from here called Asuki.

1244
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:20,156
Perfect.

1245
01:12:20,157 --> 01:12:21,809
- Do you want me to get you a map?
- Please.

1246
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,679
Okay.

1247
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,115
So, this is where we are.

1248
01:12:27,116 --> 01:12:31,290
Head down Kamehameha,
and then pass Funaho Loko Marsh.

1249
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:33,290
And it should be right to the left.

1250
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,552
It might take, like, five minutes.

1251
01:12:35,553 --> 01:12:38,945
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

1252
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,162
Um...

1253
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:46,816
- I saw you with Peter Bretter...
- Yeah.

1254
01:12:46,817 --> 01:12:49,555
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

1255
01:12:49,556 --> 01:12:52,861
Oh, my God. I'm really sorry.

1256
01:12:52,862 --> 01:12:54,339
- No.
- It's not like that at all.

1257
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,905
- It's not what you're...
- No, it's fine.

1258
01:12:55,906 --> 01:12:57,993
I'm just really glad
you're keeping him company, 'cause...

1259
01:12:57,994 --> 01:13:00,820
- Gosh, no.
- ... you seem like a really nice person,

1260
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:03,603
- and you're very pretty.
- Thank you.

1261
01:13:03,604 --> 01:13:06,125
Gosh, you're, like, way prettier.

1262
01:13:06,126 --> 01:13:09,432
No, you're, like, so pretty.

1263
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,780
Really?

1264
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:16,346
- Yeah.
- Wow, thank you. Thank you.

1265
01:13:16,347 --> 01:13:18,520
And one more thing about Peter.

1266
01:13:18,521 --> 01:13:24,870
He's a really good guy. Really good.
Like, great, actually.

1267
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:26,784
Yeah.

1268
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:28,828
Um...

1269
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:34,264
Please don't cry, Miss Marshall.

1270
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:37,091
God. Do you need me to get you a tissue?

1271
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:40,831
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1272
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:43,093
Okay.

1273
01:13:44,094 --> 01:13:48,921
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Any time, Miss Marshall.

1274
01:13:57,836 --> 01:14:00,010
Hey, ahoy, there!

1275
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,793
You surf, too?

1276
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:04,706
Good Lord, no.
I'm just drifting around, you know?

1277
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:09,186
Getting in touch with the ocean and stuff.
It's really pleasant.

1278
01:14:09,187 --> 01:14:11,753
It was, yeah.

1279
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,665
I'm gonna head in.

1280
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:16,101
Before you go, actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,

1281
01:14:16,102 --> 01:14:18,493
I was listening to Sarah's iPod
the other day,

1282
01:14:18,494 --> 01:14:22,450
and amidst the interminable dross
that's on that thing,

1283
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:24,625
I found one track that I quite liked.

1284
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,757
So I checked what it was,
and it was actually one of yours.

1285
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:33,757
And it kind of reminded me of a dark,
gothic Neil Diamond. It's great.

1286
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:36,193
That's, like, exactly what I'm going for.

1287
01:14:36,194 --> 01:14:38,761
Right, yeah.

1288
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,892
Fuck.

1289
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:47,328
Fuck, you're cool.

1290
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:53,678
It's so hard to say,
because, like, I hate you in so many ways,

1291
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:56,764
but whatever.
I can see why Sarah likes you.

1292
01:14:56,765 --> 01:15:00,288
No accounting for taste, I suppose.
In her case, anyway.

1293
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:03,419
She was with me for five years,
so there you go.

1294
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,333
Yeah, you got four on me there, mate.

1295
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:11,681
You slept with Sarah a year ago?

1296
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:16,031
I thought you knew!
Peter, please, don't take it seriously.

1297
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:19,162
- What the fuck, man! You've...
- Don't get offended by that.

1298
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:21,555
You can't be so casual about this!

1299
01:15:21,556 --> 01:15:24,285
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.

1300
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:28,339
I'm really sorry.
I apologise for offending you, Peter.

1301
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,600
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.

1302
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,035
Well, what's that about?

1303
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:35,184
What do you think it's about?
This is a big deal!

1304
01:15:35,188 --> 01:15:37,428
What about a code of the ocean?
That's not on.

1305
01:15:37,429 --> 01:15:38,559
What about codes among men?

1306
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,820
You don't sleep
with another man's girlfriend!

1307
01:15:39,821 --> 01:15:41,081
- Think of...
- Get out of here!

1308
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:45,213
- All right, okay! All right!
- Get out of here!

1309
01:16:08,612 --> 01:16:10,524
Oh, God!

1310
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:35,358
Koonu! This guy needs help! Koonu!

1311
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:40,619
- Should I call the front desk?
- It hurts. It hurts.

1312
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,011
Wow, you got coral right there in your leg!

1313
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,576
Can you get it out of my leg, please,
hotel man?

1314
01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:45,708
Can you do something about that?

1315
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:49,969
I'd love to, you know, but hotel policy...
They don't let me do that kind of thing.

1316
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,970
They get all weirded out. Insurance...

1317
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,970
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me, please?

1318
01:16:53,971 --> 01:16:55,623
- Yeah.
- It really hurts.

1319
01:16:55,624 --> 01:16:58,624
Koonu, call the front desk now!

1320
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,711
Okay, monster man.

1321
01:17:00,712 --> 01:17:02,625
Pete, he's not gonna do nothing.

1322
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:04,582
I kind of have this thing about blood, okay?

1323
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:08,453
Look at it. It's raping my leg.
Peter, get it out of my fucking leg, please!

1324
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:10,758
One, two.

1325
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,932
- You can't get it out.
- It's really in there.

1326
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:15,454
- Get it out of me!
- Three!

1327
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:17,716
Fuck my arse!

1328
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:20,631
Okay, I got it.
It's all done. It's all over.

1329
01:17:20,632 --> 01:17:23,110
Everything looks fine.

1330
01:17:25,328 --> 01:17:28,241
<i>It's all good! They're coming wiki wiki.</i>

1331
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:32,633
Can you get some towels for me, please?
I'm really losing a lot of blood.

1332
01:17:32,634 --> 01:17:34,721
You sound like you're from London.

1333
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:37,809
Yeah, I'm from London.

1334
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:44,115
What's going on?

1335
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:48,290
You fainted.
I didn't want you to wake up by yourself.

1336
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:51,813
- How's your friend? Is he all right?
- Yeah.

1337
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:54,335
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

1338
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,510
- Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
- What?

1339
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,815
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

1340
01:17:58,816 --> 01:18:00,163
Okay.

1341
01:18:00,164 --> 01:18:03,729
Edward Scissorhands over there told me
that you two were fucking each other

1342
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:06,426
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

1343
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:07,556
Shit.

1344
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,339
How about that, Sarah?

1345
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,993
I'm sorry, Peter.

1346
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:15,167
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around. Can you please...

1347
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:17,907
Please don't touch me.
Just don't touch me, okay?

1348
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:19,646
I'm not touching you.

1349
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:22,952
Will you just please sit? Please?

1350
01:18:22,996 --> 01:18:25,823
All right, I'll sit down,
but I'm sitting down 'cause I want to,

1351
01:18:25,824 --> 01:18:30,084
not because you've asked me to sit, okay?

1352
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,346
Great.

1353
01:18:37,305 --> 01:18:39,391
A year?

1354
01:18:39,392 --> 01:18:42,087
Listen, I get it, okay? I just...

1355
01:18:42,088 --> 01:18:45,088
I need to understand what I did
to make you cheat. I just...

1356
01:18:45,089 --> 01:18:51,655
Pete, it's not anything you did.

1357
01:18:51,656 --> 01:18:55,525
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.

1358
01:18:55,526 --> 01:18:58,352
Will you please cut the bullshit
and have a talk with me?

1359
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:00,980
Fine. Cutting the bullshit.

1360
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,442
It got really hard to keep taking care of you
when you stopped taking care of yourself.

1361
01:19:05,443 --> 01:19:06,702
I tried to get you out of the house.

1362
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:11,574
I tried to get you off your little island
you loved so much, the couch.

1363
01:19:11,575 --> 01:19:13,357
You didn't wanna see the light of day!

1364
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:18,533
God, there was one week
when you wore sweatpants! Every day.

1365
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:27,100
You shall not pass!

1366
01:19:27,318 --> 01:19:30,579
You know what? If they were Sean John
sweatpants, it would have been fine.

1367
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:33,798
But because they're Costco brand,
it's like the worst thing I could do.

1368
01:19:33,799 --> 01:19:37,364
That has nothing to do with it.
That's what you don't get.

1369
01:19:37,365 --> 01:19:41,190
I'm sorry that I didn't end up being
who we thought I was gonna be, you know?

1370
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:46,105
I tried really hard. I promise you that.
I just didn't have it in me.

1371
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:48,627
I think if you had just, maybe tried harder.

1372
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:51,019
I tried!

1373
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,629
You have no idea how hard I tried, Peter.

1374
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,282
I talked to a therapist.

1375
01:19:55,283 --> 01:19:57,674
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.

1376
01:19:57,675 --> 01:19:59,892
I took love seminars. I took sex seminars.

1377
01:19:59,893 --> 01:20:02,458
None of it worked.
None of it made a difference to you.

1378
01:20:02,459 --> 01:20:05,936
And I couldn't drown with you any more.

1379
01:20:05,937 --> 01:20:10,720
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me that I didn't try.

1380
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:12,808
I did.

1381
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:16,201
You were just too stupid to notice.

1382
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:51,383
Whoa. I thought you were gonna wear
the shirt I got you.

1383
01:20:51,384 --> 01:20:53,166
What? No.

1384
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,950
I mean, I do love that shirt you got me.

1385
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,690
I admire Sir Tommy Bahama an awful lot.

1386
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:03,518
He's a talented man, but tonight,
I feel that this is appropriate.

1387
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:12,173
Wow, thank you. Yeah, Sarah got it for me.

1388
01:21:12,564 --> 01:21:16,783
This is, like, way more convenient
than my backpack.

1389
01:21:18,231 --> 01:21:19,448
Awesome hat!

1390
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:22,436
Thank you.
Yeah, my girlfriend got it for me!

1391
01:21:22,437 --> 01:21:25,133
- I'm fucking with you!
- Cool!

1392
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:33,135
Sarah, can I use this lipstick, please?

1393
01:21:37,137 --> 01:21:41,094
Sure. I don't care.

1394
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:44,355
I think it looks great.
But if you're not, let's go change.

1395
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:47,878
No, I like it. I didn't like it at first.
Now I really think it's...

1396
01:21:47,879 --> 01:21:49,661
Oh, bloody hell. This is a small resort.

1397
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:52,141
Hi, Peter.

1398
01:21:53,445 --> 01:21:55,967
Hey. Wow.

1399
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:58,620
Aldous, Sarah, this is Rachel.

1400
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:01,229
Sarah bought me this shirt.

1401
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,621
I could've guessed that. Yeah.

1402
01:22:02,622 --> 01:22:03,839
- Looks great.
- You look great.

1403
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,839
Looks awesome.

1404
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,014
- See.
- Thanks.

1405
01:22:08,015 --> 01:22:12,276
Mr Snow, I'm so sorry.
I did not know you guys were coming.

1406
01:22:12,277 --> 01:22:13,450
You're gonna have to wait five minutes.

1407
01:22:13,451 --> 01:22:14,581
I did not know you guys were coming.

1408
01:22:14,582 --> 01:22:16,364
It's okay. It's not a problem.

1409
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:18,234
I didn't see you guys, so...

1410
01:22:18,235 --> 01:22:21,451
There's really no need to weep.

1411
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:24,019
I'm not crying.

1412
01:22:24,497 --> 01:22:27,411
It's no problem, honestly.
It's not a problem.

1413
01:22:27,412 --> 01:22:30,542
- So, your table is ready, guys.
- Oh, great.

1414
01:22:30,543 --> 01:22:32,194
Hey, have a lovely evening, you two.

1415
01:22:32,195 --> 01:22:34,108
- Thank you. Have a great dinner, you guys.
- Thank you.

1416
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:35,543
You're welcome to join us, obviously,
if you want.

1417
01:22:35,544 --> 01:22:37,412
- Okay.
- Wouldn't dream of it. What?

1418
01:22:37,413 --> 01:22:39,589
What?

1419
01:22:39,632 --> 01:22:41,501
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1420
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:43,284
- That's great. Awesome.
- Sure.

1421
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:44,632
Great. I'll just set two more places.

1422
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:45,763
- Okay.
- Not a big deal.

1423
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:47,242
Awesome.

1424
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:52,025
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.

1425
01:22:52,026 --> 01:22:53,069
I am so sorry.

1426
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,114
I never thought in a million years
she would say yes.

1427
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,244
I did.

1428
01:22:57,245 --> 01:23:00,245
What? I just accepted an invitation.
I didn't wanna be rude.

1429
01:23:00,246 --> 01:23:02,028
It's got us in a terrible situation.

1430
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:04,115
Now I'm gonna have to sit with him
wearing this shirt all night.

1431
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:05,986
You're wearing the shirt regardless.

1432
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:07,769
Australia is amazing.

1433
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,335
- I'm telling you. It is a great place to shoot.
- Yeah?

1434
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:14,641
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.

1435
01:23:14,642 --> 01:23:17,468
I wanna go. I really, really wanna go there.

1436
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:20,468
- Wait, so when's the movie coming out?
- Mmm.

1437
01:23:20,686 --> 01:23:22,686
It came out.

1438
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:25,557
- It was already released.
- Oh.

1439
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,253
Well, you know, it's an island.

1440
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,384
It's isolated.

1441
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:31,862
- Yeah.
- Movies don't really come out here.

1442
01:23:31,863 --> 01:23:34,559
- Obviously.
- Did you like it?

1443
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,126
- The movie?
- Yeah.

1444
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:39,473
- It was...
- Awful bloody film.

1445
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:41,648
I say, it's just a ridiculous premise.

1446
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:45,402
What would happen
if your mobile phone killed you?

1447
01:23:45,403 --> 01:23:48,003
Why would a mobile phone kill anyone?
It doesn't make sense.

1448
01:23:48,004 --> 01:23:50,804
How could a mobile phone
have an agenda and kill people.

1449
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:52,303
I told her that when she read the script.

1450
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:53,955
Yeah. You were the voice of reason, mate.

1451
01:23:53,956 --> 01:23:55,739
I tried to be, but she didn't listen.

1452
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,565
Going around killing people.
A mobile phone, like, doing murders.

1453
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,523
Why couldn't you just take the battery
out of the phone?

1454
01:24:00,524 --> 01:24:02,001
Right. That's it. The battle's over.

1455
01:24:02,002 --> 01:24:04,393
- Yeah, we've won.
- I hated it.

1456
01:24:04,394 --> 01:24:06,481
Well, it's not for everyone, but it...

1457
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:08,568
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favourite scene.

1458
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:11,048
Ring-ring. Hello?

1459
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:12,961
- Right. It would never happen.
- Yeah.

1460
01:24:12,962 --> 01:24:14,396
No, it could never happen.

1461
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:18,571
It's a metaphor for addiction to technology.

1462
01:24:18,572 --> 01:24:22,746
For society,
for how we're reliant on technology.

1463
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:23,877
I get it. I'm with you.

1464
01:24:23,878 --> 01:24:25,573
It's a metaphor for a crap movie.

1465
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:27,748
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

1466
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:30,402
- Sure.
- You know?

1467
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:44,188
Well, this is awkward.

1468
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,232
Yeah?

1469
01:24:49,233 --> 01:24:51,711
- It's a bit more awkward now.
- A little.

1470
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:54,756
Hey, excuse me.
Can we get another bottle of wine, please?

1471
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,016
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1472
01:24:56,017 --> 01:24:57,146
Mr Snow?

1473
01:24:57,147 --> 01:24:59,538
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of lime in it, please.

1474
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,235
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

1475
01:25:01,236 --> 01:25:03,845
Because I can probably rustle up either one.
Throw some OJ...

1476
01:25:03,846 --> 01:25:05,889
I don't care.

1477
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:08,368
Okay, great.

1478
01:25:16,762 --> 01:25:20,154
Hey, can we get another bottle of wine?

1479
01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:30,721
If I've learned anything from addiction,
it's that,

1480
01:25:30,722 --> 01:25:35,331
you know, life is as brief as the
twinkling of a star over all too soon.

1481
01:25:35,332 --> 01:25:37,403
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

1482
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:40,854
why not do the most interesting thing
that you can do in that situation?

1483
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:43,334
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

1484
01:25:43,335 --> 01:25:44,899
have a chin-wag, a bit of a chat.

1485
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,335
Lose yourself in something
that's both ancient and perennial.

1486
01:25:48,336 --> 01:25:53,511
Find something eternal, perpetual.
Lose yourself in fuck.

1487
01:25:54,598 --> 01:25:56,903
I'm going to disagree.

1488
01:25:56,904 --> 01:25:58,338
Respectfully, of course, sir.

1489
01:25:58,339 --> 01:26:00,555
Maybe for you, that works.

1490
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,774
For me, it's much more enjoyable
to get to know somebody.

1491
01:26:03,775 --> 01:26:05,470
If you end up sleeping with them,
that's great.

1492
01:26:05,471 --> 01:26:07,645
But I like getting to know somebody.

1493
01:26:07,646 --> 01:26:09,210
But he...

1494
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:13,255
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it wherever he wants,

1495
01:26:13,256 --> 01:26:15,865
but he's joking.

1496
01:26:15,866 --> 01:26:17,648
I ain't. No, I'm not joking.

1497
01:26:17,649 --> 01:26:21,041
It's just what I believe, really.

1498
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:22,953
So...

1499
01:26:22,954 --> 01:26:28,694
Just so we're clear and so I can hone in
on your central thesis of the night,

1500
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:30,259
wade through all the bullshit,

1501
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:33,086
you're telling me
that you think you have the right

1502
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,783
to just fuck anyone, anywhere, anytime?

1503
01:26:35,784 --> 01:26:37,784
- Yes. There it is. That's right.
- That's what you're saying?

1504
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:40,915
Not so eloquently
as you just put it, sweetheart.

1505
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:42,350
But ultimately, yes, that is...

1506
01:26:42,351 --> 01:26:44,437
Oh, no! Not the shirt!

1507
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:48,003
Take my eyes, but not the shirt. Mmm.

1508
01:26:48,004 --> 01:26:51,004
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

1509
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,613
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

1510
01:26:53,614 --> 01:26:56,137
Do you know what? I think I've improved it,
actually, against all odds.

1511
01:26:56,138 --> 01:26:57,485
I think I deserve a design award.

1512
01:26:57,486 --> 01:26:59,572
Please get some seltzer water.

1513
01:26:59,573 --> 01:27:02,965
- Garçon, could we get some...
- I saw it from farther away.

1514
01:27:03,835 --> 01:27:05,922
- Okay.
- Just lean back for a second.

1515
01:27:05,923 --> 01:27:07,705
No, it's all right.
It's not there. Let me...

1516
01:27:07,706 --> 01:27:09,139
You're very diligent. I appreciate it.

1517
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,140
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna have to walk away.

1518
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:13,141
Bless you. There you are.

1519
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:15,837
Oh, me, oh, my.

1520
01:27:15,838 --> 01:27:19,013
- Call the doctor.
- Oh, good.

1521
01:27:27,102 --> 01:27:29,275
- I love Hawaii.
- Is it good?

1522
01:27:29,276 --> 01:27:33,450
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for like a week tops.

1523
01:27:33,451 --> 01:27:35,321
Any more than that, I know I'd go crazy,

1524
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:39,192
because I think that
Hawaii is a place to escape

1525
01:27:39,193 --> 01:27:43,106
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

1526
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:49,499
Yeah, you know, there's so few
personal shoppers and pet therapists.

1527
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,718
Gosh, it's such a hard life.

1528
01:28:02,025 --> 01:28:04,678
I like living here.

1529
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,114
- Anyone need any more vino?
- I think we're good.

1530
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:13,071
I've a question for you real quick, Mr S.

1531
01:28:13,072 --> 01:28:16,419
I was actually meaning to ask you,
what did you exactly think of my demo?

1532
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,898
Did you get it? Did you get it?

1533
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:21,725
Oh, no. I was gonna listen to that,

1534
01:28:21,726 --> 01:28:25,858
but then I just carried on living my life.

1535
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:29,118
Not at all?

1536
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,119
No, I didn't, because, you know,
I go on my instincts,

1537
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,773
and they weren't good.

1538
01:28:36,426 --> 01:28:40,383
You know what, dude?
Fuck you, okay? You can go fuck yourself.

1539
01:28:40,384 --> 01:28:42,383
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.

1540
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:43,514
My boss will hear me,

1541
01:28:43,515 --> 01:28:45,514
and then I won't be able
to pay off my student loans.

1542
01:28:45,515 --> 01:28:48,428
But you know what? You're an asshole.
I fucking hate you.

1543
01:28:48,429 --> 01:28:49,559
I bought all your records.

1544
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,385
This whole fucking time, I've been trying
to get you to come hang out with me.

1545
01:28:52,386 --> 01:28:56,778
I'm gonna have people fuck with your food
the rest of your trip, you fucking dick!

1546
01:28:56,779 --> 01:29:00,171
I like him. That was quite moving.

1547
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,957
Wait, wait, wait.

1548
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:18,741
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1549
01:29:18,785 --> 01:29:21,046
Are you sure that you're not,
like, too drunk?

1550
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:24,787
Jesus, would you stop being so sensitive.

1551
01:29:50,054 --> 01:29:52,098
Aldous.

1552
01:29:52,664 --> 01:29:54,098
Wake up.

1553
01:29:54,099 --> 01:29:56,838
- Aldous. Wake up.
- Hmm...

1554
01:29:56,839 --> 01:29:59,404
Make love to me.

1555
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:03,667
All right. You go on top, though,
'cause I'm knackered.

1556
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:21,063
Listen.

1557
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:25,238
Yes! Yes!

1558
01:30:27,065 --> 01:30:29,151
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1559
01:30:29,152 --> 01:30:31,718
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

1560
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:36,807
- Yeah! Oh, God!
- Yeah!

1561
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:41,546
- Right there!
- Yes!

1562
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:44,068
- Yes!
- Yes! She's having an orgasm!

1563
01:30:44,069 --> 01:30:46,025
This is the best sex ever!

1564
01:30:46,026 --> 01:30:48,548
Yeah, all right, that'll do.

1565
01:30:48,549 --> 01:30:50,810
What?

1566
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,811
I made a mistake coming here with you.

1567
01:30:56,594 --> 01:30:59,682
And I'm not done either!

1568
01:30:59,813 --> 01:31:01,900
- Please shut up! Okay.
- Okay!

1569
01:31:01,901 --> 01:31:04,204
You're still involved with him next door,
ain't you?

1570
01:31:04,205 --> 01:31:05,336
Excuse me?

1571
01:31:05,337 --> 01:31:07,205
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

1572
01:31:07,206 --> 01:31:11,685
Then we come back here,
and you put on that ghastly performance.

1573
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:14,729
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,

1574
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:16,295
but I've never seen one.

1575
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:18,478
It really deeply upset me.

1576
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:21,027
You should have seen yourself at dinner.

1577
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:25,472
"Oh, I'm Aldous Snow.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1578
01:31:25,473 --> 01:31:27,559
"No, no drinks for me, thanks.

1579
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,211
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. "

1580
01:31:29,212 --> 01:31:31,907
That's a really reductive impression.

1581
01:31:31,908 --> 01:31:34,430
If I wanted to see you act badly,
I'd just watch your TV show,

1582
01:31:34,431 --> 01:31:36,735
which, obviously, I can't now,
because it's been cancelled.

1583
01:31:36,736 --> 01:31:38,823
Oh, my God, you're such a prick.

1584
01:31:38,824 --> 01:31:39,953
And you know what?

1585
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:43,084
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

1586
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:47,347
That is Buddhist. That is Nordic.
That is Hindu. That's just gibberish.

1587
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:49,565
They are completely conflicting ideologies.

1588
01:31:49,566 --> 01:31:51,957
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.

1589
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:54,827
It makes you full of shit.

1590
01:31:57,351 --> 01:32:00,960
Was that genuine or did you fake that?

1591
01:32:01,961 --> 01:32:06,221
Right. I'm gonna probably clear off now.

1592
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,787
I'll have a little sleep for a few hours,

1593
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:12,659
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?

1594
01:32:16,443 --> 01:32:18,660
I hate your music.

1595
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:22,966
Yeah, well,
I fucked the housekeeper the other day.

1596
01:32:28,315 --> 01:32:30,837
Are you sleeping?

1597
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:33,316
Not any more.

1598
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:43,015
I know that I'm leaving in a couple of days,
so I don't even know

1599
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:46,973
what the hell this means,

1600
01:32:49,495 --> 01:32:53,409
but I really like spending time
with you a lot.

1601
01:32:55,845 --> 01:32:58,541
I know. Me too.

1602
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:08,327
Hey.

1603
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:16,068
Good morning.

1604
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:19,328
Where are you going?

1605
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:22,764
The Korean Textile Manufacturer's Luau.

1606
01:33:22,765 --> 01:33:25,156
- Just kill me.
- Fun.

1607
01:33:25,157 --> 01:33:27,201
Joy.

1608
01:33:28,071 --> 01:33:32,724
I want you to know
that I meant what I said last night.

1609
01:33:33,072 --> 01:33:35,551
I know you did.

1610
01:33:35,813 --> 01:33:38,378
I did, too.

1611
01:33:39,856 --> 01:33:43,597
- Can I see you again tonight?
- Yeah.

1612
01:33:43,727 --> 01:33:46,422
- I get off at 7:00.
- Yay.

1613
01:33:46,423 --> 01:33:48,599
Bye.

1614
01:33:50,599 --> 01:33:51,946
Sir, morning mai tai.

1615
01:33:51,947 --> 01:33:53,947
You know what?

1616
01:33:53,948 --> 01:33:58,905
I actually will not be having
an alcoholic beverage this morning.

1617
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:28,435
- Jump! Jump! Jump!
- Don't make me do it.

1618
01:34:47,006 --> 01:34:49,831
Hey. Morning, mate.

1619
01:34:49,832 --> 01:34:53,572
- How are you today?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. You okay?

1620
01:34:53,573 --> 01:34:55,790
Am I okay? I'm better than okay, my friend.

1621
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,442
You seem sprightly.

1622
01:34:57,443 --> 01:34:59,313
I...

1623
01:34:59,314 --> 01:35:01,008
I had a great time last night.

1624
01:35:01,009 --> 01:35:04,444
- Congratulations. Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

1625
01:35:04,445 --> 01:35:06,315
What about you? What's with the bag?

1626
01:35:06,316 --> 01:35:09,751
Right, yeah. I'm off back to England, mate.

1627
01:35:09,752 --> 01:35:11,229
Oh, you and Sarah are going to England.

1628
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:14,447
No, no, no. I'm just going alone.

1629
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:16,404
- Yeah.
- Did you guys have a fight or something?

1630
01:35:16,405 --> 01:35:20,058
Yeah, it was really... How you served
five years under her, I don't know.

1631
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:24,754
You deserve a medal or a holiday
or at least a cuddle from somebody.

1632
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:26,537
You were only here for a week.

1633
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:28,711
Well, I don't know.
For me, that one week of it

1634
01:35:28,712 --> 01:35:33,409
was like going on holiday with,
I don't know, I wouldn't say Hitler,

1635
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:36,845
but certainly Goebbels.
It was like a little holiday with Hitler.

1636
01:35:36,846 --> 01:35:38,323
Jesus.

1637
01:35:38,324 --> 01:35:41,845
Hey, listen, at least it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.

1638
01:35:41,846 --> 01:35:44,108
Oh...

1639
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,673
No, no. No.

1640
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,065
You know what?
I have a good thing going on with Rachel,

1641
01:35:49,066 --> 01:35:50,848
and I want to see that through.

1642
01:35:50,849 --> 01:35:54,371
Well, maybe you could have both of them.
Rachel and Sarah.

1643
01:35:54,372 --> 01:35:57,285
They got on all right, didn't they,
at dinner? So maybe...

1644
01:35:57,286 --> 01:35:59,807
You know what?
First of all, I'm not that kind of guy.

1645
01:35:59,808 --> 01:36:04,591
And even if I was, I don't think that I have
the sexual competency to really pull that off.

1646
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,244
Yeah. It's a gift.

1647
01:36:06,245 --> 01:36:09,506
I will say,
if you do get back with Miss Marshall,

1648
01:36:09,507 --> 01:36:12,811
handle with care, because, you know...

1649
01:36:13,986 --> 01:36:15,768
Okay. Well, I think my ride's here.

1650
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:18,551
So I'm gonna skedaddle then
before anything else happens to me.

1651
01:36:18,552 --> 01:36:20,248
Before life gets any more daft.

1652
01:36:20,249 --> 01:36:21,901
Is someone gonna take that?

1653
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:25,510
Listen, don't let them grind you down.

1654
01:36:25,772 --> 01:36:27,119
Take it easy.

1655
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,729
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna have sex with her.

1656
01:36:34,296 --> 01:36:37,905
He said it was clear I wasn't over you.

1657
01:36:39,515 --> 01:36:41,384
And then he left.

1658
01:36:41,385 --> 01:36:43,863
Fucking prick.

1659
01:36:44,864 --> 01:36:48,169
And then I started thinking,
what if he's right?

1660
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:52,083
What if I'm not over you?

1661
01:36:52,997 --> 01:36:56,911
- Sarah...
- Please just let me finish, Pete.

1662
01:37:02,869 --> 01:37:07,131
What if I made
a really, really horrible mistake?

1663
01:37:09,045 --> 01:37:13,306
- Sarah.
- Yeah?

1664
01:37:13,307 --> 01:37:15,828
Stop pulling my face towards your face.

1665
01:37:15,829 --> 01:37:17,699
Why?

1666
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,351
You don't like it?

1667
01:37:19,352 --> 01:37:24,048
Listen, pulling my shirt towards you
is the same concept as pulling my face.

1668
01:37:24,049 --> 01:37:28,310
Let's spend one more night here together,
and then let's go home and then...

1669
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:30,310
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

1670
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,486
- ... face reality. No.
- That's the big plan?

1671
01:37:32,487 --> 01:37:34,269
No. I love you.

1672
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:38,401
That's not fair.
That's not fair of you to say that to me.

1673
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:41,837
Please, Peter.

1674
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:47,272
- Tell me you're sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1675
01:37:49,622 --> 01:37:52,143
I missed you.

1676
01:37:56,493 --> 01:37:58,537
I'm sorry.

1677
01:38:00,537 --> 01:38:03,538
God, I missed you, Peter.

1678
01:38:09,844 --> 01:38:11,496
All right.

1679
01:38:11,497 --> 01:38:14,932
Get hard for me, Pete. Get hard for me.

1680
01:38:14,933 --> 01:38:17,758
- I know what I'm supposed to do.
- Okay.

1681
01:38:17,759 --> 01:38:19,716
Just do it. Come on. Get hard.

1682
01:38:19,717 --> 01:38:21,499
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

1683
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,369
- Here. Just let me do it for a second.
- Okay.

1684
01:38:25,587 --> 01:38:28,805
I really want you, Peter. I missed you.

1685
01:38:28,806 --> 01:38:30,284
You don't want help?

1686
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:33,719
- You don't want help? Uh-huh.
- Can you be quiet just for a minute?

1687
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,850
Do you want my hands?

1688
01:38:34,851 --> 01:38:39,070
Maybe just don't talk for a second
is what I mean.

1689
01:38:39,244 --> 01:38:40,808
Do you want my mouth?

1690
01:38:40,809 --> 01:38:44,288
- Yeah, maybe your mouth.
- Yeah. Okay.

1691
01:38:51,855 --> 01:38:54,464
What's the problem, Peter?

1692
01:38:54,465 --> 01:38:56,638
- I don't know...
- More?

1693
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,945
You can keep trying if you want.

1694
01:39:03,424 --> 01:39:05,511
What's wrong with you?

1695
01:39:05,512 --> 01:39:07,685
- Nothing is wrong with me, okay?
- Okay.

1696
01:39:07,686 --> 01:39:09,772
- No, I didn't...
- Just, something doesn't feel right any more.

1697
01:39:09,773 --> 01:39:11,773
Okay. Well, did you... You know what?

1698
01:39:11,774 --> 01:39:13,948
Did you drink today?
Because sometimes when you drink...

1699
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,514
Excuse me.

1700
01:39:15,515 --> 01:39:19,341
No, I haven't had anything to drink today.

1701
01:39:20,733 --> 01:39:25,429
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart into a million pieces,

1702
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:29,169
and so my cock doesn't want
to be around you any more, okay?

1703
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:31,214
Ever!

1704
01:39:32,301 --> 01:39:34,910
Because you know what I just realised?
Huh?

1705
01:39:34,911 --> 01:39:38,738
You're the God damn devil. Okay?

1706
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:46,349
Wedding in Hawaii! Real original!

1707
01:39:56,308 --> 01:39:59,483
- Hey.
- Hey, Rachel.

1708
01:39:59,962 --> 01:40:03,048
- Sarah and Aldous broke up this morning.
- What a surprise.

1709
01:40:03,049 --> 01:40:06,789
So I went to check on Sarah, and...

1710
01:40:08,616 --> 01:40:11,094
Listen, I'm here
because I don't want to lie to you, okay?

1711
01:40:11,095 --> 01:40:13,095
Some stuff happened.

1712
01:40:13,096 --> 01:40:15,051
I'm really, really sorry that it did,

1713
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:18,096
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because

1714
01:40:18,097 --> 01:40:23,663
I'm able to see so clearly now that
Sarah and I are not right for each other.

1715
01:40:23,924 --> 01:40:26,403
What stuff?

1716
01:40:27,577 --> 01:40:33,317
I went up to make sure that she was okay,
and it got weird.

1717
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:35,187
But now everything is fine.

1718
01:40:35,188 --> 01:40:36,840
And I need you to understand

1719
01:40:36,841 --> 01:40:39,145
that I meant everything that I said
to you this morning.

1720
01:40:39,146 --> 01:40:40,406
What exactly happened, Peter?

1721
01:40:40,407 --> 01:40:42,059
We fooled around a little bit.

1722
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:46,278
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly what you did.

1723
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:52,973
All right. I went to her room,
and she was crying and crying and crying.

1724
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,193
And I felt like I should comfort her.

1725
01:40:55,194 --> 01:40:58,628
And then she started kissing me
because I was comforting her.

1726
01:40:58,629 --> 01:41:00,846
And then the next thing I knew,
I was kissing her

1727
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:03,021
because she had been kissing me
because of the comforting.

1728
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:07,893
Then she started taking my clothes off,
and then her clothes were off.

1729
01:41:10,024 --> 01:41:13,850
Then she performed
10 to 15 seconds of oral sex on me.

1730
01:41:13,851 --> 01:41:15,416
Okay. Peter, you can leave now.

1731
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:18,155
- At the most. Maximum.
- Thank you for staying at Turtle Bay.

1732
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,373
Rachel, please don't do this.

1733
01:41:19,374 --> 01:41:21,896
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because I really care about...

1734
01:41:21,897 --> 01:41:23,983
Listen to me, Peter.

1735
01:41:23,984 --> 01:41:27,114
I was a mess, too. I understand. Okay?

1736
01:41:27,115 --> 01:41:30,464
But it does not excuse
you acting like a complete asshole.

1737
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:33,247
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up for a minute,

1738
01:41:33,248 --> 01:41:34,943
but I'm not like every other asshole.

1739
01:41:34,944 --> 01:41:38,596
You should not be with anybody right now.

1740
01:41:38,597 --> 01:41:40,815
Anybody.

1741
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:43,684
I know...

1742
01:41:43,685 --> 01:41:45,337
I know that there is something here.

1743
01:41:45,338 --> 01:41:47,338
I know that I was not wrong about that.

1744
01:41:47,339 --> 01:41:52,210
And, yes, it's only been four days,
but I know you feel it, too.

1745
01:41:55,906 --> 01:41:58,645
I need you to leave.

1746
01:41:59,733 --> 01:42:04,604
Do not write me. Do not call me.
Do not e-mail me.

1747
01:42:09,431 --> 01:42:12,519
Peter, I need you to go.

1748
01:42:15,998 --> 01:42:18,999
I won't bother you any more.

1749
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,391
I'm sorry.

1750
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,785
I don't know what to do.

1751
01:42:37,787 --> 01:42:39,874
Hey, brother, what you doing, huh?
You stealing my art?

1752
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:42,396
I want you to put it back right now.
Put it back, bro!

1753
01:42:42,397 --> 01:42:45,006
Listen, give me the picture.

1754
01:42:45,007 --> 01:42:47,398
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing doo-doo paper?

1755
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:50,051
Give me the picture.

1756
01:42:51,878 --> 01:42:55,225
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.

1757
01:42:55,226 --> 01:42:58,140
You can hit me as many times as you want.
I'm not giving you the photo back.

1758
01:42:58,141 --> 01:43:00,185
Oh, yeah.

1759
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:10,492
No, no, no.
Peter, I told you I did not want to see you.

1760
01:43:28,889 --> 01:43:32,758
<i>Aloha, I'm Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime.</i>

1761
01:43:32,759 --> 01:43:34,411
<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,</i>

1762
01:43:34,412 --> 01:43:38,064
<i>I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines
to my favourite destinations.</i>

1763
01:43:38,065 --> 01:43:40,586
<i>Now sit back
and enjoy your in-flight entertainment.</i>

1764
01:43:40,587 --> 01:43:43,066
<i>I know I will. Mahalo.</i>

1765
01:43:43,067 --> 01:43:46,414
<i>Everybody hates you</i>

1766
01:43:46,415 --> 01:43:49,980
<i>Everybody wishes that you were dead</i>

1767
01:43:49,981 --> 01:43:51,633
<i>Because, Peter, you suck</i>

1768
01:43:51,634 --> 01:43:53,634
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

1769
01:43:53,635 --> 01:43:56,939
<i>Peter, your music is fucking terrible</i>

1770
01:43:56,940 --> 01:44:00,287
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

1771
01:44:00,288 --> 01:44:03,636
<i>Peter, you don't do anything of value</i>

1772
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:05,201
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

1773
01:44:05,202 --> 01:44:09,681
<i>Write some music but instead
you sit and write these bullshit songs</i>

1774
01:44:09,682 --> 01:44:11,464
<i>It's so self-loathing</i>

1775
01:44:11,465 --> 01:44:14,769
<i>Go see a psychiatrist
I hate the psychiatrist</i>

1776
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,336
<i>Well, go see one anyway</i>

1777
01:44:16,337 --> 01:44:17,814
<i>I don't like the psychiatrist</i>

1778
01:44:17,815 --> 01:44:19,467
<i>You need to go and see one</i>

1779
01:44:19,468 --> 01:44:21,032
<i>See a psychiatrist</i>

1780
01:44:21,033 --> 01:44:23,512
<i>I'm not going</i>

1781
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:04,697
<i>It's getting kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better</i>

1782
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,362
I don't understand
what there is to think about.

1783
01:45:52,363 --> 01:45:53,623
Because, D, he...

1784
01:45:53,624 --> 01:45:56,233
She licked the tip. That doesn't count.

1785
01:45:56,234 --> 01:45:59,059
- Of course it counts. He...
- He what?

1786
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:02,712
He refused a blowjob
from his ex-girlfriend mid-blowjob.

1787
01:46:02,713 --> 01:46:05,713
Do you know what that's like for a man?
It's called blue balls, Rachel.

1788
01:46:05,714 --> 01:46:07,931
This guy is like Gandhi, but better.

1789
01:46:07,932 --> 01:46:09,062
He likes puppets.

1790
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:11,019
I love puppets.

1791
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:14,672
I love Fraggle Rock. I love Lamb Chop.
I love Elmo.

1792
01:46:14,673 --> 01:46:19,153
<i>Sesame Street, Bert and Ernie,
Snuffelupagus. Fucks my shit up.</i>

1793
01:46:22,414 --> 01:46:26,067
<i>This is a song that
I never thought I would write</i>

1794
01:46:26,068 --> 01:46:28,241
<i>On the night I'm dying</i>

1795
01:46:28,242 --> 01:46:31,372
<i>Sorry for all the wrong I've done</i>

1796
01:46:31,373 --> 01:46:33,242
<i>I'm finished trying</i>

1797
01:46:33,243 --> 01:46:38,461
<i>It was a wonderful dream
Now let him come and slay me</i>

1798
01:46:38,462 --> 01:46:40,113
<i>There he is</i>

1799
01:46:40,114 --> 01:46:42,854
<i>The demon
who haunted the streets of London</i>

1800
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,506
<i>I've come to slay you</i>

1801
01:46:44,507 --> 01:46:46,203
<i>Here I am!</i>

1802
01:46:46,204 --> 01:46:48,681
<i>I'll leave you bleeding in my dungeon</i>

1803
01:46:48,682 --> 01:46:52,552
<i>I'll never obey you
I'll rip out your oesophagus</i>

1804
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:57,423
<i>Please, Mr Van Helsing
Listen to me</i>

1805
01:46:57,424 --> 01:47:02,990
<i>He is just a man who wishes to be free</i>

1806
01:47:02,991 --> 01:47:06,207
<i>Lay him in a hearse
You must end this curse</i>

1807
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:08,861
<i>He is the worst!</i>

1808
01:47:20,604 --> 01:47:23,909
<i>Don't go my love</i>

1809
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:27,996
<i>I can't say goodbye</i>

1810
01:47:27,997 --> 01:47:31,867
<i>My reign is done</i>

1811
01:47:31,868 --> 01:47:37,799
<i>It's time to die</i>

1812
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,782
<i>I'm pregnant</i>

1813
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:41,565
<i>Dracula</i>

1814
01:47:41,566 --> 01:47:42,783
<i>What have I done?</i>

1815
01:47:42,784 --> 01:47:45,088
<i>Has flown above</i>

1816
01:47:45,089 --> 01:47:46,437
<i>Who killed Dracula?</i>

1817
01:47:46,438 --> 01:47:50,003
<i>But he found a taste</i>

1818
01:47:50,004 --> 01:47:53,004
<i>A taste for love</i>

1819
01:47:53,005 --> 01:47:55,743
<i>My life is a lie</i>

1820
01:47:55,744 --> 01:48:01,484
<i>Sweet Dracula
I miss my young dead prince</i>

1821
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:05,746
<i>I'll never see him again</i>

1822
01:48:05,747 --> 01:48:08,225
<i>Until my death</i>

1823
01:48:08,226 --> 01:48:11,574
<i>What a wonderful dream</i>

1824
01:48:11,575 --> 01:48:17,227
<i>To find a taste for love</i>

1825
01:48:17,228 --> 01:48:24,578
<i>A taste for love</i>

1826
01:48:52,456 --> 01:48:57,413
Wow. You came.
I can't believe that you came.

1827
01:48:57,588 --> 01:48:59,543
Peter, this is great.

1828
01:48:59,544 --> 01:49:02,762
- It was really funny. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1829
01:49:02,763 --> 01:49:04,457
You know what?
I didn't realise that it was a comedy,

1830
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:10,025
and then someone told me that, and
it just, like, opened the whole thing up.

1831
01:49:11,113 --> 01:49:14,548
- How long are you in town for?
- Open-ended.

1832
01:49:14,549 --> 01:49:15,722
- Bold.
- Yeah.

1833
01:49:15,723 --> 01:49:17,767
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
checking out some schools.

1834
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:23,376
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, maybe.

1835
01:49:25,595 --> 01:49:28,291
You never called.

1836
01:49:28,552 --> 01:49:32,858
You told me not to. And I listened.

1837
01:49:33,032 --> 01:49:35,293
- Right.
- Wasn't easy.

1838
01:49:35,294 --> 01:49:37,815
I might have called once and hung up.

1839
01:49:37,816 --> 01:49:41,163
- No. No.
- From a private number.

1840
01:49:41,164 --> 01:49:43,034
No.

1841
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:44,164
Maybe.

1842
01:49:44,165 --> 01:49:46,556
Peter!
Nice job, Bretter.

1843
01:49:46,557 --> 01:49:47,818
Well, you should probably go back.

1844
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:50,036
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

1845
01:49:50,037 --> 01:49:52,514
- Maybe we could go to dinner or...
- Yeah.

1846
01:49:52,515 --> 01:49:54,906
- Still have my number?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

1847
01:49:54,907 --> 01:49:57,647
- Go.
- Yeah, I should do that.

1848
01:49:57,648 --> 01:50:00,517
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

1849
01:50:03,692 --> 01:50:04,909
Hey, Peter!
Hey, Bretter!

1850
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:06,692
Come over here and meet my mom!

1851
01:50:06,693 --> 01:50:09,389
- Go, go.
- Off I go.

1852
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:11,172
- Hey, Peter.
- Nice job, Bretter.

1853
01:50:11,173 --> 01:50:13,173
The play was sick, man. Good work.

1854
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:15,477
- Nice job.
- Good job, man. That was awesome.

1855
01:50:15,478 --> 01:50:16,608
So cool!

1856
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:18,696
Peter, congratulations.

1857
01:50:18,697 --> 01:50:22,218
I just wanted to say thank you.
I had such a great time tonight.

1858
01:50:22,219 --> 01:50:24,741
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change out of this unitard,

1859
01:50:24,742 --> 01:50:26,611
- 'cause I'm getting a chafe. Okay.
- Enough said.

1860
01:50:26,612 --> 01:50:29,700
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1861
01:50:54,664 --> 01:50:56,794
Hey, Peter?

1862
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:03,578
I was just calling you.

1863
01:51:07,928 --> 01:51:10,927
- Wow.
- Oh, Peter.

1864
01:51:10,928 --> 01:51:14,842
- I'm sorry.
- Stop laughing.

1865
01:51:15,016 --> 01:51:18,190
Can you please stop laughing?

1866
01:51:19,366 --> 01:51:21,844
I missed you.

1867
01:51:21,888 --> 01:51:23,017
I just...

1868
01:51:23,018 --> 01:51:28,628
You know, I actually wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking so much about...

1869
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:22,251
<i>This fall, Sarah Marshall is back
in a brand-new role.</i>

1870
01:52:22,252 --> 01:52:26,122
Your wife had no enemies
that you're aware of.

1871
01:52:26,123 --> 01:52:28,818
<i>Get ready for the most daring show
on television.</i>

1872
01:52:28,819 --> 01:52:32,254
- Just came home, and she was lying there.
- Right.

1873
01:52:32,255 --> 01:52:36,517
<i>In a world
where you don't know who to trust.</i>

1874
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,952
Charlie, who's Franco Marconi?

1875
01:52:41,953 --> 01:52:45,170
- No. No.
- Gun, gun, gun, gun. Drop it, drop it.

1876
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:47,389
<i>Go with your animal instincts.</i>

1877
01:52:51,565 --> 01:52:55,869
- How did you know?
- She's an animal psychic.

1878
01:52:55,913 --> 01:53:00,001
<i>Sarah Marshall returns on Animal Instincts.</i>

1879
01:53:00,002 --> 01:53:01,349
Life's a bitch.

1880
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:04,403
And where you're going,
that's exactly what you'll be.

1
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,475
Hold on a minute.

2
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,327
-What the fuck?
-Hold on a fucking minute!

3
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,899
Yo, what the fuck?

4
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,112
Quit playing with your fucking self!
Open the door!

5
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,828
Fuck, man. Who the fuck is you, nigga?

6
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,455
Where are you going?

7
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,790
-Backstage. I'm in the battle.
-You can't.

8
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,793
-l got a stamp on my hand.
-Go around front.

9
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,588
-Man, you just seen me...
-I didn't see nothing.

10
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,758
You just fucking seen me.
I went to the bathroom.

11
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,260
-He's got a problem with me.
-Shut the fuck up.

12
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,929
He's straight, dawg.

13
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,805
-He with you?
-Yeah.

14
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,394
Okay. Cool, Future.
But your boy got an attitude problem.

15
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,482
Come on.
You're crazy, trying to fight bouncers.

16
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,985
The guy's obviously got something
against me. I go to the bathroom...

17
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,238
Rise above that bullshit.

18
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,781
Hold on, man.

19
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,825
You fucking threw up on yourself?
Come here!

20
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,914
-Hey, Rabbit.
-I know you're ready, Rabbit.

21
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,000
Where you goin'?
He hurled on his shirt.

22
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,170
-Let me see.
-Get the fuck off me, Cheddar.

23
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,423
What are you doing, man?

24
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,759
Come on, it's deal time.

25
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,638
Our clica will be on the map
after you whup some ass tonight.

26
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,391
Me and Janeane broke up.

27
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,060
-What, again?
-I left her the car.

28
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,770
Come on, Rabbit.

29
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,814
She said she's pregnant.

30
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,694
She's gonna need the car if she's pregnant.

31
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,946
I'll need a place to crash.

32
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,365
You going to stay at your mom's?

33
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,871
Can I get some fucking privacy here?

34
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,790
All right, come on.

35
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,376
My bad, man.

36
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,381
lf something's gonna happen
with this shit, it needs to happen now.

37
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,843
I feel you.
I know exactly what you're talking about.

38
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,887
All right, come on, man. How you feeling?

39
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,098
-I feel good.
-You feel good?

40
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,183
-You sure?
-I'm ready.

41
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,146
Ready, baby.
I want to see you rip that shit, all right?

42
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,234
Let these motherfuckers know, man.
It's all you, baby. Three One Third.

43
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,945
Your lyrics are shitty
like when I cop a squat

44
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,614
Who told you to fuck
with the mighty Papa Doc?

45
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,159
For stepping onstage
I should rock your knot

46
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,661
Don't get too close
or you might get shot

47
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,414
You need to call your mama
and tell her come get ya

48
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,250
If she knew him, she could bring
your midget pops with her

49
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,794
I put a hole in your head
Like a 12 gauge

50
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,756
Lookin' like Kris Kross
Jiggity jump yo' ass offstage

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm a grown man, son
I'll slaughter you

52
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,927
Make your ma wish
her fat-ass aborted you

53
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,100
A lot of hostility at the end of
the 45 seconds. Let me get the mike.

54
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,270
Open up a little bit.
Let everybody see Future.

55
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,439
How y'all feel about Shorty Mike?

56
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,484
Kind of mediocre love?

57
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,569
Just all right for Shorty Mike?

58
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,446
All right, what about Papa Doc?

59
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,536
All right, Papa, you go to the next round.

60
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,208
Next up is my man Bunny Rabbit

61
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,793
and Lil' Tic.

62
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,339
Come on, bring your asses onstage.
We ain't got all day.

63
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,303
All right, enough of the fanfare.

64
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,305
-Heads or tails?
-Heads.

65
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,935
Tails. Choose.

66
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,270
You first.

67
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,232
Lil' Tic, set it off. DJ, 45 seconds.

68
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,275
Spin that shit.

69
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,320
I'ma murder this man!

70
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,491
He's the type to lose
a fight with a dyke

71
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,786
They don't laugh 'cause you wack
It's 'cause you white with a mic

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,247
You're a laughingstock
When will this laughter stop?

73
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,125
When you and Everlast
bitch-ass get popped

74
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,502
You a wigga
that invented rhyme for money

75
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,588
Watch Lil' Tic spit kick
the Energizer Bunny

76
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,216
Rip the Rabbit head off
Toss it to Hugh Hefner

77
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,927
'Cause I don't play, boy
Tell me who's fresher

78
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,805
LT, that's right
Cock the heat and shoot ya

79
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,558
I'll punish Rabbit
or obsolete Future

80
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,144
My paws love to maul an MC

81
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,938
'Cause he's faker than a psychic
with caller ID

82
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,858
So that bullshit,
save it for storage

83
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,944
'Cause this is hip-hop
You don't belong, you're a tourist

84
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,530
Put your hockey sticks
and baseball bat away

85
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,701
This here's Detroit
16 Mile Road is thataway

86
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,955
Whoa, whoa, okay,
45 seconds, very nice.

87
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,542
You did a good job, Lil' Bitch.
I mean, Lil' Tic. My bad.

88
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,462
All right, next up is my boy Bunny Rabbit.

89
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,049
Hey, talk that shit if you want,
but I vouch for this motherfucker.

90
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,343
He's a motherfuckin' genius.

91
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,055
Hit that shit. Forty-five seconds. DJ, kick it.

92
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,976
Hey, yo.

93
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,362
Boo!

94
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,241
Where'd y'all find this nigga at?

95
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,370
Come on, Rabbit!

96
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,875
Come on, Rabbit! Come on!

97
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,418
Choke! Choke!

98
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,996
Yo, Jimmy.

99
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,957
Hold up.

100
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,968
Don't worry about it, dawg.
I'll call you tomorrow.

101
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,594
I got to go back inside.

102
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,056
Stay strong, my brother.

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,059
You'll rip 'em next time.

104
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,978
-Yep.
-Yeah. Next time.

105
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,493
Peace out, Rabbit!

106
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,717
What the fuck?

107
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,553
-Oh, shit, Rabbit.
-Oh, God.

108
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,657
You okay, baby?

109
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:08,625
Don't you think you should have called
or knocked first or something?

110
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,378
Phone's disconnected.

111
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,588
I know that, Rabbit.

112
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,509
I gotta get down
to the phone place tomorrow.

113
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,304
I've been busy, you know.

114
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,848
Rabbit, what are you doing here?

115
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,642
How about knocking?

116
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,982
Me and Janeane just broke up.

117
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,693
I'm sorry, honey.

118
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,279
I thought you had
a good thing going with her.

119
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,907
-She sleeping with someone else?
-No.

120
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,661
I got work in the morning, so...

121
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,581
You and Future still
at that Little Caesars in Warren?

122
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,293
-No. I'm at New Detroit Stamping now.
-Oh!

123
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,296
That's good. What?

124
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,717
He got fired from a pizza place.

125
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,720
-At least I got a fucking job.
-Okay, stop it.

126
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,141
Only ex-cons and welfare moms work
at that plant.

127
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,768
Baby,

128
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,646
are you staying here for a while or what?

129
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,694
Just for a couple weeks, till I can
save enough to get my own place.

130
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,238
Just like Bob Zurowsky.

131
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,907
All your friends still living at home,
aren't they?

132
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,703
What a bunch of fucking losers.

133
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,205
-Fuck you!
-What's your problem?

134
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,292
What's your problem, bitch?
Don't kick my clothes!

135
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,336
-Don't fucking judge me!
-Why don't you grow up!

136
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,338
-Stop it!
-It's him, not me!

137
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,215
I've fought guys bigger than you.

138
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,342
-Fucking punk.
-Stop it!

139
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,180
Hey, Lily.

140
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,142
Hey, baby. What are you still doing up?

141
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,186
You woke me up.

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,396
Yeah, I'm sorry, baby.

143
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,356
What'd I do?

144
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,026
-Go back to bed.
-Will you sing to me?

145
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,738
Yeah. Of course I will. Come on.

146
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,532
know this girl

147
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,868
Her name is Lily

148
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,370
And it's past her bed

149
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,373
T-I-M-E

150
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,503
She goes to sleep

151
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,214
And she can just dream

152
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,841
And not have to be

153
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,386
In a stinky trailer with me

154
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,265
So when I feel blue

155
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,185
Don't know what to do

156
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,230
I look at you

157
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,899
And I just say

158
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,405
Good night, baby. Go to sleep.

159
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,248
lf you're going to live here,
you have to get along with Greg.

160
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
He started it.

161
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,587
You can't fuck this up for me, baby.

162
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,093
-You just can't.
-Whatever.

163
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,267
No milk.

164
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,979
Can I get a ride to work in the morning?

165
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,981
Where's your car?

166
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,775
I left it for Janeane.

167
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,120
You're going to let me borrow your car?

168
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,621
Nope.

169
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,875
It's your birthday present.

170
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,669
My birthday's not for two weeks.

171
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,920
I know.

172
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,634
But you're still my little Rabbit, right?

173
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,679
I need to get to sleep.

174
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,828
Bunny! What up, doe?

175
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,873
Heard about you and Janeane.

176
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,545
-I thought you might be back home.
-This ain't my home.

177
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,339
Why you up so early?

178
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,675
Up, man? I ain't even been to bed.
I came to talk to you...

179
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,678
I don't got time to talk right now.
I'm late for work.

180
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,806
-Can you give me a ride?
-My ma's got the car.

181
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,227
Don't tell nobody
I'm living back here, man.

182
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,773
What happened last night?
I heard you got caught out.

183
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,900
People are saying fucked up shit.

184
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,401
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

185
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,946
Why are you still going to The Shelter?

186
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,824
There's nobody there but clowns
who ain't got deals and never will.

187
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,911
You need to stay at home.
You know Wink's got you.

188
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,247
-Whatever, man.
-I'm telling you, I'm on my way.

189
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,376
I'm taking you with me.
You're the franchise, baby.

190
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,169
-The franchise?
-Yeah.

191
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,713
I'm taking a fucking bus to work.

192
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,592
Look, I was just on the horn
with my man Roy Darucher.

193
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,719
-The promo guy?
-Yeah.

194
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,930
Roy's all hooked up at 98.

195
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,557
So what's he need you for?

196
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,561
What's he need me for? Talent, dawg.
You know that's my specialty.

197
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,230
I'm the one that tipped him on Big O,

198
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,566
and got that fat man out of
flipping burgers at Mickey D's.

199
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,736
Roy liked what he heard,
paid for the nigga's demo,

200
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,907
and boom, just like that,
Big O got a deal, all because of me.

201
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,743
-Roy paid for Big O's demo?
-Every penny.

202
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,580
lf they thought Big O was hot,
wait till they hear B-Rabbit.

203
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,835
I'm building an empire
and I'm taking you with me.

204
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,211
You're next.

205
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,587
-All right.
-All right.

206
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,964
I'll talk to you later.

207
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,174
-Call me later, dawg.
-Okay.

208
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,428
Up!

209
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Down!

210
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,698
Up!

211
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,783
Down!

212
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,265
-What up, Manny?
-You was late today, Smith.

213
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,059
Yeah, it wasn't my fault.
My car wouldn't start...

214
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,396
It ain't never your fault.
I don't want to hear it.

215
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,900
I guess this isn't the best timing,
but I need some extra shifts.

216
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,402
Are you shittin' me?

217
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,405
You just started working here.
Hey, Dutton.

218
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,658
-Is he shittin' me?
-What?

219
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,703
You late again and you're fired.

220
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,623
-I'm looking for John Latourno.
-I can take you.

221
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,418
I don't think so, Smith. Right this way.

222
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,044
Thank you.

223
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,114
Big wheels keep on turnin'

224
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,742
-Who the fuck is that?
-Greg Buehl.

225
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,288
That dude is practically
living with my fucking mom.

226
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,916
They met at bingo.

227
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,542
Wait.

228
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,836
Greg Buehl?

229
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,504
He went to our school, right?

230
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,094
I got to save up some money
and get the hell out of here.

231
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,138
This shit is ridiculous.

232
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,477
Well, Jimmy moved in
with his mother

233
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,190
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

234
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,445
Now I'm right back in the gutter

235
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,158
With a garbage bag
that's full of clothes

236
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Bust it.

237
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,622
You live at home in a trailer

238
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,668
What the hell you gonna do?

239
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,881
'Cause I live at home in a trailer

240
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,970
Mom, I'm coming home to you

241
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,179
Break it down.

242
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,974
My name is Jimmy,
his name's Greg Buehl

243
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,726
Me, him and you
we went to the same school

244
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,853
This ain't cool
I'm in a rage

245
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,940
He's tappin' my mom
We're almost the same age

246
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,858
On the microphone,
I drop bombs

247
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,486
Look at this car!
Thanks a lot, Mom

248
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,072
"Here, happy birthday, Rabbit

249
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,741
"Here's a brand new car,
you can have it!"

250
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,286
A 1928 Delta

251
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,746
This shit won't even get me
to The Shelter

252
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,040
And I can't even say I'm from Motown

253
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,418
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now

254
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,587
'Cause I live at home in a trailer

255
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,800
Mom, I'm coming home to you

256
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,469
You know there's another battle next week?

257
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,888
I don't want to hear shit about it.
I'm signing you up.

258
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,933
-Man, don't.
-Come on, man. You got to battle!

259
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,102
Future, I'm not you, dawg.

260
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,937
-Look at me.
-Listen.

261
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,482
Once they hear you,
it won't matter what color you are.

262
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,318
You win some battles,

263
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,195
Three One Third will have
the street credit we need.

264
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,989
With you and me as the anchors.

265
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,909
Did you hear that Wink
has been talking to that promo guy?

266
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,372
Yeah, I heard that bullshit.
Wink is scandalous, dawg.

267
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,582
Could be a shot.

268
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,085
You know I'm trying to get straight
with the Lord,

269
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,839
so I don't like bringing too much
negative into my positive world,

270
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,885
but Wink is just talking shit.
There'll be no action, just talk.

271
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,805
Sweet home Alabama

272
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,518
Got a cigarette?

273
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,446
-The dude mentally ill?
-Car accident, man.

274
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,326
He's supposed to get some big
settlement check soon or some shit.

275
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,870
Will you hurry up with that thing?

276
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,831
Try it now.

277
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,961
Give it some gas.

278
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,472
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
We're going out tonight.

279
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,017
-Tonight?
-Yeah...

280
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,188
Fuck last night. Okay? Forget it.

281
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,276
What about being straight with the Lord?

282
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,447
Come on man, it's Saturday.
I can get straight with him on Sunday.

283
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,828
Hey, B, I got these new beats, man.

284
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,374
You know how much I like your mom...

285
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,627
Shit, I really, really like
your mama, Rabbit.

286
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,797
But she did you no favor
when she left you this car.

287
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,549
Fuck you. Get out and walk.

288
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,676
Hey, man, at least the radio plays.

289
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,513
What's up with this whole
East Coast/West Coast thing?

290
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,392
-We got to put Mo on the map.
-Yeah. Talking about the 313.

291
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,729
Man, nobody even knows Detroit is the 313.

292
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,398
313!

293
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,817
You're from 810, fathead.

294
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,904
We gotta make our own sound.
Fuck everybody else.

295
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,159
Yeah, then we get a deal,
go platinum, get cheesed out,

296
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,995
and get all the bitches!

297
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,455
All the hoes.

298
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,083
Do you think I have a big head?

299
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,012
Why'd you bring
that damn thing, man?

300
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,222
Oh, man!

301
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,766
Shoot it.

302
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,520
Pinkeye, bitch!

303
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,189
Let me see.

304
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,066
Let me show you motherfuckers
how to shoot something.

305
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,526
Do it, do it.

306
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,907
Okay. Here we go. Here it is, here it is.

307
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,246
Take the wheel, man.

308
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,956
-The gas, too.
-l got the gas.

309
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,668
Hey, Rabbit, get back in the car, man.

310
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,963
Hit the bus! Hit the bus!

311
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,972
Man, give me my fucking gun.

312
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,934
What the fuck is wrong with you?

313
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,605
Oh, shit.

314
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,774
Fuck!

315
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,611
-Toss the weed, Cheddar!
-Toss the fucking weed!

316
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,950
-What the fuck are you doing?
-The fucking car just died.

317
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,743
Oh, come on, man.

318
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,704
I told you stupid-ass niggas
not to be doing this shit.

319
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,015
That rifle ain't mine.
I don't want to go to jail.

320
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,475
Shut the fuck up!

321
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,478
I'm fucking serious. I get claustrophobic.

322
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,740
-You were scared!
-You were scared!

323
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,993
No, you were scared, motherfucker!

324
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,414
Do you know how many abandoned
buildings we have in Detroit?

325
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,499
How can you have pride
in your neighborhood

326
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,585
with shit like that next door?

327
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,336
Does the city tear them down?

328
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,590
They're too busy building casinos
and taking money from people.

329
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,926
Shut your preaching ass up.
Nobody care about that shit.

330
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,345
Did you care
when the crackhead raped that girl?

331
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,181
You think it would've happened
without an abandoned house?

332
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,684
-They caught him, didn't they?
-Yeah.

333
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,728
Dumb motherfucker went back to the house.

334
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,521
How stupid could a nigga be.

335
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,026
-What's happening under that hood?
-It's a just a short. Chill out.

336
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,613
I ain't getting back in that piece of shit.
It's a death-trap.

337
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,740
I think Jimmy's mom's trying to kill him.

338
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,951
Yeah, she's so goddamn fine,
she could kill me.

339
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,622
Don't be saying shit
about my mom or my fucking car, man.

340
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,582
I hear everything.

341
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,376
He a ninja now.

342
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,089
-B-Rabbit!
-Okay, it's about time.

343
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,967
Money under the hood
Money on the mic

344
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,761
Freaky girls, here we come

345
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,554
Yo, let me get a light, DJ.

346
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,168
Oh, shit.
What the fuck's going on out here?

347
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,553
-What's up, man? You all right?
-I'm cool.

348
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,305
-You sure?
-Yeah.

349
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,557
You the man, Rabbit.

350
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,521
My voice spits the fiery reign

351
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,647
Try and refrain

352
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,817
Come on, baby, it's redemption time.
Come on, man.

353
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,236
I be the nigga in The Shelter
Eyein' your chain

354
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,822
313 area
Bomb and bury you with vengeance

355
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,325
My rhyme sentences will end
your resistance with a rigorousness

356
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,994
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious
'Cause a curious

357
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,287
Pause the fury 'cause

358
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,998
Throw my jaws
from devouring y'all raw

359
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,378
Three One Third, we in the house.
Mac Mitten's finest.

360
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,256
DJ Iz, let me get that beat, baby.
Give me that beat.

361
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,383
Hip-Hop Shop, baby. Come on.

362
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,596
You forced to listen to
the individual, the metaphysical

363
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,516
The Mac Mitten rhyme ritual
Heterosexual

364
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,310
Syllables sound complex to you
Lines perplexing you

365
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,313
With words that put a hex on you
Snap that neck on you

366
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,150
Murder you, boil you
We keep a white boy or two

367
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,319
Let my man grab the mic
See how Bunny Rabbit do

368
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,863
Come on, man.

369
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,824
Come on, man.
Kick that shit, baby. Come on.

370
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,243
Come on.

371
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,372
Watch that nigga kick this shit.

372
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,792
Speed it up a little bit, Iz.

373
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,587
Come on, baby.

374
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,549
All right, look. Yo. Yo.

375
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,929
Your style's generic
Mine's authentic made

376
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,640
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid

377
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,518
My technique's bizarre and ill
I scar and kill

378
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,354
You were a star until
I served you like a bar and grill

379
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,441
As I cook and grill ya
That's all it took to kill ya

380
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,194
You better recognize me
like I look familiar

381
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,029
Want to battle?
You beat around the bush

382
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,157
Like you're scared to lick pussy
so you eat around the tush

383
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,076
I need a clown to push
Someone I can bully

384
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,746
Wait, I don't think
you understand fully

385
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,457
Me without style
Is like mustard without Heinz

386
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,210
I lead the new school
You're a Busta without the Rhymes

387
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,669
I'll crush the shit out your lines

388
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm the Da Sheki
Smokin' da leaky leaky

389
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,217
Ten freaky girls
inside the Chin Tiki

390
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,719
Girl, when you see me,
You better believe me

391
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,222
This ain't a game
And pimpin' ain't easy

392
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,933
Anything goes when it comes to hoes

393
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,560
I'm the kingpin
when it comes to flows

394
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,146
You better ask someone
if you don't know

395
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,774
When you see me, girl
say "What up, Doe?"

396
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,609
Ten freaky girls

397
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,861
Ten, ten, ten freaky girls

398
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,242
Shit. Look, man.

399
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,248
Listen up now.

400
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,708
Leadaz Of Tha Free World
in the motherfuckin' house.

401
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,670
Me and Papa Doc
will battle any motherfuckers here.

402
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,589
-Yeah.
-Told you they were talkin' shit.

403
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,925
-Fuck Tha Free World.
-Yeah.

404
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,802
Fuck Tha Free World!

405
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,304
Fuck Tha Free World?

406
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,432
You Three One Third bitches is wack.

407
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,934
Yo, fat-ass!

408
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,310
Talking about your man Sol

409
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,397
I kick you in the chest
Pork chops fall out your asshole

410
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,567
You cats is pussy
Soft like wet flowers

411
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,611
Leadaz Of Tha Free World
Here to smash you cowards

412
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,488
-Look at Future...
-Don't start, nigga.

413
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,615
What are you going to do, faggot?

414
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,618
-Who you calling a faggot?
-Don't play yourself, bitch.

415
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,247
Hold on. Yo, Elvis.
You don't want to step to this.

416
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,792
You need to take that white ass rap
back across 8 Mile.

417
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,628
Caught your choke act
at The Shelter last night.

418
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,259
Oh, shit!

419
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,435
What are you doing?
Put the shit down.

420
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,062
-Come on.
-Pull out!

421
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,190
Be cool. Chill, chill. Come on.

422
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,027
Yo, Iz, it's cool. It's cool.

423
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,653
Yo, come on, man. Let's go.

424
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,032
Come on. I should fuck you up, Cheddar.

425
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,540
What the fuck were you thinking?
"Fuck Tha Free World?"

426
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,666
Future said it!

427
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,464
It's at the Hip-Hop Shop.
Leadaz Of Tha Free World.

428
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,093
Hip-Hop Shop, Wednesday night.
Come on down.

429
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,184
It'll be your only opportunity
to blow both of us.

430
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,188
After we go platinum,
you won't be able to get to me and Future.

431
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,192
Why do they call you Future?

432
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,236
I had a lot of names,
the most conceited kind.

433
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:33,659
I was Maximum, Brimstone,
Godfather D, Devastatin' D.

434
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,411
Big D, that has a double meaning.

435
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,289
But none of them worked,

436
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,875
till I started hosting the battles
at The Shelter.

437
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:48,131
One day somebody said, "You know what?
You are the future of hip-hop in Detroit."

438
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,342
So you see, baby,

439
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,971
sometimes you got to find your name
and other times,

440
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,889
your name finds you.

441
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,309
Want to smoke some ganja?

442
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,313
That's our problem.
If we don't respect our sisters, who will?

443
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,316
We're doing it to ourselves.

444
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,444
He's my brother. He don't like pussy.

445
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,951
Rabbit, teach me to write rhymes.
That's how to get the ladies, right?

446
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,578
Let me out.

447
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,789
Hold on. Yo, I'm sorry, dawg.

448
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,043
I didn't know Papa and LC were
on their bullshit until tonight.

449
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,130
I wouldn't be with them,

450
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,757
except I'm promoting a show
with them at Hip-Hop Shop.

451
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,801
Those Free World bitches?

452
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,058
See what I'm talking about?

453
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,937
Look, they're just one of the acts.

454
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,189
lf you want, I'll step out.

455
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,358
You're my friend. I don't want you mad.

456
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,068
Man, do what you want to do.

457
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,903
Yeah, do what you want to do.

458
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,367
Respect yourself, sister.

459
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,956
God damn. Don't you ever shut up?

460
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,877
Why you got to push me?

461
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,503
Damn, Future.

462
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,881
What the hell is his problem?

463
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,466
-Future?
-Yeah.

464
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,843
He thinks sometimes you talk shit.

465
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,472
Who's he to say what's real?
'Cause he hosts the battles?

466
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,474
Ain't that Janeane?

467
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,689
I thought she was pregnant.

468
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,024
Pregnant?

469
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,111
I'm out. I'll be outside.

470
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,324
By myself.

471
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,220
Here's your chance, girl. Go ahead.

472
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,938
You're Jimmy Smith, Jr.

473
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,691
My name's Alex.

474
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,320
You find the guy you was looking for?

475
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,489
-What guy?
-At the plant.

476
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,784
That was my brother. I was borrowing a car.

477
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,456
I hear you're a real dope rapper.

478
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,416
-A "dope" rapper?
-Yeah.

479
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,377
Who told you that?

480
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,546
You know, it's around.

481
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,799
lf you're so dope,
why are you at Dead End Stamping?

482
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,553
-Your brother works there.
-My brother's a loser.

483
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,638
And you?

484
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,100
I work at Intermezzo,
saving enough to get out of here.

485
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,894
Bussin' dishes is much better
than pressing bumpers.

486
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,896
I won't be there long.

487
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,232
-Where are you going?
-New York.

488
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,734
I won a modeling contest.

489
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,655
A judge said he'd help me out.
I just have to get a book together.

490
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,782
What if he ain't for real?

491
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,952
All I'm looking for is a ticket.

492
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,665
Rabbit! You and your friend want
to bounce to an after-hours spot?

493
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,750
"Rabbit."

494
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,211
Let me ask my friends.

495
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,890
Where are we going?

496
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,474
My house.

497
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,811
-What about your mom?
-Working nights.

498
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,355
That's the after-hours spot?

499
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,732
Heck, yeah.

500
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,818
Can some of us ride with you?

501
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,286
-Why do they call you Rabbit?
-He's fast and likes to fuck a lot.

502
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,790
Get your hand off my balls!

503
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,084
Why are you being so ignorant?

504
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,252
Jimmy!

505
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,801
-What's wrong with you?
-My bad, you guys.

506
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,261
Are you signed?

507
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,473
Not yet, but I'm working on
something for him.

508
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,309
He'll record a demo at MCA.

509
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,479
-Really?
-Yeah, but I was...

510
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,441
lf you want to see Jimmy flow,
come to the battle at The Shelter.

511
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,777
He's the best!

512
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,487
Shut up.

513
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,322
-When is it?
-Friday night.

514
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,490
Yeah?

515
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,492
Can I come?

516
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,703
I'm not battling next Friday, dawg.

517
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,997
You will if she's there.

518
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,541
You want to be the man.

519
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,835
All right. Just don't push.

520
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,380
We all need to be pushed sometimes.

521
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,549
My bad. I'm sorry.

522
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,844
You gonna let him push you?

523
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,430
You can't catch me
and you never will!

524
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,641
Out of my way, freaky girl!

525
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,143
Wipe your feet. Hey, wipe your feet!

526
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,946
You like?

527
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,157
She's getting out of the D, though.

528
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,952
Negro, please. That's what they all say.

529
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,038
No, I think she's different.

530
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,544
That chick really blew both you guys?

531
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,754
I'm a sinner, James.

532
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,590
Come to church with me in the morning.

533
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,386
Hey.

534
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,017
I saw you talking to Papa Doc
in the Chin Tiki.

535
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,563
-How do you know him?
-You mean Clarence?

536
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,899
He went to Cranbrook
with Christine's brother.

537
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,736
You want to dance?
Not right now.

538
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:49,075
Fucking Wink. Trying to keep us in division
with that fake-ass Big Willie wannabe talk.

539
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,790
-Nothing wrong with a free demo.
-Free comes with a dick up your ass.

540
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,085
Three One Third is real.
What Wink is talking about is wack.

541
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,255
Another example of people's needs
being denied by the city.

542
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,424
The media should be all over this.

543
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,719
It'll happen again. The city don't give a fuck.

544
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,096
What is he talking about?

545
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,932
The abandoned house
where the girl got raped.

546
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,185
It's called an "attractive nuisance."

547
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,814
It wouldn't still be standing if
it were on the other side of 8 Mile.

548
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,442
It could have been Lily.

549
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,579
Burn this shit down to the ground.

550
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,206
That's what I mean.

551
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,167
Fuck, yeah, man!

552
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,795
Burn this fucking thing down!

553
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,632
This is the definition
of an attractive nuisance.

554
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,303
Come on, let's burn this bitch.
Right behind you.

555
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,263
That's what I mean.

556
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,682
I thought I had matches.

557
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,142
You got my lighter?

558
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,228
-I gave it back to you.
-l got one.

559
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,438
Wait, what are you doing?

560
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,815
No!

561
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,203
What the fuck, you guys!

562
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,996
I'm gonna fuck you up, Cheddar!

563
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,317
Burn!

564
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,031
Hey! I burned the house down!

565
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,001
The roof, the roof

566
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,420
The roof is on fire

567
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,340
We don't need no water
let the motherfucker burn

568
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,051
Burn, motherfucker, burn!

569
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,053
It's almost beautiful.

570
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,100
When I was little,
I wanted to live in a house like this.

571
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,394
You know, how it used to be.

572
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,147
You live with your family?

573
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,066
I got out of there as quick as I could.

574
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,320
I left home when I was 17.

575
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,322
What about you?

576
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,075
Sort of the same.

577
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,919
When you record your demo,

578
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,339
I'd really love to be there.

579
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,513
Hey, girl! Is it hot enough for you?

580
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,684
You're going to be great.

581
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,104
I got a feeling about you.

582
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,148
Let's go, Alex.

583
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,109
I'll see you.

584
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,028
See you.

585
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,492
Cheddar, bring your ass on!
Come on!

586
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,045
WOODY WOODPECKER ON TV:
Pesky mosquito!

587
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,296
Let's see.

588
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,675
Oh, yeah. "And the mirror said,
'Not you, Queenie."'

589
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,968
Shit!

590
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,761
What's wrong?

591
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,557
We're being evicted. God damn it!

592
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,811
Come on, Mom. Not in front of Lily.

593
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,314
I can't let Greg find out.

594
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,360
Fuck Greg.

595
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,992
I'm three months late.

596
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,038
-We got 30 days to get the money.
-"We?"

597
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,041
If you want to live here,
you got to start chipping in.

598
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,336
Where's Greg's settlement check?
Get the money from him.

599
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,671
I can't.

600
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,925
He's going to ask me and Lily
to move away with him.

601
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,678
Some place nice real soon.
I can't freak him out...

602
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,389
Mom, stop living your life like this!

603
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:26,060
If you cared about Lily,
you'd get a job and quit fucking around.

604
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,022
I got to go. I'll be late for work.

605
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,739
What are you doing with your life
that's so great, Rabbit?

606
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,335
Wink's working on a deal

607
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,712
where I can get free studio time

608
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,422
to record my demo.

609
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,383
Yeah.

610
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,886
Right.

611
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,972
Bye, baby.

612
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,226
Alex Latourno
Hotter than an inferno

613
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,145
Hotter than a crack house

614
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,064
Burn internal

615
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,917
Up!

616
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,085
Down!

617
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,132
Why does Manny give me
so much shit all the time?

618
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,844
Maybe because you give him reason to.

619
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,597
Stick to the plan, man.

620
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,601
Just do your work and shut the fuck up.

621
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,438
Up!

622
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,441
Down!

623
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,287
Why haven't you called?

624
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,374
Janeane, I can't talk here.
You'll get me fired.

625
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,459
I'm your girlfriend.

626
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,296
No, you're not. We broke up.
I'll call you later.

627
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,632
You just left without saying a word.

628
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,426
I left you the car.

629
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,095
Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant?

630
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,764
I know why you said that bullshit.

631
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,975
-You have to go.
-l didn't know what else to do.

632
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,602
Tell me why you left and I'll leave you alone.

633
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:35,606
It's not you, okay? It's me.
It's my shit. I had to go.

634
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,774
Why?

635
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,068
-What are you running from?
-Nothing!

636
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,820
Would you just go!

637
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,661
Everyone's calling you a loser
from the other night.

638
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,372
-Who is?
-Everybody's talking about it.

639
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,000
How you froze up and got booed offstage.

640
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,752
Fuck you! Go home.

641
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,509
What was that all about?

642
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,845
Sorry, Manny. It wasn't my...

643
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,514
It won't happen again.

644
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,851
Good. Don't be bringing that shit
around here.

645
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,271
Now get back to work.

646
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,818
Rakim was the first rapper
with complex lyrics.

647
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,238
But as far as beats and lyrics go,
Biggie is the bomb.

648
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,868
I can't believe y'all talk about
complex shit and leave out 2Pac.

649
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,036
Fuck 2Pac!

650
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,331
Nigga, you crazy? Pac's the only
lyrical motherfucker out there!

651
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,041
He's right. His shit has emotion.

652
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,210
-What about the Beasties?
-Fuck them.

653
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,337
How can you even bring them in the mix?

654
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,464
They bust some serious shit.

655
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,467
Those white boys are
more like busters on serious shit.

656
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,968
I won't bump no Beasties.

657
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,807
But it's always easier for whites to succeed
in a black man's medium. Right, B?

658
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,810
Word up. It's true.

659
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,818
What are you doing, man?
Rabbit!

660
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,153
Oh, shit.

661
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,740
Don't worry, Rabbit.
I got your back!

662
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,664
Hey, what's up, B?

663
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,042
You want to fuck with us?

664
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,383
Get off me.

665
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,346
What the fuck you gonna do,
motherfucker?

666
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,018
Come on, man!

667
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,439
Let him go.

668
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,449
You want to fuck with us?

669
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,784
Fuck with us, yeah?

670
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,371
What the fuck are you doing?
Where'd you get that shit?

671
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,498
It's my mom's.

672
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,751
Put it away
before you fucking kill somebody!

673
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,420
Papa Doc had one!

674
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,629
Put it away!

675
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,008
Man, put it down.

676
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,134
Come on.

677
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,263
Okay.

678
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,807
Fuck, man.
Oh, shit!

679
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,434
What the fuck?

680
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,477
Oh, shit!

681
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,813
Let's get out of here.

682
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,189
Shit!

683
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,401
We got to get him to a hospital.

684
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,820
-Where are the keys?
-Get the car!

685
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,824
I got to put pressure on it.
Try not to think about it.

686
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,493
My God. He shot his fucking dick off.

687
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,954
-Did I?
-Man, shut the fuck up!

688
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,207
-Take Gratiot to McDougal.
-I live here, too.

689
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,209
-I know how to get there!
-Then do it!

690
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,378
Rabbit's going to teach me to write rhymes.

691
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,631
What were you doing with a gun?

692
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,008
What were you doing with those fuckers?

693
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,052
I have a show with them!

694
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,262
Calm the fuck down, y'all!

695
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,597
MC Bob.

696
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,974
-What?
-MC Bob.

697
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,061
-What do you mean?
-Is that a good name?

698
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,646
What's wrong with Cheddar Bob?

699
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,564
I like MC Bob. Right?

700
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,233
Yeah. MC Bob.

701
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,654
I got that fat man out of Mickey D's.

702
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,283
Roy's going to interview him
at JLB and I'll be there.

703
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,327
It's gonna be on!

704
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,664
The doctor said he hit an artery,
but he'll be okay.

705
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,457
That's good, man.

706
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,042
Where were you?

707
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,252
Praying. Is he all right?

708
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,922
Let's go, man.

709
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,175
Wink told us how he got in
with Roy Darucher.

710
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,052
That shit's hot, man.

711
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,768
He's doing an interview down at JLB.

712
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,562
Why are you listening to this clown?

713
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,689
What?

714
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,857
You heard me. Clown.

715
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,946
Why you got to be like that?

716
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,199
This is a good deal for him. It's for real.

717
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,201
It's for real?

718
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,870
Like the time you said
your cousin worked for Dr. Dre?

719
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:04,583
Or the time you were real tight
with the intern in Russell Simmons' office?

720
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,087
-Or how about...
-Shut the fuck up!

721
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,589
Why are you always giving me shit?

722
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,676
Is it because I'm making moves?

723
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,179
Or because your ass is stuck
hosting battles for two years.

724
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,472
You're a fucking loser.

725
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,100
Who are you calling...
Yo, chill!

726
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,603
What the fuck?
How can you fight about this shit now?

727
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,981
I know what you're trying to do
to our group.

728
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,441
Suck a dick!

729
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,984
You little bitch!

730
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,610
Back down!

731
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:35,281
Cheddar's in the hospital
and you fight about this?

732
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,950
So fucking stupid!

733
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,297
Forget this car, B.

734
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,010
I'll give you a ride to work
in the morning.

735
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,970
I'm afraid
you've made a mistake.

736
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,973
I don't have any colored girl in my class.

737
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,851
There's Sarah Jane. There's my baby.

738
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,686
You mean Sarah Jane Johnson?

739
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,855
Yes, ma'am. I'm Mrs. Johnson.

740
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,234
Sarah Jane?
I brought you these...

741
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,909
You win at bingo tonight?

742
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,869
No.

743
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,538
You record your demo yet?

744
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,875
What happened to you?

745
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,879
Cheddar Bob had an accident, but he's fine.
I'm fine.

746
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,257
You and your friends.

747
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,343
Mom, don't start, please.

748
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,845
It's been a long fucking night.

749
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,555
Tell me about it.

750
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,559
Me and Greg are having problems.

751
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,311
He found out about the eviction?

752
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,479
No.

753
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,608
-The settlement check ain't coming.
-No, it's coming.

754
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,694
It's our sex life.

755
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,947
I don't want to hear this shit.

756
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,449
I mean, it's good. It's real good.

757
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,535
But he won't...

758
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,161
I don't want to hear this!

759
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,871
Greg won't go down on me.

760
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,039
Mom!

761
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,725
Hey, Sol.

762
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,604
Ever wonder at what point
you got to say, "Fuck it"?

763
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:36,443
When you got to stop living up here
and start living down here?

764
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,740
It's 7:30 in the morning, dawg.

765
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,500
-Thank your mom for the car.
-All right.

766
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,601
I'm getting so sick and tired
of fucking with this steel

767
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,937
They only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill

768
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,815
My body aching
just to get a buck

769
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,152
I'm sick of eating shit
off this fucking lunch truck

770
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,447
Nasty-ass food
I'm in a nasty-ass mood

771
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,241
Should have called in sick
Shit, I had somethin' to do!

772
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,369
I can't believe I'm hearin'
all this ravin' and rantin'

773
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,664
From Vanessa up here
at New Detroit Stampin'

774
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,959
Need to get your food
and take your ass back to work

775
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,046
You're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps'll work

776
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,799
Look at y'all standin' here
freezing like dumb-fucks

777
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,594
Rappin' and waitin' for food
off this raggedy lunch truck

778
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,971
Who want what?
Who pumped up to get rolled up?

779
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,974
I spit venom in every direction
Soak some up

780
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,770
Look at this fat-ass nigga
Sloppy sucka

781
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,315
You a ugly motherfucker
Your pops should've wore a rubber

782
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,859
Stop rhyming
Keep your day job, Vanessa

783
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,487
Next time leave that bullshit
home on the dresser

784
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,990
Speakin' of dresses
Take a look at Paul the fruitcake

785
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,327
When you travel
you pack panties in your suitcase

786
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,663
Made out of lace
from Victoria's Secret

787
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,374
If 10 men came in a cup,
you'd probably drink it

788
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,006
Okay, folks
Enough with the gay jokes

789
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,092
Especially from a gay,
broke bitch yourself

790
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,010
Eh, loc?

791
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,428
His style's doo-doo

792
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:30,057
You've worked here longer than me
and I get paid more than you do

793
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,517
Dawg, take a seat

794
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,520
Why's this guy standing in line?
He ain't got money to eat

795
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,523
Check this out
Yo, yo

796
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,318
He cashed his whole check
And bought one Ho Ho

797
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,363
Fucking homo, little maggot
You can't hack it

798
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,365
Paul's gay
You're a faggot

799
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,492
Least he admits it,
don't even risk it

800
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,370
This guy's starving to death
Someone get him a biscuit

801
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,707
I don't know
what they told you, Mike

802
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,126
You musta had them cornrows
rolled too tight

803
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,712
This job
You want to quit, but you can't

804
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,464
You've worked at this plant so long
You're a plant!

805
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,551
Look at your god damn boots

806
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,678
For Christ sakes
They're starting to grow roots!

807
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,181
On this mic, you get faded

808
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,601
You look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it

809
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,895
Hey, why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, G?

810
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,399
When really you're the one
who's got the HIV

811
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,901
Man, I'm done with this clown
He's soft

812
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,696
Fuck it
I'll let homegirl finish you off

813
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,160
A guy like you would never
get a real woman

814
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,038
Jackass, go jack off
That's the only way you comin'

815
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,707
Looking for your brother?

816
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,916
I was.

817
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,590
You want to do something tonight?

818
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,843
Are you asking me out on a date,
Jimmy Smith, Jr.?

819
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,388
As a matter of fact, I am.

820
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,975
Why don't you take me somewhere now?

821
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,605
Come on.

822
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,863
Where are we going?

823
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,476
You were so good outside.

824
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,479
In line at the lunch truck?

825
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,440
And at the Chin Tiki the other night.

826
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,776
And that demo thing with Wink.

827
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,779
You're going to get a deal soon.

828
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,864
I feel it.

829
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,952
You was in the parking lot the other night?

830
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,287
My friends think you're crazy.

831
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,706
Your friends don't even know me!

832
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,966
Ain't nobody here.

833
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,884
I can't believe
he got sent home already.

834
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,304
No insurance,
the medical establishment will fuck you.

835
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,348
Where else would he be?

836
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,308
Just thank God he's alive.

837
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,645
No, thank God he didn't shoot his dick off.

838
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,439
That's why brothers need to get a deal.

839
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,484
Record labels supply niggas with benefits.

840
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,988
Dawg, we get a deal,
you can take the fucking benefits.

841
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,408
We'll have Bentleys and Benjamins,
not Blue Cross.

842
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,535
I don't give a fuck about that.

843
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,954
I just want to hear Three One Third
on the box.

844
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,622
One of them songs on JLB.

845
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:50,586
We need to save, put it into savings bonds,
and build our own studio.

846
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,463
-Savings bonds?
-Let me ask you something.

847
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,090
How are we brothers?

848
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,719
We need fine bitches and phat rides,
not savings bonds.

849
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,887
All we ever do is talk shit!

850
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,016
"We need fine bitches and phat rides."

851
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,351
"We need to invest in savings bonds."

852
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,895
"We need to get our songs on JLB."

853
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,398
Shut the fuck up! And we never do shit.

854
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:14,651
We're still broke
and live at home with our moms.

855
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,780
I'm out of here. Catch you later.

856
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,366
Get your mad, rambling ass in the car.

857
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,620
I hope you get a new ride soon, Rabbit.

858
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,039
Maybe for that birthday tripping ass.

859
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,709
I'll call your mama.
See what I can work out.

860
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,503
I got shotgun, Shabba.

861
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,966
Get in the back, Farrakhan.

862
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,383
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

863
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,260
I seen you out the window, Bob.

864
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,889
I didn't feel like talking.

865
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,891
Why not?

866
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,064
I didn't want them making fun of me.

867
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,525
You know what I'm saying, Rabbit?

868
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,402
Yeah.

869
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,862
You do?

870
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,031
MC Bob.

871
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,765
Like you see in magazines.

872
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,309
What up?

873
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,770
Hey, Rabbit. Where have you been?

874
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,106
You call him Rabbit, too?

875
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,525
I gave him that nickname.

876
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,695
-Stop it.
-I did, when he was little.

877
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:25,282
He had buckteeth and big ears.

878
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,367
He was so cute.

879
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,830
Like a little rabbit. Right, baby?

880
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,274
I got good news.

881
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,777
You brought her to my mom's?
What the fuck?

882
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,863
I invited her to my show.
She said we had to come get you.

883
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,115
What was I supposed to do?

884
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,868
I've been helping Al
find a photographer for her book.

885
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,121
All she keeps saying
is how much she likes you.

886
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:17,167
Damn! Now check this, dawg.

887
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,338
I heard from my man Roy today
that he's gonna be at JLB tomorrow night

888
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,964
for the interview with Big O.

889
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,716
-So what?
-So what?

890
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,678
I told him about your skills!
I said, "Rabbit's your man."

891
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,973
He said, "Bring him down.
Let me see what he can do."

892
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,894
If it goes well, you could be
flowing at 54 Sound next week.

893
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,732
Can you get your shit together in time?

894
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,237
I can do it.

895
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,908
-My bad, man.
-No problem, dawg.

896
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,661
Big time, Jimmy.

897
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,622
Why'd you take off?

898
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,666
I don't really live here.

899
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,085
So? Why'd you take off?

900
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,254
I just...

901
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,721
Don't be embarrassed about where you live.

902
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,431
I don't live here.

903
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,686
What's up with you and Wink?

904
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,397
He's helping me get my book together.

905
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,316
Using his connections.

906
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,694
Same way he's helping you out.

907
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,364
So...

908
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,535
You have to stay home tonight?

909
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,165
Yeah, I should

910
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,293
work on some songs for my demo.

911
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,211
Okay.

912
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,431
Your mom's getting evicted.

913
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,394
It says right here.

914
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:28,066
"Tenant must vacate the premises
due to non-payment of rent."

915
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,318
You know about this?

916
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,736
Morning.

917
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,156
Sweetie, you want cereal?

918
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:39,744
I was talking to your precious son
about this eviction situation.

919
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,665
Did you plan on informing me?

920
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,750
Honey, that's a mistake.

921
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,128
-You're a fucking liar.
-Hey, man!

922
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,505
Stay out of this, Rabbit.

923
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:53,425
-Don't worry. I'm taking care of it.
-Don't.

924
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,430
Fuck, man! What is your problem?
Don't touch my mother!

925
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,098
Stay out of it!

926
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:06,021
I'm out of here.
I can't go out with someone like you.

927
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,148
You gonna let him say that to you?

928
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,108
With two homeless kids.

929
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,776
Motherfucker!

930
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,905
Rabbit!

931
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,534
Jimmy! Please!

932
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,705
Stop it!

933
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,874
Stop!

934
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,000
Fuck you!

935
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,463
Rabbit, stop!

936
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,382
-Fuck you!
-Stop it!

937
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,900
Oh, my God. Lily.

938
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,736
Come here, baby.

939
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,281
It's okay.

940
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,576
Come here, baby.

941
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,498
It's okay.

942
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,842
It's over, baby.

943
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,530
What up, dawg?

944
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,242
Alex just called.

945
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:46,704
I got a friend to take pictures
of her when she gets off work.

946
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:50,375
She needs a ride, that's why she called.
Can you drive?

947
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,710
I'll drive.
The others will be here soon.

948
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:57,382
Sol's mom's dropping them off.
I hear you're battling tomorrow.

949
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,050
I'm doing what?

950
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,220
Someone told me Future signed you up
at The Shelter.

951
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,429
Who told you that?

952
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,191
What up?

953
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,402
Wipe your feet.

954
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,029
Nobody's wiping their feet
for your junky basement.

955
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,865
Where your mama at?

956
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,449
Working.

957
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,701
Dear mama!

958
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,412
Tell her to hang this shit upstairs.

959
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,456
Did you sign me up to battle
tomorrow night?

960
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:34,252
You heard me.
Don't play fucking stupid. Did you?

961
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:40,425
Papa Doc won last week,
so he'll be defending his title.

962
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:44,470
You got to take it from him!
You win battles, you get respect.

963
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,805
I don't give a fuck!

964
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,224
I'm sick of you thinking
you know what's best!

965
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,768
You ain't my fucking father!
I'm a grown man.

966
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,812
-Look, Jimmy...
-"Look, Jimmy" nothing!

967
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,148
Fuck you! I told you not to sign me up!

968
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,150
So you want to fight me now?

969
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:01,112
You ain't the future of shit.
You're just David fucking Porter.

970
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,115
Hey, come on, fellas.

971
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,954
You know what?

972
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,999
Do what the fuck you want to do.

973
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,586
I don't give a shit anymore.

974
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,966
I really fucking don't!

975
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,315
You coming to JLB tonight?

976
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,317
I don't know, man.

977
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,744
I look like crap.

978
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,499
If I knew it was today, I wouldn't
have gone drinking after the show.

979
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,335
I can reschedule.
No, I'll do it.

980
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,837
-You will?
-I'll always do it.

981
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,632
When will we see your pictorial
in a magazine?

982
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,510
Pictorial's in Playboy.
In fashion, it's editorial.

983
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,553
Shut up, Frederick Douglass.

984
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,348
It's for her book, so she can get a job.

985
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,517
That's one book I'd definitely read.

986
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:13,893
It'd be the only one.

987
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:31,202
-Don't forget this.
-Thanks, guys.

988
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,542
Want me to come up?

989
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,419
That's okay.

990
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,775
Mom.

991
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,613
Mom, come on, get up.

992
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,285
Come on.

993
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:19,625
Greg left me.

994
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,254
Damn!

995
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,298
Get up.

996
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,966
It's okay, Lily.

997
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,593
It's okay, honey.

998
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,476
His settlement check came in.

999
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,644
His settlement check came in.

1000
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,607
And now that he's got money,

1001
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:45,485
he can't be with somebody like me anymore.

1002
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,699
It's Thursday. I got to go to bingo.

1003
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,576
Maybe he'll be there.

1004
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:57,288
You ain't going nowhere.
You're better off without him.

1005
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,624
Stop it! It's your fault he left me!

1006
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,086
You ruined it! You fucked it all up for me!

1007
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:08,007
Who's gonna want me now?

1008
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:12,136
Where are we gonna live?
We don't have any money!

1009
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:15,473
We don't have anything!
What am I gonna do?

1010
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,892
What am I gonna do?

1011
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:21,187
What are you gonna do?
Lily's out there by herself!

1012
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,273
Why do you have to be like this?
What'd we ever do to you?

1013
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:28,111
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of my house!

1014
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,322
Get the fuck out of my house!

1015
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,536
Come on, baby. Put your coat on.

1016
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,541
We're going next door, okay?

1017
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,709
We're getting out of here.

1018
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:18,119
-What floor is JLB on?
-Twenty-eighth.

1019
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,204
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1020
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,582
When we look at Big O,
what are we looking at?

1021
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,877
I'm giving you poverty, slums.
That's where I'm from.

1022
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,004
So I put it all in the music.

1023
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,381
-I'm looking for Wink Harris.
-Who?

1024
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,300
He should be here with Roy Darucher.

1025
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,552
I think they're all in Studio B.

1026
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,678
Thank you.

1027
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,056
I did anything I could for free,
just for the exposure.

1028
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:44,228
No doubt. Big O, big ups
and congratulations, playboy player.

1029
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,815
You finally got your record on the radio.
How do you feel?

1030
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,068
Much love, man.
I want to thank you and WJLB

1031
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,571
for looking out for me like that.
That was much love.

1032
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:57,992
I'm just trying to put Detroit,
the East Side, on the map, you know?

1033
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,160
We're gonna do it for real, man.

1034
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:04,332
I hope we'll get a pipeline through here,
and the industry will look at us and sign us.

1035
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,750
We'll all be eating.

1036
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,547
Stop it!

1037
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,928
I've seen you flippin' burgers!

1038
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,471
Yeah, I did that.

1039
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,474
I thought I recognized your face.
I know you been...

1040
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:26,646
Stop it! Please, Jimmy, stop!

1041
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,984
-How long you been in the game?
-Roughly 15 years.

1042
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,452
It's an honor for me to come on
and have you do this for me.

1043
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,996
-I really appreciate it.
-No problem.

1044
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,873
We're here to represent the D,

1045
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,376
take care of our artists
and take care of home.

1046
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:52,672
I hope you have a successful career
'cause I know you're puttin' it down.

1047
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:55,383
You represent real hard for the 313.

1048
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,385
I'm doing it for y'all, man.

1049
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,637
This is for Detroit, 313, baby! Love!

1050
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,020
-Thank you, Mrs. Helgeland.
-Any time.

1051
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,730
Have a good night.

1052
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,985
-You have fun?
-Mmm-hmm.

1053
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,111
Yeah, I know.

1054
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,876
I want you to go inside
and lock the door, okay?

1055
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:12,960
Listen to me.

1056
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,130
Go in, lock the door
and I'll be in in a minute.

1057
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,716
-Okay.
-Okay, go.

1058
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,388
Go!

1059
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,518
What up, bitch?

1060
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:33,397
Ready to get knocked out, dawg?

1061
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,901
Wink said you lived in a trailer
with your mom.

1062
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,072
But we didn't believe him.

1063
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,117
Come on, Elvis. Get up.

1064
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,662
Get up, bitch.

1065
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,416
Get your faggot ass up and fight!

1066
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:01,676
What? What the fuck you looking at?

1067
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:12,978
Jimmy!

1068
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,118
Get the fuck up.

1069
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:31,122
Stop it!

1070
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,207
Fight me, you punk-ass bitch!

1071
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:48,347
I could end your shit right now
and nobody would even miss your ass.

1072
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,309
No, no. Don't do this.

1073
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:54,478
Come on.

1074
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:56,313
He's done.

1075
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,405
Free World, motherfucker.

1076
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:13,998
Don't forget to come
to The Shelter tomorrow night.

1077
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,835
You little faggot.
I mean, little Rabbit.

1078
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,324
Jesus.

1079
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,744
-What happened to you?
-I fell.

1080
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,371
You fell?

1081
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,291
I fell.

1082
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,755
Come on in. I'll make you something to eat.

1083
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:03,964
What?

1084
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,467
I'm your mother.

1085
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,137
I want to make you something to eat.
What's the big deal?

1086
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,155
I thought you wanted me out.

1087
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,617
You want the fucking pancakes?

1088
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,580
What's gotten into you?

1089
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,208
-We're not getting evicted.
-Why not?

1090
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,585
I went to bingo.

1091
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,630
And I won!

1092
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,593
$3,200!

1093
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,180
-You're kidding me.
-Nope!

1094
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,725
Our luck's finally changing around here.

1095
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,482
Did you mean it
about doing the demo with Wink?

1096
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,239
No.

1097
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,076
I'm gonna do it on my own.

1098
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:22,501
You know, Rabbit,
I think that's the best way.

1099
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,320
Hey, Smith!

1100
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,032
Hey, Smith!

1101
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,168
Are you all right?

1102
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,170
I fell down some steps.

1103
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:10,841
You been doing much better here.

1104
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,843
Still want the extra shifts?

1105
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,011
Yeah.

1106
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:18,223
You got them. I need you to work tonight.
I'm a man short.

1107
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:19,558
Tonight?

1108
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,977
-Is that a problem?
-No problem.

1109
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,646
Good.

1110
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,440
Get back to work.

1111
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:32,821
Manny!

1112
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:36,200
Thanks.

1113
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,085
What up?

1114
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,837
Shit. Waiting on this slow-ass ride.

1115
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,341
What are you still doing here?

1116
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,927
Someone's sick, so I'm filling in.

1117
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,690
She ain't waiting on me.

1118
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:10,234
I'll be back.

1119
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:23,914
What do you want?

1120
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,418
I wanted to say goodbye.
I'm going to New York.

1121
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,254
Yeah? And...

1122
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,219
Can I give you a ride or something?

1123
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:39,096
No, I'm cool.

1124
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:41,598
I'm working overtime.

1125
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,475
Saving up for something special?

1126
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,436
Yeah, studio time.

1127
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,607
Good.

1128
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,277
Good for you.

1129
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,450
I was hoping to see you
at The Shelter tonight.

1130
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:00,993
But, if you're afraid...

1131
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,203
I ain't afraid of them guys.

1132
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,082
I didn't say you were.

1133
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:12,880
Bye.

1134
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:25,350
Paul, would you mind covering for me
for a couple hours?

1135
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,228
I can do that.

1136
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,439
Thanks, man. I owe you.

1137
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,036
It's Rabbit! Hey!

1138
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,748
Rabbit, wait up!

1139
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,587
What's up, man?

1140
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,298
What happened to you?

1141
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:58,967
-You straight? Look at your eye.
-I'm fine.

1142
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:02,721
Wink said you blew up 'cause
Roy Darucher said no to your demo.

1143
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:05,182
He also said crazy shit about him and Alex.

1144
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,601
We gonna jump those guys again?

1145
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,063
Fuck that. I'm gonna battle them.

1146
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:14,691
For real?

1147
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:16,985
Yeah.

1148
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,997
You guys coming or what?

1149
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,670
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred

1150
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,756
Cheddar cheese
There's not a better MC than me

1151
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,091
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch

1152
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:41,677
Sting like a bee,
float like a butterfly

1153
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:44,221
What am I?
So what if I cut a guy?

1154
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,390
Did I s-s-stutter, guy?

1155
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,976
Leave you punch drunk
From lunch truck to Shelter

1156
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,186
You never felt the wrath
of Helter Skelter

1157
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,690
Melt ya, got the belt
for the welterweight champ

1158
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:57,067
You got in with a fake stamp

1159
01:25:57,110 --> 01:26:00,279
Garbage bag full of clothes
Still pullin' ho's

1160
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:03,073
Rip you from head to toe
From leg to bullet hole

1161
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,908
Next gun, pull it slow

1162
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,286
Aim at Tha Free World
'fore you let it go

1163
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,330
Instead of,
"Oh, I just shot my dick head!"

1164
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,583
Yes, you do got a big head

1165
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,835
I can't call it
Cheddar, where's your wallet?

1166
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,671
You're so drunk,
you can outdrink the "Alkaholiks"

1167
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,465
Make 'em say, "Damn,
Cheddar's the man!"

1168
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,594
He needs a can
surgically removed from his hand

1169
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,516
You again?

1170
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,687
It looks like a handicap convention in here.
Crippled motherfuckers.

1171
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:35,939
Don't shoot!

1172
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,412
Yo, let's get the fuck out of here.

1173
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,135
I need to get some privacy, guys.

1174
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,139
Can I come?

1175
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,565
Hey, man,

1176
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,777
-I apologize for...
-Stop it.

1177
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,695
Don't do it.

1178
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,198
I didn't even trip.

1179
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,493
Just make sure

1180
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,913
you flip the script on this shit tonight.

1181
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,499
You understand me?

1182
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,340
Thank you.

1183
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,342
It's on tonight, Rabbit.

1184
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:51,056
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

1185
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,771
All right, all right!

1186
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,692
How y'all feeling out there?
You feeling all right?

1187
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:06,697
All right! Next up is LC, Lyckety-Splyt...

1188
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,407
Slaughter him.

1189
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:11,451
...and my man B-Rabbit.
B-Rabbit, where you at?

1190
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,662
B-Rabbit, come to the stage!

1191
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,916
Where the fuck is B-Rabbit?

1192
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:22,546
-Where's he at?
-They're calling you!

1193
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:25,048
You drew Lyckety-Splyt in the first round.

1194
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,301
-You okay with that?
-Yeah.

1195
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,054
I don't give a fuck who it is.

1196
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:33,932
Okay.

1197
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,977
Where the fuck is B-Rabbit?

1198
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:40,314
Come to the stage.
You got everybody waiting.

1199
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,484
It's gonna be blazin' in this bitch tonight.

1200
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,988
We got a lot of dope rappers,
and at the end of the night,

1201
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:51,241
one will battle last week's winner,
Papa Doc.

1202
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:54,661
This shit will be off the hook,
so stick around.

1203
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:58,665
Come to the stage, Rabbit.
Come to the stage!

1204
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:02,753
B-Rabbit, where you at?
There he is. Come on.

1205
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:06,548
Make way for the Rabbit. Let him through.

1206
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:10,427
Let the artist get to the motherfucking stage.

1207
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:13,638
Come on, B-Rabbit.

1208
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,015
Let him up.

1209
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:16,892
You good?

1210
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,602
Choose.

1211
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,020
Heads.

1212
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,274
You got it.

1213
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,444
I'll go first against this choke artist.

1214
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:31,323
You got enough confidence.
Do your thing! Forty-five seconds.

1215
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,824
Spin that shit!

1216
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,495
Free World, nigga.

1217
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,164
(RAPPING) I'll tell you something

1218
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,503
Check this out

1219
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:49,174
This guy's a choke artist
You catch a bad one

1220
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:52,344
You better off shootin' yourself
with Papa Doc's handgun

1221
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:54,137
Climbing up this mountain
You're weak

1222
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:57,057
I leave you lost without a paddle
Floating up shit's creek

1223
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,935
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
You the New Kid on the Block

1224
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:02,312
'Bout to get smacked
back to the boondocks

1225
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,189
Fucking Nazi,
your squad ain't your type

1226
01:30:04,273 --> 01:30:07,234
Take some real advice
Form a group with Vanilla Ice

1227
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:09,444
What I tell you,
you better use it

1228
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:12,239
This guy's a hillbilly
This ain't Willie Nelson music

1229
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:14,574
Trailer trash
I'll choke you to your last breath

1230
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:17,577
Have you look foolish like
Cheddar Bob when he shot himself

1231
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,579
Silly Rabbit,
I know why you called that

1232
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,666
You follow Future
Like he got carrots up his ass crack

1233
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,751
When you acted up,
You got jacked up

1234
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,587
Left stupid like Tina Turner
when she got smacked up

1235
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,005
I'll crack your shoulder blade

1236
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,551
You'll drop so hard
EIvis'll turn in his grave

1237
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:34,678
I don't know why
they let you out in the dark

1238
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:37,806
Take your white ass
across 8 Mile to the trailer park

1239
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:45,522
Okay, okay.

1240
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,483
Very nice, very nice. Let me get the mike.

1241
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:51,528
Pretty good. Hip-hop 101.

1242
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:54,281
Bunny Rabbit, it's your turn, baby.

1243
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,199
Forty-five seconds.

1244
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:58,535
Let this motherfucker feel it!

1245
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:00,954
DJ, spin that shit!

1246
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,127
Come on, Rabbit!

1247
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,337
Don't choke this time.

1248
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,013
All right, look.

1249
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,390
He's choking!

1250
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,815
Hey, yo

1251
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,068
This guy raps
like his parents jerked him

1252
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,363
He sounds like Erick Sermon
The generic version

1253
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:37,073
This crowd looks suspicious

1254
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,494
It's all dudes here,
except for these bitches

1255
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,621
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay

1256
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:45,040
You look like a fuckin' worm
with braids

1257
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:47,042
These Leadaz Of Tha Free World
rookies

1258
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:50,545
Lookie
How can six dicks be pussies?

1259
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,214
Talkin' about shit's creek?

1260
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:54,883
You could be up piss creek
with paddles, this deep

1261
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,301
You're still gonna sink

1262
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:57,427
You're a disgrace

1263
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,930
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

1264
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,973
He can't get with me,
spittin' this shit

1265
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,266
Wickedly lickin' these shots

1266
01:32:03,392 --> 01:32:05,727
To spiggy, spiggity
split lickety

1267
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,313
Now I'm gonna turn around
with a great smile

1268
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:10,982
And walk my white ass
back across 8 Mile

1269
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,783
Say no more!
That's what I'm talking about.

1270
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,117
It's unanimous!

1271
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:23,620
Bunny Rabbit goes to the next round!

1272
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:26,915
Lyckety, tell your mama I'll be over later.

1273
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,959
She can save me a plate.

1274
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,045
-You killed him. Good shit.
-That's what I'm talking about.

1275
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,880
Hold up, hold up.

1276
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,799
Next up, we got

1277
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:40,303
Ox and Strike.
Come to the stage, motherfuckers.

1278
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,429
Yo, Rabbit!

1279
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,740
Okay, B-Rabbit. Call it.

1280
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:01,992
Heads.

1281
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,578
Heads. Choose.

1282
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:08,415
Lotto, it's on you, baby. You first.

1283
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,167
-Don't matter.
-DJ, spin that shit!

1284
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:17,757
-He's always taking his shirt off.
-I'm gonna smash this bastard.

1285
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,138
Free World in the motherfuckin' house.

1286
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:26,975
It's time to get rid of this coward
once and for all.

1287
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:29,978
I'm sick of this motherfucker.

1288
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,272
Rip him, Lotto! Rip him, baby!

1289
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:38,653
I'll spit a racial slur, honky
Sue me

1290
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:39,988
This shit is a horror flick

1291
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,240
But the black guy
doesn't die in this movie

1292
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,451
Fuckin' with Lotto
You got to be kiddin'

1293
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:47,746
That makes me believe
you've no interest in livin'

1294
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,498
You think these niggas
gonna feel the shit you say?

1295
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:53,043
I got a better chance
joining the KKK

1296
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:55,128
On some real shit, though?
I like you

1297
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:58,465
That's why I didn't want to be
the one you commit suicide to

1298
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:00,467
Fuck Lotto
Call me your leader

1299
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:03,970
I feel bad I gotta murder
that dude from Leave it to Beaver

1300
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,057
I used to like that show
Now I'm in fight-back mode

1301
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,351
Oh, well
If you got to go, you got to go

1302
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:11,770
I hate to do this
I'd love for this shit to last

1303
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:15,190
I'll take pictures of my rear end
So you won't forget my ass

1304
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:16,858
All's well that ends okay

1305
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,654
So I'll end this shit with
"Fuck you, but have a nice day!"

1306
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,412
Whoa, okay, okay.

1307
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,540
Can't be mad, can't be bad.

1308
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,584
You killed that fucked-up white boy.

1309
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:35,919
That ain't shit.

1310
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,714
Settle down. Give the man a chance.

1311
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:43,093
Bunny Rabbit's up next. All right, B-Rabbit.

1312
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:47,347
You got the mike. It's on you.
You know what to do.

1313
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:49,099
DJ, spin that shit!

1314
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,398
You got something?

1315
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,069
You can't fuck with us!

1316
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:03,697
Let's see what you got.

1317
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,742
-Come on, Rabbit!
-Get him!

1318
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:16,376
"Ward, I think you were
a little hard on the Beaver"

1319
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,546
So was Eddie Haskell,
Wally and Miz Cleaver

1320
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,048
This guy keeps screaming
He's paranoid

1321
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,759
Quick, someone get his ass
another steroid

1322
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,429
Blah-biddy, bloo-blah
blah-blah-biddy, bloo-blah

1323
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:30,724
I ain't hear a word you said
Hippety hoo-plah

1324
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,934
Is that a tank top or a new bra?

1325
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:35,520
Look, Snoop Dogg
just got a fuckin' boob job

1326
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,814
Didn't you listen to
the last round, meathead?

1327
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:41,526
Pay attention
You're saying the same shit he said

1328
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:43,319
Matter of fact, dawg
Here's a pencil

1329
01:35:43,362 --> 01:35:45,989
Go home, write some shit
Make it suspenseful

1330
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:48,950
Don't come back
'til something dope hits you

1331
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:52,162
Fuck it
You can take the mike home wit' you

1332
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,247
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you

1333
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:57,542
Tank top screaming,
"Lotto, I don't fit you!"

1334
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:59,669
You see how far
them white jokes get you

1335
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,047
Boys like,
"How's Vanilla Ice gon' dis you?"

1336
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,841
Fuck Lotto

1337
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:08,011
I'll get the seven digits from your
mother for a dollar tomorrow

1338
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,191
It's real as it feels!

1339
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:26,863
Hold on! That was some close shit.
Let's see what's poppin'.

1340
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:28,990
How y'all feel about Lotto?

1341
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,870
Okay! B-Rabbit?

1342
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,544
Let's do it again. It's hard to judge.

1343
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,129
We'll start with Lotto.

1344
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,762
Okay, lotta love, lotta love!

1345
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:52,972
What about B-Rabbit?

1346
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,394
Say no more!

1347
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:02,732
B-Rabbit advances to the next round!

1348
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:05,693
He goes to the finals against Papa Doc!

1349
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:07,862
That's the way it's going down.

1350
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:11,366
Okay, check this.
Fifteen minute intermission.

1351
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,411
Make sure you tip the bartenders.
Fifteen minutes.

1352
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,455
You did your thing, man.

1353
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:21,751
That's okay, 'cause Wink got more
than seven digits from your bitch!

1354
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,799
You did it, kid.

1355
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:34,472
Fuck him. Fuck Lyckety, man.

1356
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:39,853
That Beaver line almost killed me.

1357
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,354
But you flipped it.

1358
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:44,274
You got it, man. You're a fucking genius.

1359
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:47,610
Make sure you serve this clown
in the next round for me.

1360
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,905
-Whup Papa Doc's ass!
-He's got no vocabulary.

1361
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:53,366
You worried about what he'll say?

1362
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,243
What do you mean?

1363
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,329
About Wink and that Alex bitch getting it on,

1364
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:01,916
and them beating you up
and giving you a black eye and shit.

1365
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:04,377
-Cheddar!
-Fuck that. Listen to me.

1366
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,129
You're making history tonight.

1367
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,798
Yeah, he ain't nothing. You got it!

1368
01:38:10,509 --> 01:38:11,968
You got this.

1369
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:27,025
All right.
You know what's happening.

1370
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,820
It's the championship round.
Yes, believe it's real.

1371
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,657
It's time. We got Papa Doc

1372
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:38,328
and we got B-Rabbit.

1373
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:42,582
I don't have to stress how important this is.

1374
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:44,208
It's the championship.

1375
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:47,211
This motherfucker is what we came to see.

1376
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:50,131
That's why the fuck we're in the D.

1377
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,675
We represent. We at The Shelter.

1378
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,178
It's real. I hope you're all ready.

1379
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:58,598
This shit is about to be crackolatin' in here.

1380
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,183
Hold on.

1381
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:02,685
Let's do the coin toss.

1382
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:06,898
As Papa Doc is defending champion,
you get to choose.

1383
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:08,942
What do you want, heads or tails?

1384
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:10,193
Heads.

1385
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,239
Okay. Who goes first?

1386
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:17,700
Let that bitch go first.

1387
01:39:19,995 --> 01:39:22,997
I can't believe my ears. A lot of hostility.

1388
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,958
Papa's got a lot of anger.

1389
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:29,003
All right, check this out. We got new rules.

1390
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:33,341
Being it's the championship round,
each of these cats

1391
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,885
gets a minute and a half apiece.

1392
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:37,720
I don't know what'll happen!

1393
01:39:37,763 --> 01:39:39,222
B-Rabbit,

1394
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:42,058
you know what to do.

1395
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:43,893
DJ, kick that shit.

1396
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:05,248
Now everybody from the 313

1397
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:08,459
Put your motherfuckin' hands up
and follow me

1398
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:12,130
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up

1399
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,173
Look, look

1400
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,550
Now while he stands tough

1401
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:18,553
Notice this man
did not have his hands up

1402
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:20,847
This Free World's got you gassed up

1403
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:23,307
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

1404
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,643
One, two, three and to the four

1405
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:28,396
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four

1406
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,773
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one

1407
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:33,776
You're Pac, he's Pac,
you're Pac none

1408
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:36,112
This guy's no motherfuckin' MC

1409
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,823
I know everything
he's got to say against me

1410
01:40:38,907 --> 01:40:41,159
I am white
I am a fuckin' bum

1411
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,911
I do live in a trailer with my mom

1412
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:46,122
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom

1413
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,249
I do got a dumb friend
named Cheddar Bob

1414
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,877
Who shoots himself in his leg
with his own gun

1415
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:54,130
I did get jumped
by all six of you chumps

1416
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:55,965
And Wink did fuck my girl

1417
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:59,135
I'm still standing here screaming
"Fuck Tha Free World"

1418
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:01,054
Don't ever try to judge me, dude

1419
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,473
You don't know what the fuck
I've been through

1420
01:41:03,515 --> 01:41:06,059
But I know something about you

1421
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:09,312
You went to Cranbrook
That's a private school

1422
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:11,564
What's the matter, dawg?
You embarrassed?

1423
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:14,317
This guy's a gangsta?
His real name's Clarence

1424
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:16,569
Clarence lives at home
with both parents

1425
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:19,155
Clarence's parents
have a real good marriage

1426
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,282
This guy don't wanna battle
He's shook

1427
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,327
'Cause ain't no such thing
as halfway crooks

1428
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:25,453
He's scared to death

1429
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,872
He's scared to look
in his fucking yearbook

1430
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:29,499
Fuck Cranbrook

1431
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,252
Fuck a beat

1432
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:34,504

01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:35,838

1434
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,340

1435
01:41:37,382 --> 01:41:38,925
Fuck y'all if you doubt me

1436
01:41:39,009 --> 01:41:42,261
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash
I say it proudly

1437
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:44,847
Fuck this battle
I don't want to win, I'm outtie

1438
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,850
Here, tell these people something
they don't know about me

1439
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,573
Papa Doc, what are you gonna do?

1440
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,076
DJ!

1441
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,204
A minute and a half! Spin that shit!

1442
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:10,289
Spin that shit!

1443
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:17,255
Crook!

1444
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:19,757
Yo.

1445
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:53,457
We got a new champion!

1446
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:56,169
B-Rabbit!

1447
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,674
Let's roll, man.

1448
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:07,096
Fuck Free World! 313!

1449
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,861
B-Rabbit!

1450
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:32,955
Three One Third is in the house!

1451
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,291
Don't get it twisted, this is my man here!

1452
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:37,793
This is my man right here.

1453
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,629
Where we headed, Rabbit?

1454
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:41,255
We're on our way.

1455
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:45,760
We're gonna get that big deal soon!
Then we'll get all the bitches!

1456
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,428
All the bitches.

1457
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,141
Where are we going?

1458
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,143
I'm going back to work.

1459
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:55,478
Work?

1460
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:59,148
Get out of here. You ain't going to work.

1461
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,275
You the man now. You ain't got to work.

1462
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,819
Fuck Wink! Fuck Tha Free World!

1463
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,905
We are the shit!

1464
01:44:11,161 --> 01:44:12,328
What's up?

1465
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:13,621
Hold on.

1466
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,040
Man, I've been thinking.

1467
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:20,753
We should host the battles together,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1468
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:25,758
No. That's you, dawg.

1469
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:30,179
Come on.
Tell me you don't want to host with me.

1470
01:44:30,847 --> 01:44:33,516
You'll have everybody looking up to you,

1471
01:44:33,558 --> 01:44:35,810
everybody'll know who you are.

1472
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:38,479
Yeah, but...

1473
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:42,858
I think I need to just do my own thing, man.

1474
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:47,029
You know?

1475
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:52,118
Yeah, I think I do.

1476
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,595
All right, Rabbit.

1477
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,389
Peace out, Rabbit!

1
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,830
What should I do with this,
Your Excellency?

2
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,165
Yes.

3
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,918
I picked it out for Daria
Alexandrovna and the children.

4
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,005
Bonjour, Lili.

5
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,715
Bonjour.

6
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,468
Bonjour, Grisha.

7
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,761
Bonjour.

8
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,554
Vasya.

9
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,351
Who is coming to see
Grand-maman?

10
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,602
Me! Me! Me!

11
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,691
Come along,
my little ducklings.

12
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,598
Be good today. I'm off.

13
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,271
Read the chapter carefully.

14
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,438
I'll come back
to test you on it.

15
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,608
Read it twice.

16
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,290
Au revoir.

17
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,182
Oh, Stiva.

18
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,083
Aunt Dolly found a note
from the governess.

19
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,168
Well?

20
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,255
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

21
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,009
I'm to be deprived of my wife so
that adultery may be forgiven?

22
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,387
I can't excuse him just
because he's your brother.

23
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,306
Oh, it's for
Dolly's sake, too.

24
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,599
Four committees today.

25
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,809
I have the world
waiting for me.

26
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,979
There's never time to
look at your exercises.

27
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:33,441
Serozha is doing very well,
Your Excellency.

28
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,276
Who put this shirt on you?

29
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,612
Well, never mind.
I'll come and hear you read.

30
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,281
Tomorrow, perhaps.

31
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,201
Thank you, Lukich.
Perhaps tomorrow.

32
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,371
No. No, no, not tomorrow.

33
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,747
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

34
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,957
Come along.

35
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,543
Alexei, do you think nine years
of marriage and children

36
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,797
should count for nothing
against an infatuation?

37
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,383
No. Very well.

38
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,011
But sin has a price,
you may be sure of that.

39
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,806
But why?

40
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,641
Because that's
where Aunt Dolly lives.

41
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,811
- But why?
- I told you, Serozha.

42
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,813
She's not well.
I must go to see her.

43
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,356
But why, Mama?

44
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,483
Don't make Mama cry.

45
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll be back before you know,
and bring you a present.

46
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,363
I don't want a present.
I want you to stay.

47
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,740
Oh, my little Kotik.

48
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,701
What present?

49
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,661
That's better.

50
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,272
It's the first time
I've left my little boy.

51
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:58,526
So, you're leaving your son
and I'm returning to mine.

52
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,486
I'm Countess Vronskaya.

53
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,865
I've been in St. Petersburg for the
christening of a granddaughter.

54
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,742
My eldest son married
Princess Chirkov.

55
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,750
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?

56
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,586
I've never been
in Moscow society, really.

57
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,046
But you know my name.

58
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,631
- I've heard you mentioned.
- Talked about, you mean?

59
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,386
Ah, love.

60
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,306
- Was it love?
- Always.

61
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,558
My sons are ashamed of me.

62
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,269
But I'd rather end up wishing I
hadn't than end up wishing I had.

63
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,645
Wouldn't you?

64
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,689
I don't know.

65
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,762
Some man came without an
appointment, Your Excellency.

66
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,013
Waiting outside.

67
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,183
Levin!
Where did you disappear?

68
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,352
I'm very anxious to see you.

69
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:16,938
I need your advice.

70
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,397
Well, come into
my room, then.

71
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:21,859
This is my oldest friend,
Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin.

72
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,195
Someone send word
I'll be a few minutes late.

73
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,240
That's my office, up there.

74
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,578
Oh, I've been hard at it.
Sit down.

75
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,955
Hard at what, exactly?

76
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,040
Well, we're overwhelmed
with work.

77
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,125
Paperwork.

78
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,460
Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
Farming is only the stomach.

79
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,380
Now, when am I going to
come and shoot some snipe?

80
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,511
Look at you, in Western clothes you
told me you'd never wear again.

81
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,637
Something's up.

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,349
Yes, I'm in love.
I've come back to propose.

83
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,310
Have you guessed who she is?

84
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,896
I... I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?

85
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,482
I decided it was impossible.

86
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,986
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

87
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,865
But then, I thought and thought, and
there's no life for me without her

88
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,826
- Do I have a chance?
- Of course you do.

89
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,161
The Shcherbatskys are giving
a soiree this evening.

90
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,871
Get there early,
before the crowd.

91
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,539
- And if I may suggest...
- Anything, what?

92
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,791
- New boots.
- Right. Anything else?

93
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,669
We'd better have
dinner together.

94
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,379
Come on.
We'll meet later at l'Angleterre.

95
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,839
Or do you prefer
the Hermitage?

96
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,716
Let's say, 5:30
at l'Angleterre.

97
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,259
I owe them more
than the Hermitage,

98
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,802
so it wouldn't be fair
to withdraw my custom.

99
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:34,515
Uh, so, new boots,
coat, and a proper hat.

100
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,268
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

101
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,770
Do you...

102
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,396
Do you...

103
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,900
Excuse me.

104
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,387
It's so unfair.

105
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,806
You marry for love.

106
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,683
You're a good husband.

107
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,645
Children arrive,
years depart.

108
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:07,942
And all of a sudden,
your wife grows old and tired.

109
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,611
And her hair is thin.
And her body...

110
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,863
And you yourself,
you still have your vigor!

111
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,159
And then you find yourself a martyr
to distraction by so many women.

112
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,161
Forgive me, but I find
that incomprehensible.

113
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,707
As though, I should leave this restaurant
and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

114
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,916
Well, you know,
a freshly baked roll.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm talking about love, and you're
talking about your appetite.

116
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,631
Easily confused.
Now, do you know, um, Count Vronsky?

117
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,300
Who? No. Why?

118
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,385
He's your rival. He turned up
from Petersburg after you left.

119
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,469
Who is he?

120
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,055
Oh, you don't need to worry about him.
He's... He's just...

121
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,807
He's a rich,
good-looking cavalry officer

122
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,518
who has nothing better to do
than make love to pretty women.

123
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,728
Is that cabbage soup?

124
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:47,023
Potage aux choux a la russe,
as the gentleman ordered.

125
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,025
It's what I wanted.

126
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,113
Understand that, for me, tonight
is a question of life and death.

127
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,573
Kostya...

128
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,617
Kostya, Kitty would be
mad to refuse you.

129
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,828
And Dolly's on
your side, you know?

130
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,249
She says her sister Kitty was always
meant to be your wife, and will be.

131
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,417
Dolly said that?

132
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,254
I've always thought
your Dolly was a gem.

133
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,464
She is.

134
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,758
She is.

135
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,801
I loved her to distraction.

136
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,679
Konstantin!

137
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,266
Konstantin!

138
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,272
Konstantin!

139
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,524
I'm too early.
I'll come back.

140
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,693
No. Come up.

141
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,394
Look at me.

142
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,397
I'm receiving for Papa and
Maman, who are late to dress.

143
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,273
It's my first reception.

144
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,151
Princess Ekaterina.

145
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,987
Delighted. Delighted.

146
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,659
I'm so pleased you were able to be
with us, Konstantin Dmitrievich.

147
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,120
Kitty, you look...

148
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,332
- You look...
- Stiva told us you were back.

149
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,417
How long are you staying?

150
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,919
I don't know.
It depends on you.

151
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,004
On me?

152
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,969
What I mean to say is I...

153
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,679
I only came with one purpose.

154
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,599
I want to...
Will you be my wife?

155
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,273
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

156
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,316
Wrong moment.
It's the wrong moment.

157
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,693
But will you?

158
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,488
I can't.

159
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,414
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,666
Yes.

161
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,294
It was impossible.

162
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,716
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,135
Are you the brother
of Nikolai Levin?

164
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,219
Yes.

165
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,931
He's in Moscow.
He's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.

166
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,141
How do you know?

167
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,185
It's the sort of thing I know.

168
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,900
Count Vronsky?

169
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,401
Yes?

170
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,541
Princess Kitty.

171
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,336
It's been so long, and yet,
it seems like yesterday.

172
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,379
It was yesterday.

173
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,491
Excuse me.

174
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,951
No.

175
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,745
Sorry.

176
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,865
It's Kostya.

177
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,909
Good God! Look at him.

178
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,870
You look like a capitalist.

179
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,872
What do you want?

180
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,458
Nothing.
I came to see you.

181
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,046
Good evening, miss...
Madam.

182
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,632
Don't talk to her like that.
You sound like a magistrate.

183
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:28,478
More vodka for my brother!
Quick about it.

184
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,847
I don't want anything.

185
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,099
I'm all right.

186
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,354
Who told you
where to find me?

187
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:41,358
A colonel in the Third Department.
They're watching you.

188
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,652
Good.

189
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,238
They must think
I'm dangerous.

190
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,241
What have you got
to smile about?

191
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,326
Nothing.

192
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,410
That's right.

193
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,539
The day is coming.
I have given up my birthright for it.

194
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,584
You're on the wrong side
of history.

195
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,253
Not because privilege
is immoral.

196
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,714
But because it's irrational.

197
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,259
He's sick!

198
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,470
Let go, if you know
what's good for you.

199
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,473
I took Marya Nikolaevna
from a brothel.

200
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,893
But I consider her my wife.

201
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,812
If her presence offends,
you're free to leave.

202
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,317
Are you married?

203
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,612
No.

204
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,990
Why not?
Are you waiting to fall in love?

205
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,909
- No.
- Good.

206
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,828
Romantic love will be the last
illusion of the old order.

207
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,332
You should marry
one of your peasants.

208
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,085
Yes. I damn well should.

209
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,922
The brotherhood of man!

210
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,436
Nikolai, you need to
see a doctor.

211
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,066
Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe
till you get your health back.

212
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,567
With my wife?

213
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,152
If you

214
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,321
Or...

215
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,324
Or go abroad to a spa.

216
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,787
I'll send more
if that's what you want.

217
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,341
Hello, what's this?

218
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:32,720
Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
I've got them for four days.

219
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,264
The private carriage will
stop opposite the stand.

220
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,100
Bad luck.
What do they like, art?

221
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:39,685
Food.

222
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,271
Here's the train.

223
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:54,158
Oh.

224
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,043
I'll come back.

225
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,679
Stiva!

226
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,514
Anna!

227
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,396
- You don't look ashamed!
- Oh, I am, I really am.

228
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,025
Yes, of course.
Oblonsky's sister, Karenina.

229
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,863
Charmante, don't you think?

230
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,842
There, Countess.

231
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,928
You have found your son,
and I have found my brother.

232
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,805
Madam Karenina
has a son, too.

233
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,057
It's the first time they've been
apart, so she frets about him.

234
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,060
Excuse me for not
recognizing you before.

235
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,480
- Au revoir, Countess.
- Au revoir, my dear.

236
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,565
Let me kiss that pretty face.

237
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,588
Keep your people inside until
this has been cleared up.

238
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,009
The sole supporter
of a large family, they say.

239
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,845
Well, can't anything
be done for them?

240
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,680
Wait for me, Maman.

241
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,687
Stand back.
Move aside. Stand back.

242
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,564
I have you to
thank for that.

243
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,444
Oh!
Oh, what a good fellow!

244
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,030
What a good fellow.

245
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,074
Have you known
Count Vronsky long?

246
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,077
Did you like him?
He's in love with Kitty.

247
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,954
Oh.

248
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,084
But we should be discussing
you and Dolly.

249
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,544
What have you got
to say for yourself?

250
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,589
I've said it all.
On my knees, in tears.

251
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,882
Now I need you to say it.

252
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,592
I'm going to the office, so
you'll have Dolly to yourself.

253
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,302
Don't be late home.

254
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,804
Oh, dear.

255
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,850
Kitty's coming by
to see you.

256
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,061
She's all grown up
and a bit frightened of you.

257
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,230
The belle of
St. Petersburg society.

258
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,649
Is that who I am?

259
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,487
Dolly.

260
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,450
Stiva has told me.

261
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,955
Oh, Dolly, I'm sorry.

262
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,291
From the bottom of my heart.

263
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,835
I don't know what to do.

264
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,171
I know. I know.

265
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,506
I can't bear to be with him.

266
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,259
And he doesn't care.
He's got what he wants.

267
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,763
What he wants is you.
He loves you, Dolly.

268
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,057
You and the children
are everything to him.

269
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,391
Are we?

270
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,143
And there is room
for a governess?

271
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,605
That was shameful, disgraceful,
but it was not love.

272
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,942
It was the animal in man
not the soul.

273
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,944
Stiva's remorse is
from the soul.

274
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,529
Well, what about me?

275
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,824
Does his remorse
make it easier for me?

276
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,036
I know you are suffering.
But, Dolly, you must tell me.

277
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,832
Is there enough love left in your heart?
Enough to forgive him?

278
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:37,005
Well, when I think of them
together, I can't forgive him.

279
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,173
No.

280
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,885
My poor lamb.
So you would rather accept your fate?

281
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,178
My fate?

282
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,808
But I haven't done anything!
It's him who...

283
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,559
Do you love him, Dolly?

284
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,651
You love him,
and he loves you.

285
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,152
But you can't forgive.

286
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,364
So, your lives must continue like this
forever, with both of you wretched.

287
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,996
Oh, that's pretty.
Is that a wedding dress?

288
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,288
Yes.

289
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,832
Look for
the "G" for "Grisha."

290
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,126
- Here.
- Ok.

291
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,627
Can you do your whole name?

292
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,754
Doesn't that look
like a princess? No?

293
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm home!
Home, home, home!

294
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,469
Now, where are
my little ducklings?

295
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,682
Papa! Papa!

296
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,017
Papa!

297
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,106
Will you stay for
the Bobrishchevs' ball, Anna?

298
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,442
Oh. I always feel
dull at a ball.

299
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,238
Stiva, tell Anna
she must come to the ball.

300
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,948
Well, of course she must.

301
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,660
And God go with you.

302
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,205
You can introduce me
to your new governess.

303
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,791
But she's old!
She's a hundred!

304
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,004
I know why
you want me to come.

305
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,381
You want everyone
to be there

306
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,092
because you're quite sure
it's going to be your night.

307
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:05,886
How did you know?

308
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,056
I know everything.

309
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,810
Oh, to be your age again.

310
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,313
Surrounded by that...

311
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,231
That blue mist.

312
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,276
I was 18, too,
when I got married.

313
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,170
Is the prince at home?

314
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,464
He's just
gone up, I believe.

315
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,341
Is nobody receiving?

316
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,511
- I can enquire, sir.
- I don't think so.

317
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,265
- The princess retired early.
- Is there a message?

318
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,528
No. Thank you.

319
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,954
We thought you would
come back married.

320
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,247
Did you?

321
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,919
But you only came back
with a hat.

322
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,463
A black silk hat.

323
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,009
What kind of animal can you
make a hat like that from?

324
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,635
It's not natural.

325
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,930
Next time, perhaps.

326
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,766
There'll be no next time.

327
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,483
Kitty.

328
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,152
May I have a waltz?

329
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,987
You may, Boris.

330
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,074
I'll save you the third, just
because it's your first ball.

331
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,784
You're my first conquest!

332
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,314
Where do you want
to be taken?

333
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,525
There.

334
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,294
How are you, Stiva?

335
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,171
Thanks to Anna, lam a happy man.
Would you like to dance?

336
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,923
No. Ask Anna.

337
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,800
No, I don't...

338
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,306
- Come on, then.
- Oh! Look out!

339
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,221
This vile, idiotic
matchmaking of yours.

340
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,682
For goodness' sake,
what have I done?

341
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,727
Is anything the matter?

342
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,020
No.

343
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,152
You look as lovely as ever,
Princess Kitty.

344
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,288
Don't ask me, Maman.

345
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,749
Kitty, it's us next.

346
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,171
Princess, I have the honor
to claim my dance.

347
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,486
He'll dance the mazurka
with Kitty. You'll see.

348
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,634
lam! I really am!

349
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,685
Dance with me.

350
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm not used to being
spoken to like that

351
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,691
by a man I met once
at a railway station.

352
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,277
I dare say, but if I'm
not to dance with you,

353
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,280
then I'm getting out of
this operetta and going home.

354
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,158
Then, for Kitty's sake.

355
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,877
That's my sister.

356
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:09,989
Next stop is Bologoyel
Bologoye, next stop.

357
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,681
Can I be of service to you?

358
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,936
Why are you leaving Moscow?

359
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,439
What else can I do?

360
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,526
I have to be where you are.

361
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,152
Stop, that's enough.

362
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,446
Go back to Kitty.

363
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:52,407
No.

364
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,992
This is wrong.

365
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,452
It makes no difference.

366
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,787
You have no right.

367
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,414
It makes no difference.

368
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,375
You must forget me.

369
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,378
If you're a good man,
you'll forget everything.

370
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,964
And you? Will you forget?

371
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:11,676
Yes.

372
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,169
Is Serozha all right?

373
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,754
Oh, is that all I get?

374
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:48,921
Yes, he's quite well.

375
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,758
Were you a success?

376
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:52,925
L?

377
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,594
Oh, Dolly and Stiva.

378
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,846
Yes, I think so.

379
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,561
- I'll announce myself.
- Very good, sir.

380
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,523
Vronsky.
The master himself.

381
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,443
Baroness, coffee from the new
coffee pot for Count Vronsky.

382
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,529
I'll be off home
if I'm in the way.

383
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:15,990
You're at home
where you are, Baroness.

384
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,035
Oh! Oh, Pierre, you never say
such pretty things to me.

385
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,078
We were just
discussing my husband.

386
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,122
He won't divorce me, you see,
and do you know why?

387
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,083
No. Because he likes eating
off my family silver.

388
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,376
I want to bring an action.

389
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,045
Just because I'm supposed
to be unfaithful,

390
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,088
I don't see why I have to
eat off Pierre's crockery.

391
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,340
Look at it!

392
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,300
It's my crockery.

393
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:35,468
Oh!

394
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,053
How was Moscow?

395
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,180
Provincial.

396
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,666
Thank you for my presents.

397
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,245
I'm writing to Dolly
and to Kitty.

398
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,707
You are good.

399
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,971
Time for bed.

400
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:09,395
What are they saying in Moscow
about the new statute?

401
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,689
What new statute?

402
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,775
The new statute
I carried in Council.

403
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,738
No one mentioned it.

404
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:20,907
Really?

405
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:23,993
Oh.

406
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,998
Here, it caused
quite a sensation.

407
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,365
Princess Betsy.

408
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:03,866
Cousin.

409
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,910
I didn't know
you were an art lover.

410
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,536
I'm prepared to be one.

411
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:50,079
Countess Lydia tells me

412
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,748
you haven't been to one of her
evenings since you returned.

413
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,166
The last one was to
meet a missionary.

414
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,334
The one before that

415
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:58,546
was for a lecture on the union
of the Greek and Roman Churches.

416
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,508
Oh, I'm sorry.

417
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,260
I know you're fond of her.

418
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,179
Come on, or we'll be late.

419
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,326
Here's the thing, Vronsky.

420
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,204
A posting's come up, and there's
a promotion in it for you.

421
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,247
Thank you, sir.

422
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,915
In the garrison in Tashkent.

423
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,876
Tashkent? But...

424
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,839
I would like to stay in Peter,
sir, if you don't mind.

425
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,799
Well, I don't mind.

426
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:48,554
But your mother...
It's her idea.

427
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,490
Your husband is a saint,

428
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,576
and we must all cherish him
for Russia's sake.

429
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,293
You didn't come
to my dinner.

430
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,878
I had to see my
Commanding Officer.

431
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,297
Well, "she"
didn't come either.

432
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,886
I do hope you can
come on afterwards.

433
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:32,973
Father Kristof's report on the Chinese
mission will be with lantern slides.

434
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,893
I'm expected
at the Tverskoys'.

435
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,104
No doubt.

436
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,816
But I'm sure that Princess
Betsy can wait for you.

437
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,910
Yes, in fact, I don't think
I will go to Betsy's.

438
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,370
You're caught.

439
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,041
I'm afraid I'm becoming
quite ridiculous.

440
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,116
Now, there's
a phenomenon.

441
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,411
Look, Anna's shadow
has arrived before Anna.

442
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,371
I'm Anna's friend.

443
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,582
But all this making up
one's mind to it in public

444
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,293
is not polite to a distinguished
man like Karenin.

445
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:46,422
In my opinion, Karenin is a fool
and Anna is the best of us.

446
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,550
And we all love you for your
contrary opinions, Princess.

447
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,610
Alexei, you look desperate.

448
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,988
It's not attractive.

449
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,615
I'm losing hope.

450
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,033
Hope of what?

451
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,202
Persuading a virtuous woman
to break her marriage vows?

452
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:19,663
No, you're right.

453
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,875
She won't come.

454
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,869
He's gone.

455
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,163
But you're just in time
for the surprise.

456
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,870
Turn around!

457
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:46,125
May I have the honor
of bringing you an ice?

458
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,049
Ices are being served.

459
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,763
I would prefer
to try a cigarette.

460
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,323
Courage.

461
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,158
I'll try another one
sometime.

462
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,243
When?

463
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,120
Where?

464
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,540
Just as I was thinking your manners
had improved since Moscow.

465
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:27,958
You behaved badly.

466
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,335
Very badly.

467
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,462
And who was
responsible for that?

468
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:37,051
Give me a cup of tea.

469
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:43,849
How nice!

470
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,768
Alexei Alexandrovich
has arrived.

471
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,606
I'm not sure my nerves can stand
another Alexei at this moment.

472
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,114
Were you glad
to see me or not?

473
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:01,742
So the Schuzburgs
asked us to dinner.

474
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:06,121
The sauce was said to have cost a
thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

475
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,714
I gave them a sauce that cost
85 kopeks and it was a triumph

476
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:19,051
This must stop.

477
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,011
You make me feel as if I
were guilty of something.

478
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,304
What do you want me to do?

479
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:25,057
I want you to go to Moscow
and beg Kitty to forgive you.

480
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,809
No, that's not
what you want.

481
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,644
Moscow?
I can do better than that.

482
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,064
Tonight I refused a posting
to Tashkent.

483
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:35,317
I can change my mind,
and you'll never see me again.

484
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:39,488
If you have any thought for me,
you will give me back my peace.

485
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,073
I have no peace to give.

486
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:42,908
There can be no peace for us.

487
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:45,994
Only misery
or the greatest happiness.

488
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,882
Your husband is impossible.

489
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,250
His opinions are all wrong,

490
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,419
but he talks so brilliantly,
he wins every argument.

491
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:54,920
What?

492
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:56,380
I called to take you home.

493
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,215
No, I'm staying.

494
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:00,884
Send the carriage
back for me.

495
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,052
Of course.

496
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:25,534
Do you want me
to go to Tashkent?

497
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,048
So I'll go to Tashkent.

498
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,300
No!

499
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,388
I don't want you to go.

500
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,253
I stayed up
to talk to you.

501
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,886
What about?

502
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:28,722
It's late.

503
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,350
Where's Annushka?

504
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,771
I sent her off.

505
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,858
Well.

506
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,612
If you want to talk,
but we should go to bed.

507
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,030
I must warn you
about something.

508
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,198
Warn me?

509
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,202
Oh, it's really
rather late.

510
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,329
I wish to warn you that
you may, inadvertently

511
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,541
by indiscretion
and carelessness,

512
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:57,251
give the world occasion
to talk about you.

513
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:58,877
I am not a committee.

514
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,588
Please say
what you want to tell me.

515
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,135
You and Count Vronsky
attracted attention tonight.

516
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,557
You don't like it
when I don't talk to people,

517
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,933
and you don't like it
when I do.

518
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,434
I didn't notice
anything myself,

519
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:15,769
but I saw
everyone else noticed.

520
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:20,899
I consider jealousy to be insulting
to you and degrading to me.

521
00:48:20,983 --> 00:48:22,943
I have no right
to inquire into your feelings.

522
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,362
They concern
only your conscience.

523
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:29,074
But it's my duty to remind you
that we are bound together by God,

524
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:32,661
and this bond can only be
broken by a crime against God.

525
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:35,205
I have nothing
to say to you.

526
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:38,000
And you have a son.

527
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,751
And I'm tired.

528
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,973
If I am wrong,
I ask your pardon.

529
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,020
I don't know
what you're talking about,

530
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,980
and it's really
too late for this.

531
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:04,943
Excuse me, please.

532
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,704
Too late.

533
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,032
Oh, God! Oh, forgive me!

534
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,451
It's the end of everything.

535
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:38,954
I've got nothing left now
except you, remember that.

536
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,125
How could I not remember?

537
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:46,628
You're my happiness.

538
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,427
Happiness?

539
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,554
You murdered my happiness.

540
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:57,973
Murderer.

541
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,725
Murderer.

542
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:02,394
Go on.

543
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:03,812
Yes.

544
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:06,273
Go on. Murderer.

545
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:08,692
Murderer.

546
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,167
Look out,
here they come.

547
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,129
Oh, bad luck.

548
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,182
Potage aux choux a la russe!

549
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,434
Agafia, if you
opened up in Moscow,

550
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:44,561
the l'Angleterre
would go out of business.

551
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,482
It's true.

552
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,026
- Do you want news of Moscow?
- Babylon? No.

553
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,736
Oh, you're right,
what do you care?

554
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,112
You love the country,
you've got it.

555
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:56,656
You love agriculturing, and,
Lord knows, you've got that.

556
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,991
You love shooting,
you've got that.

557
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,451
- You've got everything you want.
- Ha!

558
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:02,996
All right, go on, then.

559
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,539
Have you stopped
stealing bread rolls?

560
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,376
Ballet girl, Oriental type.
How can I help it?

561
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:10,837
How is...

562
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,380
How are the Shcherbatskys?

563
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:13,715
You mean Kitty.

564
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,426
- Is she engaged now?
- No.

565
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:19,137
Vronsky went back
to St. Petersburg.

566
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,847
Huh.

567
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,767
Kitty will be seeing Dolly
at Ergoshovo in the summer.

568
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,393
You could...

569
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,187
Oh, yes, as if I had
time in the summer.

570
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,815
And I've got extra land at Kashin
this year for the haymaking.

571
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,817
Kashin? That's on the
Ergoshovo road, isn't it?

572
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,401
Couldn't you see Kitty
when she's there?

573
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:35,987
Especially, not then.
I humiliated myself once.

574
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:38,406
Oh, damn you, Kostya.
You love Kitty.

575
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,409
You love Kitty
and you can't forgive her

576
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:43,662
because, first, you funked it,
and then you bungled it.

577
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,497
And then you ran away
from an 18-year-old girl

578
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,166
who was made
a fool of by a uniform.

579
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,377
It's not you I feel
sorry for, it's Kitty.

580
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,795
Her heart told her no.

581
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:56,132
Did you come to shoot snipe
or criticize me?

582
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,267
Well, don't hold him
like a parcel.

583
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,353
Oh! It's Aunt Kitty,
darling.

584
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,358
Doesn't he make you ashamed
of dwelling on your troubles?

585
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,651
I have no troubles.

586
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,529
That man wasn't worth
the tears, believe me.

587
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:20,866
I don't care about him.
I don't even think about him, or her.

588
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,243
Except to hate her.

589
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,621
Then we'll never
speak of it again.

590
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:31,710
There are better men
waiting for you.

591
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:33,795
Stiva says...

592
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:40,427
Kitty, my lamb,
did Konstantin...

593
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,762
What has Levin
got to do with it?

594
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,806
Anyway,
I'll never get married.

595
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,560
The whole business of it
has become disgusting to me.

596
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,896
And look what it's done for you.
Why do they call it love?

597
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,317
Because it's love.

598
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,823
I want you to,
I don't care about it.

599
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:02,991
You should care.

600
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,827
Anyway, someone
might be watching.

601
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,508
But I'm damned, anyway.

602
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:23,011
I'm not. I'm blessed.

603
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:27,474
- You love me.
- Yes.

604
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,975
-  Only me.
- No.

605
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:33,772
- Apart from Frou-Frou?
- Yes.

606
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:36,066
But me more
than your horse?

607
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,192
Yes.

608
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,738
Are you happy?

609
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:43,740
Yes.

610
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,993
And you love me?

611
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:48,286
Yes.

612
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,164
How much?

613
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:53,333
This much.

614
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:56,252
This much?

615
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,754
Yes.

616
00:54:58,213 --> 00:54:59,881
- This much?
- Yes.

617
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,216
And this much?

618
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:03,051
Yes.

619
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,260
This much?

620
00:55:04,644 --> 00:55:05,762
Yes.

621
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,056
This much?
And this much?

622
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,367
So, this is love.

623
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,078
This.

624
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:35,834
Countess.

625
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,296
I thought you would be
at Peterhof now.

626
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,673
I've come from there.

627
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,592
I'm distressed that you haven't
taken your usual house this year.

628
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,761
Anna wanted a change.

629
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:50,306
Nearer to Princess Betsy
at Tsarskoe Selo.

630
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,020
The guards are in summer camp
at Tsarskoe.

631
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,106
Alexei Alexandrovich,

632
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,276
forgive me, but...

633
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:05,030
You are too tolerant.
Your wife is...

634
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:07,407
Oh! Is this about my wife?

635
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,617
My wife is beyond reproach.

636
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,579
She is, after all, my wife.

637
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,469
Alyosha! Alyosha!

638
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,098
A message from Maman.

639
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,392
Her friend Princess Sorokina
has a house here

640
00:56:34,476 --> 00:56:36,428
and a virgin daughter.

641
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,730
Well, that's not
part of the message,

642
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,190
but they'll all be
at the races

643
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,858
and you're expected
to supper afterwards.

644
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,736
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

645
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,322
I give you the regiment!

646
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,991
The regiment!

647
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,623
I heard you turned down
a promotion.

648
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:58,708
That was Maman interfering.

649
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,876
Yes.

650
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,836
And now she's come up
with a princess for you.

651
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:07,675
Alexei, we're brothers,
so don't take offense.

652
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:11,137
Getting married
puts the pack on your back.

653
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,973
It leaves your hands free
for climbing the ladder.

654
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,894
Getting serious
about a married woman

655
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,437
is like carrying
your pack in your arms.

656
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:21,189
So, they talk about me.

657
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,735
I'm leaving, Sasha.

658
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,530
An assignation?

659
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,406
Come on, I'll introduce you.

660
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,411
Beautiful.

661
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,665
A man would
come to no harm.

662
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,378
Do you think
you'll win tomorrow?

663
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:45,421
Makhotin's
Gladiator is favorite.

664
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,590
Sixteen hands.

665
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,467
Frou-Frou looks dainty
beside him.

666
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,178
But she's got heart.

667
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:53,888
Haven't you, my darling?

668
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:11,573
Anna.

669
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:15,201
Alexei!

670
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:16,870
What is it?

671
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:20,582
I couldn't bear not to
see you before the race.

672
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,924
What were you
thinking about?

673
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,471
Tell me.

674
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:39,184
I'm pregnant.

675
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:42,770
Oh, my love.

676
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,734
Well, love was
never a game to us.

677
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:50,778
Here's an end
to living in corners,

678
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:52,447
existing day to day on lies.

679
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:54,449
Yes.

680
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,784
Now we can be together.

681
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,454
How can we, Alexei?

682
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:01,623
Tell Karenin everything.

683
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,708
Do you think my husband
will make you a present of me?

684
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:04,876
Leave him.

685
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,336
Leave him
and be your mistress?

686
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:08,129
Yes, run away.

687
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:13,635
I would never
see my son again.

688
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,387
The laws are made by
husbands and fathers.

689
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:17,847
What, then?

690
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,976
I'll never forgive myself
for your unhappiness.

691
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:23,978
Unhappiness?

692
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,440
I'm like a starving beggar
who's been given food.

693
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,651
I, unhappy?

694
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:32,654
No.

695
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,616
This is my happiness.

696
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,745
Serozha!

697
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,374
Serozha,
I'm coming to get you!

698
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,089
Where are you?

699
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:54,509
Serozha!

700
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:58,012
Where are you?

701
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,641
How are you, young man?

702
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:03,851
Your tutor doesn't seem
to be in evidence.

703
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:05,186
Yah!

704
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,692
Alexei.

705
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,236
You got away at last.
Can you stay?

706
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,946
Why?

707
01:00:16,906 --> 01:00:18,992
Go and find Vasily Lukich.

708
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:21,828
I have to change.

709
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:23,746
Princess Betsy
is sending her trap for me.

710
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,582
Would you like to come?
She's taking me to watch the race.

711
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,459
Races, surely.

712
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,130
No, I'll come on later.
Then I must get back to town.

713
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,000
Yes!

714
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,181
Princess! Princess!

715
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,016
A bet!
Who do you fancy in the next?

716
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:26,851
Kusolev.

717
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,978
I'm on Vronsky.
Pair of gloves?

718
01:01:29,771 --> 01:01:31,272
Done.

719
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:37,612
Alexander Vronsky.

720
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,418
You are an
exquisite creature.

721
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:54,670
You really ought to be
the spoils of victory today.

722
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:43,428
Yah! Yah!

723
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:50,143
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

724
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:57,859
Go!

725
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:06,033
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

726
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:11,974
Alexei!

727
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:20,882
I'm here.

728
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:27,096
Oh

729
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:32,351
I'm here.

730
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:37,356
Get up!

731
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,568
Get up!

732
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:44,489
Her back is broken.

733
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,091
You know...

734
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:11,265
They say the Emperor
disapproves of the races.

735
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,309
The danger of injury.

736
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,477
But I...

737
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,728
What?

738
01:04:17,522 --> 01:04:22,318
I'm saying I think there's a value
in manly sport, for the military.

739
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,279
I don't understand.

740
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:31,118
In my opinion, it's not the sport itself.
It's the spectacle.

741
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:33,829
It's making
a cruel spectacle out of...

742
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:35,790
What are you talking about?

743
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:40,378
- I have to tell you...
- Yes.

744
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:43,798
I have to tell you,
you behaved improperly today.

745
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,259
How is that?

746
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:52,473
By making plain your feeling
when one of the riders fell.

747
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,767
Your conduct was improper.

748
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:59,021
It must not occur again.
I have said it before.

749
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:05,111
You will say my concern
is unnecessary and ridiculous.

750
01:05:05,194 --> 01:05:06,821
You are my wife.

751
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:09,991
I'm wrong to think that.

752
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:13,494
Yes?

753
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:15,830
Perhaps I was mistaken...

754
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:17,248
No.

755
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:20,376
You were not mistaken.

756
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:25,298
I love him.

757
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:29,343
I am his mistress.

758
01:05:33,306 --> 01:05:35,224
Do what you like to me.

759
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,990
Wait. Please, move away.

760
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,750
I will not have a scandal.
Therefore, you will not see this man again.

761
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,087
You will behave in a way that
nothing is known against you

762
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:06,922
by society or by the servants.

763
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:12,053
In return, you will keep the
privileges of a wife, and the duties.

764
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:15,389
Tomorrow you will return home.
That is all.

765
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,465
Are you hurt?

766
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:54,804
What's happened?

767
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,932
I told him
I'm your mistress.

768
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,601
He thinks I can give you
up and go on living.

769
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:02,436
No. You cannot.

770
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,776
Time for bed?

771
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,331
It was pleasant to hear you being
congratulated on your husband.

772
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,418
Not that I care
for decorations, but...

773
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,336
Alexei, I can't. I'm sorry.

774
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:11,547
Oh.

775
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:14,467
But I'm his wife, now.

776
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,975
I'm having his child.

777
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:59,386
Tell me what I did
to deserve this.

778
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,417
Halt!

779
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:56,110
How many mowers
is it, Theodore?

780
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,279
Forty-two, Master.

781
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:02,825
In your father's time, it was
work for two days for 30 men.

782
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,702
Though he never
picked up a scythe himself.

783
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,497
The men don't
like me for it.

784
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,833
They like
what they're used to.

785
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,501
It settles me.

786
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:13,794
How is that, Master?

787
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:17,423
When I'm mowing, I don't
ask myself why I'm here.

788
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:20,092
You're here to be
Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.

789
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,469
As it's always been,
by the grace of God.

790
01:10:22,845 --> 01:10:25,139
My father owned you,
Theodore.

791
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,225
Owned you like chattels
to be bought and sold.

792
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:29,977
Was that
by the grace of God?

793
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:33,063
It was.

794
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:35,816
That's my youngest
you were looking at, there.

795
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:40,821
His young life is perilous now since the
freedom came and work must be found.

796
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:43,407
They look happier
than I've ever been.

797
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,288
Is it living simply
that I'm looking for?

798
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,344
I'm expected.

799
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,099
No.

800
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:35,352
I will not live like this.

801
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:38,981
This waiting
for hour after hour,

802
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:41,275
not knowing
when I'll ever see you again.

803
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:43,277
Sorry.

804
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,071
It's my demon.
I can't help it.

805
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,531
You wrote that you were ill.

806
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:48,824
Don't worry,
it won't be for long.

807
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,067
- Stop.
- No, it's true.

808
01:12:50,151 --> 01:12:51,444
I was told it in a dream.

809
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:52,820
There.
It was only a bad dream.

810
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:54,530
Yes, and I'm only going
to die having your baby.

811
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,416
That's all nonsense.
Tell me it is.

812
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,877
Tell me it is.

813
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,297
You love me, only me.

814
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,175
Your note said
your husband would be out.

815
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:08,844
He was late.
It serves him right.

816
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:13,474
And you...

817
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:15,601
Why do you call him
my husband?

818
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:17,144
He isn't my husband,
he's a clock.

819
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,147
But it was awkward. My honor.
You made an agreement.

820
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,192
Do you think of your honor when you're
sharing whores with your Colonel?

821
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:24,985
Your demon again?

822
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:28,489
I'll be glad to die
before you start to hate me.

823
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:29,907
Anna.

824
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:33,368
Put your hand there.

825
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:36,622
You can feel him move.

826
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:41,668
I respectfully ask
Minister Karenin

827
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:47,341
whether his proposals for the regulation
of these colorful gypsy tribes

828
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:51,261
of these scholarly,
God-fearing Jews, and of...

829
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:55,974
But I'm afraid I've lost
the Minister's attention.

830
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,520
Who is here?

831
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:01,355
Only Madame,
Your Excellency.

832
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,238
I wanted to see him because...

833
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:12,908
I do not wish to know why a
woman wants to see her lover.

834
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,993
What are you doing?

835
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,620
I want his letters!

836
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:24,670
lam going to Moscow tomorrow,
and then the provinces

837
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:27,673
with a commission to investigate
conditions among the Jews and gypsies,

838
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:30,676
whose conditions
I infinitely prefer to my own.

839
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:35,097
I will not return to this house until
divorce has driven you into the street.

840
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,474
Meanwhile, my son will be sent
to live with my eldest sister.

841
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,144
No, Alexei, please.
Please, leave me Serozha!

842
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,604
Do you think
I would let you have my son?

843
01:14:42,688 --> 01:14:44,773
You are depraved.
A woman without honor.

844
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:47,985
I thank God the curse of
love is lifted from me.

845
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,296
I need your advice.

846
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:16,638
- Come on, come on!
- Yes, yes.

847
01:15:21,185 --> 01:15:23,353
Right, after you,
after you.

848
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:25,189
- Are we late?
- Of course, you're late.

849
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:27,399
I'm Countess Nordston.

850
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:30,235
We nearly met at the
Shcherbatskys' last winter.

851
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,778
Come into the fold.

852
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:33,238
Come on.

853
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:38,952
You've been waiting for me.
Forgive me.

854
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:42,497
Kitty is here.

855
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:49,129
Konstantin, what a long time
since we saw each other.

856
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,299
Since you saw me, but I
saw you not so long ago.

857
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,675
When?

858
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,636
You were driving
to Ergoshovo.

859
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:57,137
I was at Kashin
for the haymaking.

860
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,388
Oh, but why didn't you

861
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,140
I'm so glad to see you.

862
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:02,726
You're just the same.

863
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:06,521
I hope not.

864
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,524
I was young and silly
in those days.

865
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:11,485
Months and months ago.

866
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:16,865
And you haven't changed.

867
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,161
No. I haven't.

868
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:29,378
Permit me to announce,
um, soup Marie-Louise carp

869
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:31,546
with asparagus
and roast beef.

870
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,632
I went to the market
in person.

871
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,345
An extra place.

872
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,934
I've come to tell you our
connection must be severed.

873
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:46,520
I'm going to
divorce your sister.

874
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,147
Divorce?

875
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:53,068
Oh, dear me, what are you
talking about?

876
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:54,778
Well, don't be in a hurry.
Stay to dinner.

877
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,113
And later, you can talk
it over with Dolly.

878
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:58,115
Prince Oblonsky, everything
is over between our families.

879
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:01,076
Alexei, divorce is one thing.
Dinner is quite another.

880
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:05,122
You Petersburgers
think yourselves so de bon ton

881
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:08,333
compared with dull,
old-fashioned Moscow.

882
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:10,711
But we know
how to do things.

883
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:11,920
Only the other day,

884
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,923
I hear Vasya Pryachnikov fought a
duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

885
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,091
Well, what...

886
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,801
What was the challenge about?

887
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:19,511
Pryachnikov's wife,
naturally.

888
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:21,305
It was a matter
of honor, defending a woman's honor.

889
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:25,017
Sounds like barbarism to me.
What if the lover had killed the husband?

890
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,686
Would that have preserved
the wife's honor, too?

891
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:30,314
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

892
01:17:30,522 --> 01:17:31,732
Love?

893
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:34,901
"Thou shall not covet
thy neighbor's wife."

894
01:17:44,453 --> 01:17:47,622
Would you die for love,
Konstantin Dmitrievich?

895
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:50,083
I would. But not for
my neighbor's wife.

896
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:56,673
An impure love
is not love to me.

897
01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,926
To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

898
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,597
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

899
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,599
a kind of gluttony,

900
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,685
and a misuse of something
sacred, which is given to us

901
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:12,105
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfill our humanness.

902
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:16,985
Otherwise,
we might as well be cattle.

903
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:18,695
Ah! An idealist!

904
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:27,579
But she will be
nobody's wife.

905
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,331
She'll be ruined.

906
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:33,043
I tried to save her.
She chose ruin.

907
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,087
Alexei Alexandrovich.

908
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:36,797
Look at me.

909
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:42,469
You will have no peace of mind
until you forgive her.

910
01:18:44,012 --> 01:18:45,972
It was Anna
who taught me that.

911
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:47,599
I do not wish to forgive.

912
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:49,559
I'm not a cruel man.

913
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,686
I've never hated anyone.

914
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:53,855
But I hate her
with all my soul

915
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:56,441
for all the wrong
she has done me.

916
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:00,946
Now, it is your turn
to play us something, Countess.

917
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:03,073
I thought you'd never ask.

918
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,616
Very good.

919
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,787
Since we last met,

920
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,957
there is something I have
often wanted to ask you.

921
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,583
What is that?

922
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,595
This.

923
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,183
Do...

924
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,060
Not...

925
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,317
Did.

926
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:43,029
Did not.

927
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,544
The last word is "never."

928
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,033
I know what it says.

929
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:35,350
Then.

930
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:40,021
But now?

931
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,948
Can you forgive

932
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:53,201
and forget?

933
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:11,761
I never stopped.

934
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,013
Why doesn't he come?

935
01:23:38,223 --> 01:23:41,267
He is kind.
He will forgive me.

936
01:23:44,312 --> 01:23:45,605
Her fever is higher.

937
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:48,108
I want Alexei.
Why doesn't he come?

938
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,402
Give me some water.
No, I mustn't.

939
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,487
It isn't good
for my little girl.

940
01:23:52,654 --> 01:23:54,489
Or let her have a nurse, yes.

941
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,659
Don't bring her here
because Alexei is coming

942
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:59,703
and it will hurt him
to see her.

943
01:23:59,828 --> 01:24:01,996
He's come, my dear.
Look there.

944
01:24:02,497 --> 01:24:04,999
Her deliverance
is still in God's hands.

945
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,628
You think he won't forgive
me but you don't know him.

946
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:11,631
No one knows him
except me.

947
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,467
I'm not afraid of him, now.

948
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,763
I'm afraid of death, though.

949
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:22,851
Oh.

950
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,650
You poor man.

951
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,364
Let him come closer.

952
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:39,784
Alexei.

953
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:44,414
Alexei.

954
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:00,513
Look at my husband.

955
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:03,016
He's a saint.

956
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:05,560
Take his hand.

957
01:25:21,951 --> 01:25:23,286
Thank God.

958
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:26,289
Thank God.

959
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:45,058
You must leave now.

960
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:48,978
I promise to send for you
if she asks for you.

961
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:52,690
I don't know
what happened to me.

962
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:55,902
I forgive you.
I forgive Anna.

963
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,532
My soul is filled
with joy.

964
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:05,578
I will remain with her
and look after her forever.

965
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,418
Come now.

966
01:26:19,843 --> 01:26:21,094
Come now.

967
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,388
Look at you.

968
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:27,308
You look like what you've become.
A laughingstock.

969
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,770
I fancy you will be asked
to leave the regiment.

970
01:26:30,854 --> 01:26:32,355
I would like you
to go, Maman.

971
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:34,107
I'll go when I'm ready to go.

972
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,734
A little affair
with a married woman

973
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:38,695
puts a finishing touch
to a young man's education.

974
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:41,281
But this morbid,
selfish obsession...

975
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:42,740
You've publicly
humiliated yourself

976
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:44,534
and dishonored a man who has
devoted his life to Russia.

977
01:26:45,702 --> 01:26:48,621
So you'd better come back
to Moscow with me.

978
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:50,665
You're finished here.

979
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:15,189
And there was her husband,
wearing her best ball gown.

980
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,400
Rouge all over his face.

981
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:20,904
Ma chére, le scandale!

982
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:26,034
But I'd better tell you
some regimental news.

983
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,368
Who is here?

984
01:27:27,452 --> 01:27:31,706
Princess Elisabeth Federovna
Tverskaya, Your Excellency.

985
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,042
I don't want to see him.

986
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:37,253
But surely your husband
wouldn't stop...

987
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,589
I'm so glad
to see you.

988
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:40,798
You look feverish.

989
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:42,926
We've been talking too much,
so I'm going.

990
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:44,928
Princess Betsy
came to tell me...

991
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:48,014
I don't want to hide
anything from you.

992
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:51,601
Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye.
He's going away.

993
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:57,231
I've told him
that I can't receive him.

994
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:01,694
Well, goodbye,
my treasure.

995
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:26,427
I agree with you.

996
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:29,013
As he is going away, there's no
need for Count Vronsky to come.

997
01:28:29,097 --> 01:28:31,057
I just said so, so there's
no need to repeat it.

998
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,475
But it is for you
to decide.

999
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,769
Yes, and I decided.

1000
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:35,853
Then I am very glad that...

1001
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:38,773
That we agree, so perhaps we
can stop talking about it.

1002
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,776
Of course.
Is there anything I can do for you?

1003
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:46,531
Yes, can you please, please, please
stop cracking your knuckles?

1004
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,746
I'm a bad woman.

1005
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,751
But I can't breathe.

1006
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:02,964
Your kindness, which I can't
repay, and your forgiveness...

1007
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:05,925
You begged me
for my forgiveness.

1008
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:07,593
But I didn't die, and now
I have to live with it.

1009
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:10,513
Then what? What do you want?

1010
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:13,891
Do you know what you want?
Do you want to see Count Vronsky?

1011
01:29:13,975 --> 01:29:16,102
Not to say goodbye.

1012
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:21,065
I can't hear.

1013
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:23,776
Not to say goodbye.

1014
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:30,616
You would be lost.
Irretrievably lost.

1015
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:33,286
You would have no position.

1016
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:36,831
And worse, if we divorce,
you would be the guilty party.

1017
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:39,500
That means you cannot
legally remarry.

1018
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:43,004
Your union with Count Vronsky
would be illegitimate,

1019
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:45,673
as would your daughter, who now
has the protection of my name.

1020
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:47,759
And this is what
you want?

1021
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:53,139
It would be a sin
to help you destroy yourself.

1022
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:55,016
You forget something.

1023
01:29:56,392 --> 01:30:00,104
Count Vronsky and I
love each other.

1024
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:05,443
And this love sanctifies
a criminal folly?

1025
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:07,361
All I know
is that I sent him away

1026
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:09,947
and it's as if I'd shot
myself through the heart!

1027
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:15,411
I see.

1028
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:21,375
And what of Serozha?

1029
01:30:23,795 --> 01:30:25,671
I would die for him,

1030
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,217
but I won't live
like this for him.

1031
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,805
When he knows of love,
he will forgive me.

1032
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:40,311
Then I must choose
the smaller sin.

1033
01:30:41,187 --> 01:30:44,982
Vronsky has robbed me of my cloak
and I will give him my coat.

1034
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:46,484
No, I...

1035
01:31:14,387 --> 01:31:16,597
My darling. My darling.

1036
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:20,518
You look so pale.

1037
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:22,145
Oh, my darling.

1038
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:26,566
We'll go south
to the sea air and sunshine.

1039
01:32:31,923 --> 01:32:34,967
Is it all right?
Sit down a minute.

1040
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:38,095
I want to see everything.

1041
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:43,017
A moment.

1042
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:48,064
And now I'm doing
kitchenmaid's work

1043
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:51,025
because Nadya's parents won't
let her set foot in the house.

1044
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:53,694
And who can blame them?
It's indecent

1045
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,360
It's Konstantin.

1046
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:37,363
Yes, good.

1047
01:33:38,281 --> 01:33:40,366
The doctor here is useless.

1048
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:43,202
Get me one from Moscow.

1049
01:33:44,704 --> 01:33:46,372
Where did you go?

1050
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,460
I asked for you everywhere
when I was getting married.

1051
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:01,971
I'm sorry.
I couldn't leave him.

1052
01:34:02,388 --> 01:34:04,932
Yes. My wife...

1053
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:08,561
You can't stay now.

1054
01:34:12,732 --> 01:34:14,900
I will nurse him
with Agafia.

1055
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,820
The woman will find
somewhere in the village.

1056
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,613
You won't see her.

1057
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:23,034
She knows it is impossible
to meet you.

1058
01:34:24,327 --> 01:34:26,704
It is a torment to me that I've
brought you under the same roof

1059
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:29,874
as this unfortunate...
As this fallen...

1060
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:33,252
And in your precious,
delicate condition.

1061
01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:36,339
Oh, Kostya.

1062
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:42,053
Good. A clean nightshirt
and sheets.

1063
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:44,805
A towel and a clean
pail of warm water.

1064
01:34:45,473 --> 01:34:46,515
Wait.

1065
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:52,813
And bring
the perfume bottle,

1066
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:56,067
in the outside pocket
of my handbag.

1067
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:17,356
Twenty-one to Stremov, four to Karenin.
The motion is carried.

1068
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,878
Alexei, they're back.

1069
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:41,714
Here, in St. Petersburg.

1070
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:43,924
She has written to me.

1071
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,885
To you?

1072
01:36:57,229 --> 01:37:00,149
They think I don't have
the right to refuse.

1073
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,067
It's the boy's birthday.

1074
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:04,153
My friend,

1075
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:10,201
you would be blowing on the embers of
a fire which must be allowed to die.

1076
01:37:12,745 --> 01:37:14,246
Let me write to her.

1077
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,377
I'm here to see Serozha.

1078
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:04,797
Madame?

1079
01:38:09,093 --> 01:38:11,512
I beg your pardon,
Your Excellency.

1080
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,227
No, I've come
to see Serozha.

1081
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:38,539
Serozha.

1082
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:40,040
Maman?

1083
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,208
Oh.

1084
01:38:41,834 --> 01:38:43,168
My dear little boy.

1085
01:38:43,252 --> 01:38:45,129
I knew you would come.

1086
01:38:45,838 --> 01:38:47,089
Today is my birthday.

1087
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,674
I know.

1088
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:51,093
Are you crying?

1089
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:52,344
No, I won't cry.

1090
01:38:53,137 --> 01:38:54,430
Where did you
go, Maman?

1091
01:38:54,513 --> 01:38:56,265
I don't know.

1092
01:38:56,473 --> 01:38:58,392
Everywhere. The south.

1093
01:38:59,852 --> 01:39:02,021
I thought about you
every day.

1094
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:05,691
And I thought
about you every day.

1095
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:10,779
And you must love Papa.
He's better than I am.

1096
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,824
No one in the whole world
is better than you.

1097
01:39:32,009 --> 01:39:33,052
No.

1098
01:40:08,087 --> 01:40:09,338
Where's Anya?

1099
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:11,173
She's still asleep.

1100
01:40:12,758 --> 01:40:14,718
Should I take your coat?

1101
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:19,932
Are you feeling
unwell, madam?

1102
01:40:20,015 --> 01:40:21,642
I'm not sleeping.

1103
01:40:22,309 --> 01:40:24,436
I can send out
for something.

1104
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:26,271
Yes.

1105
01:40:48,502 --> 01:40:50,462
Why are you in the dark?

1106
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:53,757
Yashvin is going to call.
You remember him.

1107
01:40:54,133 --> 01:40:55,175
Are you going out?

1108
01:40:55,759 --> 01:40:57,052
To where?

1109
01:40:58,262 --> 01:40:59,471
To whom?

1110
01:40:59,805 --> 01:41:01,473
What's the matter?

1111
01:41:02,474 --> 01:41:03,851
I didn't know
what happened to you.

1112
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:05,394
But I told you
yesterday. My brother.

1113
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:08,313
Does it take all day
to meet your brother?

1114
01:41:08,564 --> 01:41:10,649
Does he need you
more than I do?

1115
01:41:11,066 --> 01:41:12,526
What's happened?

1116
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,907
Well, Alexander agreed
to everything.

1117
01:41:18,991 --> 01:41:20,701
Mother's house in Moscow
will go to him,

1118
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:23,704
and the country estate
will be our new home.

1119
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:28,417
As soon as the divorce.

1120
01:41:29,877 --> 01:41:32,588
Karenin hasn't answered
your letter yet?

1121
01:41:37,342 --> 01:41:39,762
You're the very first person to
call on me since our return.

1122
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:42,097
I received a note
from Princess Betsy

1123
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:45,100
asking me to call on her
between 6:30 and 8:00.

1124
01:41:45,184 --> 01:41:46,852
Or was it 7:00?

1125
01:41:47,186 --> 01:41:49,730
But perhaps you'll meet
at the opera tonight.

1126
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,774
I would love to be there
if I could get a box.

1127
01:41:52,024 --> 01:41:53,650
Madame, your box
is number four.

1128
01:41:54,193 --> 01:41:56,695
You'll find me there
with Princess Myagkaya.

1129
01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:58,864
Will you come, Vronsky?

1130
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:05,996
Well... I see why Alexei
is so fond of you.

1131
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:15,088
You know you can't
go to the theater.

1132
01:42:15,172 --> 01:42:16,924
- Annushka!
- For heaven's sake.

1133
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,342
A bath! I'll come in
and choose a dress.

1134
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:19,510
Anna, I implore you.

1135
01:42:19,593 --> 01:42:21,970
I'm not ashamed of who I am
or what I've done.

1136
01:42:22,054 --> 01:42:23,806
Are you ashamed for me?

1137
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:26,600
Why don't you book
a room at the hotel?

1138
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:28,393
Aren't we together?

1139
01:42:29,186 --> 01:42:30,229
Have you changed towards me?

1140
01:42:30,312 --> 01:42:31,814
It's because I love you
and care about you.

1141
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:33,690
If that's the case, then I don't
know why you aren't coming with me.

1142
01:42:33,774 --> 01:42:34,775
That would make it worse.

1143
01:42:34,858 --> 01:42:36,360
You're afraid.

1144
01:42:36,777 --> 01:42:38,278
Well, I'm not.

1145
01:43:17,109 --> 01:43:19,278
Should we visit,
or stay put?

1146
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:21,154
Stay put.

1147
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,201
Minister! Congratulations.

1148
01:43:26,869 --> 01:43:28,662
Come in for a moment.

1149
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:50,517
Princess
Sorokina and her daughter.

1150
01:43:50,601 --> 01:43:53,937
They're from Moscow, neighbors
of Count Vronsky's mother.

1151
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:57,524
Quite well off. No sons.
She's a widow.

1152
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,862
My dear,
I'm a sales catalog.

1153
01:44:10,203 --> 01:44:11,413
Alexei.

1154
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:16,543
You'll come up
to see us afterwards?

1155
01:44:17,002 --> 01:44:18,754
I'll talk to Varya.

1156
01:44:22,883 --> 01:44:24,217
Will you call on Anna?

1157
01:44:24,343 --> 01:44:27,804
Oh. Alexei. I'm fond of...

1158
01:44:27,888 --> 01:44:28,931
For God's sake!

1159
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:32,392
Anna isn't a criminal.

1160
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:35,395
I'd call on her if she'd
only broken the law.

1161
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:38,106
But she broke the rules.

1162
01:44:53,455 --> 01:44:56,708
Who has made the décor?
Haven't we got a program?

1163
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,543
Colonel, would you
be so kind?

1164
01:44:58,627 --> 01:44:59,670
Of course.

1165
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:03,340
Please, I would be honored
if you would take mine.

1166
01:45:03,548 --> 01:45:05,384
Thank you. How very...

1167
01:45:08,053 --> 01:45:09,096
It's a disgrace.

1168
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:10,555
Hush, dean
A common courtesy.

1169
01:45:15,435 --> 01:45:17,145
Everyone's looking.

1170
01:45:17,229 --> 01:45:20,065
Let them look!
Fetch my cloak.

1171
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:22,734
What are we coming to?

1172
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:25,862
It's an insult to decency.
Take me home.

1173
01:45:25,946 --> 01:45:29,408
Hush. I beg you, my dear.
It was only a word or two.

1174
01:45:29,616 --> 01:45:31,034
I have a word or two
for some people

1175
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:32,953
one didn't expect
to be rubbing shoulders with.

1176
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:37,624
She has a nerve, flaunting
herself like a slut in society.

1177
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,296
Yes, why don't you?

1178
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:45,716
Rescue her and put your
seal on the fiasco.

1179
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:02,649
Alexei

1180
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:05,110
you see why
she must divorce.

1181
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:09,406
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

1182
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,533
As far as I'm concerned,
she's my wife.

1183
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:13,618
As you saw, she isn't.

1184
01:46:15,871 --> 01:46:17,539
We're going to Moscow, then
to my place in the country.

1185
01:46:18,123 --> 01:46:19,624
That sounds
like a good idea.

1186
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:21,376
But, for a day or two,
Anna will be at home.

1187
01:46:23,795 --> 01:46:24,838
Then“.

1188
01:46:26,715 --> 01:46:28,508
I'll say goodbye now.

1189
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,655
Well, you had
an excellent night.

1190
01:46:52,699 --> 01:46:55,285
Does your mother want you to
marry the widow or the child?

1191
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:58,330
Either one.
Don't joke about it

1192
01:46:58,413 --> 01:47:02,209
If you loved me, you would have
looked me in to stop me going!

1193
01:47:18,141 --> 01:47:19,935
Yes, it was my fault.

1194
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:34,908
I won't sleep.

1195
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:40,997
I know how
to make you sleep.

1196
01:48:35,802 --> 01:48:39,055
Anna, I am very glad
to see you.

1197
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:41,766
Are you well?
How is your little one?

1198
01:48:43,602 --> 01:48:46,688
Stiva wanted to invite you and
Count Vronsky to the house,

1199
01:48:46,771 --> 01:48:48,356
but it's impossible.

1200
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,941
No, I understand.

1201
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:51,943
No. No, you don't.

1202
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:54,946
Kitty and her husband
are with us.

1203
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:56,907
She's in Moscow
to have the baby.

1204
01:48:56,990 --> 01:49:00,285
Kitty! Tell her
how pleased I am.

1205
01:49:00,994 --> 01:49:03,288
Perhaps I'll wait
a year or two.

1206
01:49:05,248 --> 01:49:06,291
Love.

1207
01:49:08,168 --> 01:49:09,502
Yes, love.

1208
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,968
Don't you disapprove of me
for what I've done?

1209
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:20,639
No. I wish I'd done the same

1210
01:49:21,139 --> 01:49:22,891
But no one asked me.

1211
01:49:24,226 --> 01:49:27,729
Well, I wouldn't have been
brave enough.

1212
01:49:29,231 --> 01:49:31,066
Stiva, you know,

1213
01:49:31,691 --> 01:49:33,360
he doesn't change.

1214
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:36,446
Like all men, I suppose.

1215
01:50:37,966 --> 01:50:39,551
I had an inspiration.

1216
01:50:39,718 --> 01:50:40,927
Why do we have to wait here?

1217
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:42,804
Why can't we wait
in the country?

1218
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:45,140
I don't want to hear any more about
a divorce or think about it.

1219
01:50:45,223 --> 01:50:46,850
Good, I'm bored here.
When should we go?

1220
01:50:47,309 --> 01:50:49,227
If I bore you here,
I'll bore you in the country.

1221
01:50:49,394 --> 01:50:51,938
I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores me.
When should we go? Tomorrow?

1222
01:50:52,314 --> 01:50:53,648
I can't be ready by tomorrow.

1223
01:50:53,732 --> 01:50:54,899
- The day after, then.
- If you like.

1224
01:50:54,983 --> 01:50:57,902
No, wait, that's Sunday.
I have to see Maman.

1225
01:50:58,236 --> 01:50:59,571
That's 20 minutes away
on the train.

1226
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:01,906
You could go
to see her tomorrow.

1227
01:51:03,158 --> 01:51:05,910
Or was it that you wanted to spend
Sunday with Princess Sorokina?

1228
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:08,413
Please.
Don't spoil everything.

1229
01:51:08,913 --> 01:51:11,833
I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't
have read the papers she has to sign.

1230
01:51:12,459 --> 01:51:14,085
In that case,
let's not bother.

1231
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:16,087
- I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
- That's absurd.

1232
01:51:16,171 --> 01:51:18,923
It's absurd to you because you have
no understanding of my life here.

1233
01:51:19,466 --> 01:51:21,843
- Anna.
- No, you've stopped loving me.

1234
01:51:22,594 --> 01:51:25,221
You've given up everything for me
and it's turned you against me.

1235
01:51:25,347 --> 01:51:27,098
- Why lie about it?
- Stop!

1236
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:29,768
I put off our departure for a day or
two and you tell me I don't love you.

1237
01:51:30,143 --> 01:51:32,020
Because I've been living off
your love and there's none left.

1238
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,188
So this is over. Finished.

1239
01:51:47,285 --> 01:51:48,620
I'm sorry.

1240
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:00,006
I don't mind when we go.

1241
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:02,300
I'll telegraph Maman.
We'll go on Sunday.

1242
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:04,260
I'll do anything you want.

1243
01:52:04,386 --> 01:52:07,472
- You should leave me.
- I don't want to. I love you.

1244
01:52:08,181 --> 01:52:09,265
Why?

1245
01:52:10,475 --> 01:52:13,478
You can't ask "why"
about love.

1246
01:52:39,546 --> 01:52:41,673
So, will you be all packed?

1247
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,426
I'll be out today
making the arrangements.

1248
01:52:44,509 --> 01:52:46,302
Is that your way of telling
me you'll be at your mother's

1249
01:52:46,386 --> 01:52:47,720
with that simpering
little princess?

1250
01:52:47,804 --> 01:52:50,640
No. I'll be at my lawyer's,
waiting for some documents.

1251
01:52:50,723 --> 01:52:52,600
Then I'm having dinner to say
goodbye to old comrades.

1252
01:52:52,684 --> 01:52:53,726
I know what that means.

1253
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:56,312
My God, this is unendurable!

1254
01:52:58,189 --> 01:52:59,441
I can invite them here,
if you like.

1255
01:52:59,524 --> 01:53:02,318
Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine
in society, I won't eat with the band.

1256
01:53:02,402 --> 01:53:06,030
Who was the telegram from?

1257
01:53:06,448 --> 01:53:09,159
I didn't show you because Stiva keeps
telegraphing what we already know.

1258
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:10,869
Karenin promises nothing,
but will consider...

1259
01:53:10,952 --> 01:53:14,038
I told you I don't care about the
divorce, so why hide the telegram?

1260
01:53:24,799 --> 01:53:27,510
Is there anything
you wish to say to me?

1261
01:54:02,128 --> 01:54:03,796
So it's the child.

1262
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:06,090
She brought papers
from Maman.

1263
01:54:11,262 --> 01:54:12,347
Anna.

1264
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:33,451
No.

1265
01:58:07,457 --> 01:58:08,833
Oh, God.

1266
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,002
Forgive me.

1267
01:58:47,955 --> 01:58:50,833
I'll be buying in feed
before winter's over.

1268
01:58:50,917 --> 01:58:54,462
Well, you don't press people
hard, but you live rightly.

1269
01:58:55,296 --> 01:58:57,840
For your soul
not your belly

1270
01:59:00,718 --> 01:59:02,470
How do we know
what's rightly?

1271
01:59:02,804 --> 01:59:05,139
Just by knowing it.
How else?

1272
01:59:05,932 --> 01:59:09,185
But I believe in reason.

1273
01:59:09,644 --> 01:59:12,939
Reason. Was it reason that
made you choose your wife?

1274
01:59:40,132 --> 01:59:42,051
I came looking for you.

1275
01:59:44,428 --> 01:59:46,097
I understood something.

1276
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:48,391
What did you understand?

1277
02:00:01,654 --> 02:00:03,281
He smiled at me.

1278
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:05,658
He's very advanced
for his age.

1279
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:10,621
What did you understand?

1280
02:00:27,889 --> 02:00:29,765
I'm so proud of you.

1281
02:00:29,849 --> 02:00:31,517
Night-night.

1282
02:00:46,115 --> 02:00:47,158
And you, too.

1283
02:00:47,241 --> 02:00:49,785
Good night, my darling boy.

1284
02:01:10,348 --> 02:01:11,849
Anya!

1285
02:01:13,225 --> 02:01:14,560
Anya!

1286
02:01:16,854 --> 02:01:18,230
Anya!

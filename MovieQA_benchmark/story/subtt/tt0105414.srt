1
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,120
- So how many kids do we want?
- What's the statistical norm?

2
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,760
You and your statistics.

3
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,320
- 1.2.
- Okay, then I want 2.2.

4
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,960
- And I want them to look like you.
- Poor kids.

5
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,840
If I can get you off the computer
tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
- Is this gonna be a real wedding?
- As opposed to a fake one?

7
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,720
Sam, you've already been through
the big ceremony.

8
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,440
That was the fake one.
This is the real one.

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,320
You can have any kind of wedding
you want. Underwater. In a sauna.

10
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
Horseback.

11
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
Naked skydiving?

12
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,920
I've not been in New York
long enough to know many people.

13
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,120
- Except me.
- Well, you're invited.

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,640
And my friend Graham upstairs.

15
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,560
It won't be long before you know
half the people in New York.

16
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,160
People like you...
but I found you first.

17
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,680
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Hold on a second.

19
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,880
- Sam, it's your ex-wife.
- What?

20
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,720
It's Lisa.

21
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,800
Because... I'm hanging up now.

22
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,240
I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

23
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,440
It's where you live. She's entitled.

24
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,760
Don't answer it.

25
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,480
- Why does she do this?
- Talk to her. You're already up.

26
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,440
I'll get that.

27
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Would youpick up the phone, please?
Don't do this to me.

28
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,720
- Afteryou left this afternoon...
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?

29
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,720
- You come andsleep with me...
- Allie, shut that thing off.

30
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Yousaid you were going to call.
Yousaid you'd call.

31
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay... goodbye.

32
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,960
I take it back. She's not entitled.

33
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,680
I didn't go over there
intending to sleep with her, Allie.

34
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,280
She's depressed. She heard we were
getting married. She was drunk.

35
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,560
- I don't want to hearthis!
- She makes me feel guilty.

36
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,440
- It won'thappen again.
- Am Isupposed to trustyou now?.

37
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
- It's 4 a. m.!
- It's me, Graham.

38
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
- Allie?
- I'm sorry...

39
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
Sam left. I told him to.

40
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,960
I can't be alone tonight...
so I came up here.

41
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,680
Allie, I let you sleep.
It's about 10.

42
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,320
I've got an important meeting.

43
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,480
- I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
- No, it's worth the wait.

44
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,840
You can redefine your product
on-screen with my software.

45
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,680
This is a marketing tool
that no one else has.

46
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,440
- Who do I get to run it?
- Training is included in the quote.

47
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,440
The quote...
That's the one thing I haven't seen.

48
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Best for last.

49
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
You'll find that's reasonable...
as a ballpark.

50
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,360
Here's where
I was thinking of playing.

51
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
It makes sense.

52
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,280
I made a phone call
to your former partner.

53
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,800
It was not a friendly split.
I did all the work.

54
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,960
She took all the credit and
she didn't like me telling her so.

55
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,280
In the settlement you got all the
hardware and a rent-controlled flat.

56
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,560
That means your overhead is minimal,
as is your client list.

57
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,320
I could improve that if you're
as good as you say you are.

58
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,600
But that
is the only way to prove it.

59
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,800
- I could go for something...
- No, don't embarrass yourself.

60
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,880
That's my final offer. Of course,
if you'd like to think about it...

61
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,680
I'll get this.

62
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
- It'll be on my expense report.
- I look forward to it.

63
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,280
No messages.

64
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,040
What is this? "You're Nobody
Till Somebody Loves You. "

65
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,040
It's just living alone and cooking
for one. It's just too depressing.

66
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,840
There are worse things
than being on your own.

67
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,640
- I should go home.
- You came here for a reason.

68
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,040
You think I'd let some guy
interfere with my acting career?

69
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,360
If I had a career...
or a guy to interfere with it.

70
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,680
- You'll find someone again.
- Maybe.

71
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,280
The point is,
if I don't... I don't.

72
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
- I know. I can do it on my own.
- Absolutely.

73
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,840
I'll just get a room-mate.

74
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,240
You could always call him.

75
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
Not if I have a room-mate.

76
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,280
SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE
APARTMENT IN W70S.

77
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,080
NON-SMOKER
PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED

78
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
The managers
couldn't know you lived there.

79
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,280
It's rent-stabilized,
so you couldn't come on the lease.

80
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
Nice...
you could really open 'em up.

81
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,240
Great.

82
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm an incest survivor, you know.
I don't remember, -

83
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,800
- but I know that I survived
something. My therapists think so.

84
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,400
I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning,
anything feminine.

85
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,160
I think this could work. If you
feel the same, give me a call.

86
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,160
Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello?

87
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,720
The front door was open.
Are you Allison Jones?

88
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
Yes... Allie.

89
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm Hedra Carlson.
We spoke on the phone this morning.

90
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,920
Are you sure you're okay?

91
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,280
You know what? I'm not.
Would you come back tomorrow?

92
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,080
- Sit down. I'll make some tea.
- I don't think I had lunch.

93
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,000
It's only this one.
The one in the bathroom works.

94
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I use a wrench.

95
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm so sorry.

96
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,200
If you need a reference,
you can call them at Rizzoli.

97
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,960
Hedra... that's unusual.

98
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,560
I got terrible nicknames growing up,
which I'm not telling you.

99
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,920
Not Hedy? Like Hedy Lamarr?
That's exotic.

100
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,320
I wasn't exotic in grade school...
as opposed to now, right?

101
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,720
They're dry.

102
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,800
- Here.
- Thanks.

103
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,400
You can toss that. He's the reason
I'm looking for a new room-mate.

104
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Will you guys patch things up?
I wouldn't want to move in -

105
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,560
- and then have things change.
It would just be awkward.

106
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,080
Nothing will change, except
for now my faucets will work.

107
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,600
- When can you move in?
- No, really?

108
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

109
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,040
I've got one friend. Graham.
He lives upstairs... but he's gay.

110
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,560
It's not a real friendly building,
but there's no problem with privacy.

111
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,200
You just close your door...
no problem.

112
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,680
I'll leave you alone...
whatever's good for you.

113
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,240
Look, this could be good.

114
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Laundry room.

115
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,840
It's a little creepy at night.

116
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
It's okay in the day,
but lock yourself in.

117
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,760
- This one?
- No, that's the mail key.

118
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,440
This is creepy.

119
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
It's not bad, it's just kind of old.

120
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
Sometimes this gets stuck and
you have to use this screwdriver.

121
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Excuse me.

122
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,760
- Which floor?
- 11.

123
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
14, please.

124
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,680
- Okay.
- Look what I found.

125
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.

126
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Allie, it's Sam.

127
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Where do you guys learn to dress?
I mean, it's just so New York.

128
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,560
I think you look very comfortable.

129
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
Yeah, I never know what looks good.

130
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I think that looks nice,
but with this it would look great.

131
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,800
- What do you think?
- They go great with that dress.

132
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,160
You take them.
I'll borrow them when I want to.

133
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,480
God! I didn't know you were home.

134
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
I was...

135
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,160
You haven't even been here two weeks
and I'm already in your room.

136
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,680
I was just about
to go through your drawers.

137
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,640
That smells nice on you.

138
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:32,160
- I always wanted to try that.
- Sure, anything you want.

139
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
- Share and share alike.
- I don't really know about that.

140
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,760
I'm an only child.
Do you come from a big family?

141
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,000
There's just me.

142
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:55,520
I was supposed to be a twin,
but she was stillborn.

143
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,960
- That's so sad.
- A part of me was always missing.

144
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,800
Allie! God!

145
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:18,000
It's beautiful.
Thank you. What do I owe you?

146
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,680
Nothing.
It's just a little housewarming.

147
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,960
No...

148
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,080
They look beautiful on you.
It's a housewarming.

149
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,560
Thanks, they're great.

150
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,840
No, Sam.

151
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
No, it's not a good time.

152
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm not ready to see you. You're
prolonging something that's over.

153
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,160
There's nothing to talk about.
There's somebody here right now.

154
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Why don't we order some Chinese?

155
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,440
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message.

156
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Allie, are you there?
Pick up.

157
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,320
This is torture forme. I knowyou
need me as much as I need you.

158
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,840
I love you. I'll do anything
foryou,just call me.

159
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,560
Buddy.

160
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,680
What a good clean boy.

161
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,680
Are you going to cheer her up?

162
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Do you think she'll let you stay?

163
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,680
YELLOW LAB PUPPY

No messages.

165
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,040
I know I shouldn't have,
but they were giving him away...

166
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,440
- They said I could bring him back.
- I hope they meant it.

167
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
His name's Buddy.

168
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,560
I had a dog named Buddy
when I was little.

169
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Tomorrow, okay. I promise.

170
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,040
You're working so hard.

171
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,640
- Myerson better refer some clients.
- He wll, you're the best.

172
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,920
Hedy, thanks. I never
would've got it done without you.

173
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,080
I love helping.

174
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Come here. Family portrait.

175
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,160
Ready?

176
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,880
I lived a few weeks
while you loved me.

177
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,400
Goodbye, David.

178
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,240
- Ready to kill her yet?
- Who, Hedy?

179
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,440
No, it's fun
having a girlfriend again.

180
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,520
Good. You were starting
to look like a Kennedy wife.

181
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,040
You were great, Graham. I just
had to spend some time with her.

182
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,400
She needed a lot of help moving in.
Plus, I've been working like crazy.

183
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,440
I've been meaning to come down.
I want to ask you something.

184
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,120
Will you cat sit again?
I have to go to my cousin's wedding.

185
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,680
- Sure, I'll watch Carmen.
- I've made you a set.

186
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,960
Ignore the litter box, I do.
I think I saw your room-mate.

187
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,240
I thought it was you.
Your backpack. This jacket.

188
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,360
But it was someone else.
Very nervous.

189
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,320
That's Hedy. I freaked her out
about people knowing she lives here.

190
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,760
I would've had you down
to meet her... but she's shy.

191
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,800
- Friday?
- I'll make dinner when I get back.

192
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,440
I thought you'd be at work.
Don't tell me we have the same belt.

193
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,720
- Yeah... I have to talk to you.
- Look, cookies for dogs.

194
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,160
- I had to get them.
- Can I just talk to you...

195
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,880
I tried to let you know.

196
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,360
- What are you doing here? Hedy!
- It's not her fault.

197
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,280
I kind of forced my way in here.
I had to see you.

198
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,240
I've got to get out of here now.
Unless you need me...

199
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,240
Why can't you just leave me alone?

200
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,400
You've got to talk to me.
You can't pretend I don't exist.

201
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,120
It's easier that way. Easier on me!

202
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,080
People screw up.
What I did was wrong, I admit it.

203
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,120
But you cut me off. You didn't
take my calls or answer my letter.

204
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,040
You lied to me! If she hadn't
called, would I have found out?

205
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,360
If you want to be nice,
just stay away.

206
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,040
I was hoping we could
put this thing back together.

207
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, I guess we can't.

208
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,080
I didn't get any letter.

209
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,400
I wasn't trying to punish you
by not answering it.

210
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:03,000
- I sent it with the keys.
- I didn't get those, either.

211
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,680
- What did it say?
- Forget the letter.

212
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,720
I love you.
I can't exist without you.

213
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,040
I have no excuse for what I did.
Give me a second chance.

214
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,560
You really hurt me, Sam.

215
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,880
- Where's the biography section?
- At the front, against the wall.

216
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,840
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message.

217
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,720
Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling
to see if you're okay.

218
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,480
Call me at work.
My number's on the fridge.

219
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,760
- Next month should be enough time.
- I'm sure she'll understand.

220
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,440
I mustbe in love with you.
Has ithityou that way?

221
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,840
It's not for you!

222
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,760
- Will itgo on foralways?
- Does anything go on foralways?

223
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,920
One likes to thinksome things do.

224
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,960
Where the hell have you been?

225
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,680
God, what are you doing in my room?

226
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,840
I've been waiting to hear from you.
I've been worried sick.

227
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,520
Buddy was crying.
I came in to comfort him.

228
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:30,160
- Sorry, I just didn't think.
- There's such a thing as a phone.

229
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:38,040
- This is New York. Things happen.
- I'm sorry. It was thoughtless.

230
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
You're making me feel
like I'm 16 years old.

231
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,720
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just... forget it.

232
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,160
- I guess you've patched things up.
- I made him suffer.

233
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,600
Is that an engagement ring?

234
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,520
- It's a beautiful ring.
- Thanks.

235
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm sure you'll be very happy...
and I'll be alone.

236
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,200
You'll find someone, Hedy.
I mean, if I can...

237
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,000
Why don't you look in the mirror?

238
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,880
Look!

239
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,720
You're in a different league.
I know that.

240
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,720
You have this great personality.
You've got this great style.

241
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,960
You're running your own business.

242
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,760
You're always going to find someone.

243
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,560
You'd have to be stupid
to think that you wouldn't.

244
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,720
I guess you and Sam
want to be together.

245
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,320
So I have to move out, right?

246
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,600
Sam's keeping his place for a while.
I know you spent a lot on furniture.

247
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,240
Yeah, your timing is really great!

248
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:41,360
- You promised this wouldn't happen.
- Nothing's happened, come on.

249
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,160
I'll talk to Sam.

250
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Maybe we'll move
if we find some place like this.

251
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,320
We'll figure something out. Okay?

252
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,560
- They're nervous.
- Salesmen have to be sold.

253
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,320
Let's set up a demo.
Something different, maybe at night.

254
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,960
- Open bar, open minds. "F9".
- I'll set it up.

255
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,920
I'll call you tonight
after I check on some things.

256
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,000
"8796, Knox". What's Knox?

257
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,640
Graham Knox.
That was just for last night.

258
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,520
- I admit, I'm very impressed.
- Well, start spreading the word.

259
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I can see I'm not going to be able
to afford you any more.

260
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,920
Great. Press "enter". That's it.

261
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,400
Are you thirsty?

262
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,960
I'll be right back.

263
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,240
You'd know more about that than me.

264
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,880
Allie, do you want a sip?

265
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:47,120
I guess I'll turn in.
Goodnight, Allie. Goodnight, Sam.

266
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
- They're ready.
- Just a minute.

267
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,760
- They'll get cold.
- All right.

268
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,720
No, Rawson is a Norse name.

269
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,680
It's a thoroughly uninteresting
conversation.

270
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Are we going?

271
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,360
- Scrambled or fried?
- This is fine.

272
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,920
Sweetheart,
this isn't all that urgent.

273
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,280
This apartment thing
can wait till I get back.

274
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,960
Why don't we get away together?
A drive?

275
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,960
Buddy, come here.

276
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,640
- Three's a crowd.
- It's all right, Hedy, he's fine.

277
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,160
- Poor guy's all confused.
- We'll take a day off...

278
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,560
No, I'm fine.

279
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,200
I just didn't get a very good sleep.
Nightmares.

280
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,040
You've got a good day for it
if it doesn't get too hot.

281
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,800
- You don't need to do that.
- I don't mind.

282
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,080
It's clean
when you can't tell I'm here.

283
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,320
If the eggs were okay,
maybe you'd trust me with dinner.

284
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,680
- Do you know when you'll be back?
- We'll be out celebrating tonight.

285
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,240
Really? That's great. Good luck.

286
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,760
Goodbye.

287
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,840
Buddy, come here.

288
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,160
Come here, sweetie.

289
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,640
I know.

290
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,640
Buddy, come!

291
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Fine.

292
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
This is half the size
for twice the price.

293
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,680
- It's easier this way.
- It's a long way from The Victoria.

294
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,400
- Do you think we can smoke her out?
- I couldn't, I'm her only friend.

295
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,320
God, what happened?

296
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Hedy!

297
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,760
- He's dead. Buddy's dead!
- What?

298
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,840
You left the window open.
How could you do that?

299
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,200
I thought we could leave it open.
You fixed it.

300
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,840
- I thought I did.
- It's me.

301
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,800
I interrupted you
when I called you in for breakfast.

302
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,760
- Thanks, that pill helped.
- Are you still leaving tomorrow?

303
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Well, she wants me to.

304
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,480
If I'd just let you finish your work
this morning...

305
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,480
If she blames anybody,
she blames me.

306
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,320
Hi, Mitch.

307
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,360
What?

308
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:48,640
No, I'm just running a little late.
I didn't forget.

309
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,960
Just hold them till five, okay?

310
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,920
You were terrific...
but you know that, don't you?

311
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,680
And I thought
all the guys would resist you.

312
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,320
- As if anyone ever could.
- No, I've got to go.

313
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,360
Hold it. Not so fast.

314
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,240
Now everybody under me
knows more than I do. I hate that.

315
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,640
Find some time for me next week.
It's just a little late tonight.

316
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,240
Please, just a taste.
Something simple.

317
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,440
Right now.

318
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Something simple.

319
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,120
This is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff,
but it does come in handy.

320
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,720
Enter the vendor's name.

321
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,480
J- o-n-e-s.

322
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,160
- A-I-I-i-s-o-n.
- Very good.

323
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,120
"Contract price", "Payment to date",
"Balance outstanding".

324
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,080
- We should've paid you last Friday.
- Barbara will handle it.

325
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,800
Not till I give her the word.

326
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,760
- I hope you're satisfied with me.
- So far.

327
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,480
But this is it.
There ain't much more.

328
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,960
A little fine tuning, that's it.

329
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,480
I would like
to meet your colleagues.

330
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,640
I was thinking
of keeping you to myself.

331
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,440
- What are you doing?
- You're just so tight.

332
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.

333
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,840
Look...
I've been a good boy, haven't I?

334
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,720
And you've been a good girl.
We have nothing to prove any more.

335
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,920
This is your last chance to play
before you're an old married lady.

336
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,000
Let me turn around, okay?

337
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,120
That's better.

338
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
Just a second.

339
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,600
Fucking bitch!

340
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,960
Take this.

341
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,440
I can't believe
I didn't see it coming.

342
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,280
- It's just so humiliating.
- The problem is you're too nice.

343
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,760
Men are pigs.
I don't care how nice they seem.

344
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,040
You always fall for that.

345
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,640
But what I did...

346
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,440
It was like something inside
taking over. It was scary.

347
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:32,080
No, don't turn this around. You're
the victim. He should pay for this.

348
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,200
He'll pay. I set up my programmes.
He'll have to eventually.

349
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,400
It's not about getting paid,
it's about getting even.

350
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,880
You don't understand. It's the
contacts more than the money.

351
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,400
I took the job for the word of mouth
and now that's gone.

352
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,840
- He's put me back to square one.
- Only if you let him.

353
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,160
- What can I do?
- Allie...

354
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,880
Of course, Sam's away.
I didn't want to say anything...

355
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,600
How he could go
the day after Buddy died.

356
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,480
Especially when it was his fault.

357
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,640
- May I speak with your husband?
- Who are you calling?

358
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,840
I know it's late. Tell him it's
Allison Jones, he'll take the call.

359
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,040
Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you
want to hold on to your business?

360
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,160
No, you listen to me, asshole!

361
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:57,240
If you trash me around town, you're
fucked and your family is, too!

362
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,840
It won't just be you.

363
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,400
Let me tell you, he is pissing
in his p. j.'s right now.

364
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,280
Gee, Hedy, I hope
you never get mad at me.

365
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,800
- Hedy, we really have to talk.
- I have a surprise for you.

366
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,080
I'm not up for this today.

367
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,880
It'll be fun. It'll make you
feel better, I promise.

368
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,360
And I'm paying.

369
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
It'll be fine, come on.

370
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,880
You've got to be kidding.

371
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,680
- You should've asked first.
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

372
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,240
This feels so good on my neck.

373
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,320
I didn't think you'd mind.

374
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,960
I'm going to take a shower.

375
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,440
Ellen Besch.

376
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,000
AUTOMATED MAIL
PO BOX 72810, NEW YORK

377
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,960
NINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN
DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC

378
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,040
Sam!

379
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,720
I LOVE YOU, ALLIE
SAM

380
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,120
Do you want me to fix you something
before I go?

381
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,760
No, thanks.
I'm going up to visit Graham.

382
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,600
- I love myself like this.
- Have fun.

383
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,560
I love myself like this.

384
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Taxi!

385
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,240
Don't lose her.
She has something of mine.

386
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,920
- Do you want to play?
- No, thanks.

387
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,440
- Come on, Jim.
- Allie, regular or diet?

388
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,480
- Diet.
- Something's different.

389
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,160
Jim, you look like
my sister's boyfriend.

390
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,720
- Jesus, Allie, what is it?
- You've got to help me, Graham.

391
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,880
Allie?

392
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,720
I'm home.

393
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,800
Allie?

394
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,800
It's like looking atmyself.

395
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,400
Andshe lies.
I found a shoebox in herroom.

396
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,640
Nothingshe told me is true.
She said hertwin died atbirth.

397
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,600
It was in an accident
when she was nine.

398
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,360
And she stole a letter
that Sam wrote me.

399
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,160
- I have to do something.
- Get rid of her.

400
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,120
Call the police ifyou have to.
You've got to getherout

401
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,000
You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

402
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,280
I can't just throw her out
on the street.

403
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,680
- She needs help.
- Do it tonight.

404
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,160
I feel responsible for her.
I'm the only one she has.

405
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,600
Either she's gone by Saturday,
or I go to the police, okay?

406
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,400
- That was very impressive.
- I can be butch when I have to.

407
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,040
I've got a friend who's a shrink.
Maybe he can help her.

408
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,840
- When I talk to her, she may leave.
- Do you want to sleep here tonight?

409
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,160
Don't tempt me. I just needed
to talk it out. Thanks.

410
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,960
- She's not going to chase me out.
- When's Sam coming back?

411
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,160
- Tomorrow.
- That's good.

412
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,840
This is a little embarrassing, but
now we're letting our hair down...

413
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,080
Those old air vents between
our apartments carry sound.

414
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,760
It's a weird acoustic thing.

415
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,920
What do you hear?

416
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,040
Oh, no!

417
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,600
- I'm sorry.
- I should've mentioned it sooner.

418
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,360
You're sure
you want to go down there?

419
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,560
Yeah, she's my problem.
I'll handle it.

420
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,880
Thank you for the tea.
I'll see you tomorrow.

421
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,320
Hedy?

422
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:47,680
This is serious. I know you
can't diagnose over the phone.

423
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,840
I don't know what hypervigilant is.
I've never met the woman.

424
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,160
She could be
infantile or paranoid, whatever.

425
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:13,520
I'll go down and call from there.
She can tell you better than I can.

426
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,320
Thanks.
So you might hear from us.

427
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Love to Jack.
And you're not charging me for this.

428
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,040
Carmen...

429
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,040
- Allie!
- Goodnight.

430
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,040
Hedy?

431
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,840
I'm sorry...

432
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,360
Wait, take it easy.
We just want to get you some help.

433
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,800
Please...
I didn't do anything wrong.

434
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,320
- Take it easy.
- I didn't do anything.

435
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,880
Mr. Besch, you don't know me,
my name is Allison Jones.

436
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,480
I think my room-mate Hedra
is your daughter. Ellen.

437
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:26,200
I'm not sure, really.

438
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,560
She's been
under a lot of stress lately...

439
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:35,360
I'd rather not get into this
on an answering machine.

440
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,520
Could you please give one of us
a call? You must have the number.

441
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,960
It's 212-555-9814.

442
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,040
Don't say I called.

443
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,160
Hedy?

444
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,440
Hedy?

445
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,720
What?

446
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,200
- Are you all right?.
- I can't hear you.

447
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,280
I was starting to worry.
You've been in here so long.

448
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,960
Do you want some camomile tea?

449
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,320
Yeah... that'd be great.

450
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,600
I'm not feeling really well.

451
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,880
Mine always comes
when I'm wearing something nice.

452
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,960
Are you crampy?
Sometimes tea helps.

453
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,440
Something warm. We could talk.

454
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,800
About what?

455
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:26,600
About Sam and I
wanting this place for ourselves.

456
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,520
You need a long engagement
to make sure you can trust him.

457
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,880
Frankly. that's my business.
I'm sorry, but it is.

458
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,240
It's me, isn't it?

459
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,160
I'll change, Allie. I can change.

460
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,880
No, that's not it at all.
You've been a good room-mate.

461
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,200
This is the man I'm going to marry.
I want us to live together.

462
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,720
He will cheat on you again,
that's a promise.

463
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,320
And when he does,
don't come running to me.

464
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,480
I've had it with you.
You're so fucking weak!

465
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,280
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

466
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,640
Allie?

467
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,400
- Is it Sam?
- Ellen, is thatyou?

468
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,040
Talk to me oryourmother.
We miss you. Come home.

469
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,120
Don't call here again.

470
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:06,760
We'llstop sending the cheques.
No doctors this time,just come.

471
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,280
Obscene phone call. New York!

472
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,520
- Find someone else, jerk!
- I'm expecting a call from Sam.

473
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:25,080
Just for a while.
Sam will call back if it's busy.

474
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,840
I'm sorry, Allie. It's no big deal.
I'll find some other place.

475
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
- I don't want you making a mistake.
- I understand.

476
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:41,400
- We'll still be friends.
- Sure.

477
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,520
- Allie?
- No, it's Hedy.

478
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:15,240
- Where are you?
- I just got in. Is she asleep?

479
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:22,160
- Yeah, do you want me to wake her?
- No, tell herto surprise me.

480
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,480
- I'll tell her.
- Goodnight, honey.

481
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,160
Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.

482
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,320
Allie, what are you doing here?

483
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:54,040
- Allie?
- No, not Allie.

484
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,320
Hey, sleepy guy.

485
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,680
I knew it.

486
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,360
- Knew what?
- I told her.

487
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,960
Guys like you don't change.
You can't be faithful.

488
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,320
And now she'll know.

489
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,080
She'll know what?

490
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:42,400
That you came up here and pretended
to be her? What is this hair?

491
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,600
You're n her clothes.
You're wearing her perfume!

492
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,920
You knew it was me.

493
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:59,240
You knew and you didn't care.

494
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,400
I think she should know that.

495
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,280
You think she's going to thank you
for that news, do you?

496
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:14,480
- You can't understand friendship.
- She can't stand you!

497
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,360
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!

498
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,240
You're too needy.
You're constantly in her face.

499
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,920
She needs me. Who was there for her
when her boss almost raped her?

500
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,080
You were off on a business trip
or screwing someone.

501
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:41,920
- She never told me that.
- That's right, she told me.

502
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,560
So... don't try and make me think
that we're not close.

503
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:53,760
We lean on each other
and we protect each other.

504
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,640
We're best friends.

505
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:05,000
You're nuts, you know that?
I think you're out of your skull.

506
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,240
Yeah, well, sticks and stones...

507
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,040
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

508
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,760
I know you want to save face.
I won't tell her, okay?

509
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,400
Just call her and tell her you're
going back to your ex-wife.

510
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,480
I won't say a word.

511
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,880
You won't have to say a word.
I'll tell her myself.

512
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,960
Fucking bitch!

513
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,480
Goodnight, Miss Jones.

514
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,800
Goodnight.

515
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,160
Hedy?

516
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,880
I hope I didn't wake you.
I got an early start.

517
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:14,760
- You don't have to move out today.
- There, I think that's it.

518
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,920
I hope you don't mind me storing
some stuff in the cage downstairs.

519
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,960
It'll be less bother.

520
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:29,440
Sure, that's fine.
I'm really sorry it didn't work out.

521
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,240
I'd better get this stuff
out of here.

522
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,760
We can have breakfast
when you get back.

523
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,720
Morning Newsbreak...

524
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,240
Police found the body this morning.

525
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,760
Identification ofthe white male of
around 30 years ofage is pending.

526
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:47,640
A witness heard a struggle in room
612, around 4 o'clock this morning.

527
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,400
- Atherton Hotel.
- Sam Rawson's room, please. 612.

528
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,720
I'm sorry, there's been an accident.
Youshouldspeak to the police.

529
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,240
Allie?

530
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
What are you doing?

531
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,120
I just suddenly felt sick.
It was the funniest thing.

532
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,560
I hope I'm not pregnant.

533
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,200
Let me help you.
Let me get you some water.

534
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,480
Drink some.

535
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:33,520
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah, I'm going out for a while.

536
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,400
- I thought you said breakfast?
- Yeah, it's in the blender.

537
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,840
Dressed like that?

538
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,840
I'm going to see Graham.
He called while you were out.

539
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:59,920
Still, if you're not feeling well,
you should wear more than that.

540
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,520
Maybe you're right.

541
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,880
Leave the door open so we can talk.

542
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,360
You know why I think you're sick?

543
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,960
You're upset about Sam.

544
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,480
You know Sam's dead, don't you?

545
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,320
Yeah, we don't have much time.

546
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,360
You didn't do it, Hedy, did you?

547
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,600
You couldn't have!

548
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,320
Why?

549
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,360
Allie, he came in my mouth.

550
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,800
Then he wanted to beat the shit out
of me because I wanted to tell you.

551
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,120
It was an accident.

552
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:27,040
But he deserved it.

553
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:35,160
Come on.
The police will be here soon.

554
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But you shouldn't run.

555
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,400
That'll only make it worse.

556
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,600
You weren't yourself
when you did this.

557
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,280
I know. I was you.

558
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:57,120
Who is this Hedy anyway?

559
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,640
No one's seen her.
She's not on the lease.

560
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,360
There's not even a fingerprint.
I've been cleaning like crazy.

561
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:18,720
- They'd put you away.
- Hedy, it'll never work.

562
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,000
Besides... people have seen you.

563
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:28,880
We'll get a lawyer and a doctor and
they'll explain it to the police.

564
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,000
No.

565
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,720
Why are you making me do this?

566
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:51,240
We're friends, Allie. You'll be
in a lot of trouble without me.

567
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,000
But I'm not going to leave you.

568
01:19:55,160 --> 01:20:00,560
That wouldn't be right.
I won't leave you. Let's go.

569
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,200
Up!

570
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,040
Go!

571
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:18,920
No, up to Graham's.
He's already involved.

572
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,800
- Nobody's home.
- Use these. Go on, hurry up.

573
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,200
He must be sleeping.
We were up late last night.

574
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,720
- Graham?
- He can't hear you.

575
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,800
Wait till you see me.

576
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,040
It was beautiful, but I can't
go around looking like you any more.

577
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,680
Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.

578
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,560
How's that? Good?

579
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,200
23 and 24 are the movie channels.
I've got to cash a pay cheque.

580
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,920
I'll only be gone an hour.
I know how you hate to be alone.

581
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:42,240
When I get back, we'll do
your hair, too. Be good. Bye.

582
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,880
- What's the part this time?
- Excuse me?

583
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:42,840
You're an actress, right?
You're never the same person twice.

584
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I like it. I just thought
the other was more you.

585
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,400
- Maybe next time I'll try blonde.
- Really? I'm flattered. Thanks.

586
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,360
Miss Besch?
Your father's been calling here.

587
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,200
He'll come to New York
if you don't call him.

588
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,800
Do you live here?

589
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:52,320
No, I'm just watching the place.
It's on a timer. I'm sorry.

590
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:58,000
- I have to register a complaint.
- Please, I'll turn it off.

591
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,640
How could you do that?

592
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,640
Everything I've done, I've done
for you. Don't you understand that?

593
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,160
People like you don't care.

594
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,800
Just like that stupid girl in Tampa.
She called my parents, too.

595
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,080
Told them all my secrets.

596
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,440
You want to put me away.

597
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,560
I can't keep making excuses
for you, Allie.

598
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,480
I can't... I can't...

599
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,120
God!

600
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,320
What?

601
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,800
What?

602
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,560
- Please...
- No.

603
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:40,240
Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

604
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,600
It's okay.

605
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:24,040
We've got to get out of here now.

606
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,360
Jesus... Mitch!

607
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,480
- Get in here.
- What?

608
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,560
- What is it?
- Look.

609
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:53,160
It's erasing.

610
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,080
I didn't do anything.

611
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,440
On mine, too!

612
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:17,240
"The last payment from
Fontana Fashions is past due. "

613
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,280
"Contact Allison Jones today or your
data will be irretrievably lost. "

614
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:28,720
"This payment policing programme
is installed on all my software. "

615
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,840
Should I just plug this
in the phone jack?

616
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,880
- You can make reservations on this?
- And you can pay by credit card.

617
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,080
- L.A., right?
- Yeah.

618
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:52,120
- No answer at the first number.
- What about Knox?

619
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:05,560
Busy.
Turn 'em off. Turn 'em all off!

620
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,680
Things are going to be different
in L.A.

621
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,520
- First class?
- Is it worth it?

622
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,920
We can use one of Graham's cards.
I saw his wallet in the living room.

623
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,960
I'll go see.

624
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,000
PLEASE HELP ME.
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

625
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,720
I know I saw it.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

626
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,520
I'M AT 768 W. 74TH STREET

627
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,520
No! No!

628
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,040
Going down.

629
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,520
That's okay...

630
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,800
Excuse me, is this 1203?
Is Graham Knox at home?

631
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:19,040
- No, he's on a cruise.
- I'm looking for Allison Jones?

632
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,200
- Who are you?
- Mitchell Myerson.

633
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,520
She did a job for me.

634
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,560
- She's not on this floor.
- I was down at her apartment.

635
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,880
But I did contact her here once.

636
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:42,000
I'm the only one here
and I never met her. Excuse me.

637
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,320
This is hers. You do know her.

638
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,560
What the fuck is going on here?

639
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,160
Be careful, she's crazy.

640
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,520
Get off of her.

641
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,960
You think she wants you
touching her? Get off her!

642
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,600
Okay, I'm getting up.

643
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:36,200
- Where is she?
- Don't worry, I took care of her.

644
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:08,560
I don't want to try
to be loved any more.

645
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,600
I don't want to be scared any more.

646
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,600
Or to kill any more.
I don't want to kill any more.

647
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,800
I don't want to be alone any more.

648
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:27,400
I don't want
to be anything any more.

649
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:32,000
I don't need a reason
to kill myself...

650
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:35,600
I need a reason not to...

651
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,800
...and there isn't one.

652
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:46,280
You want to say anything special
to anyone?

653
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,680
Okay, "Allison Jones", go on.

654
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:09,360
Now they'll know it was you.

655
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:15,720
No one will believe I wrote that.
I was never that scared.

656
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:23,920
- Well... not like that.
- Of course it's you.

657
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:31,840
I never met anyone
so scared of being alone.

658
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,720
And I saved you from that,
but you don't care.

659
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:46,680
Did you know that identical twins
are never really identical?

660
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,880
There's always one who's prettier.

661
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,440
And the one who's not
does all the work.

662
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:02,200
She used me
and then she left me.

663
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,320
Just like you.

664
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,360
Come on... take them.

665
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:15,640
- Come on, it's nicer this way.
- Okay.

666
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,880
Allie!

667
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,320
Please...

668
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:57,160
I'm not like your sister, Hedy.
Not any more. I'm like you now.

669
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,880
Graham!

670
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,920
I'll kill you!

671
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,960
Get off him!

672
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,680
Graham, stay inside!

673
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,080
EXIT

674
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,160
Allie?

675
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,600
Hey, here you are.

676
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:10,480
Don't make me come get you.

677
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,360
Allie, come out now.

678
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,400
Come on. Come out now!

679
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,120
I'm scared!

680
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,440
Where are you?

681
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,920
Why are you hiding from me?

682
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:32,000
You think I can't find you?
Your shirt is sticking out.

683
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,640
I cried the whole week
ofSam's funeral.

684
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,600
Graham says
that won'tbring him back.

685
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,480
He says I have to startletting go.
He's right.

686
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:31,160
Hedy's parents said
they'd tried to explain to her-

687
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,920
- thathersister's death
wasn'therfault.

688
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:38,760
Butshe neverforgave herself
forsurviving.

689
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:43,600
So every day,
I try to forgive Hedy forSam.

690
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:49,600
Then I try to do what
she couldn't... Forgive myself.

691
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:54,240
I know what can happen
to someone who doesn't.

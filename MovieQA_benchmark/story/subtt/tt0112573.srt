1
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:41,983
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

2
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:45,604
<i>Historians from England will say I am a liar.</i>

3
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:50,735
<i>But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i>

4
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,445
<i>The King of Scotland had died without a son.</i>

5
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,615
<i>And the King of England...</i>

6
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:00,126
<i>... a cruel pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks...</i>

7
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:03,627
<i>... claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.</i>

8
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:06,627
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him...</i>

9
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,348
<i>... and fought each other over the crown.</i>

10
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,138
<i>So Longshanks invited them
to talks of a truce.</i>

11
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:18,899
<i>No weapons. One page only.</i>

12
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,490
<i>One farmer of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace...</i>

13
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,650
<i>... a commoner with his own lands.</i>

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,281
<i>He had two sons: John and William.</i>

15
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,672
I told you to stay!

16
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:42,712
Well, I finished my work.
Where are we going?

17
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,013
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

18
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,133
- Can I come?
- No! Go home, boy!

19
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:51,934
- But I want to go!
- Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand!

20
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:56,434
Away hame, William.

21
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,598
MacAndrews!

22
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:28,019
MacAndrews!

23
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,820
Holy Jesus.

24
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:25,497
- William! William!

25
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:31,128
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

26
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,241
And I say we hit back now!

27
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,741
- We cannae fight them.
- Something's got to be done.

28
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,532
Wallace is right! We fight them!

29
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:01,412
Every nobleman willing to fight
was at that meeting!

30
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:04,873
We cannot beat an army!
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

31
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:08,003
We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.

32
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:12,384
- Now, who's with me?
- I am, Wallace.

33
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:16,844
- All right, all right.
- Aye.

34
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:33,117
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going with you.

35
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,827
Och, are ye?
And what are you going to do?

36
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,997
I'm gonna help.

37
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,958
Aye, and a good help you'd be, too.

38
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,588
But I need you to stay here...

39
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:48,799
...and look after the place for me
while I'm away.

40
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,469
I can fight!

41
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,150
I know! I know you can fight.

42
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,862
But it's our wits that make us men.

43
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:12,702
See ye tomorrow.

44
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,747
- English!
- Get down.

45
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:50,208
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm!

46
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,088
It's up to us, Hamish.

47
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,361
Nah!

48
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,458
Da?

49
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,419
Da?

50
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,510
William.

51
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,140
Come here, lad.

52
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:23,738
<i>De profundis...</i>

53
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,119
<i>... clamavi ad te, Domine.</i>

54
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,169
<i>Domine, exaudi vocem meam.</i>

55
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,710
<i>Fiant aures tuae intendentes...</i>

56
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,011
<i>... in vocem deprecationis meae.</i>

57
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:47,102
<i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</i>

58
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,902
<i>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>

59
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:55,733
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>

60
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:57,653
Amen.

61
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:01,534
Amen.

62
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,920
William.

63
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,631
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

64
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:15,183
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:28,915
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

66
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:32,126
I don't want to leave!

67
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,166
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

68
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,887
But it happened.

69
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,307
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

70
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,728
- The Lord bless thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.

71
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:51,518
You don't speak Latin?

72
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:56,319
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.

73
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,200
The Lord...

74
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,740
...bless thee and keep thee.

75
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,040
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

76
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,581
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee...

77
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,421
...and give thee peace.

78
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:16,302
Amen.

79
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:22,933
<i>Your heart is free.</i>

80
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:27,563
<i>Have the courage to follow it.</i>

81
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,468
What are they doing?

82
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,848
Saying goodbye in their own way.

83
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:04,149
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

84
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,990
It was the same for me and your daddy...

85
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,831
...when our father was killed.

86
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,575
First, learn to use...

87
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,575
...this.

88
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,406
Then I'll teach you... to use...

89
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,876
...this.

90
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,531
<i>Many years later...</i>

91
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,871
<i>... Edward the Longshanks,
King of England...</i>

92
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:36,582
<i>... supervised the wedding of his eldest son,
who would succeed him as king.</i>

93
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:40,503
Amen.

94
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,633
<i>As bride for his son...</i>

95
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:49,144
<i>... Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival...</i>

96
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:53,024
<i>... the King of France.</i>

97
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,968
<i>It was widely whispered
that for the Princess to conceive...</i>

98
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:22,389
<i>... Longshanks would have
to do the honours himself.</i>

99
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:27,689
<i>That may have been
what he had in mind all along.</i>

100
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,400
Scotland...

101
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,611
My land.

102
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:40,491
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

103
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:47,582
But how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

104
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:58,764
Where is my son?

105
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,934
Your pardon, my Lord.

106
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:03,395
He asked me to come in his stead.

107
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,895
I sent for him and he sends you?

108
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:09,815
Shall I leave, my Lord?

109
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:13,156
If he wants his queen to rule
when I am gone...

110
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:19,117
...then by all means stay
and learn how. Please.

111
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,288
Nobles.

112
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,588
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

113
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:31,429
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

114
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,679
Give their nobles estates here in England.

115
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,519
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

116
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:40,690
But, sir, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.

117
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,311
New lands mean new taxes and they're
already taxed for the war in France.

118
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:48,401
Are they?

119
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:52,282
Are they?

120
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,594
The trouble with Scotland...

121
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,594
...is that it's full of Scots.

122
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,775
Perhaps the time has come...

123
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,736
...to reinstitute an old custom.

124
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:27,407
Grant them "primae noctis".

125
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:29,197
First night.

126
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:33,707
When any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married...

127
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:40,919
...our nobles shall have sexual rights to her
on the night of her wedding.

128
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,219
If we can't get them out...

129
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:47,349
...we'll breed them out.

130
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,270
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

131
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,440
Taxes or no taxes, eh?

132
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,561
A most excellent idea, sire.

133
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,441
Is it?

134
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,782
<i>Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

135
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:12,753
<i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce...</i>

136
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:17,964
<i>... a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.</i>

137
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,595
I hear that Longshanks
has granted "primae noctis".

138
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:30,146
Clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here.

139
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,026
My father believes we must lull
Longshanks into our confidence...

140
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,157
...by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

141
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,157
- A wise plan.
- How is your father? He missed the council.

142
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,958
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

143
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,169
But he sends his greetings.

144
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,339
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces...

145
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,220
...and for Scotland.

146
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:13,209
- You've dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.

147
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,129
- You win.
- Ah-hah!

148
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:19,170
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

149
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,470
The English won't let us train with weapons,
so we train with stones.

150
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:27,351
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

151
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:30,932
No. It's here.

152
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:41,033
- Hamish?
- Mm-hm.

153
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:53,965
Here you go, son. Show him how.

154
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:58,045
- Come on, Hamish!
- Come on, boy!

155
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:02,676
Come on!

156
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,238
That's a good throw.

157
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,358
Aye. Aye, it was.

158
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:21,949
I was wondering
if you could do that when it matters.

159
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,040
As it... as it matters in battle.

160
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,790
Could you crush a man with that throw?

161
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,091
I could crush you... like a worm.

162
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,421
Oooh!

163
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,591
- You could?
- Aye.

164
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:39,221
Well, then, do it.

165
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:43,642
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?

166
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,393
- Come and do it.
- You'll move.

167
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:51,563
- I will not.
- Right.

168
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,193
He'll move.

169
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:55,194
Come on, Hamish!

170
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:59,284
Come on there, boy!

171
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,506
Well done!

172
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,438
A fine display, young Wallace.

173
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,898
Are you all right?
You look a wee bit shaky.

174
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:30,149
I should have remembered the rocks.

175
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:34,159
Aye, you should have.

176
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,160
Get up, you big heap of...

177
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,751
- It's good to see ye again.
- Aye, welcome home.

178
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:49,842
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

179
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,773
William, will you dance with me?

180
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:06,654
Of course I will.

181
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,888
I've come to claim the right
of "primae noctis".

182
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:39,279
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed...

183
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,939
...on the first night of her union.

184
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,109
By God you will not!

185
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,450
It is my noble right.

186
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,928
Good evening, sir.

187
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:56,888
Ah, young Wallace.
A grand soft evening, huh?

188
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,809
Aye, it's that.

189
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,399
Might I have a word with your daughter?

190
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,110
What do you want to have
a word with her about?

191
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,110
Well, erm...

192
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,440
Murron?

193
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,531
Would you like to ride with me this evening?

194
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:16,081
In this? You're out of your mind!

195
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:20,412
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling almost straight down.

196
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,172
- She cannae go with you.
- No?

197
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,713
No. No the now, anyway.

198
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,463
- No the now.
- No the now.

199
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:31,383
- We'll see ye later.
- The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

200
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:33,974
Did you no hear what I said?

201
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:37,854
- Murron!
- Murron!

202
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:42,405
It's you she takes after.

203
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,479
How did you know me after so long?

204
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,019
I didn't.

205
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,360
I saw you staring at me
and I didn't know who you were.

206
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,191
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

207
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:25,201
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

208
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:30,082
It was the best way to make you leave.

209
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,583
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I'll warn you in writing first.

210
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,343
- It wouldn't help. I can't read.
- Can ye not?

211
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:41,513
No.

212
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:44,684
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.

213
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,304
- You're gonna teach me to read?
- If you like.

214
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,764
Aye.

215
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,815
In what language?

216
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,025
You're showing off now.

217
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:57,696
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Should I be?

218
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:08,077
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

219
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,298
- My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try...

220
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,758
You learnt no manners on your travels!

221
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,088
The French and the Romans
are worse than I.

222
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:18,969
- You went to Rome?
- Aye. Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

223
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:22,219
What was it like?

224
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,770
What does that mean?

225
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,731
Beautiful.

226
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:37,031
But I belong here.

227
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,406
Murron!

228
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:13,277
Come in now!

229
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:26,527
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night, but...

230
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:29,078
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

231
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:33,578
- I've come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?

232
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:38,709
- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.

233
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,129
Your father was a fighter...

234
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:45,010
...and a patriot.

235
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,180
I know who my father was.

236
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,271
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

237
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:56,191
If I can live in peace, I will.

238
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,652
Go on!

239
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,442
- You want to stay out of the troubles?
- Aye.

240
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:03,742
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

241
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:05,913
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

242
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:08,623
- No.
- No, Wallace. No.

243
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:10,703
Didn't I just prove it?

244
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:11,914
No!

245
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:15,794
- No?
- No!

246
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,840
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

247
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,221
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

248
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,431
So, you've got children.

249
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:08,402
Well, not yet. But I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

250
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,982
So you want me to marry you, then?

251
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,613
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

252
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:17,363
Is that what you call a proposal?

253
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:21,994
I love you. Always have.

254
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,084
I want to marry you.

255
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:38,056
Is that a yes?

256
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:41,897
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

257
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:26,153
- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.
- Oh, wait.

258
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:30,074
Where are you going?

259
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:37,705
- What's that?
- You'll see.

260
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:58,988
Father.

261
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,960
I will love you my whole life.

262
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,840
You and no other.

263
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:22,011
And I you.

264
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,141
You and no other... for ever.

265
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:38,023
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...</i>

266
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,382
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

267
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:57,712
- I can't.
- Why not?

268
00:40:57,962 --> 00:40:59,552
My dad's growing suspicious.

269
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:02,433
Would that have anything to do with...

270
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:05,893
When?

271
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:07,563
When?

272
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:11,434
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

273
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:20,825
Look lively, Sergeant.

274
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,587
What are you carrying, lassie?

275
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:35,797
- That looks heavy. Can we help you?
- That's fine.

276
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:38,928
I'm not going to steal it...

277
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:44,099
Ohh! You remind me
of my daughter back home.

278
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,911
Hello, lassie.

279
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:16,093
Ssh.

280
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:19,604
Keep quiet, Smythe.

281
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:25,235
Aagh! Bitch!

282
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:35,196
You bitch!

283
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:45,587
Are you all right?

284
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:51,598
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

285
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,360
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

286
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,701
Come back here, you bastard!

287
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,491
Ring the alarm! Help!

288
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,662
Meet me at the grove.

289
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:19,622
- Ride!
- They're getting away!

290
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:04,639
All right, you bitch!

291
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:29,582
Murron!

292
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:38,384
Murron!

293
00:44:44,845 --> 00:44:49,605
All of you know full well
the great pains I've always taken...

294
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:55,316
...never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

295
00:44:55,566 --> 00:44:58,027
And, as a consequence...

296
00:44:58,277 --> 00:45:01,247
...have we not learned to live together...

297
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,907
...in relative peace and harmony?

298
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,588
Huh?

299
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:17,139
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

300
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,361
Well, you leave me with little choice.

301
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:38,202
An assault on the King's soldiers...

302
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:43,163
...is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

303
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:59,935
Now...

304
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:04,566
...let this scrapper come to me.

305
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:02,004
There.

306
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:46,818
Aaagh!

307
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:14,392
Aaagh!

308
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:31,034
Corporal! Some archers on the tower! Now!

309
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:42,176
- Hold still, Father.

310
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:46,267
You idiot, boy!

311
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:06,739
Aaagh!

312
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:12,779
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

313
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:37,161
MacCaulich.

314
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,382
MacCaulich.

315
00:53:40,632 --> 00:53:42,502
MacCaulich!

316
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,882
MacCaulich! MacCaulich!

317
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:50,723
MacCaulich!

318
00:53:51,013 --> 00:53:53,473
Wallace! Wallace!

319
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:04,655
<i>Anima eius
et animae omnium fidelium defunctorum...</i>

320
00:54:04,905 --> 00:54:06,825
<i>... per misericordiam Dei...</i>

321
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:10,286
<i>... requiescant in pace.</i>

322
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:13,376
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii...</i>

323
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,417
<i>... et Spiritus Sanctus.</i>

324
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:20,007
- Amen.
- Amen.

325
00:56:15,134 --> 00:56:18,764
What are you waiting for, boy?

326
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:23,605
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

327
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,406
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

328
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:29,576
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

329
00:56:29,826 --> 00:56:32,576
I know it seems like
a waste of good whisky. Indulge me.

330
00:56:36,707 --> 00:56:40,377
Hold him! Hold him! Hold him. Now...

331
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:42,048
...let him go.

332
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:48,089
All right?

333
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:50,929
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

334
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,350
- There's somebody coming!
- Arm yourselves!

335
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,941
There's somebody coming.

336
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:08,241
MacGregors! From the next glen.

337
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:13,912
We heard about what was happening.

338
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:18,463
We don't want you "amerdans"
thinking you can have your fun without us.

339
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:21,963
Go home.

340
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,764
Some of us are in this.

341
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:26,884
I can't help that now.

342
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:30,095
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

343
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:36,105
We'll have no homes left when the English
garrison comes through and burns us out.

344
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:40,026
- And they will.
- Aye.

345
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:43,867
Welcome.

346
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:16,231
Patrol returning, my Lord.

347
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:45,475
So, what news?

348
00:58:55,827 --> 00:59:00,037
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
They will be returning now!

349
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:03,998
Were they dressed like this?

350
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,708
Actually, it was more like 50.

351
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:09,799
Make it quick.

352
00:59:10,049 --> 00:59:13,679
Do you remember me?

353
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:16,430
I never did her any harm. It was my right!

354
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,600
Your right.
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

355
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:31,492
I'm William Wallace.

356
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:34,322
And the rest of you will be spared.

357
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,993
Go back to England!

358
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:39,163
And tell them there...

359
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:44,004
...that Scotland's daughters and her sons
are yours no more.

360
00:59:44,254 --> 00:59:47,884
Tell them Scotland is free.

361
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:54,975
Burn it.

362
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,261
The Scottish rebels
have routed one of my garrisons...

363
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:34,731
...and murdered the noble Lord.

364
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:38,442
I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

365
01:00:38,692 --> 01:00:42,022
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

366
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:47,953
Like any common thief. Have the local
magistrate arrest and punish him.

367
01:00:48,953 --> 01:00:52,624
Leave us.

368
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:07,176
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

369
01:01:07,426 --> 01:01:09,596
Stand up.

370
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:11,436
Stand up!

371
01:01:11,686 --> 01:01:13,477
In the morning...

372
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:18,107
...I depart for France to press our rights there.

373
01:01:18,357 --> 01:01:21,238
And I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

374
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:25,948
Understood? Is it?

375
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:31,209
One day you will be a king.

376
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:35,130
At least try to act like one.

377
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,221
Get away from me!

378
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:44,431
Convene my military council!

379
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:26,897
There!

380
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:30,608
After them!

381
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:59,392
No point resisting.
You're outnumbered and trapped.

382
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:04,563
Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?

383
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:18,245
- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.

384
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:22,125
A rebellion has begun.

385
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:29,136
Under whom?

386
01:03:29,386 --> 01:03:34,187
A commoner... named William Wallace.

387
01:03:43,438 --> 01:03:45,609
You will embrace this rebellion.

388
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:48,529
Support it from our lands in the North.

389
01:03:48,779 --> 01:03:53,040
I will gain English favour by condemning it...

390
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:58,330
...and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the South.

391
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,881
Sit down. Stay awhile.

392
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:11,312
This Wallace...

393
01:04:11,562 --> 01:04:13,062
He doesn't even have a knighthood.

394
01:04:13,313 --> 01:04:15,643
But he fights with passion.

395
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,773
And he inspires!

396
01:04:18,023 --> 01:04:22,654
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did, eh?

397
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,614
- So would I.
- Well, maybe it's time.

398
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:29,035
It is time... to survive.

399
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:32,165
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

400
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:39,836
The 16 before you passed you land and title
because they "didn't" charge in.

401
01:04:40,336 --> 01:04:43,467
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

402
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:48,518
Rightly so! They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

403
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:51,978
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

404
01:04:52,228 --> 01:04:54,728
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

405
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:57,189
He has courage. So does a dog.

406
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:02,830
But it is exactly the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.

407
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,910
And understand this:

408
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,331
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of England.

409
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:11,751
And none of us...

410
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:14,961
...and nothing of Scotland will remain...

411
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,422
...unless "we" are as ruthless.

412
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:21,012
Give ear to our nobles.

413
01:05:21,262 --> 01:05:23,893
Knowing their minds...

414
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:27,773
...is the key to the throne.

415
01:05:42,995 --> 01:05:45,166
Wait. Wait! Look.

416
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:48,006
This is out, and this is left.

417
01:05:48,256 --> 01:05:49,916
Carry on.

418
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:53,757
Carry on!

419
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,871
You know...

420
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:38,292
...eventually Longshanks
will send in his northern army.

421
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:43,303
Heavy cavalry. Armoured horse.
Shake the very ground.

422
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:45,513
He'll ride right over us.

423
01:07:45,763 --> 01:07:48,223
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

424
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:51,354
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

425
01:07:51,604 --> 01:07:56,445
- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

426
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:06,206
Or make spears.

427
01:08:06,456 --> 01:08:11,207
Hundreds of 'em.
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

428
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:14,297
- That long?
- Aye.

429
01:08:14,547 --> 01:08:16,547
Some men are longer than others.

430
01:08:16,797 --> 01:08:21,098
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again, eh?

431
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:25,059
Volunteers coming in!

432
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:29,979
William Wallace.
We've come to fight and to die for you.

433
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:33,860
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

434
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,650
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

435
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,701
- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.

436
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:42,241
I brought you this.

437
01:08:42,491 --> 01:08:44,411
My wife made it for you.

438
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,702
Ah, thank you.

439
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:53,213
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

440
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,053
I'm prettier than this man.

441
01:08:57,973 --> 01:08:59,844
All right, Father.

442
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,014
I'll ask him.

443
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:07,185
If I risk my neck for you...

444
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,355
...will I get to kill Englishmen?

445
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:12,866
Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the Almighty?

446
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:16,196
To find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

447
01:09:16,446 --> 01:09:17,746
Yes, Father!

448
01:09:17,996 --> 01:09:21,327
The Almighty says,
"Just answer the fucking question!"

449
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:25,167
- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!

450
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,758
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

451
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:33,839
That's my friend, Irishman.

452
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:39,309
And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

453
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,640
Excellent!

454
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,810
Stephen is my name.

455
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,270
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

456
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,821
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

457
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:51,361
- More's the pity.
- Your island?

458
01:09:51,611 --> 01:09:56,162
- You mean Ireland?
- Yeah. It's mine.

459
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:01,793
You're a madman.

460
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:10,304
I've come to the right place, then.

461
01:11:29,645 --> 01:11:34,736
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

462
01:11:35,686 --> 01:11:39,367
I didn't like him anyway.

463
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:44,117
He wasn't right in the head.

464
01:11:55,759 --> 01:12:00,140
William! It's our runners!

465
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:13,361
The English... are advancing
an army towards Stirling!

466
01:12:13,612 --> 01:12:17,782
- Do the nobles rally?
- Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

467
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:21,453
But word has spread. The Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

468
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:24,793
Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!

469
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:27,003
Are you ready for a war?!

470
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:46,066
- What news?
- We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

471
01:12:46,316 --> 01:12:48,487
- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.

472
01:12:48,737 --> 01:12:51,527
- 300 heavy horse!
- We must "try" to negotiate.

473
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:55,368
Who was in command?
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

474
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,908
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

475
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:01,828
We could still negotiate...

476
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:06,249
What are they talking about?

477
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:08,959
I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

478
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,130
The nobles will negotiate.

479
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,470
They do a deal... and we go home.

480
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,101
If not... we charge.

481
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:20,641
300 heavy horse! We've no chance!

482
01:14:18,589 --> 01:14:22,010
So many.

483
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,511
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

484
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:30,721
Then I'd have to work for them.

485
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,892
Nor me.

486
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:34,852
All right, lads!

487
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:37,352
I'm not dying for these bastards!

488
01:14:37,612 --> 01:14:40,073
Let's go home!

489
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,255
Stop, men!

490
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:05,096
Do not flee! Wait until we've negotiated!

491
01:15:55,863 --> 01:15:57,784
William Wallace!

492
01:15:58,034 --> 01:16:01,624
Can't be. Not tall enough.

493
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:25,478
The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight.
It's drawn the finest people.

494
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:30,988
- Where is thy salute?
- For coming to this battlefield, I thank you.

495
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:34,159
This is our army.
To join it, you give homage.

496
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:36,659
I give homage to Scotland.

497
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:40,330
And if this is your army...

498
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,960
...why does it go?

499
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,380
We didn't come here to fight for them!

500
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:52,592
Home! The English are too many!

501
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:02,273
Sons of Scotland!

502
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,483
I am William Wallace!

503
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:08,864
- William Wallace is seven feet tall.
- Yes, I've heard.

504
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:11,034
He kills men by the hundred.

505
01:17:11,284 --> 01:17:15,415
And if he were here, he'd consume
the English with fireballs from his eyes...

506
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,585
...and lightning from his arse!

507
01:17:21,836 --> 01:17:24,676
I "am" William Wallace!

508
01:17:24,926 --> 01:17:26,887
And I see...

509
01:17:27,137 --> 01:17:29,767
...a whole army of my countrymen...

510
01:17:30,017 --> 01:17:33,888
...here in defiance of tyranny.

511
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:39,778
You've come to fight as free men...

512
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:44,029
...and free men you are!

513
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:48,740
What will you do without freedom?

514
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,910
Will you fight?

515
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:57,331
Against that? No!

516
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:00,551
We will run, and we will live.

517
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,012
Aye. Fight and you may die.

518
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:06,472
Run, and you'll live.

519
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:10,393
At least a while.

520
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,394
And dying in your beds,
many years from now...

521
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:19,064
...would you be willing to trade...

522
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:22,034
...all the days from this day to that...

523
01:18:22,284 --> 01:18:24,745
...for one chance, just one chance...

524
01:18:24,995 --> 01:18:27,705
...to come back here and tell our enemies...

525
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:30,996
...that they may take our lives...

526
01:18:31,246 --> 01:18:36,046
...but they'll never take our freedom!

527
01:18:37,427 --> 01:18:39,887
<i>Alba qu bra!</i>

528
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:43,518
<i>Alba qu bra!</i>

529
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,581
They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.

530
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:07,581
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion.

531
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:11,882
But nonetheless...
I think we should deliver the King's terms.

532
01:19:12,132 --> 01:19:14,552
The King's terms?
They'll never live up to them.

533
01:19:14,802 --> 01:19:17,012
My Lord, I think...

534
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:20,933
All right! Offer them the terms.

535
01:19:22,893 --> 01:19:26,774
- They're coming out. Should we go to them?
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?

536
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:29,774
Aye.

537
01:19:33,155 --> 01:19:35,785
Fine speech.

538
01:19:36,035 --> 01:19:38,205
Now what do we do?

539
01:19:38,455 --> 01:19:40,366
Just be yourselves.

540
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:42,536
Where are you going?

541
01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:46,417
I'm going to pick a fight.

542
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:56,848
Well... we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

543
01:19:58,018 --> 01:20:01,599
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

544
01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:06,980
Here are the King's terms.

545
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:12,280
Lead this army off the field...

546
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:18,541
...and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire...

547
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:23,752
...including hereditary title,
from which you will pay...

548
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:26,632
- From which you will pay...
- I have an offer for ye.

549
01:20:26,882 --> 01:20:30,303
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

550
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:33,513
From which you will pay the King
an annual duty...

551
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:36,894
- I said I have an offer for "you".
- You disrespect a banner of truce!

552
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:39,774
From his King? Absolutely.

553
01:20:40,024 --> 01:20:42,485
Here are Scotland's terms.

554
01:20:42,735 --> 01:20:45,985
Lower your flags...
and march straight back to England.

555
01:20:46,235 --> 01:20:52,326
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

556
01:20:52,576 --> 01:20:54,666
Do that, and your men shall live.

557
01:20:54,916 --> 01:21:00,337
Do it not...
and every one of you will die today.

558
01:21:05,718 --> 01:21:09,258
You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavalry.

559
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:12,139
In two centuries, no army has won without...

560
01:21:12,389 --> 01:21:15,939
I'm not finished!

561
01:21:16,019 --> 01:21:17,900
Before we let you leave...

562
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:23,030
...your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army...

563
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:28,331
...put his head between his legs...
and kiss his own arse.

564
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:40,553
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

565
01:21:40,803 --> 01:21:43,973
You be ready and do exactly as I say.
On my signal...

566
01:21:44,224 --> 01:21:47,144
...ride round behind our position,
and flank them.

567
01:21:47,394 --> 01:21:51,685
- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and let the English see you do it.

568
01:21:51,935 --> 01:21:53,605
They'll think we run away?

569
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:57,655
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

570
01:21:57,905 --> 01:22:01,536
Right. Come on.

571
01:22:18,178 --> 01:22:19,929
<i>Ego vos absolvo...</i>

572
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:24,139
<i>... ab omnibus peccatis vestris.
In nomine Patris...</i>

573
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:28,900
Insolent bastard!
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

574
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,480
Archers!

575
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:43,872
Archers forward!

576
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,850
You bastards!

577
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:38,589
The Lord tells me
He can get me out of this mess...

578
01:24:38,839 --> 01:24:42,719
...but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

579
01:25:02,242 --> 01:25:05,742
Ready... Loose!

580
01:25:22,425 --> 01:25:25,475
Ride!

581
01:25:27,976 --> 01:25:30,436
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

582
01:25:30,686 --> 01:25:35,607
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
Send the horse.

583
01:25:35,857 --> 01:25:39,117
Full attack.

584
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:54,868
Steady...

585
01:26:55,118 --> 01:26:57,999
Hold!

586
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:01,629
Hold!

587
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,460
Hold!

588
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:13,851
Hold!

589
01:27:23,362 --> 01:27:27,863
Now!!

590
01:28:11,999 --> 01:28:14,120
- Send the infantry.
- My Lord...

591
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:17,130
You lead them!

592
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,732
Charge!

593
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:38,120
Retreat!

594
01:31:10,905 --> 01:31:14,125
Bastard!

595
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:18,126
Come on!

596
01:31:56,421 --> 01:32:00,052
All right.

597
01:32:27,286 --> 01:32:31,086
Wallace!

598
01:32:35,757 --> 01:32:39,598
Wallace! Wallace!

599
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,422
I knight thee...

600
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:16,303
...Sir William Wallace.

601
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:20,804
Sir William, in the name of God...

602
01:33:21,064 --> 01:33:24,274
...we appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland...

603
01:33:24,524 --> 01:33:27,064
...and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

604
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:30,485
Stand and be recognised.

605
01:33:41,587 --> 01:33:43,547
Does anyone know his politics?

606
01:33:43,797 --> 01:33:47,127
No, but his weight with the commoners
could upset everything.

607
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:52,388
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

608
01:33:58,809 --> 01:34:02,310
Sir William!

609
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,820
Sir William.

610
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:10,451
Inasmuch as you and your captains
hail from a region...

611
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:13,621
...long known to support the Balliol clan...

612
01:34:13,871 --> 01:34:18,792
...may we invite you to continue your support
and uphold our rightful claim?

613
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:22,843
Damn the Balliol clan!
They're all Longshanks's men!

614
01:34:24,463 --> 01:34:27,383
Gentlemen.

615
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:29,764
- Gentlemen!
- It's time to declare a king.

616
01:34:30,014 --> 01:34:34,054
Halt! Wait! Are you prepared
to recognise "our" legitimate succession?

617
01:34:34,304 --> 01:34:37,895
- You won't support the claim.
- Those were lies, written by you.

618
01:34:38,145 --> 01:34:40,195
- Oh, no.

619
01:34:40,445 --> 01:34:46,536
- I demand recognition of these documents!
- These were lies when you wrote them!

620
01:34:46,786 --> 01:34:50,406
Please, gentlemen!

621
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:55,417
Quiet! Sir William! Where are you going?

622
01:34:56,247 --> 01:34:57,878
We have beaten the English.

623
01:34:58,128 --> 01:35:00,048
But they'll come back...

624
01:35:00,298 --> 01:35:02,128
...because you won't stand together.

625
01:35:02,378 --> 01:35:04,468
What will you do?

626
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,679
I will invade England...
and defeat the English on their own ground.

627
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,980
Invade? That's impossible.

628
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:16,730
Why? Why is that impossible?

629
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:21,241
You're so concerned with squabbling
for scraps from Longshanks's table...

630
01:35:21,491 --> 01:35:26,582
...that you've missed
your God-given right to something better.

631
01:35:26,832 --> 01:35:28,742
There's a difference between us.

632
01:35:28,992 --> 01:35:33,673
You think the people of Scotland exist
to provide you with position.

633
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:38,753
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom.

634
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:43,224
And I go to make sure that they have it.

635
01:35:54,946 --> 01:35:58,526
Wait!

636
01:35:58,946 --> 01:36:00,827
I respect what you said.

637
01:36:01,077 --> 01:36:04,577
But remember that these men
have lands and castles.

638
01:36:04,827 --> 01:36:06,577
It's much to risk.

639
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:12,128
And the common man that bleeds
in battle, does he risk less?

640
01:36:15,299 --> 01:36:16,589
No.

641
01:36:16,839 --> 01:36:20,349
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

642
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:23,680
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

643
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:27,770
- Its clans war with each other.
- Aye.

644
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:32,111
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border... you'll end up dead.

645
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:34,821
We all will. It's just
a question of how and why.

646
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:37,242
I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

647
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:39,122
But we need the nobles.

648
01:36:39,372 --> 01:36:42,623
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

649
01:36:42,873 --> 01:36:45,463
Now, tell me.
What does that mean, to be noble?

650
01:36:45,713 --> 01:36:50,464
Your title gives you claim to Scotland's
throne, but men don't follow titles.

651
01:36:50,714 --> 01:36:52,464
They follow courage.

652
01:36:52,714 --> 01:36:54,594
Now, our people know you.

653
01:36:54,844 --> 01:36:56,885
Noble and common, they respect you.

654
01:36:57,135 --> 01:37:01,645
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

655
01:37:01,895 --> 01:37:05,686
...they'd follow you.

656
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:10,567
And so would I.

657
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:34,560
Damn it! My sodomite cousin the Prince
tells me he has no troops to lend.

658
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:38,771
And every town in northern England
is begging for help.

659
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,731
He advances!

660
01:37:40,981 --> 01:37:44,191
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

661
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:48,822
Bring the provisions inside,
double the guards, seal the gate. Now!

662
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:53,993
Quickly! Bring in the provisions!

663
01:38:21,657 --> 01:38:24,197
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

664
01:38:24,447 --> 01:38:29,458
I will not tell my uncle I've lost him
the greatest city in the North.

665
01:39:09,244 --> 01:39:12,254
Come on!

666
01:39:45,419 --> 01:39:49,039
Make way for the King!

667
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,551
It's not your fault.

668
01:39:58,801 --> 01:40:04,482
- Stand up to him!
- I will stand up to him and more.

669
01:40:40,017 --> 01:40:43,607
What news of the North?

670
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:48,818
Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.

671
01:40:49,068 --> 01:40:53,539
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

672
01:40:53,789 --> 01:41:01,380
The word, my son, is that
our entire northern army is annihilated.

673
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,710
And you have done nothing.

674
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:09,591
I... I have ordered conscription, sir,
assembled and ready to depart.

675
01:41:10,591 --> 01:41:14,312
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

676
01:41:14,562 --> 01:41:18,142
Come.

677
01:41:23,403 --> 01:41:27,404
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

678
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:31,244
Erm... W... Wallace has sacked York.

679
01:41:31,494 --> 01:41:32,454
What?

680
01:41:32,704 --> 01:41:36,335
Wallace has sacked York.

681
01:41:37,835 --> 01:41:39,465
Uh!

682
01:41:39,715 --> 01:41:43,346
Oh!

683
01:41:50,057 --> 01:41:53,647
Sire... thy own nephew!

684
01:41:53,897 --> 01:41:58,238
What beast could do such a thing!

685
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:02,068
If he can sack York...

686
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:04,489
...he can invade Lower England.

687
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:07,999
We will stop him!

688
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:15,290
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

689
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:18,131
I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.

690
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:20,551
Is he qualified?

691
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:25,182
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

692
01:42:25,432 --> 01:42:27,142
Are you?

693
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:28,932
Tell me...

694
01:42:29,182 --> 01:42:34,313
What advice would you offer
on the, er, present... situation?

695
01:42:34,563 --> 01:42:38,364
Aaaagh!

696
01:43:05,648 --> 01:43:09,228
I shall offer a truce...

697
01:43:09,318 --> 01:43:12,949
...and buy him off.

698
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:16,659
But who will go to him? Not I.

699
01:43:16,909 --> 01:43:20,120
If I fell under the sword of that murderer...

700
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:23,620
...it might be "my" head in a basket.

701
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:27,751
And not... my gentle son.

702
01:43:28,001 --> 01:43:32,632
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

703
01:43:36,182 --> 01:43:39,763
So whom do I send?

704
01:43:42,773 --> 01:43:45,563
Whom do I send?

705
01:45:06,865 --> 01:45:08,745
I'm dreaming.

706
01:45:08,955 --> 01:45:11,996
Yes, you are.

707
01:45:12,246 --> 01:45:15,876
And you must wake.

708
01:45:23,887 --> 01:45:27,098
I don't want to wake.

709
01:45:27,348 --> 01:45:30,438
I want to stay here with you.

710
01:45:30,688 --> 01:45:32,609
And I with you.

711
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:36,529
But you must wake now.

712
01:45:37,569 --> 01:45:39,910
Wake up, William.

713
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,530
Wake up.

714
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:47,201
William, wake up...

715
01:45:47,451 --> 01:45:50,371
William! A royal entourage comes...

716
01:45:50,621 --> 01:45:52,542
...flying banners of truce...

717
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:57,012
...and the standards of Longshanks himself!

718
01:46:38,638 --> 01:46:40,478
I am the Princess of Wales.

719
01:46:40,729 --> 01:46:44,099
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

720
01:46:44,349 --> 01:46:47,149
To do what?

721
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:51,030
To discuss the King's proposals.

722
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,491
Will you speak with a woman?

723
01:47:13,803 --> 01:47:17,224
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

724
01:47:17,474 --> 01:47:19,394
I have been given nothing.

725
01:47:19,644 --> 01:47:22,435
God makes men what they are.

726
01:47:22,685 --> 01:47:25,355
Did God make you
the sacker of peaceful cities?

727
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:30,116
The executioner of the King's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

728
01:47:30,366 --> 01:47:34,406
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country.

729
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:41,047
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even
women and children, from the city walls.

730
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:48,138
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

731
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:12,202
You ask your King...
to his face. Ask him.

732
01:48:13,412 --> 01:48:17,922
See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

733
01:48:25,014 --> 01:48:28,804
Hamilton... Leave us.

734
01:48:29,054 --> 01:48:33,355
- My Lady?
- Leave us! Now.

735
01:48:43,446 --> 01:48:45,366
Let us talk plainly.

736
01:48:45,576 --> 01:48:47,537
You invade England.

737
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:52,748
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

738
01:48:52,998 --> 01:48:55,798
The King desires peace.

739
01:48:56,048 --> 01:48:57,918
Longshanks desires peace?

740
01:48:58,178 --> 01:49:00,139
He declares it to me, I swear it.

741
01:49:00,389 --> 01:49:03,179
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

742
01:49:03,429 --> 01:49:06,850
In return he grants you title,
estates and this chest of gold...

743
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,940
...which I am to pay to you personally.

744
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:14,481
A lordship and titles, gold...
that I should become Judas.

745
01:49:14,731 --> 01:49:16,691
Peace is made in such ways.

746
01:49:16,941 --> 01:49:20,281
Slaves are made in such ways!

747
01:49:22,072 --> 01:49:25,162
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy.

748
01:49:25,412 --> 01:49:27,913
And many Scottish nobles
who would not be slaves...

749
01:49:28,163 --> 01:49:31,213
...were lured by him,
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

750
01:49:31,463 --> 01:49:35,054
...where he had them hanged.

751
01:49:35,094 --> 01:49:37,054
I was very young.

752
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:41,725
But I remember
Longshanks's notion of peace.

753
01:49:44,265 --> 01:49:47,605
I understand you have suffered.

754
01:49:47,855 --> 01:49:52,606
I know... about your woman.

755
01:50:02,037 --> 01:50:05,628
She was my wife.

756
01:50:06,588 --> 01:50:11,719
We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.

757
01:50:11,969 --> 01:50:15,429
They killed her... to get to me.

758
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,151
I've never spoken of it.

759
01:50:24,311 --> 01:50:28,611
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

760
01:50:29,781 --> 01:50:33,412
...I see her strength in you.

761
01:50:37,873 --> 01:50:39,583
One day...

762
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:42,293
...you'll be a queen.

763
01:50:42,543 --> 01:50:46,174
And you must open your eyes.

764
01:50:52,425 --> 01:50:54,385
You tell your King...

765
01:50:54,635 --> 01:50:57,265
...that William Wallace will not be ruled...

766
01:50:57,515 --> 01:51:01,526
...and nor will any Scot while I live.

767
01:51:33,391 --> 01:51:37,691
Ah! My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

768
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,822
So he accepted our bribe?

769
01:51:40,072 --> 01:51:43,692
No. He did not.

770
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:45,742
Then why does he stay?

771
01:51:45,992 --> 01:51:48,703
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

772
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,873
He waits for you at York.

773
01:51:51,123 --> 01:51:53,253
He says he will attack no more towns...

774
01:51:53,503 --> 01:51:56,004
...if you are man enough
to come and face him.

775
01:51:56,254 --> 01:51:58,794
Did he?

776
01:51:59,044 --> 01:52:02,965
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected...

777
01:52:03,215 --> 01:52:08,266
...arriving so far around his flank.

778
01:52:08,516 --> 01:52:11,306
The main force of our armies
from France land here...

779
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:13,566
...to the north of Edinburgh.

780
01:52:13,816 --> 01:52:17,987
Conscripts from Ireland
approach from the southwest...

781
01:52:18,237 --> 01:52:19,657
...to here.

782
01:52:19,907 --> 01:52:23,328
Welsh bowmen, troops from France,
Irish conscripts.

783
01:52:23,538 --> 01:52:26,118
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

784
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,288
I dispatched them...

785
01:52:28,539 --> 01:52:32,289
...before I sent your wife.

786
01:52:34,669 --> 01:52:37,220
So our little ruse succeeded.

787
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:39,380
Thank you.

788
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:43,721
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York...

789
01:52:43,971 --> 01:52:48,851
...my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

790
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:52,652
You spoke with this, er...

791
01:52:52,902 --> 01:52:55,532
...Wallace in private?

792
01:52:55,782 --> 01:52:58,783
Tell me...

793
01:52:59,033 --> 01:53:02,203
What kind of man is he?

794
01:53:02,453 --> 01:53:05,794
A mindless barbarian.

795
01:53:06,044 --> 01:53:09,664
Not a king like you, my Lord.

796
01:53:10,585 --> 01:53:12,925
You may return to your embroidery.

797
01:53:13,175 --> 01:53:15,095
Humbly, my Lord.

798
01:53:15,345 --> 01:53:19,516
You brought back the money, of course?

799
01:53:21,806 --> 01:53:26,437
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

800
01:53:29,107 --> 01:53:33,068
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

801
01:53:33,448 --> 01:53:38,539
Forgive me, sire. I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness...

802
01:53:38,789 --> 01:53:40,709
...to those you mean to rule.

803
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:45,960
My greatness...

804
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:50,130
...will be better demonstrated
when Wallace returns to Scotland...

805
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,761
...and finds his country in ashes.

806
01:53:57,601 --> 01:53:59,522
William!

807
01:53:59,772 --> 01:54:03,562
There's riders approaching.

808
01:54:08,863 --> 01:54:11,743
A personal escort of the Princess.

809
01:54:11,993 --> 01:54:14,074
Aye.

810
01:54:14,284 --> 01:54:16,324
Must have made an impression.

811
01:54:16,584 --> 01:54:17,704
Aye.

812
01:54:17,954 --> 01:54:22,045
I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

813
01:54:24,465 --> 01:54:27,426
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

814
01:54:27,886 --> 01:54:30,556
<i>Un message de ma maîtresse.</i>

815
01:54:30,806 --> 01:54:34,387
<i>Merci.</i>

816
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:59,500
It's true! The English ships
are moving up from the South.

817
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:02,921
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed.

818
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:05,301
I had to see it myself to believe it.

819
01:55:05,551 --> 01:55:08,181
What are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

820
01:55:08,431 --> 01:55:12,062
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?

821
01:55:12,312 --> 01:55:14,182
It's "my" island.

822
01:55:14,432 --> 01:55:18,523
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council. Order it!

823
01:55:18,773 --> 01:55:21,153
Right. Come on!

824
01:55:21,403 --> 01:55:23,694
Ya!

825
01:55:23,944 --> 01:55:28,414
- Your island?
- My island! Yup!

826
01:55:28,664 --> 01:55:31,125
- We'll have to negotiate.
- Please, gentlemen!

827
01:55:31,375 --> 01:55:33,625
Lords, Craig is right!

828
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:36,796
This time our only option is to negotiate.

829
01:55:37,046 --> 01:55:41,176
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

830
01:55:46,597 --> 01:55:49,977
My army has marched
for more days than I can remember.

831
01:55:50,227 --> 01:55:52,358
And we still have preparations to make...

832
01:55:52,608 --> 01:55:55,358
...so I'll make this plain.

833
01:55:55,608 --> 01:55:58,199
We require every soldier you can summon...

834
01:55:58,449 --> 01:56:01,159
...your personal escorts, even yourselves.

835
01:56:01,369 --> 01:56:04,750
And we need them now.

836
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:08,460
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

837
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:11,421
Other options?!

838
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:14,961
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field...

839
01:56:15,211 --> 01:56:17,881
...and barter a better deal with Longshanks...

840
01:56:18,131 --> 01:56:20,472
...before you run?
- Sir William...

841
01:56:20,722 --> 01:56:22,472
- We cannot defeat them!
- We can!

842
01:56:22,722 --> 01:56:26,603
- Sir William!
- And we will!

843
01:56:27,393 --> 01:56:31,903
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!

844
01:56:32,364 --> 01:56:34,944
We won at York
and you would not support us.

845
01:56:35,194 --> 01:56:39,995
If you'll no stand up with us now,
I'd say you're cowards.

846
01:56:45,335 --> 01:56:46,756
If you are Scotsmen...

847
01:56:47,006 --> 01:56:48,796
...I'm ashamed to call myself one.

848
01:56:49,046 --> 01:56:53,097
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

849
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:57,387
I beg you.

850
01:56:59,637 --> 01:57:01,648
You've achieved
more than anyone ever dreamed.

851
01:57:01,898 --> 01:57:05,188
But fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

852
01:57:05,438 --> 01:57:09,069
It's well beyond rage.

853
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:12,529
Help me.

854
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:16,660
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

855
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:18,790
Now is our chance! Now!

856
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,001
If we join, we can win. If we win...

857
01:57:21,251 --> 01:57:24,631
...we'll have what none of us
have ever had before.

858
01:57:24,881 --> 01:57:28,462
A country of our own.

859
01:57:28,962 --> 01:57:30,882
You're the rightful leader...

860
01:57:31,132 --> 01:57:35,603
...and there is strength in you, I see it.

861
01:57:39,103 --> 01:57:42,854
Unite us.

862
01:57:43,774 --> 01:57:47,824
Unite us! Unite the clans!

863
01:57:53,415 --> 01:57:57,956
- All right!
- Right.

864
01:58:00,956 --> 01:58:02,837
This cannot be the way.

865
01:58:03,087 --> 01:58:05,177
You said yourself...

866
01:58:05,427 --> 01:58:10,018
...the nobles will not support Wallace.

867
01:58:10,268 --> 01:58:15,098
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

868
01:58:15,348 --> 01:58:19,019
I gave him my word.

869
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:27,320
I know it is hard.

870
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:31,241
Being a leader is.

871
01:58:31,331 --> 01:58:33,251
My son...

872
01:58:33,501 --> 01:58:35,121
Son...

873
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:38,462
Look at me.

874
01:58:44,132 --> 01:58:46,383
I cannot be King.

875
01:58:46,643 --> 01:58:49,183
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

876
01:58:49,433 --> 01:58:52,274
What I tell you, you must do.

877
01:58:52,524 --> 01:58:55,104
Not for me, not for yourself...

878
01:58:55,354 --> 01:58:58,985
...but for your country.

879
01:59:14,167 --> 01:59:18,007
Right, lads, make way. Coming through.

880
01:59:23,598 --> 01:59:27,269
Make way, lads.

881
01:59:30,899 --> 01:59:32,819
The Bruce is not coming, William.

882
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:36,450
He'll come.

883
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:40,411
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

884
01:59:40,621 --> 01:59:44,241
So will the Bruce.

885
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:50,332
Quite a lovely... gathering.

886
01:59:50,582 --> 01:59:54,423
Wouldn't you agree?

887
01:59:54,633 --> 01:59:56,513
The archers are ready, sire.

888
01:59:56,763 --> 01:59:58,633
Not the archers.

889
01:59:58,883 --> 02:00:02,054
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

890
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,224
Arrows cost money.

891
02:00:04,474 --> 02:00:07,314
Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.

892
02:00:07,564 --> 02:00:09,815
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

893
02:00:10,065 --> 02:00:13,115
- Infantry!
- Infantry!

894
02:00:13,365 --> 02:00:15,536
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

895
02:00:15,786 --> 02:00:18,076
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

896
02:00:18,326 --> 02:00:23,127
- Advance!
- Advance!

897
02:01:44,758 --> 02:01:50,429
Ah, good to see ye this morning!

898
02:01:50,559 --> 02:01:52,560
Irish!

899
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,810
Glad to have ye with us.

900
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:58,690
Watch this.

901
02:04:06,459 --> 02:04:09,009
Mornay? Lochlan?

902
02:04:09,259 --> 02:04:12,010
I gave Mornay
double his lands in Scotland...

903
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,100
...and matching estates in England.

904
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:17,640
Lochlan turned... for much less.

905
02:04:17,890 --> 02:04:19,811
Archers.

906
02:04:20,061 --> 02:04:24,271
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

907
02:04:24,521 --> 02:04:26,362
Yes.

908
02:04:26,612 --> 02:04:28,492
But we'll hit theirs as well.

909
02:04:28,742 --> 02:04:31,322
We have reserves.

910
02:04:31,572 --> 02:04:33,993
Attack!

911
02:04:34,243 --> 02:04:35,783
Archers!

912
02:04:36,033 --> 02:04:40,584
- Archers!
- Archers!

913
02:05:13,918 --> 02:05:16,419
Send in our reinforcements.

914
02:05:16,669 --> 02:05:20,919
- Send in the rest!

915
02:05:28,221 --> 02:05:30,431
Bring me Wallace.

916
02:05:30,681 --> 02:05:32,561
Alive, if possible.

917
02:05:32,811 --> 02:05:35,522
Dead... just as good.

918
02:05:35,772 --> 02:05:37,692
Send us news of our victory.

919
02:05:37,942 --> 02:05:41,572
Shall we retire?

920
02:06:44,892 --> 02:06:49,522
Ya! Ya!

921
02:07:05,204 --> 02:07:08,795
Protect the King.

922
02:07:16,516 --> 02:07:19,266
Aaaagh!

923
02:07:47,301 --> 02:07:51,381
Aagh! Aagh!

924
02:09:10,522 --> 02:09:14,983
Get up! Get up!

925
02:09:15,403 --> 02:09:18,444
Get up! Get up!

926
02:09:18,694 --> 02:09:22,154
- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!

927
02:09:25,325 --> 02:09:28,125
Go!

928
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:32,206
Ya!

929
02:10:26,313 --> 02:10:29,984
I'm dying.

930
02:10:32,154 --> 02:10:35,445
Let me be.

931
02:10:39,245 --> 02:10:42,206
No.

932
02:10:42,456 --> 02:10:46,086
You're going to live.

933
02:10:46,256 --> 02:10:48,627
I've lived long enough to live free.

934
02:10:48,877 --> 02:10:51,637
Proud...

935
02:10:51,887 --> 02:10:55,968
...to see you become the man you are.

936
02:10:59,308 --> 02:11:02,899
I'm a happy man.

937
02:12:50,974 --> 02:12:52,984
I'm the one who's rotting.

938
02:12:53,234 --> 02:12:58,655
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

939
02:13:01,486 --> 02:13:04,866
Son...

940
02:13:09,457 --> 02:13:13,217
We must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

941
02:13:13,467 --> 02:13:15,378
You achieved that.

942
02:13:15,628 --> 02:13:17,548
You saved your family...

943
02:13:17,798 --> 02:13:19,718
...and increased your land.

944
02:13:19,968 --> 02:13:24,849
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

945
02:13:25,099 --> 02:13:26,849
Lands.

946
02:13:27,099 --> 02:13:29,270
Titles. Men.

947
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,070
Power. Nothing.

948
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:35,321
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

949
02:13:35,571 --> 02:13:39,491
Men fight for me because if they do not
I throw them off my land...

950
02:13:39,741 --> 02:13:43,372
...and I starve their wives and children.

951
02:13:43,622 --> 02:13:45,542
Those men...

952
02:13:45,792 --> 02:13:49,753
...who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

953
02:13:50,003 --> 02:13:53,173
They fought for William Wallace,
and he fights...

954
02:13:53,423 --> 02:13:57,014
...for something that I've never had.

955
02:13:58,264 --> 02:14:00,894
And I took it from him when I betrayed him...

956
02:14:01,144 --> 02:14:03,855
...and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield.

957
02:14:04,105 --> 02:14:06,775
And it's tearing me apart.

958
02:14:07,025 --> 02:14:10,156
Well, all men betray. All lose heart.

959
02:14:10,406 --> 02:14:14,656
I don't want to lose heart!

960
02:14:16,957 --> 02:14:19,117
I want to believe...

961
02:14:19,367 --> 02:14:22,997
...as he does.

962
02:14:27,508 --> 02:14:31,889
I will never be on the wrong side again.

963
02:15:13,725 --> 02:15:16,895
Aagh!

964
02:15:20,196 --> 02:15:23,736
No!

965
02:16:18,384 --> 02:16:21,464
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

966
02:16:21,724 --> 02:16:23,635
Aye.

967
02:16:23,885 --> 02:16:26,555
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

968
02:16:26,805 --> 02:16:30,276
More of a liability now than ever he was.

969
02:16:30,526 --> 02:16:34,196
And there's no telling who'll be next.

970
02:16:34,446 --> 02:16:37,867
Maybe you.

971
02:16:39,077 --> 02:16:42,697
Maybe me.

972
02:16:45,418 --> 02:16:48,378
It doesn't matter.

973
02:16:48,628 --> 02:16:50,499
I'm serious, Robert.

974
02:16:50,749 --> 02:16:53,839
So am I!

975
02:17:05,521 --> 02:17:07,231
Christ! Shit!

976
02:17:07,481 --> 02:17:11,822
Search the place!

977
02:17:13,112 --> 02:17:16,952
Lochlan!

978
02:17:21,243 --> 02:17:24,203
William Wallace killed 50 men.

979
02:17:24,453 --> 02:17:26,374
50 if it was one.

980
02:17:26,624 --> 02:17:29,004
100 men... with his own sword.

981
02:17:29,254 --> 02:17:31,044
Cut through them like...

982
02:17:31,294 --> 02:17:36,095
...Moses through the Red Sea.

983
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:09,010
His legend grows.

984
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:11,890
It will be worse than before.

985
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:14,681
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town.

986
02:18:14,931 --> 02:18:16,851
When he replenishes his numbers...

987
02:18:17,101 --> 02:18:19,351
They're sheep! Mere sheep!

988
02:18:21,272 --> 02:18:24,612
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

989
02:18:24,862 --> 02:18:28,073
Very well.

990
02:18:28,113 --> 02:18:32,243
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

991
02:18:32,493 --> 02:18:37,954
My Lord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

992
02:18:40,334 --> 02:18:44,045
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct...

993
02:18:44,295 --> 02:18:49,516
...he warmed to our future Queen
and would trust her.

994
02:18:49,556 --> 02:18:53,016
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion that she comes in peace.

995
02:18:53,266 --> 02:18:55,897
My Lord,
the Princess might be taken hostage...

996
02:18:56,147 --> 02:18:58,067
...or her life be put in jeopardy.

997
02:18:58,317 --> 02:19:03,198
My son would be most distressed by that.

998
02:19:03,448 --> 02:19:05,698
But in truth if she were to be killed...

999
02:19:05,948 --> 02:19:13,669
...we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1000
02:19:13,789 --> 02:19:15,709
You see...

1001
02:19:15,959 --> 02:19:22,590
As King, you must find
the good in any situation.

1002
02:19:47,914 --> 02:19:50,624
It's William Wallace, sure.

1003
02:19:50,874 --> 02:19:52,755
And he's given up his sword.

1004
02:19:53,005 --> 02:19:56,425
Be ready.

1005
02:20:18,909 --> 02:20:22,289
Aagh!

1006
02:21:34,079 --> 02:21:37,710
My Lady.

1007
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:41,460
I received your message.

1008
02:21:54,602 --> 02:22:00,483
This is... the second time
you've warned me of danger.

1009
02:22:01,233 --> 02:22:02,483
Why?

1010
02:22:02,733 --> 02:22:06,444
There will be a new shipment
of supplies coming north next month.

1011
02:22:06,694 --> 02:22:08,574
Foods and weapons. They will...

1012
02:22:08,824 --> 02:22:12,125
No, stop.

1013
02:22:12,375 --> 02:22:15,955
Why do you help me?

1014
02:22:19,586 --> 02:22:23,296
Why do you help me?

1015
02:22:23,676 --> 02:22:27,967
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1016
02:24:18,643 --> 02:24:21,353
Just when we thought all hope was lost...

1017
02:24:21,603 --> 02:24:25,814
...our noble saviours have arrived.

1018
02:24:26,564 --> 02:24:30,615
Off with their hoods.

1019
02:24:33,945 --> 02:24:36,616
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

1020
02:24:36,866 --> 02:24:38,786
Well, what's the point?

1021
02:24:39,036 --> 02:24:41,666
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1022
02:24:41,916 --> 02:24:44,377
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1023
02:24:44,627 --> 02:24:47,177
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1024
02:24:47,427 --> 02:24:49,337
So let the council swear publicly.

1025
02:24:49,587 --> 02:24:53,008
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1026
02:24:53,258 --> 02:24:55,638
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

1027
02:24:55,888 --> 02:24:57,809
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1028
02:24:58,059 --> 02:25:02,189
Meet us two days from now. Pledge us
your pardon and we'll unite behind you.

1029
02:25:02,439 --> 02:25:04,320
- Scotland will be one.
- One?

1030
02:25:04,570 --> 02:25:08,610
- You mean us and you.
- No.

1031
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:12,661
I mean this.

1032
02:25:12,871 --> 02:25:16,871
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1033
02:25:24,882 --> 02:25:26,763
You do know it's a trap. Tell him!

1034
02:25:27,013 --> 02:25:30,343
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

1035
02:25:30,593 --> 02:25:31,593
Aye.

1036
02:25:31,853 --> 02:25:33,264
I know. I saw.

1037
02:25:33,514 --> 02:25:36,814
All right, leaving him aside,
what about the others?

1038
02:25:37,064 --> 02:25:42,445
Scheming bastards who couldnae agree on
the colour of shite! It's a trap! Are you blind?

1039
02:25:42,695 --> 02:25:44,615
Look at us.

1040
02:25:44,865 --> 02:25:46,786
We've got to try.

1041
02:25:47,036 --> 02:25:51,116
We can't do this alone. Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.

1042
02:25:51,366 --> 02:25:54,377
- You know what happens if we don't?
- What?

1043
02:25:54,627 --> 02:25:58,257
Nothing.

1044
02:25:59,007 --> 02:26:02,338
- I don't want to be a martyr.
- Nor I.

1045
02:26:02,588 --> 02:26:04,508
I want to live.

1046
02:26:04,758 --> 02:26:07,349
I want a home, and children. And peace.

1047
02:26:07,599 --> 02:26:09,479
- Do ye?
- Aye, I do.

1048
02:26:09,729 --> 02:26:14,150
I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

1049
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:18,150
- It's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

1050
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:21,861
Well, then,
what have we been doing all this time?

1051
02:26:22,111 --> 02:26:23,991
We've lived that dream.

1052
02:26:24,241 --> 02:26:27,912
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron!

1053
02:26:28,162 --> 02:26:31,372
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye!

1054
02:26:31,622 --> 02:26:34,713
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

1055
02:26:34,963 --> 02:26:39,513
And your father sees you, too.

1056
02:26:47,224 --> 02:26:50,815
Jesus.

1057
02:26:55,365 --> 02:26:58,946
Shall I come with you?

1058
02:26:59,826 --> 02:27:03,327
No. I'll go alone.

1059
02:27:03,577 --> 02:27:05,457
I'll see you after.

1060
02:27:05,707 --> 02:27:08,917
Right.

1061
02:27:11,548 --> 02:27:15,758
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1062
02:27:20,969 --> 02:27:24,310
- He won't come.
- He will.

1063
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:28,190
I know he will.

1064
02:27:40,202 --> 02:27:43,792
My Lord! He approaches!

1065
02:28:26,299 --> 02:28:29,929
No!

1066
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:34,970
Stay out of it, Robert!

1067
02:28:35,230 --> 02:28:39,901
Aagh! Get away! Get away!

1068
02:28:40,941 --> 02:28:45,651
The Bruce is not to be harmed,
that's the arrangement.

1069
02:28:53,122 --> 02:28:56,163
Father!

1070
02:29:00,633 --> 02:29:03,294
You rotting bastard!

1071
02:29:03,554 --> 02:29:07,264
Why? Why?

1072
02:29:10,595 --> 02:29:13,305
Longshanks required Wallace.

1073
02:29:13,565 --> 02:29:15,936
So did our nobles.

1074
02:29:16,186 --> 02:29:18,566
That was the price of your crown.

1075
02:29:18,816 --> 02:29:21,026
Die!

1076
02:29:21,276 --> 02:29:23,447
I want you to die.

1077
02:29:23,697 --> 02:29:26,157
Soon enough I'll be dead.

1078
02:29:26,407 --> 02:29:28,287
And you'll be King.

1079
02:29:28,537 --> 02:29:31,038
I don't want anything from you!

1080
02:29:31,288 --> 02:29:33,538
You're not a man!

1081
02:29:33,788 --> 02:29:37,419
And you're not my father.

1082
02:29:40,049 --> 02:29:41,969
You're my son...

1083
02:29:42,219 --> 02:29:45,680
...and you have always known my mind.

1084
02:29:45,930 --> 02:29:47,850
You deceived me.

1085
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:50,141
You let yourself be deceived.

1086
02:29:50,391 --> 02:29:56,191
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1087
02:29:56,652 --> 02:29:58,532
At last...

1088
02:29:58,782 --> 02:30:02,742
...you know what it means to hate.

1089
02:30:05,833 --> 02:30:09,703
Now you're ready to be a king.

1090
02:30:09,953 --> 02:30:11,874
My hate...

1091
02:30:12,124 --> 02:30:15,844
...will die with you.

1092
02:30:19,845 --> 02:30:23,645
William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.

1093
02:30:23,895 --> 02:30:25,936
Against whom?

1094
02:30:26,186 --> 02:30:28,646
Against your King.

1095
02:30:28,896 --> 02:30:32,027
Have you anything to say?

1096
02:30:32,277 --> 02:30:35,867
Never in my whole life...

1097
02:30:35,907 --> 02:30:39,828
...did I swear allegiance to him.

1098
02:30:39,988 --> 02:30:44,328
It matters not. He is your King.

1099
02:30:44,868 --> 02:30:48,879
Confess and you may receive a quick death.

1100
02:30:49,129 --> 02:30:51,879
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

1101
02:30:52,130 --> 02:30:54,880
Do you confess?

1102
02:30:55,140 --> 02:31:00,561
Do you confess?

1103
02:31:04,731 --> 02:31:09,822
Then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification.

1104
02:31:19,954 --> 02:31:22,164
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1105
02:31:22,414 --> 02:31:26,294
- The King ordered that nobody...
- The King will die soon and his son is weak.

1106
02:31:26,544 --> 02:31:28,795
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1107
02:31:29,045 --> 02:31:32,635
Now open this door.

1108
02:31:32,885 --> 02:31:36,516
Your Majesty.

1109
02:31:40,516 --> 02:31:42,397
Come on, filth. Up on your feet!

1110
02:31:42,647 --> 02:31:46,397
Stop it! Leave me.

1111
02:31:46,647 --> 02:31:50,488
I said leave me!

1112
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:04,050
My Lady.

1113
02:32:04,300 --> 02:32:06,840
Sir...

1114
02:32:07,090 --> 02:32:10,391
I come to beg you...

1115
02:32:10,641 --> 02:32:15,351
...to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might show you mercy.

1116
02:32:15,601 --> 02:32:19,272
Will he show mercy to my country?

1117
02:32:19,522 --> 02:32:21,482
Mercy is to die quickly...

1118
02:32:21,692 --> 02:32:23,823
...perhaps even live in a tower.

1119
02:32:24,073 --> 02:32:27,283
In time, who knows what can happen?

1120
02:32:27,533 --> 02:32:31,164
If you can only live...

1121
02:32:34,744 --> 02:32:37,125
If I swear to him...

1122
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:42,295
...then all that I am is dead already.

1123
02:32:50,186 --> 02:32:52,187
You will die. It will be awful.

1124
02:32:52,437 --> 02:32:56,067
Every man dies.

1125
02:32:56,817 --> 02:33:00,448
Not every man really lives.

1126
02:33:06,119 --> 02:33:08,039
Drink this.

1127
02:33:08,289 --> 02:33:10,669
It will dull your pain.

1128
02:33:10,919 --> 02:33:13,080
No. It will numb my wits.

1129
02:33:13,330 --> 02:33:15,920
And I must have them all.

1130
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:18,631
For if I'm senseless or if I wail...

1131
02:33:18,881 --> 02:33:21,011
...then Longshanks will have broken me.

1132
02:33:21,261 --> 02:33:23,801
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1133
02:33:24,051 --> 02:33:27,682
Take it.

1134
02:33:30,772 --> 02:33:34,403
All right.

1135
02:34:20,289 --> 02:34:22,160
I have come...

1136
02:34:22,410 --> 02:34:24,670
...to beg for the life of William Wallace.

1137
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:28,881
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1138
02:34:29,131 --> 02:34:32,631
I respect him.

1139
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:35,432
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1140
02:34:35,682 --> 02:34:39,682
Show mercy, O thou great King,
and win the respect of your own people.

1141
02:34:49,694 --> 02:34:52,284
Even now...

1142
02:34:52,534 --> 02:34:54,824
...you are incapable of mercy.

1143
02:35:00,335 --> 02:35:03,966
And you...

1144
02:35:06,836 --> 02:35:09,887
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1145
02:35:10,137 --> 02:35:12,807
Before he lost his powers of speech...

1146
02:35:13,057 --> 02:35:14,977
...he told me his one comfort...

1147
02:35:15,227 --> 02:35:19,358
...was that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1148
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:39,881
You see?

1149
02:35:40,131 --> 02:35:43,801
Death comes to us all.

1150
02:35:51,643 --> 02:35:55,103
But before it comes to you...

1151
02:35:55,353 --> 02:35:57,443
...know this:

1152
02:35:57,693 --> 02:36:01,314
Your blood dies with you.

1153
02:36:02,364 --> 02:36:07,405
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

1154
02:36:08,785 --> 02:36:14,126
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

1155
02:36:50,871 --> 02:36:54,462
I'm so afraid.

1156
02:37:00,182 --> 02:37:02,933
Give me the strength...

1157
02:37:03,183 --> 02:37:06,813
...to die well.

1158
02:37:17,115 --> 02:37:21,325
Boo!

1159
02:37:28,126 --> 02:37:32,177
Here he comes!

1160
02:38:58,309 --> 02:39:03,320
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1161
02:39:08,661 --> 02:39:12,291
Or fall to your knees now...

1162
02:39:12,661 --> 02:39:16,372
...declare yourself the King's loyal subject...

1163
02:39:16,622 --> 02:39:20,633
...and beg his mercy...

1164
02:39:25,343 --> 02:39:28,974
...and you shall have it.

1165
02:39:38,105 --> 02:39:40,735
Rope!

1166
02:39:52,707 --> 02:39:56,338
- Raise him.

1167
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:04,889
Stretch him!

1168
02:40:05,139 --> 02:40:07,019
That's it.

1169
02:40:07,269 --> 02:40:10,850
Stretch him!

1170
02:40:46,975 --> 02:40:50,696
Pleasant, yes?

1171
02:40:51,906 --> 02:40:54,116
Rise to your knees.

1172
02:40:54,366 --> 02:40:57,116
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak...

1173
02:40:57,366 --> 02:41:00,617
...and you will feel no more.

1174
02:41:40,833 --> 02:41:42,623
Rack him!

1175
02:42:36,731 --> 02:42:40,361
Enough?

1176
02:43:30,288 --> 02:43:32,839
It can all end...

1177
02:43:33,089 --> 02:43:34,999
...right now.

1178
02:43:35,259 --> 02:43:37,840
Peace.

1179
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:39,840
Bliss.

1180
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:41,760
Just say it.

1181
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:43,850
Cry out...

1182
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:47,481
..."Mercy".

1183
02:43:55,782 --> 02:43:57,112
Mercy!

1184
02:43:57,362 --> 02:44:02,453
Mercy! Mercy!

1185
02:44:05,373 --> 02:44:08,004
Cry out.

1186
02:44:13,175 --> 02:44:18,675
Just say it. "Mercy".

1187
02:44:39,538 --> 02:44:42,369
Mercy, William. Mercy.

1188
02:44:42,619 --> 02:44:46,249
Jesus, man, say it.

1189
02:44:50,470 --> 02:44:55,471
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1190
02:45:13,493 --> 02:45:24,295
Freedom!

1191
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:11,670
<i>After the beheading...</i>

1192
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,801
<i>... William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.</i>

1193
02:47:17,921 --> 02:47:22,262
<i>His head was set on London Bridge.</i>

1194
02:47:22,392 --> 02:47:24,472
<i>His arms and legs...</i>

1195
02:47:24,722 --> 02:47:28,023
<i>... sent to the four corners of Britain...</i>

1196
02:47:28,273 --> 02:47:30,143
<i>... as a warning.</i>

1197
02:47:30,403 --> 02:47:35,784
<i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i>

1198
02:47:36,114 --> 02:47:39,074
<i>And I, Robert the Bruce...</i>

1199
02:47:39,324 --> 02:47:44,285
<i>... rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English King...</i>

1200
02:47:44,535 --> 02:47:47,585
<i>... and accept his endorsement of my crown.</i>

1201
02:47:47,835 --> 02:47:50,256
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1202
02:47:50,506 --> 02:47:54,386
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1203
02:48:22,370 --> 02:48:27,001
Come. Let's get it over with.

1204
02:48:37,183 --> 02:48:39,773
Stop!

1205
02:48:55,915 --> 02:49:00,206
You have bled with Wallace!

1206
02:49:04,967 --> 02:49:08,387
Now bleed with me.

1207
02:49:47,433 --> 02:49:51,603
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

1208
02:50:14,296 --> 02:50:17,217
<i>In the year of our Lord 1314...</i>

1209
02:50:17,467 --> 02:50:22,008
<i>... patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered...</i>

1210
02:50:22,258 --> 02:50:25,388
<i>... charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i>

1211
02:50:25,638 --> 02:50:28,268
<i>They fought like warrior poets.</i>

1212
02:50:28,519 --> 02:50:31,519
<i>They fought like Scotsmen...</i>

1213
02:50:31,769 --> 02:50:35,400
<i>... and won their freedom.</i>

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:21,661
It's fucking cold outside.

3
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:25,373
The guy on the radio said
it's gonna get down to 34.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,293
34, that's freezing,
for Chrissakes.

5
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,964
Yo, Chili. Are you spacing?

6
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:36,843
They're closing down the Granville,
that theatre on Biscayne.

7
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:39,763
The guy owes Momo a couple of Gs.

8
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:44,976
I know. I think Momo should buy it.
I could run it for him.

9
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:49,064
Why would Momo want some old theatre
that shows movies no-one watches?

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,193
I'd say turn it into
some kind of porno house.

11
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,738
- (Ray) I'm going to go talk to Chili.
- Besides, you've got a job.

12
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:00,200
Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:02,369
- Ray! How you doing?
- Good. You?

14
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:05,163
OK. Can you believe this weather?

15
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,083
It's Miami Beach, for Chrissakes.

16
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,626
Chili Palmer.

17
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:14,965
It's chilly outside and it's Chili
inside. It's a fucking Chili-fest.

18
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:18,260
How you doing, Ray?

19
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:20,595
Obviously much better
than you, Chili.

20
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,392
- That was a good one!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

21
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:35,318
Hey, when you're done
staring out the window,

22
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll meet you back at the office.

23
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:39,990
(chair scrapes)

24
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,918
Hey! Where's my coat?

25
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,379
It's not one of these?

26
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,091
Do you see a black leatherjacket
like Pacino's in Serpico?

27
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,260
If you don't, you owe me $379.

28
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:04,347
- But the sign...
- I didn't come to Florida to freeze!

29
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:08,560
You either find my coat or give me
the $379 my ex-wife paid for it.

30
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,147
(speaking Italian)

31
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:16,192
Wait, Ray Bones took my coat?

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,113
He borrow it. Somebody took his coat

33
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,866
so he tried this other coat
and it fit good.

34
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:25,660
That was my coat!

35
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,747
- He's not gonna keep it.
- My car keys are in that coat.

36
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:32,417
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.
He works for Jimmy Cap.

37
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,295
I know. Where's your phone?

38
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,880
This way.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,301
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?

40
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,094
Yes.

41
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:46,931
Tomorrow's gonna be warm,
you don't need the coat.

42
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,516
This is it.

43
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:52,270
Chili, get the coat,
just don't piss the guy off.

44
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:59,361
We'll straighten it all out with Momo,
he'll be pissed off. We don't need that.

45
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:02,947
Don't worry. I'll say no more
than I have to, if that.

46
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a minute.

47
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,560
What are you, fucking nuts?

48
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,439
My nose! My nose!

49
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,544
Uh-oh.

50
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:06,469
(coughs)

51
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,938
Holy shit!

52
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,566
(babbles)

53
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,318
Somebody call nine,
fucking one, one, one.

54
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:30,076
What do you want me to do, Ray?
Go to war over a fucking coat?!

55
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:34,581
You're lucky he didn't kill you,
the coat was a Christmas present!

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,752
Jimmy, you gotta do
something about him,

57
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,173
he's got no fucking respect for us.

58
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,341
He's got no respect for you!

59
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,553
I don't gotta do shit!
Chili Palmer don't work for me,

60
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,388
he works for Momo in Brooklyn.

61
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,852
As long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili. Understand?

62
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:58,855
Over here.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,235
We're here, Momo.

64
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:09,783
I hope you guys checked this place
out good. I don't want no surprises.

65
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,452
Yeah, I checked everything, Momo.

66
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:19,834
(sighs)

67
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:29,052
(breathes heavily)

68
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,554
(coughs)

69
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,522
(pants and wheezes)

70
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:48,238
Yeah? Who is it?

71
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:49,906
It's Momo.

72
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:51,866
(door unlocked)

73
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,290
(all) Surprise!

74
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,129
(croaks)

75
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,224
You're never gonna sleep again?

76
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:25,228
No, I'm never going to bed,
there's a difference.

77
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:30,274
It says most people die in bed.
If I stay out of bed, I'm safe.

78
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,737
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard. Where'll you sleep?

79
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:37,907
In my recliner,
the tan one in the TV room.

80
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:42,078
Or I'll go to the coffee shop,
pull my hat down.

81
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:45,915
How many people you know
died in a coffee shop?

82
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:53,256
You cut straight hair in here
orjust fags?

83
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,593
Hey, Bones,
that's quite a scar on your head.

84
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,722
These guys can fit you for a rug,
cover it up.

85
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,183
You two geezers,
take your game to the park.

86
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,939
This man is the man, you understand
what I'm saying, motherfucker?

87
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,776
You speak to Mr. Bones from now on.

88
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,863
You can do better than him.

89
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,574
Not these days,
not unless you speak Spanish.

90
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,786
Leo Devoe's six weeks over.

91
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,789
- He's dead.
- How do you know? Did he tell you?

92
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,875
Yeah, he told me he was dead.

93
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,293
Personally?

94
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:35,465
Yeah, he told me he got killed
in a jet crash last month.

95
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,760
Maybe he had flight insurance.
Visit his wife.

96
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:41,637
You do it, it's your book now.

97
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,057
He had a dry-cleaner's on the highway.

98
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,184
Let me explain something.

99
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:52,065
Momo is dead, so all he had now
belongs to Jimmy Cap, including you.

100
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:55,318
This means when I speak,
I speak for Jimmy,

101
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:59,697
e.g. from now on you start
showing me the proper respect.

102
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,534
E.g. means "for example."
You mean "i.e."

103
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,453
Bullshit, it's short for ergo.

104
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,829
Ask your man.

105
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,499
I know e.g. means "for example."

106
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,709
E.g., i.e., fuck you!

107
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,546
The point is that
when I say jump you say OK, OK?!

108
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,673
Yeah, Ray, OK.

109
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:23,137
Now, you owe me the dry-cleaner's
15 Gs plus juice which is another...

110
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,309
2700.

111
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,939
Get it from his wife or out of your
own pocket, I don't give a fuck,

112
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:35,858
but never hand me a book with a miss.

113
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:43,699
We'll see you, Ray.

114
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,995
Go see the dry-cleaner's wife.
You've got three days.

115
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,207
I told you not to piss him off...

116
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,543
Don't say another fucking word, OK?

117
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,338
I hate the dry-cleaning business.

118
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:01,843
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.

119
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,845
Must be hot.

120
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,722
You have no idea how hot it is.

121
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,646
Do you know, Fay, I was wondering,
did Leo have life insurance?

122
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,358
- I don't know of any.
- Hmm.

123
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,657
I trust you, Chili.

124
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:29,245
I think you're a decent type of man
even if you are a crook.

125
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,038
Oh. Thank you.

126
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,418
I wish he really was dead.

127
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,296
He's a son of a bitch.

128
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:48,431
That's him.
Called himself Larry De Mille.

129
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,308
Hit on every showgirl in town.

130
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,394
Said he was the "Martinizing King
of Miami". What a moron!

131
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:57,773
He's in LA. We put him on a plane
after he spanked a cocktail girl.

132
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,775
Leo spanked a cocktail girl?

133
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:04,530
He invites her to play the ponies,
she doesn't want to,

134
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,324
he gives her one on the tush.

135
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,452
My guess, he's at the track right now.

136
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:16,042
Chil, if you go to LA, this guy owes
us $150,000, some movie producer.

137
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,127
- Movie producer?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,503
Why not?

139
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:24,842
You're gonna love this guy,
another fucking moron. Harry Zimm.

140
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:42,068
(Chili) Thanks a bunch. Where is it?

141
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,486
(Rental Car Attendant) It's right there.

142
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:46,697
What is that?

143
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,699
It's an Oldsmobile Silhouette.

144
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:52,828
- I ordered a Cadillac.
- That's the Cadillac of mini-vans.

145
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:53,996
Are you kidding me?

146
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:57,416
Hey, the car rental's over there,

147
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,127
but I think all they've got
is convertibles.

148
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,424
I guess I'll take the Cadillac
of mini-vans.

149
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,361
Harry!

150
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:29,865
Harry, wake up,
somebody's downstairs!

151
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,702
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's downstairs. Shh!

152
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:36,998
I don't hear anything.

153
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,541
Right there!

154
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,334
(cheering)

155
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,087
That's the television.

156
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:48,217
Harry, I told you to turn off
the television when you were done.

157
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,468
Uh-huh.

158
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,971
I also told you
to sleep in the maid's room.

159
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,390
I did that.

160
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:58,936
I turned the television offwith the
remote and I laid it on the floor.

161
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,566
You know what could've happened?

162
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:07,320
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned it back on.

163
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,113
I don't have a dog, Harry.

164
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,745
You don't?
Oh. What happened to Muffy?

165
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:18,414
Are you gonna go down there
or shall I?

166
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,874
No, I'll go.

167
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,418
Hurry!

168
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,259
The pool needs a skim.

169
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:32,428
- Harry!
- I'm going. I'm going.

170
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,724
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Harry!

171
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:40,353
I'm going. I'm going.

172
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,565
Jesus!

173
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:48,402
(TV) Have you got a satellite dish?

174
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,779
Yeah.

175
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,865
How many channels do you get?

176
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,576
Probably 40, 50 channels.

177
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,953
Are you on the information
superhighway?

178
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,663
Not yet.

179
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:03,959
I get 2800 different channels.

180
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:05,461
2800 channels?!

181
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,172
2800. And if I wanted l...

182
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,799
Harry Zimm.

183
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:11,634
Jesus Christ!

184
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,136
How ya doing? I'm Chili Palmer.

185
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,139
If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.

186
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:20,184
- Where you been?
- Have we met?

187
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:24,730
We just did.
I told you, my name's Chili Palmer.

188
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:29,652
You're in pictures.
What if I had a heart attack?!

189
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,278
Look at me, Harry.

190
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,488
I'm looking.

191
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:34,490
Keep looking at me.

192
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,534
That's what I'm doing!

193
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:41,163
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?

194
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,126
You're a collector
for the fucking casino!

195
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,461
You come here in the middle
of the night...

196
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,674
I thought you were an actor!
We'll see about this.

197
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,056
Operator, let me have Las Vegas...

198
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,184
Let me give you some advice.

199
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,937
Don't act hard when you're
in your undies.

200
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,107
What you wanna do is
sit down and talk to me.

201
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:14,029
Harry, a marker is like a check...

202
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,365
I know what a marker is!

203
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:19,910
They don't wanna deposit yours
and have it bounce, that annoys them.

204
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,748
You haven't returned Dick Allen's calls,

205
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,084
so he asked me to look you up.

206
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,046
I follow you here
and I see you with a woman...

207
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:36,051
Looks like Karen Flores,
who was in Grotesque. Look at me.

208
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:38,053
Why do I have to look at ya?

209
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,722
I want you to.

210
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,392
So I make good
or you break my legs, huh?

211
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,227
Come on, Harry. Mesa's?

212
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:50,357
Tell Dick Allen I'll cover
those markers in 60 days.

213
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,903
If he doesn't like it, that's
his problem, the fucking prick!

214
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,908
So you want me to call you a cab?

215
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,910
You make movies, huh?

216
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:04,330
I produce feature
motion pictures, no TV.

217
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:10,961
You mentioned Grotesque. Karen Flores
was actually in Grotesque Part ll.

218
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:14,423
She also starred in three
of my Slime Creatures releases.

219
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,887
I got an idea for a movie.

220
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:21,847
(laughs)

221
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,266
(indistinct conversation)

222
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:38,531
He'd wear wool hats in Miami
in the middle of summer.

223
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,161
He doesn't want anyone to think he's
bald, so he wears a fucking cap.

224
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,043
Karen! Karen, hey!
Say hello to Chili Palmer.

225
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,295
Chili, this is Karen Flores.

226
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,630
Pleasure to meet you.

227
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:56,257
How'd you get in?

228
00:17:56,424 --> 00:18:01,262
He has an idea for a movie,
it's not bad so far. Have a drink.

229
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,305
Tell Karen.

230
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,641
Maybe you didn't hear me.

231
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,434
I came in the back door.

232
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:08,936
You broke in?

233
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,605
It was open. It wasn't locked.

234
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,691
What if it were?

235
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:18,195
Listen to the idea. A dry-cleaner
scams an airline out of 300 grand.

236
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:23,534
This guy owes a shylock $15,000.

237
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,996
He's three weeks over on the vig.
That's the interest.

238
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,497
I know what vig is.

239
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:32,501
Anyway, this dry-cleaner,
let's call him Leo, he's scared.

240
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,880
He leaves town.
Leo's on a plane but itjust sits there.

241
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:40,843
They announce over the PA
there's a mechanical problem.

242
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,014
It'll take an hour but to stay seated.

243
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:49,685
The guy's nervous
so he gets off the plane,

244
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:53,314
goes into the cocktail lounge
and starts throwing them down.

245
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,943
He's still in the lounge
when the plane crashes on takeoff.

246
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:04,658
So when the guy finds out,
he can't believe it.

247
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,827
If he'd stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.

248
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:12,750
If everybody thinks he's dead, he
won't have to pay the 15 or the vig.

249
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,044
Keep going.

250
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,714
Leo's wife is brought to the airport

251
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,800
to get any personal effects
that weren't destroyed.

252
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:26,388
Leo's bags were on the plane,
so the wife tells 'em what to look for.

253
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,390
(gasps) Ah!

254
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,644
(sobs)

255
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:39,652
Oh, my Leo! My Leo!

256
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,363
Later, the airline people
visit his wife...

257
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,450
...and offer her a settlement,

258
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,496
based on what he would've earned from
the dry-cleaner's the rest of his life.

259
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:55,918
- So how much is that?
- 300 grand. So they take it.

260
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:59,963
He gets his wife to cash the check
and he goes to Vegas with the dough.

261
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:03,467
He should call her
to let her know when to come.

262
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:08,263
She never hears from him, but
he turns the 300,000 into 500,000.

263
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:13,102
But he's winning
and he can't tell anyone who he is!

264
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:17,272
So we're showing his desire
to be famous.

265
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,358
He's got the dough
to buy his way in,

266
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:23,779
mix with the celebs,
and he can't resist, so he comes to LA.

267
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:28,242
I dunno about the celebrities.
That was just added,

268
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,871
but, yeah, he comes to LA and...
I don't know what happens next.

269
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,457
That's it, that's your movie?

270
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,459
I said I had an idea for a movie.

271
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:40,129
That's half a movie with holes in it.

272
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,214
There's maybe 40 minutes there.

273
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:47,386
You don't have a girl, a female lead,
or anybody to sympathize with.

274
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,972
- You don't have a good guy.
- The shylock is a good guy.

275
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,141
(Harry) The shylock is barely mentioned.

276
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:55,018
And it's not believable the wife'd
get a settlement that fast.

277
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:58,897
Harry doesn't realize it's
a true story. That Miami flight?

278
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,151
On the news every day for a week.
Harry must have been busy.

279
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:05,154
- That's where you got the idea?
- Part of it, yeah.

280
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,741
You're not the guy, the dry-cleaner?

281
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:11,827
- Leo.
- No, you wouldn't be talking to me.

282
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:15,038
- No, I'm not the guy, Harry.
- But you do work for the casino?

283
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,750
For God's sake, he's the shylock.

284
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,169
That's what you do?

285
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,504
That's what I did.

286
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,466
After I'm done here,
I don't know what I'll do.

287
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,634
Well, I got an early call.

288
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:30,429
No problemo. Go on up to bed.

289
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:35,809
Harry, I would like you and your
new buddy to get out of my house.

290
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,936
Oh, yeah. Well, sure.

291
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:41,648
It was absolutely a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.

292
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,359
Hmm.

293
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,498
I guess there's times
you have to get rough,

294
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,167
if one of your customers don't pay.

295
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,710
They always pay.

296
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,213
You pack a gun?

297
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,215
Not really.

298
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:07,883
Ever been arrested?

299
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:13,055
I've been picked up for loan sharking
and racketeering, but never convicted.

300
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,685
Racketeering.
Covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?

301
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:21,939
Get to the point, Harry. You want me
to do something for you?

302
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:35,452
That's us.

303
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,674
Good girl. Good girl.

304
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:36,889
Don't say nothin', just sit
and act like you're waiting.

305
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:39,892
What you talkin' about?
Give me the fuckin' money.

306
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,351
Sit down.

307
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:47,816
Now be lookin'.
Man to your right in the blue shirt.

308
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:50,569
The other way. Derecho.

309
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:52,988
That's a federal officer.

310
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:57,075
Most likely DEA.
He moves his leg, look for the bulge.

311
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,535
Savvy "bulge"?

312
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,663
That's his backup piece.

313
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:04,750
Try it without lookin' right at him.

314
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,669
- What's your name?
- Yayo Portillo.

315
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:13,091
All right, I'm gonna get up,
when I'm gone you sit in this seat,

316
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,012
under you ass is a key to a locker
where your half million is,

317
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,348
along with some product
we're returning.

318
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,975
Powder's been stepped on
so many times it's baby food.

319
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:23,644
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself!

320
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,520
Try to be cool, yahoo.

321
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:32,527
I told you where it is. Do it how
I told you, and have a safe trip home.

322
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:54,257
What'd you have for breakfast, baby?
How come you weigh so much?

323
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:56,677
You have a burrito?

324
00:24:57,553 --> 00:25:00,889
OK, give it to the nice lady,
there you go.

325
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:06,311
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

326
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,729
Bye-bye.

327
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,068
Like fucking clockwork, huh, Bear?

328
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:16,738
- Hi, Bo.
- Ready to go for a ride, sweetie?

329
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,199
I told you to watch your mouth
round my daughter.

330
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,037
(announcer)
The white zone is for loading only.

331
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,917
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service,

332
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:33,922
..put money in some of my pictures,
did OK, they're happy.

333
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:38,135
This was a few months ago,
when I was planning my next picture,

334
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:42,764
about this band of killer circus freaks.

335
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:47,060
There's this 700lb fat lady,
has a way of seducing guys,

336
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:49,271
Harry, look at me.

337
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:52,107
You're trying to tell me you fucked up
without sounding stupid.

338
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:55,444
That's hard to do.
Let's talk about where you're at, OK?

339
00:25:55,611 --> 00:26:01,533
You blew 200 grand of their money
in Vegas and didn't tell 'em. Why?

340
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:05,454
They wouldn't have taken it
with any understanding or restraint.

341
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,709
If you're so scared,
why take it to Vegas to begin with?

342
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:12,961
I needed half a million to buy a script.

343
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:16,840
A blockbuster, but quality.

344
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,302
No mutants or maniacs.
This is gonna be my Driving Miss Daisy.

345
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:30,312
Murray Saffron, who wrote my Grotesque
pictures, showed it to me one day,

346
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,273
said he's got a star interested,
would I produce?

347
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,524
Which star?

348
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,694
Two-time Academy Award nominee,
Martin Weir.

349
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:43,992
That's Martin Weir!
He played the mob guy in Cyclone.

350
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,368
One of his best parts.

351
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:48,580
No, his best part was the crippled
gay guy who climbed Mt. Whitney.

352
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,290
(Harry) Ride The Clouds.

353
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,626
The woman, she looks familiar.

354
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,671
She's a rock star.
Every day they have breakfast.

355
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,802
He faces west, so he sees his billboard.
She faces east so she can wear shades.

356
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:07,474
Anyway, Murray's shrink is
Martin's personal trainer's shrink.

357
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:11,353
Murray's shrink gives
the script to Martin's trainer,

358
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:13,522
who reads it to Martin.

359
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:15,398
Martin loves it.

360
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:19,528
- So what's the problem?
- Problem is Murray. Heart attack.

361
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:23,573
Doris, Murray's widow,
hears about the Martin Weir thing,

362
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:27,536
and because we didn't have a contract,
she wants half a million for the script.

363
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:32,165
Ah, so you want my dry-cleaner
to invest in your movie.

364
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:36,378
That, or what if some accident
was to befall the widow Saffron?

365
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,965
No, I'm not gonna pop her, OK?

366
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,466
It was just a thought.

367
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:46,221
I'll meet these limo guys,
tell 'em to leave you alone

368
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,223
in a way they'll understand.

369
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:49,891
You don't know these guys.

370
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,811
Believe me, I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.

371
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:15,584
I asked this literary agent what kind of
writing paid best, he said ransom notes.

372
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,463
Here it is, Mr. Lovejoy.

373
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:31,183
"Lovejoy sits at the wheel,
watching the bar across the street..."

374
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,727
- Is he following someone?
- Read it, it's a grabber.

375
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,447
Harry, I think your investors are here.

376
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:46,823
Oh, Jesus!

377
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,617
All right, this is the plan.

378
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:51,578
I want these guys to sit here,
not on the couch.

379
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,334
Keep the blinds open.
I want the light in their eyes.

380
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:01,379
I'll sit at the desk. I don't want
you to introduce me. Just start talking.

381
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,424
I want you to stand behind them
as they sit down. Understand?

382
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:08,178
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.

383
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,641
That's right.
Do not tell 'em who I am.

384
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:16,269
- I gotta say something.
- No, you don't.

385
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,983
Unless it's "Glad you assholes stopped
by, now I can straighten you out."

386
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,610
You're kidding, right?

387
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,655
Just say the movie's been postponed.

388
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:29,449
And whatever you do,
don't say anything about Mr. Lovejoy.

389
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:32,953
All right, let's go.

390
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,164
Hey, Ronnie!

391
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:37,582
Harry, all right!

392
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:45,048
Have we entered a time warp? I feel
like I'm in Hollywood of yesteryear.

393
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,300
- Have a seat right there.
- Cool.

394
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,892
This is my associate, Chili Palmer.

395
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,355
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

396
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:04,859
your investment is just as solid
as the day you signed.

397
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,320
I can hear you, man,
but where the fuck are you?

398
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:08,863
Right here!

399
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,367
What I've been wondering is,
where's he been?

400
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:16,037
Yeah, where you been, Harry?

401
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,832
New York. I was scouting locations.

402
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,794
The main thing is that Freaks will
be put off for a couple of months.

403
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,754
- A couple of months?
- Yeah.

404
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,261
Just a couple of months, yeah.
We need more... prep.

405
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,806
Bullshit, man!
We have an agreement.

406
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:36,725
We're going to do this picture.

407
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:42,480
I just have another project first,
one I promised this guy for years.

408
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:47,569
(Ronnie) I wanna see your books.
Show me a two with five zeros after it.

409
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,781
I wanna see your books,
your fuckin' bank statements...

410
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,075
(Chili) Hey, Ronnie. Look at me.

411
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:58,830
You have a piece of a movie,
not a piece of Harry.

412
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:02,459
If he wants to do another movie
this year, that's how it's gonna be.

413
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,253
Excuse me...
but who the fuck are you?

414
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:07,213
I'm the one telling you how it is.

415
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,845
What is this other movie, Harry?

416
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:16,598
Harry, let me answer this.

417
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:19,559
First, who am I talking to, him or you?

418
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,102
You can talk to me.

419
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,855
That's what I thought.
Let me put it this way.

420
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:27,484
Outside of Freaks, it's none
of your fucking business what we do.

421
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,986
Whoa! Here it is, right here.

422
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,739
This is the project, Mr. Lovejoy.

423
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:35,784
I'm not puttin' one over on you.

424
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,162
What is it, a porno flick?

425
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,332
It's fluff,
you wouldn't be interested.

426
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,502
You think we see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.

427
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,717
So how 'bout you just take
our 20 points out of Freaks,

428
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:55,136
and put it in this other one?

429
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,138
No, I can't do that.

430
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,973
You're positive about that?

431
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:03,311
Yeah, it's a different kind of deal,
it's structured...

432
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,565
OK. Then be good enough
to hand us our money back.

433
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:12,028
Or let us come in on this new deal.
Let us know.

434
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,490
By Friday, or you're fuckin'
dead as disco. You hear me?

435
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:21,079
Take your time, Harry.
We're not animals. Are we, Ronnie?

436
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:48,690
What?

437
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:55,113
Maybe I wasn't clear, but I thought
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

438
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,698
I had to tell 'em something.

439
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:01,244
Never say anything
unless you have to.

440
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,038
You asked me to get these guys
off your back.

441
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:08,710
Then you offer a piece of Mr. Lovejoy.
I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.

442
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:12,589
I told them I'd think about it.
In this town, that means nothing.

443
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,051
That's the difference between you
and me, Harry. I say what I mean.

444
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:24,476
I want Martin Weir, I talk to Martin
Weir, not his trainer's shrink.

445
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,269
Shrink's trainer.

446
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,854
Take me back to my car.

447
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:39,324
(phone)

448
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:41,659
Yeah?

449
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:43,077
Tommo. Chili.

450
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:46,498
Where you been?
I been lookin' all over.

451
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:49,959
Ray Bones is looking for you.
Where are you?

452
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:55,423
I'm in LA now. I'm going into
the movie business. Producing.

453
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:57,675
What the fuck do you know
about makin' movies?

454
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:00,470
I don't think the producer
has to know much.

455
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,014
(key in lock)

456
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:06,100
I gotta go. Call me when
you know more about Bones.

457
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:09,270
Hey, Karen, how you doin'?

458
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,939
What are you doing here?

459
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:15,109
Listen, I wanted to apologize
for breaking in last night.

460
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:20,448
You broke in again to apologize
for breaking in before?

461
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:24,619
No, your patio door was open.
You shouldn't do that.

462
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:26,913
Well, lock it on your way out.

463
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,290
You had a bad day, huh?

464
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:35,129
The director said I couldn't reach
the emotional core of the character.

465
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:39,467
What? Obviously he didn't see
Bride Of The Mutant.

466
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:41,511
You saw that one?

467
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,308
When you say to the alien mother
that her time on earth is finished,

468
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:52,355
Joan Crawford, on her best day
wished she had the emotion,

469
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,940
the intensity that you had.

470
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:57,652
That was a good scene
for a horror movie.

471
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,612
No, for any movie.

472
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,326
I know I'm better than walking round
in fuck-me pumps, waiting to scream.

473
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:06,869
Yeah, but what a scream.

474
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:13,501
It would be nice to get the chance
to say one great line.

475
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:17,672
Like when Bette Davis walks up
to the guy

476
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,300
and says "I'd kiss you...

477
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,468
...but I just washed my hands".

478
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,721
How come you don't work with Harry?

479
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:28,683
'Cause I married Martin Weir.
He was a full-time job.

480
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,728
- Have you read Harry's new script?
- No.

481
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,272
He says it's the best thing
he's ever read.

482
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,066
He means after Slime Creatures lll.

483
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:42,155
Did Harry ask you to help him
put Martin in a movie?

484
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:46,868
Harry's dreaming of
a $40 million movie,

485
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,954
with a star he'll never sign
with or without my help.

486
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,540
He said Martin flipped over it.

487
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,375
Martin's known for his flipping.

488
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:58,296
When it's time to make a deal,
he flips out.

489
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:03,551
Why don't I pick you up a script,
then you can read it yourself?

490
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,220
Don't go out of your way.

491
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,889
Nah, it's nothing.

492
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,685
Well, I gotta have a talk
with my runaway dry-cleaner.

493
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,729
See how your story ends.

494
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:17,607
Touch Of Evil is
playing near my hotel.

495
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,070
We can check it out if you want.
Watch Charlton Heston be a Mexican.

496
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,324
That's all right. Another time.

497
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:30,036
See you round.

498
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:34,040
See you.

499
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,752
(music playing on stereo)

500
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,942
Hi. My name is Ray,
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.

501
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,779
Have you spoken with Mr. Palmer
since your husband blew up?

502
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:07,615
Oh, once or twice.

503
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,325
What was it you talked about?

504
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,661
Nothing really. This and that.

505
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,121
This and that?

506
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:20,962
Fay... Fay, I want us
to be friends, I really do.

507
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:26,134
And we all know friends don't hit
each other unless they have to.

508
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:32,014
So what do you say you tell me
exactly what the fuck is goin' on?

509
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,558
(sobs)

510
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:35,101
OK?

511
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,191
Good evening, sir.

512
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,736
And a very good evening
to you too, sir.

513
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:10,094
Leo.

514
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:12,180
Look at me.

515
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:20,062
I'd have never thought you'd be so dumb.
Leaving over 300 grand in a closet.

516
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,523
I guess you are.

517
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:27,111
I didn't know where else to keep it.
Where would you?

518
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:28,696
How 'bout a bank?

519
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,240
They'd report it to the IRS.

520
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:36,162
You don't open an account,
you get a safe deposit box.

521
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,164
How did you know I was here?

522
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,543
Next time you write to your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.

523
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,545
It was Fay, wasn't it?

524
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:47,048
Did she tell you my life history?

525
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:49,717
Leo, I'm here to save your ass.

526
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:52,345
How? By taking my money?

527
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:54,514
No, the money you won today is yours.

528
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:55,932
It's all mine!

529
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,767
Leo, sit down.

530
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:04,482
I don't know how you got this far,
you're so fuckin' dumb,

531
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,193
but you're through,
and I'll explain why.

532
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,031
Ray Bones is the man
you're dealing with now,

533
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:17,829
and when he finds out what you did,
he'll take everything.

534
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:20,623
Then most likely he'll shoot you,
so you won't tell.

535
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,252
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

536
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:29,632
There's 310,000 here. I'm taking the
300 you scammed from the airlines,

537
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,427
and the ten that's over,
I'm gonna borrow from you.

538
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:38,850
Wait... You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?

539
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:42,520
At 18%. Don't ask another
fuckin' question. I'm leaving now.

540
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:49,610
But you won't know where I am.
I don't even know where I'll be.

541
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,947
I'll find you, Leo.
You leave a trail like a caterpillar.

542
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,242
Hey!

543
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:01,664
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this 18% shit?

544
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:05,001
You wanna borrow ten,
the vig is three bills a week.

545
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:08,337
15 for the vig, plus the ten,
that's 25 big ones.

546
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:12,341
Hey, you hear... hear me?

547
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:51,047
This is good. This Mr. Lovejoy...

548
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:56,093
It needs a better ending, but yes,
I see why Harry wants to do it.

549
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:01,849
I knew he was lyin',
sayin' this wasn't any good,

550
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:05,436
but holding on to it,
like you'd have to break his fingers!

551
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:11,150
That's funny. I was thinking
what I'd have to break of yours.

552
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:13,569
I'm explaining why I'm here,

553
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:19,200
in case you thought I came to rob
any of this dusty old shit.

554
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:21,869
I wouldn't make you out
to be a burglar.

555
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:25,373
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?

556
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,002
I never heard your name,
or read it in Variety or anyplace.

557
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,213
I'm his associate.

558
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,090
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.

559
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:36,050
I do. Me.

560
00:41:36,843 --> 00:41:39,553
It says here
you're getting Martin Weir.

561
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:41,389
That's right.

562
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:43,849
Come on.
How you gonna do that?

563
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:46,227
I'm gonna take a gun,
put it to his head,

564
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:49,105
I'm gonna say
"Sign, Martin, or you're dead."

565
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,067
I wonder, would that work?

566
00:41:53,235 --> 00:41:57,571
You know who I see as Al Roxy?
Harvey Keitel.

567
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:00,157
He was good in that movie Fingers.

568
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:04,412
You know who else? Morgan Freeman.

569
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:07,748
Morgan Freeman.
But he's a colored guy.

570
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:12,253
So what? Where does it say
the man's got to be white?

571
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:16,424
Color's what the part needs, man.
You need somebody with some style.

572
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,260
So what do you think of the script?

573
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,184
The first thing
that's got to go is the title.

574
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:30,229
Murray Saffron would be
better than Lovejoy.

575
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:32,023
I'm with you on that.

576
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:38,279
Why don't you and I sit down, write
the script over where it needs it.

577
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:41,240
- You could write one of these?
- Nothin' to it.

578
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:44,785
You get an idea,
set it down on paper,

579
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:49,707
then you hire somebody
to fill in the commas and shit,

580
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,668
fix up the spelling,
where you have tricky words.

581
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,130
Although I've seen scripts,
I know words weren't spelt right,

582
00:42:56,298 --> 00:43:00,134
there was hardly any commas at all.
So I don't think that's too important.

583
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:04,472
You get to the end, fade out.
You done.

584
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,807
That's it?
That's all there is to it?

585
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:11,145
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?

586
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm offering my services, man.

587
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:20,654
I'll tell you what. If I need
a ride sometime, I'll let you know.

588
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,788
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

589
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:31,665
This is where you're going to die.

590
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,798
That was no miss.

591
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:41,008
I don't want to shoot you
in the back.

592
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:43,844
Unless you'd rather
try to run for it.

593
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,972
(gunshot)

594
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,185
Did you bring my wife?

595
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:53,395
She's in the car.
I've got it all on tape.

596
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:56,273
- You sure you got enough?
- Go play it back, you'll see.

597
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,653
(indistinct movie dialogue)

598
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:06,325
That's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

599
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:09,203
That's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

600
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:16,752
You're going down, Orson.

601
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,678
lsn't somebody going to come
and take him away?

602
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:27,429
You really liked him, didn't you?

603
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:28,848
The cop did.

604
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:33,227
The cop did. The one who killed him.
He loved him.

605
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:35,938
Well, Hank was a great detective.

606
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,065
- But a lousy cop.
- But a lousy cop.

607
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:41,610
ls that all you have to say for him?

608
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:44,405
He was some kind of a man.

609
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:50,703
What does it matter
what you say about people?

610
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,545
Goodbye, Karen.

611
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:04,133
Adios.

612
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:13,434
Wow, huh?

613
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:17,146
(sighs)

614
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:21,650
You've been here the whole time.

615
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,068
No, I just caught the end.

616
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:28,657
Welles didn't want to do this movie.
He couldn't get out of the contract.

617
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:33,370
Sometimes you do your best work
when you got a gun to your head.

618
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,041
I brought you a copy of the script.

619
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:38,918
I've read it.
Harry left a copy at the house.

620
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:41,212
- How'd you like it?
- It's not horrible.

621
00:45:41,379 --> 00:45:44,131
I don't like the title
or some characters.

622
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,383
- So you read it?
- I haven't yet, but I will.

623
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:48,510
You and Harry make a great team.

624
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:50,137
Is that right?

625
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:53,349
- I'll make a deal with you.
- Oh, found a character you like?

626
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:56,810
I want to produce it
especially if I help him get Martin.

627
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:59,480
Hey, that's fair.

628
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:01,148
So what do you get out of it?

629
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:03,609
Is that why you came here,
to ask me that?

630
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:05,319
I wanna know.

631
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:07,488
Why would anyone
want to be in movies?

632
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:09,698
Yesterday you were a loan shark.

633
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:14,245
I was never into it and especially
that bullshit about respect.

634
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:18,123
It was bad enough
treating these guys like heroes,

635
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:21,293
those stupid comments
they think are so funny.

636
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:23,963
You think the movie business
is different?

637
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,258
I like movies and I figured
if I help Harry make one,

638
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:30,678
I'll find out what to do
outside of having an idea.

639
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:36,725
I was in the money business
and I have a lot of ideas in my head.

640
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:39,478
I'm going to talk to Martin tomorrow.

641
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:43,148
I told Harry I'd meet you and him
at the restaurant afterwards.

642
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:49,363
This mightjust work out.
You never know.

643
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,532
Sounds fine.

644
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,370
(Chili to himself) Adios.

645
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:54,845
(Yayo) I spent eight hours at the
airport looking at people's bulges!

646
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:56,972
This is not the way we do business.

647
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,602
You don't know who you're messing
with. I want the fucking money!

648
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:06,648
You gonna smoke, you get
the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.

649
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:11,612
I told you where the money is.
Now go and get it.

650
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:17,451
I'll tell you somethin',
if they bust me,

651
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:20,454
I tell them I come to get something
for you. That's all I know.

652
00:48:20,622 --> 00:48:22,664
- That's all you know, huh?
- That's all I know.

653
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:25,000
Wait here. I'll be back directly.

654
00:48:27,212 --> 00:48:28,962
Keep an eye on him for me.

655
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,101
That's the way you get things done.

656
00:48:47,732 --> 00:48:49,775
What the fuck
you gonna do with that?

657
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:51,693
I'm taking you out, yahoo.

658
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,958
See that,
the way the man went right over?

659
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:08,293
We could get Chili Palmer here.

660
00:49:08,461 --> 00:49:11,839
You could fix my railing
to give way like in the movies.

661
00:49:12,006 --> 00:49:16,343
I invite him to look at my view,
get him to lean over...

662
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:18,679
It's the dumbest idea I ever heard.

663
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:21,390
Here's the thing, Bear,

664
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:26,019
what's the point of living in LA
unless you're in the movie business?

665
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:31,650
High up in it. That's why Harry's
going to produce Mr. Lovejoywith me,

666
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,694
not Chili Palmer.

667
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:57,092
I can't believe
this map is accurate.

668
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,636
I bought it from a kid on Sunset.

669
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:01,889
You were supposed
to meet me at the restaurant.

670
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:05,225
It says Martin Weir's house
across from George Hamilton.

671
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:07,102
- That must be...
- Chili?

672
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,812
Nicole?

673
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,441
It's Nicki now.
I don't believe this!

674
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,859
Hey!

675
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:15,903
- I know her!
- Hi, Nicki.

676
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,198
Karen, shit, I didn't see you.
How are you?

677
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:21,950
You gotta come in,
you gotta meet Martin!

678
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,497
Where you been?
What have you been doing?

679
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:31,084
Chili was the only one
who didn't try to hit on me.

680
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:33,003
What a gentleman.

681
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:34,755
Do you like my hair black?

682
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:37,508
Nice, yeah,
especially under the arms.

683
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:43,305
Martin won't let me shave. Takes
him back to the '60s or something.

684
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,433
Speak of the devil.

685
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,228
Karen, look at you.

686
00:50:49,395 --> 00:50:50,646
Hi, Martin.

687
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:54,691
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.

688
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:57,277
Martin, this is Chili Palmer.

689
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:58,946
Chili, is it?

690
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:00,614
Nice to meet you, Martin.

691
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:05,786
Chili ran a club I used to play at
in Miami. How is Momo these days?

692
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:07,621
Dead.

693
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:10,457
Bummer. I'll let you
get to your movie talk.

694
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:13,418
Chili, do not leave
without saying goodbye to me.

695
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:19,091
So...

696
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:23,470
You know how beautiful you are?

697
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:25,264
You really are beautiful.

698
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:29,518
I'm sitting here looking at you

699
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,271
and having flashbacks, memories of us.

700
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,690
- Really?
- Yeah and I'm wondering...

701
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:38,443
...how did it all slip away?

702
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:43,156
It didn't slip away. You did when
you fucked Nicki at my birthday party.

703
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,493
That was a good party.

704
00:51:46,661 --> 00:51:49,079
You know, Marty, you were so good
in that movie, The Cyclone.

705
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,623
Martin. Yeah, it was a beautiful role.

706
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,501
All I had to do
was find the character's center.

707
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:59,715
The stem I used to wind him up
and he'd just play.

708
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:04,303
If I didn't know better,
I'd have thought you was a made guy.

709
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,471
No acting there, right?

710
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,640
And the fink part...

711
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:11,393
I never met a fink
and I hope I never do,

712
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,438
but the way you played a fink,
that's how it's gotta be.

713
00:52:14,606 --> 00:52:15,772
Yeah.

714
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,317
Two weeks before shooting,

715
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:21,194
I went to Bensonhurst
to hear you guys talk.

716
00:52:21,362 --> 00:52:24,197
I'm Italian, but grew up in Tarzana.

717
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,951
I wanted to get the rhythms
of your speech.

718
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:30,454
We speak differently?

719
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:33,040
It was more your attitude, your tone.

720
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:36,877
Your speech patterns demonstrate
confidence in your opinions,

721
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:39,338
your indifference
to conventional views.

722
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,507
Like we don't give a shit?

723
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:44,217
Yeah, kinda. Yeah.

724
00:52:45,345 --> 00:52:48,472
Once I get the authentic
sounds of speech,

725
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,558
the patois, you know,

726
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:56,271
I can actually think the way
those guys do. Get inside.

727
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,898
- Really?
- Yeah.

728
00:52:58,066 --> 00:53:01,026
Well, I'm one of those guys.
What am I thinking?

729
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,986
Well, don't get me wrong,

730
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:08,075
a metamorphosis doesn't take
place, that wouldn't be acting.

731
00:53:08,242 --> 00:53:11,870
- So you don't know what I'm thinking?
- No, but I have to say I'm curious.

732
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:14,247
So you want to know?

733
00:53:14,415 --> 00:53:16,875
- If you want to tell me.
- I'm thinking about a movie.

734
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:18,251
One of mine?

735
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:20,045
No. One we're producing.

736
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,631
With what? Wise guy money?

737
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:27,177
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

738
00:53:27,345 --> 00:53:30,180
I'm not connected to that any more

739
00:53:30,348 --> 00:53:32,724
since I left that
loansharking operation.

740
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:34,518
The pressure got too much for you?

741
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:37,104
I'm the one who applied the pressure.

742
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:40,315
- Oh, yeah?
- Can I ask you a question?

743
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,275
Yeah.

744
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:45,946
- Actors like to pretend, right?
- We've been known to make believe.

745
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:50,117
Pretend this. You're a shylock.
A guy owes you 15 grand.

746
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:53,161
He skips town, he takes off.
What do you do?

747
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:01,920
(low laugh)

748
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:03,964
(grunts melodramatically)

749
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:08,260
Oh, Martin, for Christ's sake...

750
00:54:09,554 --> 00:54:11,638
This is, you know...

751
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:15,475
I'm doing Shylock
instead of a shylock.

752
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:17,185
What's my motivation?

753
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:22,149
The acquisition of money,
to collect, to inflict pain if I must.

754
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:27,738
Guy splits with my money, I go
after him, what do you think I'd do?

755
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:30,157
- Look at me.
- I am looking at you.

756
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:33,910
Look at me the way I'm looking at you.
Put it in your eyes.

757
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:36,496
"You're mine, asshole,"
without saying it.

758
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,166
OK, how 'bout this?

759
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:46,673
Are you telling me you're sleepy,
you want to go to bed?

760
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:49,634
All right, OK.

761
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:51,887
(strains theatrically)

762
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:00,854
Now you're squinting
like you need glasses.

763
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:03,315
What do you...?

764
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,525
- Look at me.
- What?

765
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:09,362
What I'm thinking is
"You're mine. I fuckin' own you."

766
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,324
But I'm not feeling
one way or another about it.

767
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:17,913
You're not a person to me, you're an
entry in a book, a guy who owes me.

768
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:21,541
All right, how about this?

769
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,089
Whoa, oh, wow, not bad!

770
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,759
Not bad.
No wonder you're Martin Weir.

771
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:36,181
That's what I think of you, asshole.
Nothin'.

772
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:38,892
I believe it.

773
00:55:40,102 --> 00:55:41,978
So I turn this on
when I confront the guy?

774
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:45,065
You haven't found him yet,
he's split for Las Vegas.

775
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:47,943
- How do I know that?
- Because his wife told you.

776
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,195
His wife told me. OK.

777
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,447
(convivial laughter)

778
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,580
Harry, how you doing?

779
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,666
Great.

780
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:06,211
I'm expecting some people.

781
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:09,965
You must be doing some big deals
doing lunch in a place like this.

782
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:11,758
I'm working on a few things.

783
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,678
I hear you bagged Martin Weir
for Mr. Lovejoy.

784
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:17,097
Word gets around, huh?

785
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:22,519
Chili Palmer told me when
he called me over to talk about it.

786
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:24,312
He showed you my script?

787
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,898
Yeah. I was wondering
why he would do that.

788
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:32,612
The wife sues the airline?
Some gutsy babe!

789
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,948
Good looking, too, like Karen.

790
00:56:35,116 --> 00:56:37,701
When do I meet the husband
and give him the look?

791
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,578
That's not so simple.

792
00:56:39,745 --> 00:56:42,289
There's a mob guy.
You owe him money.

793
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:46,126
He wants to take you out
because you broke his nose.

794
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:48,378
Keep going.

795
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:51,798
At this point, basically,
that's gotta be it.

796
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,134
That's all you'll tell me?

797
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:57,846
The reason we came by
was to talk about Mr. Lovejoy.

798
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:01,141
We understand that you read
the script and you loved it.

799
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:03,977
Refresh my memory.

800
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:07,939
Listen, how'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?

801
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:10,817
Pay me back at your convenience,
no interest.

802
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:12,652
Are you serious?

803
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,113
All I want in return
is to work on this movie with you.

804
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:19,451
I've got some ideas
on how to fix it up.

805
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:21,661
(waiter) Can I get you anything else?

806
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:24,497
Another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.

807
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:30,962
You're just going to give me
this $500,000?

808
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,673
We'll talk about that
but first I gotta know,

809
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:36,259
how'd you hook up
with this Chili Palmer?

810
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:41,514
Mr. Lovejoywas good.
I'll call Buddy, set up a meeting.

811
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:42,724
Who's Buddy?

812
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,476
- His agent.
- Karen knows him.

813
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:46,394
- You are interested?
- I'm intrigued.

814
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,772
Take another look at The Cyclone,

815
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,191
the way the visual fabric
is maintained

816
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,652
while the metaphor
plays on different levels.

817
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:57,739
Is this your ride?

818
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,325
I like to sit high,
check everything out.

819
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:02,535
It is the Cadillac of mini-vans.

820
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:04,996
- Ho...
- Check this out.

821
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:11,670
Mind if I take it for a spin?

822
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:16,341
(chuckles)

823
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:22,347
He was watching Letterman, huh?

824
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:24,224
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.

825
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:27,394
Did he ever find that dry-cleaner,
the one with all the money on him?

826
00:58:27,561 --> 00:58:29,729
Leo? I don't know.

827
00:58:30,648 --> 00:58:35,777
I bet he did and he ain't giving you one
penny to help you out, not the way I am.

828
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:41,157
Assuming I go along with this,
when can I have the $500,000?

829
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:42,659
Whenever you want.

830
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:47,831
The money's in $100 bills
in a locker at the airport.

831
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,416
At the airport?

832
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,418
(sniggers)

833
00:58:53,587 --> 00:58:57,132
It was waiting out there on a deal
that didn't go through, Harry.

834
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,009
One you don't want to know about.

835
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:00,927
I don't know...

836
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:06,266
It's not a thing you'd do,
so why not send Chili Palmer?

837
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:10,520
If he gets busted,
you aren't out a thing, Harry.

838
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,273
C18.

839
00:59:13,441 --> 00:59:15,108
The magic number.

840
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:17,610
Cat.

841
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,242
I'm positive it was Susan Hayward.

842
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,619
It was Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford.

843
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:29,873
Excuse me, Harry.

844
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,584
Wait here.

845
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:44,721
I'd like you to meet
my associate, Bear.

846
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:48,433
Stuntman, champion weightlifter,
as you might have noticed.

847
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:50,643
Throws things out I don't want.

848
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:53,938
Turn around and go back to Miami.

849
00:59:54,106 --> 00:59:56,816
A stunt man. Any good?

850
00:59:57,943 --> 00:59:59,903
Am I any good?

851
01:00:00,071 --> 01:00:01,404
(shouts in pain)

852
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,995
That's not bad for a guy his size.

853
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,918
If you can get out of here
before I take my coat off,

854
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:18,171
I won't clean up the floor with you.

855
01:00:19,673 --> 01:00:23,426
You don't know me.
You only think you do.

856
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,067
- That guy is a stunt man.
- Yeah, he was in Creatures II.

857
01:00:47,201 --> 01:00:49,202
Rough business, this movie business.

858
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,746
I may go back to loansharking
for a rest!

859
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,374
What are you still doing
with those guys?

860
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:57,961
He happens to be loaning me
$500,000. No strings.

861
01:00:58,129 --> 01:01:00,171
I can write any kind of agreement.

862
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:01,881
Cash or check?

863
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:06,010
Cash. It's in a locker
at the airport at this moment.

864
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:10,765
A locker at the airport?
Tell me you're not that stupid.

865
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:14,561
You're being set up.
He's paying you back.

866
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:16,855
That right? He's setting me up?

867
01:01:17,022 --> 01:01:20,233
Why did Catlett say
I should send you to pick it up,

868
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:25,155
since you haven't done a thing for
me except show Catlett my script?

869
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:29,534
You're right,
you're not being set up.

870
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:31,744
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.

871
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:33,413
We spoke with Martin.

872
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:34,789
We?

873
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,082
- Chili and me.
- Really?

874
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,418
Told us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.

875
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,587
A meeting. You and Karen?

876
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,005
Harry...

877
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:46,426
He's been in town two days
and he thinks he's David O Selznick.

878
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:52,682
Shall I deal with Bo or will you
talk with your dry-cleaner?

879
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,602
I've found him,
but forget about Leo's money.

880
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:57,145
Do you have it?

881
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:01,774
If I gave you Leo's money you'd
have Ray Bones all over your ass.

882
01:02:01,942 --> 01:02:03,276
Who?

883
01:02:03,444 --> 01:02:06,738
Ray Barboni.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.

884
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:09,991
Who the fuck is Momo?
Where do you get these names?

885
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,287
I'll go to the airport

886
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,706
and if there's no
problem I'll get your money.

887
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:19,000
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

888
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,962
Maybe I'll call Barboni and ask him
if he wants to invest in my movie.

889
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:27,467
He's not a movie fan. Gimme the key.

890
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:30,970
(Karen) Oh, Harry.

891
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:36,935
Tell him he's got to be out by 5:00am.

892
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:38,603
(knock on door)

893
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:40,980
The actor'll only work one night.

894
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,733
I gotta go. Yeah.

895
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:48,738
Coming!

896
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:53,159
- Who is it?
- Me.

897
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:54,535
Oh, fuck!

898
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:56,663
I heard that.

899
01:02:57,456 --> 01:02:59,040
Hello, Doris!

900
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,543
Harry Zimm!
You look like a wet kiss.

901
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:04,879
Mmm!

902
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:09,259
Yum! Aren't you gonna offer me
whatever it is you taste like?

903
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:11,970
Come in, Doris.

904
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:15,056
My favorite color! Putty.

905
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:17,684
(chuckles) Yeah, I like it.

906
01:03:18,644 --> 01:03:20,186
What do you want, Doris?

907
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:31,364
I miss Murray, Harry.

908
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:34,867
Yeah, I miss him, too.
Hell of a good writer.

909
01:03:37,288 --> 01:03:38,705
I made him what he was.

910
01:03:38,872 --> 01:03:43,209
He was a hack. He couldn't get a job
writing for anybody but you.

911
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:48,381
I'm being honest. He was
a lousy writer but a good husband.

912
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:50,800
I didn't know till it was too late.

913
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:54,095
Yeah, well, 20/20 hindsight
and all that.

914
01:03:55,264 --> 01:04:00,268
I hate being alone.
The house is so quiet, so lonely.

915
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:03,771
It needs...

916
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:06,149
...a man's touch.

917
01:04:07,818 --> 01:04:09,944
Nice necklace, Doris.

918
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:15,241
Mmm!

919
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:17,702
Doris...

920
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:20,830
I don't know how I feel about this.

921
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:23,583
You seem to feel fine about it.

922
01:04:25,169 --> 01:04:28,129
I mean morally. Murray was a friend.

923
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,589
Murray's dead.

924
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,930
Does this mean you'll reconsider
our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?

925
01:04:38,098 --> 01:04:42,935
No, but I talked to a gorgeous
young executive at Paramount

926
01:04:43,103 --> 01:04:45,855
who happened
to get his hands on the script.

927
01:04:46,023 --> 01:04:47,023
What'd he say?

928
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:50,276
He said if Martin's interested,
I can get half a million for it.

929
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:56,366
Don't worry, Harry.
I'm still gonna give you till Friday.

930
01:04:57,117 --> 01:04:58,493
How honorable of you.

931
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,579
Harry, you want me to go,

932
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:03,498
just say so.

933
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,753
(sighs) Oh, what the hell?

934
01:05:16,053 --> 01:05:17,553
(phone)

935
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:18,971
Fuck.

936
01:05:21,558 --> 01:05:25,645
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

937
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:31,317
What?

938
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:32,693
Ray Barboni?

939
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:34,070
Who is this?

940
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:35,988
ls this Ray Bones?

941
01:05:36,156 --> 01:05:38,241
It depends. Who is this?

942
01:05:39,743 --> 01:05:43,913
This is the one telling you
the way it is. OK, asshole?

943
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,499
You want your 300 grand or not?

944
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,584
What 300 grand?

945
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:52,255
The 300 grand Leo Devoe
scammed off an airline.

946
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:56,551
The 300 grand that Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.

947
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:01,347
Hello? Are you there?

948
01:06:01,515 --> 01:06:06,352
I don't like this anonymous crap.
You're either a big chickenshit,

949
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,979
or you're not for real.

950
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:10,022
I am very for real.

951
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:11,524
So who are you?

952
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:14,360
I work for Harry Zimm.

953
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:15,528
Who?

954
01:06:15,696 --> 01:06:19,198
Harry Zimm,
a major Hollywood player.

955
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:20,658
I never heard of him.

956
01:06:20,826 --> 01:06:23,828
Because you've never left
fucking Miami, dipshit.

957
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:28,207
Maybe you ought to come out to LA
and meet Mr. Zimm.

958
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:32,712
OK, so this Zimm guy
is asking for a finder's fee?

959
01:06:34,548 --> 01:06:39,927
Zimm don't ask for dick.
Zimm tells you the way it is, or else.

960
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:43,431
Or else what?

961
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,558
Use your fucking imagination!

962
01:06:46,101 --> 01:06:47,393
(hangs up)

963
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:07,974
Excuse me, could you help me out?

964
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:13,437
I got a surprise gift in here for my
wife. Could you put it in locker C17?

965
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:17,358
Ten bucks. Take you two minutes.

966
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,985
Yeah, OK.

967
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:21,445
You'll need this.

968
01:08:22,656 --> 01:08:26,659
Gotta make it quick, though,
she's in the john. C17.

969
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:46,470
Good man.

970
01:09:47,824 --> 01:09:49,158
Let's go, boys.

971
01:09:52,871 --> 01:09:56,165
Excuse me, sir.
Agent Curtis, Drug Enforcement.

972
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:58,501
These are agents Dunbar and Morgan.

973
01:09:58,669 --> 01:10:00,419
Would you come with us, please?

974
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:01,754
What's going on?

975
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,589
Let's behave ourselves.

976
01:10:10,764 --> 01:10:14,767
Mr. Barbone? Welcome to LA.
Did you have a good flight?

977
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:19,438
I hope you drive better than you fucking
spell. It's Barboni, not Barbone.

978
01:10:20,982 --> 01:10:23,275
Want to go to the hotel first,
Mr. Escobar?

979
01:10:23,443 --> 01:10:25,111
Wanna get my fucking money.

980
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:31,158
You live in Miami?
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

981
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:34,537
I'm a movie producer.

982
01:10:34,705 --> 01:10:35,705
You have a card?

983
01:10:35,872 --> 01:10:39,375
Not yet. I just got started.
What's this all about?

984
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:42,128
I could strip-search you.

985
01:10:42,295 --> 01:10:43,713
Pat him down.

986
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,925
Hands on the wall. Spread your legs.

987
01:10:48,093 --> 01:10:49,427
Why are you at the airport?

988
01:10:49,594 --> 01:10:52,930
I was supposed to pick up my wife
but she wasn't on the plane.

989
01:10:53,098 --> 01:10:55,266
Is she coming in from Newark?

990
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:58,811
We had a fight
and she went back to Brooklyn.

991
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:03,983
So I said "Come out West. A change of
scenery might get us back together."

992
01:11:04,151 --> 01:11:06,986
She said OK but evidently
she changed her mind.

993
01:11:07,154 --> 01:11:08,988
Your wife a Lakers fan?

994
01:11:09,156 --> 01:11:12,825
I am. I like everything that's LA.
I love it out here.

995
01:11:13,827 --> 01:11:14,869
He's clean.

996
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:17,997
You can go.

997
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,251
What are you guys looking for?
A bomb?

998
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:24,962
Something that shouldn't be there.

999
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:28,758
Get an attendant to open the lockers.

1000
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:30,676
That's an idea.

1001
01:11:30,844 --> 01:11:34,638
I'd do that. Then I'd get
the right guy next time.

1002
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:49,487
Mr. Barbone, to go to the beach,
this is the freeway.

1003
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:51,822
On the weekend, there's no traffic.

1004
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:55,201
I'm from Miami fucking Beach
and you wanna show me the ocean!

1005
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:58,829
Does the sun ever shine
or is this smog around all the time?

1006
01:11:58,997 --> 01:12:01,874
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.

1007
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:03,834
That's what they say, huh?

1008
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:06,962
What a bunch of fucking bullshit!

1009
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:23,354
I don't know how I missed you
in that shirt.

1010
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:27,525
It's like the other one but with
a different colored hibiscus.

1011
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:29,860
You didn't have the key on you?

1012
01:12:30,028 --> 01:12:35,241
You think I'd be here? To set
someone up, it's gotta be a surprise.

1013
01:12:36,243 --> 01:12:37,701
You spotted 'em, huh?

1014
01:12:37,869 --> 01:12:41,038
Did you see it work in some movie?

1015
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:43,415
I gotta ask you for that key back.

1016
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:47,670
The setup didn't work
and you want the key back?!

1017
01:12:47,838 --> 01:12:50,756
Bo said if you didn't
open the locker, the deal's off.

1018
01:12:50,924 --> 01:12:52,758
You're serious?

1019
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:56,428
This is how you do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.

1020
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:02,101
There's no fucking way you're getting
that key unless you got a gun.

1021
01:13:02,269 --> 01:13:04,603
Move away from the fucking car.

1022
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:06,063
I don't need a gun.

1023
01:13:09,526 --> 01:13:14,113
All right, all right. Slow down.
Breathe through your mouth, slow.

1024
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:19,118
Bear, look at me.

1025
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:21,412
(wheezes)

1026
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:24,957
Tell your boss I don't ever
wanna see him again.

1027
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,209
A deal's a deal. Got that?

1028
01:13:27,377 --> 01:13:29,461
OK, get up.

1029
01:13:32,757 --> 01:13:35,843
What are you hanging around
a guy like that for, anyway?

1030
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,638
You were a stunt man, right?
What's he ever done?

1031
01:13:42,475 --> 01:13:44,476
- You OK?
- Not too bad.

1032
01:13:45,478 --> 01:13:47,813
How about when you fell
down the stairs?

1033
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:50,316
I pulled my quadriceps.

1034
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:53,819
How many movies you been in?

1035
01:13:53,987 --> 01:13:55,779
About 60.

1036
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,699
No shit? What were some of them?

1037
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:01,827
You won't have seen none of 'em.

1038
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:03,579
- No, what were some of them?
- You wouldn't know.

1039
01:14:03,747 --> 01:14:05,748
I know movies.

1040
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:09,084
(knock on door)

1041
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:10,669
Harry Zimm?

1042
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:12,421
(continued knocking)

1043
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,465
Who is it?

1044
01:14:16,009 --> 01:14:19,595
I'm the dipshit
who's never been outta Miami.

1045
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:24,391
Mr. Barboni, what a nice surprise!

1046
01:14:25,477 --> 01:14:26,894
Uh, have a seat.

1047
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,896
Right here. Right here.

1048
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,856
(chuckles)

1049
01:14:34,194 --> 01:14:35,861
Ray Bones.

1050
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:38,405
Barboni...

1051
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:41,075
Oh, yes. Uh...

1052
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:47,039
They say the fucking smog
is the fucking reason

1053
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:49,833
you have such beautiful
fucking sunsets.

1054
01:14:50,835 --> 01:14:51,835
Yes...

1055
01:14:52,671 --> 01:14:54,296
What do you mean he faked them out?

1056
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:56,840
He was ready for the setup.

1057
01:14:57,008 --> 01:14:59,343
- So where's the money?
- I guess it's still in the locker.

1058
01:14:59,511 --> 01:15:01,845
You guess? You don't know?

1059
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:05,808
I don't care, Bo.
I really don't care.

1060
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:07,893
Bear, I'm gonna call you later.

1061
01:15:09,562 --> 01:15:12,189
Mr. Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to LA.

1062
01:15:12,357 --> 01:15:13,649
Where's my nephew?

1063
01:15:13,817 --> 01:15:15,359
Your who?

1064
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,778
Yayo! Where is he?

1065
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:21,365
I haven't seen Yayo.

1066
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:28,122
He is my sister's kid. No father.
Personally, I think he's a retard.

1067
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:31,000
I only gave him the job as a favor
to my sister. You understand?

1068
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:34,253
Family. I know.

1069
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:36,422
He comes up here with our product.

1070
01:15:36,589 --> 01:15:40,009
He should come home with $500,000.
He never shows up.

1071
01:15:40,176 --> 01:15:44,388
Meanwhile, my sister's
going crazy with worry.

1072
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:48,225
I just wanna know
where my fucking money is.

1073
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:51,603
I don't know. I gave him his money.

1074
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:54,106
You gave him the money?

1075
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:57,151
I gave him a key to a locker
with the money in it.

1076
01:15:57,318 --> 01:15:59,236
Why did you do that?

1077
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:02,865
There were a zillion
DEA guys in the terminal.

1078
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:05,534
A zillion? That's a lot.

1079
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:08,579
Maybe your nephew panicked
and took off.

1080
01:16:08,747 --> 01:16:11,790
Why are you talking this bullshit?

1081
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:15,169
I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!

1082
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:18,797
What do you think?

1083
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:21,341
I think you speak very good English.

1084
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,595
We're gonna spend the weekend
at the Universal Sheraton.

1085
01:16:24,763 --> 01:16:27,347
See the shark.

1086
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:30,476
Watch that Miami Vice spectacular.

1087
01:16:30,643 --> 01:16:31,810
Oh, nice.

1088
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:36,231
After, we're gonna come back here,
get my money.

1089
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:39,693
(speaks Spanish)

1090
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,529
Oh, yeah. And Yayo, too.

1091
01:16:45,492 --> 01:16:46,992
His fucking nephew?!

1092
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,995
You go straight to the bank.

1093
01:16:50,163 --> 01:16:55,292
We got dick in the bank.
We dumped it all into Harry's movie.

1094
01:16:56,127 --> 01:17:00,756
I'm talking about you, Ray Barboni,
owning a piece of a motion picture.

1095
01:17:00,924 --> 01:17:04,301
How much is up to you.
What I'm saying is,

1096
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:07,679
you could invest part
of the 300 grand Palmer owes you,

1097
01:17:07,847 --> 01:17:10,432
or all of it. It's up to you.

1098
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:16,105
Where's Chili Palmer? Where's Leo
Devoe? Where's my fucking money?

1099
01:17:16,272 --> 01:17:18,482
Ray, look at me.

1100
01:17:20,735 --> 01:17:21,944
What?

1101
01:17:22,112 --> 01:17:23,445
Look at me, Ray.

1102
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:25,322
Did you just say look at you?

1103
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,032
Look at me, Ray.

1104
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,161
Take a fucking look at this.

1105
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:35,374
Have a peek at this.

1106
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:41,046
You know, Harry, this is the exact
fucking thing I needed.

1107
01:17:41,214 --> 01:17:43,799
A little fucking exercise...

1108
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:47,052
...after that long fucking...

1109
01:17:48,304 --> 01:17:49,888
...plane ride!

1110
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:54,685
You got a big problem, Harry.

1111
01:17:54,853 --> 01:17:58,397
Come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.

1112
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:01,233
Look at me, Harry.

1113
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:05,529
Where's my money?

1114
01:18:07,866 --> 01:18:11,076
Harry, I'm gonna ask you one more time,

1115
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:14,163
then I gotta shoot you,
you don't tell me.

1116
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:16,456
Where's my money?

1117
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:19,710
Your money? Who the fuck are you?

1118
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,088
I'm Ray Barboni from Miami.

1119
01:18:23,256 --> 01:18:27,926
I'm supposed to know you?
He belongs to me and my partner.

1120
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:30,345
- This piece of shit owes me money.
- Get in line.

1121
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,139
I don't like waiting in lines.

1122
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:36,018
Tough shit. This ain't Miami.
You gotta ask me.

1123
01:18:36,186 --> 01:18:39,563
Fuck you, fuckball. LA is an open city.

1124
01:18:39,731 --> 01:18:42,524
I don't need permission
from nobody for nothing.

1125
01:18:42,692 --> 01:18:46,612
Oh, really? Well, I just closed it.

1126
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:50,824
You must be one of those
quick-draw artists,

1127
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,119
the way you got your gun
stuck way down in your belt.

1128
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:57,581
What have you got there?

1129
01:18:57,749 --> 01:19:01,501
They're always fucking jamming
on you at the wrong time.

1130
01:19:06,299 --> 01:19:08,300
Don't you puke on my shoes, Harry.

1131
01:19:08,885 --> 01:19:12,471
Hey, Harry.
I want you to do me a favor.

1132
01:19:13,264 --> 01:19:17,809
Take this gun and
put a pill in the bro' over there.

1133
01:19:17,977 --> 01:19:21,271
You're thinking, why shoot him?
He's already dead.

1134
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:25,484
The police have tests
to tell whether you fired a gun.

1135
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:31,365
And I was never here. Do you
understand? I was never here.

1136
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:37,204
If you say I was, I'm gonna
throw you outta that fucking window.

1137
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:44,920
Knock it off, Harry, we haven't got
a lot of time. That's it. That's it.

1138
01:19:47,507 --> 01:19:49,675
Not a worry in the world.

1139
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:52,803
- Your pool needs skimming.
- Yeah.

1140
01:19:53,846 --> 01:19:56,723
That was Martin.
He wants us to have lunch tomorrow.

1141
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:59,518
- Depends on who's paying.
- Definitely not Martin.

1142
01:19:59,686 --> 01:20:03,272
Movie stars never pick up the check.

1143
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,608
Most don't know their phone number.

1144
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:11,280
I can't get used to the idea
that the two of you were together.

1145
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:15,993
- You don't like Martin, do you?
- No, I do! I think he's...

1146
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,954
- I think he's short!
- (both laugh)

1147
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:24,209
But, uh, I know he's a good actor,

1148
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:26,753
but what was it exactly
that you saw in him?

1149
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,549
Oh... Martin was different then.

1150
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:32,301
He wasn't a movie star.

1151
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:37,055
What about your story?
You thought of a title yet?

1152
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:38,849
How about Get Shorty?

1153
01:20:39,726 --> 01:20:41,727
Chili's Hollywood Adventure?

1154
01:20:41,894 --> 01:20:45,147
That's a different story.
I'm still working on it.

1155
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,277
I'm getting the visual fabric together.
But I have added to it.

1156
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:53,030
There's a girl in it now.

1157
01:20:53,197 --> 01:20:55,240
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1158
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,909
- She looks like you.
- Oh!

1159
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,710
You could be an actor. You act
sometimes but you don't show it.

1160
01:21:06,878 --> 01:21:09,504
You thought I was faking?

1161
01:21:09,672 --> 01:21:12,841
No, not then! I mean in general.

1162
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:16,928
You don't mean a movie star?
More like a character actor?

1163
01:21:17,096 --> 01:21:19,056
Whichever.

1164
01:21:19,223 --> 01:21:22,726
I could see myself
in a Robert De Niro part,

1165
01:21:22,894 --> 01:21:26,021
or even a Al Pacino,
playing a real hard-on.

1166
01:21:26,189 --> 01:21:28,315
I couldn't see myself in them movies

1167
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,734
where the three guys
get left with the baby...

1168
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,238
Chili. Chili, look at me.

1169
01:21:38,785 --> 01:21:40,786
(phone)

1170
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:43,872
Leave a message.

1171
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,082
(beep)

1172
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:51,254
Karen, it's Doris. You might wanna come
visit Harry in the emergency room.

1173
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:55,175
Let's go.

1174
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:01,473
I stopped by his office to ask him
to take me to Le Dome for dinner.

1175
01:22:01,641 --> 01:22:04,726
I see Harry and some other man
lying on the floor.

1176
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,687
Good night, Todd, Lewis.

1177
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:09,815
Oh, man!

1178
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:12,150
Jesus!

1179
01:22:12,318 --> 01:22:13,819
Harry, my God!

1180
01:22:13,986 --> 01:22:16,154
He can't talk.
He's full of Demerol.

1181
01:22:16,322 --> 01:22:19,366
According to Todd, Sergeant Randall,

1182
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:23,161
a man named Ronnie
wanted to collect a debt from Harry.

1183
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:25,247
He got rough and Harry shot him.

1184
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:28,500
- You shot Ronnie?!
- (indistinct mumble)

1185
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,588
Hello, hello! OK,

1186
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:37,843
Mr. Zimm has a broken jaw
and some neck trauma

1187
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:40,387
to go with these fractured hands.

1188
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:43,140
Excuse us, folks.

1189
01:22:48,354 --> 01:22:52,315
Martin wanted to meet us for lunch
tomorrow at the Ivy, and I cancelled,

1190
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:56,987
but he's going to Cannes
so I think Chili and I should go.

1191
01:22:57,155 --> 01:23:00,740
(doctor) Who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr. Zimm's jaw?

1192
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:06,204
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1193
01:23:06,372 --> 01:23:08,039
Hi, Bo.

1194
01:23:08,207 --> 01:23:11,543
Hey, Farrah! Little honey bunny!

1195
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,879
You wipe your feet?

1196
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:15,755
- Yeah.
- That's my girl.

1197
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:18,216
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet nice and white.

1198
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:21,094
I been calling you. Where you been?

1199
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,888
See the paper?

1200
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:24,848
I seen it. I don't believe it.

1201
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:27,392
It says Harry shot Ronnie five times,

1202
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,395
four through the chest
and one through his foot.

1203
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:33,732
His foot! Jesus! Poor Ronnie.

1204
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,861
Tonight, later on, I've got one for you
that won't involve any heavy work.

1205
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:40,363
I want you to take a look
around Chili Palmer's hotel room.

1206
01:23:40,531 --> 01:23:43,575
No, I can't. I can't.

1207
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:46,369
I gotta take Farrah
over to her mother's.

1208
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:52,000
I quit!
I don't work for you no more.

1209
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:55,045
I came down
to tell you to your face.

1210
01:23:55,213 --> 01:23:58,048
The Colombians are in LA,
upset about their money,

1211
01:23:58,216 --> 01:24:02,427
and it turns out Yayo
was Escobar's nephew.

1212
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:04,930
That's your problem.
You shot the guy.

1213
01:24:07,934 --> 01:24:12,395
Farrah! Hey, honey bunny!
Come here, honey bunny!

1214
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:17,484
Come and see Uncle Bo, come on.
Uncle Bo hates being alone.

1215
01:24:19,237 --> 01:24:23,532
He hates it so much, if he takes a fall,
he's not gonna fall by himself.

1216
01:24:23,699 --> 01:24:25,909
He's gonna plea-deal his way out.

1217
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:29,287
Give up his ace stunt man, now one
of the West Coast's dope kings,

1218
01:24:29,455 --> 01:24:31,039
if they go easy on him.

1219
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:36,753
In Federal joints, you get extra time
with your daddy on Father's Day.

1220
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:39,422
Let her go, Bo.

1221
01:24:46,138 --> 01:24:50,100
After this one, I'm out.
It's the last time we talk.

1222
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:53,979
Remember Harry's story about
the dry-cleaner Palmer was after,

1223
01:24:54,146 --> 01:24:58,483
- who stole 300 grand from the airline?
- What about him?

1224
01:24:58,651 --> 01:25:02,821
You go look around Palmer's hotel room
while I check out Karen Flores's place.

1225
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,575
Meet me back here at midnight.

1226
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:13,748
What kind of food is it at the Ivy?

1227
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:16,835
Continental, but Martin
won't order from the menu.

1228
01:25:17,003 --> 01:25:18,044
Why not?

1229
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:23,049
Movie stars have to think of
something that isn't on the menu.

1230
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:34,185
Harry, you should be
in the hospital!

1231
01:25:34,353 --> 01:25:37,564
You look like you're in
one of your own horror movies.

1232
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,691
(muffled)

1233
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:42,027
- What'd he say?
- "My project."

1234
01:25:42,194 --> 01:25:43,862
Mr. Zimm!

1235
01:25:45,197 --> 01:25:48,033
Hey, Harry! Attaboy, killer!

1236
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:50,535
Right this way.

1237
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:59,794
You're a celebrity. You shoulda
shot someone a long time ago.

1238
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:01,755
(muffled chuckle)

1239
01:26:08,304 --> 01:26:13,725
Hi.

1240
01:26:13,893 --> 01:26:17,812
'Scuse me. How you doin'?
Hello. Hi.

1241
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:21,191
How you doin'? Hey, Chili.

1242
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:23,276
Good to see you.

1243
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:27,822
Harry! Oh, my goodness!

1244
01:26:33,663 --> 01:26:36,164
- Hi, Martin.
- Sweet face.

1245
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:38,416
You look great. You smell good, too.

1246
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:39,793
Thanks.

1247
01:26:43,547 --> 01:26:47,133
So, Harry, I hear you had
quite an experience.

1248
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,928
Anyway, I'm glad you're OK.

1249
01:26:51,555 --> 01:26:56,184
I'm glad you rejected me ten years ago
for the part of Eddie Solomon,

1250
01:26:56,352 --> 01:26:58,395
the pedophile clown.

1251
01:26:58,562 --> 01:27:01,773
If I'd have gotten that part,
I might have been typecast!

1252
01:27:02,983 --> 01:27:05,944
Have you guys ordered?
Can we order?

1253
01:27:06,112 --> 01:27:08,196
Excuse me, could you...?

1254
01:27:08,948 --> 01:27:10,365
- Hi, what's your name?
- Stephanie.

1255
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:12,242
Hi, Stephanie.

1256
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,160
Can you make an egg white omelet

1257
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:19,124
with slightly brown shallots
and no salt?

1258
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:22,001
Bring one for the table.

1259
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:23,461
No...

1260
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:28,883
How about those strawberry frappes,
drinks with little strawberries?

1261
01:27:29,051 --> 01:27:31,553
And bring two straws for Harry.

1262
01:27:32,888 --> 01:27:37,100
Anyway, I think the romance angle
in your story is critical.

1263
01:27:37,268 --> 01:27:42,021
This shouldn't be a hop in the sack.
These two should fall in love.

1264
01:27:42,189 --> 01:27:43,481
Which two?

1265
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:47,235
Then, when the mob guy's
chasing them,

1266
01:27:47,403 --> 01:27:51,156
it adds a wistful element
to their romance.

1267
01:27:51,323 --> 01:27:52,782
Mob guy?

1268
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:56,745
As the mob guy, it's another
man's wife I'm sleeping with.

1269
01:27:56,912 --> 01:27:58,997
After all, you have such morals.

1270
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:06,880
I have to run, but I'd like to see
them having misgivings

1271
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:10,300
about wanting the money.
It's a moral dilemma for them.

1272
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:14,012
They rationalize taking it,
but in the end, they can't.

1273
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,182
- What money?
- The 300 large.

1274
01:28:17,349 --> 01:28:19,601
I shouldn't discuss this
until I've read the script,

1275
01:28:19,769 --> 01:28:21,686
but I have such a good feeling.

1276
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:24,063
I am that shylock.

1277
01:28:27,985 --> 01:28:29,652
Look at me, Harry.

1278
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:34,032
(Chili) Not bad!
You're really getting it down.

1279
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,578
It scares me how well I know this guy.
I could do this tomorrow.

1280
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:48,880
Doll face. You should think
about getting back into acting.

1281
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:51,883
- I'll give it some heavy thought.
- OK.

1282
01:28:57,223 --> 01:28:58,848
Take care of yourself, Harry.

1283
01:29:03,729 --> 01:29:04,896
Enjoy.

1284
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:13,738
Let me help you out. Go ahead.

1285
01:29:17,076 --> 01:29:18,827
(groans)

1286
01:29:18,994 --> 01:29:20,328
Suck harder.

1287
01:29:27,086 --> 01:29:28,711
(distant banging)

1288
01:29:28,879 --> 01:29:32,382
Chili, wake up!
Somebody's downstairs.

1289
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:33,925
It's Harry.

1290
01:29:34,093 --> 01:29:35,677
How do you know?

1291
01:29:35,845 --> 01:29:38,888
He's doing what you did to him,
playing Letterman on TV.

1292
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:42,058
That's not Dave, it's a movie. Hmm.

1293
01:29:42,226 --> 01:29:44,269
- You gonna go down?
- I don't know.

1294
01:29:44,436 --> 01:29:45,770
You don't know?

1295
01:29:45,938 --> 01:29:47,647
I know, I'm going!

1296
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:54,070
Karen, you got a gun?

1297
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:56,281
- No!
- Any kinda gun'll do.

1298
01:29:56,448 --> 01:29:57,949
No!

1299
01:29:58,701 --> 01:30:01,452
(faint voice on TV)

1300
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:07,625
Ah. Sounds like Rio Bravo.

1301
01:30:09,879 --> 01:30:13,298
Duke, maybe this'll help.

1302
01:30:16,135 --> 01:30:18,011
(laughter)

1303
01:30:27,938 --> 01:30:30,148
Guess I'll take that drink.

1304
01:30:30,316 --> 01:30:31,774
I thought you would.

1305
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:36,529
(gunshot)

1306
01:30:38,949 --> 01:30:42,911
You want that gun, pick it up.
I wish you would.

1307
01:30:46,498 --> 01:30:48,833
I need the money.

1308
01:30:49,001 --> 01:30:50,168
What money?

1309
01:30:50,336 --> 01:30:53,379
The 300 grand you got
from a dry-cleaner named Leo.

1310
01:30:54,673 --> 01:30:59,761
You break into Karen Flores's house
and ask for 300 grand?

1311
01:30:59,929 --> 01:31:01,304
Just give me the money.

1312
01:31:03,933 --> 01:31:05,975
I can't believe how fucked up
your organization is.

1313
01:31:06,143 --> 01:31:09,854
How about I count to three and organize
your brain all over the wall back there?

1314
01:31:10,022 --> 01:31:11,272
How 'bout that? One...

1315
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,982
You're gonna shoot me now, huh?

1316
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:15,860
- Just a second. Two...
- (laughing) I can't believe this...

1317
01:31:16,028 --> 01:31:18,488
- (screams)
- (gunshots)

1318
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:22,867
Karen!

1319
01:31:23,035 --> 01:31:24,869
She can't talk right now.

1320
01:31:26,538 --> 01:31:29,040
Nice scream.
They oughta give you more work.

1321
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:32,251
I'll get you the money,
but it's not here.

1322
01:31:32,419 --> 01:31:35,380
Fine. In the meantime,
I'll hold onto her.

1323
01:31:38,133 --> 01:31:41,427
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue,
right off Laurel Canyon.

1324
01:31:41,595 --> 01:31:43,388
- I'll be there, Karen.
- (muffled cries)

1325
01:31:54,066 --> 01:31:56,859
- You get the money?
- No. What is this?

1326
01:31:57,027 --> 01:31:58,528
Plan B.

1327
01:32:00,572 --> 01:32:02,490
You make yourself comfortable.

1328
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:07,328
(raised voices)

1329
01:32:09,456 --> 01:32:11,207
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1330
01:32:15,004 --> 01:32:16,129
Calm down, Bear.

1331
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:19,424
- This is life in prison!
- Don't fade on me now, Bear.

1332
01:32:19,591 --> 01:32:23,845
You gonna shoot me now?
Put me out of my misery!

1333
01:32:24,013 --> 01:32:28,558
Calm down, unless you wanna spend
your life with Farrah on your lap

1334
01:32:28,726 --> 01:32:30,476
in a roomful of felons!

1335
01:32:30,644 --> 01:32:32,270
(door closes)

1336
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:37,108
So! This is one of them houses
that hang off the side of the cliff.

1337
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:39,110
Where's Karen?

1338
01:32:39,278 --> 01:32:42,321
In my bathroom. Where's the money?

1339
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:49,912
- Let me see her.
- Go ahead.

1340
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:53,958
Karen! Are you OK?

1341
01:32:54,126 --> 01:32:56,461
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet.

1342
01:32:56,628 --> 01:32:59,839
She's great! Give me the money.

1343
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,717
I'm gonna settle something.

1344
01:33:02,885 --> 01:33:06,637
I've been shot up before, three times,

1345
01:33:06,805 --> 01:33:07,889
and I'm still here.

1346
01:33:08,057 --> 01:33:10,099
I'm gonna be here as long as I want.

1347
01:33:10,267 --> 01:33:14,312
So you gotta be nowhere near me,
Karen or Harry.

1348
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,731
Take your money,

1349
01:33:16,899 --> 01:33:20,818
and leave the movie business to those
of us who know what we're doing.

1350
01:33:21,653 --> 01:33:23,112
Come on, Karen.

1351
01:33:28,786 --> 01:33:31,245
You broke in my house
and I have a witness.

1352
01:33:31,413 --> 01:33:32,413
What?

1353
01:33:32,581 --> 01:33:36,084
And it ain't John Wayne
or Dean Martin in El Dorado.

1354
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:40,588
That was Rio Bravo.
Robert Mitchum was in El Dorado.

1355
01:33:40,756 --> 01:33:44,634
Dean Martin was in Rio Bravo.
Basically the same part.

1356
01:33:44,802 --> 01:33:48,346
John Wayne played John Wayne in both.

1357
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:50,473
I can't wait for you to be dead.

1358
01:33:50,641 --> 01:33:52,225
Are you gonna let him...?

1359
01:33:55,604 --> 01:33:58,356
That's for the stairs,
and that's for the airport!

1360
01:33:58,524 --> 01:34:01,192
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.

1361
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,827
Make it look like he came at us,
you shoot him. Self-defense.

1362
01:34:10,994 --> 01:34:13,788
Shouldn't he have a weapon,
a knife or something?

1363
01:34:13,956 --> 01:34:15,039
I'll get it later.

1364
01:34:15,207 --> 01:34:17,375
Bear, that's enough.

1365
01:34:17,543 --> 01:34:22,421
He's gonna look like somebody
beat him up and then shot him.

1366
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:24,924
No, he ain't.

1367
01:34:30,848 --> 01:34:33,015
(both) Waah!!

1368
01:34:33,725 --> 01:34:35,518
(Bear) Hold on, man!

1369
01:34:35,686 --> 01:34:38,062
- Chili!
- What the hell are you doin'?

1370
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,106
(Chili) Karen,
what the fuck are you doing?

1371
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:42,233
She's shooting at us! Come on!

1372
01:34:47,322 --> 01:34:50,533
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1373
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:53,744
Wow.

1374
01:34:56,498 --> 01:34:58,374
How do you think that happened?

1375
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:00,626
Beats the shit outta me.

1376
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:15,683
Were you scared up there?

1377
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:17,018
You bet.

1378
01:35:17,186 --> 01:35:18,603
You don't act like it.

1379
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:22,190
I was scared then, not now.
How long you want me to be scared?

1380
01:35:24,067 --> 01:35:25,318
I'll be right back.

1381
01:35:46,965 --> 01:35:48,341
How'd you get in here?

1382
01:35:48,508 --> 01:35:52,261
I told them I was you. I acted
real stupid and they believed me.

1383
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,889
What brings you to LA, Bones?

1384
01:35:55,057 --> 01:35:58,517
Don't insult me, just turn around!

1385
01:36:00,812 --> 01:36:05,274
You're the dumbest fuck I ever met.
Lemme take a look in these pockets.

1386
01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:08,694
You shoulda told me about Leo Devoe.

1387
01:36:08,862 --> 01:36:10,112
Why would I do that?

1388
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,865
Because the guy is
a customer of mine, dummy!

1389
01:36:15,661 --> 01:36:18,955
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

1390
01:36:20,123 --> 01:36:22,250
C18.

1391
01:36:22,417 --> 01:36:25,711
I wonder what this could be!
A locker key?

1392
01:36:26,338 --> 01:36:27,838
But where's the locker?

1393
01:36:28,006 --> 01:36:30,091
I checked the bag at the airport.

1394
01:36:31,009 --> 01:36:34,679
Which terminal?

1395
01:36:34,846 --> 01:36:36,180
Sovereign.

1396
01:36:39,643 --> 01:36:41,644
You found Leo, huh?

1397
01:36:41,812 --> 01:36:45,898
You found him, you took his money,
you put it in a locker ready to go?

1398
01:36:47,317 --> 01:36:48,985
Why haven't you left?

1399
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,903
I like it out here.

1400
01:36:53,907 --> 01:36:58,869
I been thinking, there's no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.

1401
01:36:59,788 --> 01:37:01,872
Forget about that stuff.

1402
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,542
I don't even remember
how all this started.

1403
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:08,045
You took a swing at me. Fuck it.

1404
01:37:08,213 --> 01:37:10,548
You owe me money. Fuck that.

1405
01:37:10,716 --> 01:37:13,801
You owe me the juice on the money.
Fuck that too.

1406
01:37:13,969 --> 01:37:15,928
I say live and let die.

1407
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:20,766
But this is strictly between you and I.

1408
01:37:22,185 --> 01:37:25,313
You say nothing to nobody about this.
Understood?

1409
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,814
Whatever you say, Ray.

1410
01:37:26,982 --> 01:37:28,899
I think it's only fair. Don't you?

1411
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,237
Then it's all settled.
I'll see you around.

1412
01:37:36,533 --> 01:37:37,908
Dumb fuck.

1413
01:37:38,076 --> 01:37:46,042
(chuckles)

1414
01:37:53,383 --> 01:37:54,592
Come here.

1415
01:38:02,392 --> 01:38:03,392
The fucking airport.

1416
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,560
(plane overhead)

1417
01:38:53,276 --> 01:38:54,819
Bingo, boys, let's go.

1418
01:38:55,654 --> 01:38:57,822
Hey, Bones! Look at me.

1419
01:39:03,078 --> 01:39:05,413
Fuck you, fuckball!

1420
01:39:06,415 --> 01:39:07,832
Aaagh!!

1421
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:09,959
Damn!

1422
01:39:10,127 --> 01:39:12,253
Cut! Cut!

1423
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:14,547
I am pushing the right button.

1424
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:18,050
- You're not!
- I'm pushing the right button.

1425
01:39:18,885 --> 01:39:21,429
Bear, show him how to do it, OK?

1426
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:24,390
What do you wanna do, Harry?

1427
01:39:25,475 --> 01:39:30,146
Wrap. It's a wrap.
Come back tomorrow. Fuck!

1428
01:39:30,313 --> 01:39:33,607
You should've gone into overtime
to get that shot.

1429
01:39:33,775 --> 01:39:36,527
It's the second day
and we're two weeks behind.

1430
01:39:37,904 --> 01:39:40,698
And do me a favor, Harry. Next time...

1431
01:39:40,866 --> 01:39:43,659
Martin already told me that he loves it.

1432
01:39:43,827 --> 01:39:46,370
Look, Buddy.
I don't think Martin is right.

1433
01:39:46,538 --> 01:39:49,540
- Why the hell not?!
- Because he's too short. Come on.

1434
01:39:50,709 --> 01:39:52,626
Why does he keep pushing Martin?

1435
01:39:52,794 --> 01:39:54,003
Packaging.

1436
01:39:54,171 --> 01:39:56,922
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.

1437
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:01,010
Where do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go downtown?

1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,773
Hello?

2
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,937
Hello?

3
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,774
Hi!

4
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,154
Cheese.

5
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,035
Hello?

6
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,329
Oh, hi.

7
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,414
Uh, right.

8
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,999
10:30. Right.

9
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,335
Uh, we're doing okay.

10
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,047
Right.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,340
Okay.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,342
Fine.

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,010
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,346
Whatever makes you comfortable.

15
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,639
Sure.

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,724
Fine.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,851
Well, look, if we see
you after --

18
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,312
You know, whatever you want.
Thanks. Okay.

19
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,829
Hello?

20
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,039
Oh, thanks for calling.

21
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,541
W-We just don't think
our daughter

22
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,376
would have wanted to hear
the God thing.

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,836
Oh, thank you.
See you there.

24
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,758
That was the rabbi.
It's a done deal.

25
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,218
-- No God?
-- No God.

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,053
-- But <i>Yahweh.</i>
-- No <i>Yahweh.</i>

27
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,388
Okay.

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,436
Hello?

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,313
10:30, yes.

30
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,773
Oh. Oh.

31
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,150
Do you want us to hold it
for you?

32
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,902
No, we'll wait.

33
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,446
Well, you're on -- you're on
the throughway, right?

34
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,698
Um.

35
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,119
Lock your door.

36
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,998
Lock your door.

37
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,208
Lock your door.

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,566
We're all set.

39
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:05,537
# <i>Feeling's gettin' stronger</i> #

40
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,334
# <i>Music's getting longer, too</i> #

41
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,462
# <i>Music is flashin' me</i> #

42
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,630
# <i>I want to</i> #

43
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,881
# <i>I want to</i> #

44
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,761
# <i>I want to take you higher</i> #

45
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,348
# <i>I want to take you higher</i> #

46
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,435
# <i>Baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>light my fire</i> #

47
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,811
# <i>Yeah, hah</i> #

48
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:35,984
# <i>I want to take you higher</i> #

49
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,152
# <i>Boom shaka</i>-<i>laka</i>-<i>laka</i> #

50
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,112
# <i>Boom shaka</i>-<i>laka</i>-<i>laka</i> #

51
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,340
<i>Cielo.</i>

52
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,885
<i>Cielo.</i>

53
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,889
<i>Cielo.</i>

54
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,558
"Sky."
Sometimes "ceiling."

55
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,269
Do you think the dead girl
was learning ltalian?

56
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,230
For the honeymoon --
she and the fiancé.

57
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,232
The guys on set-up

58
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:01,737
heard they were planning a trip
to Rome before.

59
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,030
Ohh.

60
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,239
Uh, how are
the cheese coming?

61
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,201
I think maybe about --
about five more plates.

62
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,287
And maybe some of the mushroom,
the big sellers.

63
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,956
There should be some more out
in just a sec.

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,083
Joe!

65
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,919
Joe, come here.

66
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,171
I want you to meet
the Meyersons.

67
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,297
our old neighbors.

68
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,216
Barbara, Don,
this is Joe Nast.

69
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,968
He's been here -- what? --
about three weeks now.

70
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,053
-- Oh.
-- Oh.

71
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,471
lsn't that great?
Welcome.

72
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,098
Joe's Diana's fiancé.

73
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,059
Excuse me just a second.

74
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,229
There should be some more out
in just a second.

75
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,355
We're so sorry.

76
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,940
Thank you.

77
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,274
Beautiful girl.

78
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm sure the two of you looked
just gorgeous together.

79
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,407
So, how are you enjoying
our town?

80
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,409
I beg your pardon?

81
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,286
So, now what?
The arraignment, huh?

82
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,163
String the asshole up
by his toes

83
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,915
and wait for a trial date,
huh?

84
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,917
T-The other one's a vegetable,
right?

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,126
The wife.

86
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,711
Would --
Would you e-excuse me?

87
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,636
Even doggy
looks sad today.

88
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,806
Oh, my God.

89
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,725
You must be exhausted.

90
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,977
all of you.

91
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,729
Propping each other up,
running on adrenaline.

92
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,898
Probably haven't slept
in days.

93
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,317
I'm Stan Michaels,

94
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,570
friend of Ben and JoJo's
from school.

95
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,238
I'm a shrink.

96
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,824
Do you know what your plans are
until the trial?

97
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,158
Plans?

98
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,662
Selfishly, I'm just asking
for my friends --

99
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,582
only child gone,
work at a standstill.

100
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:41,628
You know, JoJo hasn't touched
her typewriter since.

101
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,631
It's only been three days.

102
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,632
Of course.

103
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,092
What I'm trying to say is,

104
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,178
I know this town
isn't home to you,

105
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,264
but I hope, for their sake,
you'll consider staying on.

106
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,642
You're all of Diana
they're gonna have left.

107
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,943
Joe, come talk to me.

108
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,696
Have you noticed there's usually
too much cheese at these things?

109
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,240
So, like, his mother
had canc--

110
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,100
Thanks again.

111
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,019
Really,
you were just fabulous.

112
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,313
<i>Buonasera.</i>

113
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,774
Jo, are you cold?

114
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,692
Oh, not now.

115
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,861
Jo, what are you --
Honey, those are gifts.

116
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,446
Not gifts -- party favors.

117
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,115
Gifts from our friends.
They're supposed to be helpful.

118
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,909
"Grieving for Grownups"?

119
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,868
Yes.

120
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,036
Please.

121
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,287
I'll show you helpful.

122
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,413
D--

123
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,962
Oh, good.
We're <i>all</i> here now.

124
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's dish, shall we?

125
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:07,881
Oh.

126
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,008
Joe, you go first.

127
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,552
The Meyersons.

128
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,594
Oh, my God.

129
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,763
Didn't you just want
to smack 'em?

130
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,516
Why can't people think
before they spew?

131
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,893
And that matching, uh --
matching couple. The, uh --

132
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,103
The Hillers.

133
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,146
Oh, my God, those big dripping
looks of sympathy.

134
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,107
"She was such an angel."
How would they know?

135
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,234
They met her once
for two seconds,

136
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,611
and she was being
a total brat that day.

137
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,030
Oh, come on.
Funerals are awkward at best.

138
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,740
"Awkward at best"?

139
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,117
Put yourself
in their shoes.

140
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,535
What are they
supposed to say?

141
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,996
Nothing, thank you very much.
Not if it's cant and trite.

142
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,497
Did you hear
that cliché parade?

143
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,207
And they were all over
this poor guy.

144
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, it's a
first chance meeting.

145
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,377
What -- put yourself
in their sh--

146
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,713
Believe me, all our friends
are not such horror shows.

147
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,131
Just put yourself
in their --

148
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,133
I don't want to put myself
in their shoes, all right, Ben?!

149
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,259
Why the hell should I?

150
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,469
We are the ones that lost
the girl, for God's sake!

151
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,763
Let them put themselves
in <i>our</i> goddamn shoes!

152
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,145
Stop defending everyone.

153
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,813
Ah, look.

154
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,441
Here's the only honest one
that was here today,

155
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,318
even if he did vote
Republican.

156
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,486
Did you see the projection
that he got

157
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,031
when he booted all over
that windbag Madeline?

158
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,741
Full velocity.

159
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,659
That was impressive,
wasn't it?

160
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,621
Good, good, good boy,
but I'm sensing.

161
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,082
.an encore here.

162
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,043
Ben, take him out before
he spreads the joy again.

163
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,169
I -- I could --

164
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,755
No, no. Go ahead.
Will you please stop?

165
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,798
Look, stop cleaning up,
okay?

166
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,343
Look, if we ever had
an excuse for once

167
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,137
to have our place
look like shit, it's now.

168
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,598
So just relish
the opportunity, okay?

169
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,183
-- Okay.
-- Come on, Nixon.

170
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,519
And lower your shoulders,
Benjamin.

171
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,811
Thank you.

172
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,734
Come back to me.

173
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,654
Come on, Nixon.

174
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,700
I really miss cigarettes
right now.

175
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,994
That wonderful fog.

176
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,163
You never smoked,
did you, Joe?

177
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,249
No.

178
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,252
Diana said you had
sweet breath --

179
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,088
the very first thing
she told me.

180
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,924
At least the girl had her
priorities straight.

181
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,097
Joe, what do you think
you're gonna do.

182
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,603
without our girl?

183
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:31,483
JoJo, I have no idea.

184
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,152
Promise you'll let me know
when you do.

185
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,239
Of course,

186
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,825
I'd like you to remain celibate
for the rest of your life,

187
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,410
but.

188
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,496
It's negotiable.

189
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,958
Now, the only way to guarantee
this asshole's

190
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,253
not gonna skate off on
a second-degree charge

191
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,839
is to have someone
back up intent,

192
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,967
and clearly his target,
the waitress --

193
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,136
common-law wife, concubine,
whatever --

194
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,221
you can bet
she'd have a thing or two

195
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,639
to say about premeditation

196
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,850
if she ever actually
pulls through this.

197
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,020
Two shots to the head, you can't
count on it at this point.

198
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,273
What we do have now
is a witness appears

199
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:14,568
who's tucked in a corner booth
out of the guy's eyeline.

200
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,111
Guy never saw him.

201
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,238
Now, I'll be talking to him.

202
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,615
But what he's laying out

203
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,159
lines up right with
the detective's scenario.

204
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,869
Which is?

205
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,621
Which is the wife
was the only server

206
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,706
on the floor at the time,
stations were empty.

207
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,708
She was refilling Diana's cup
at the counter

208
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,835
when the husband approached
and shot them both.

209
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,921
Diana was killed.

210
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,090
The wife took two shots
to the head.

211
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,385
The guy was caught on
the premises with the gun.

212
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,805
And in seven years,
he could walk.

213
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,310
And that's the difference
between second-degree

214
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,688
and life without parole.

215
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,484
Now, there's something else we
need to discuss at this point.

216
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,904
This may be a capital case,
a death-penalty case.

217
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,241
I need to know your feelings.

218
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,283
Jesus.

219
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,118
JoJo?

220
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,829
Oh, Christ.
I don't kn-- I don't know.

221
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,456
I -- Christ.

222
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,459
Ben?

223
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,044
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

224
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,629
I just want it over.

225
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,840
No, no.
I want him eviscerated.

226
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,634
I want him strung up
and ripped apart.

227
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,845
-- Christ, Ben.
-- What, Josephine?

228
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,013
She asked.
She asked, so I'm telling her.

229
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,224
-- We never agreed to that.
-- We never had to.

230
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,393
ls it -- Do we really need
to decide this now?

231
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,061
Right?

232
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,524
Excuse me.

233
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,902
It's ultimately the decision
of the D.A.'s office,

234
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:42,197
however, your feelings
influence that decision.

235
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:46,285
I just want you to be aware that
if we decide to go for death,

236
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,203
it may not be so easy to do.

237
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,872
What is the death penalty
here?

238
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:50,706
Gas.

239
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,040
Shit.

240
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,543
Uh, is it --
is it better for us if he --

241
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,087
if he, uh -- if he shot
our daughter first?

242
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,422
Christ, Ben.

243
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,008
I'm afraid that --
that may be hard to prove.

244
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,012
I mean, what kind of a guy
is that who would do that?

245
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,973
He -- He --
He had to kill somebody.

246
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,433
ls he that crazy?

247
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,144
W-Why didn't he just shoot
his wife first?

248
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,563
Why did he have to kill
our daughter?

249
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:18,817
Because she was there.

250
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,741
We have your numbers.

251
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,367
Feel free to call.

252
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,411
Call me at any time.

253
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,440
What is it?

254
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:01,276
It's like we're all waiting
for something to happen.

255
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,116
Good night.

256
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,371
Good night, Joe.

257
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,791
Don't you worry about us.
We're okay.

258
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,626
Okay.

259
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,109
Joe?

260
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,903
Say it, Joe.

261
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,782
-- Joe. Joe.
-- What?

262
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,201
I-I need some help.
I think we forgot something.

263
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,369
W-What is it?

264
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,662
The invitations.

265
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,330
We forgot the wedding
invitations.

266
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,874
I didn't call the shop.
They had the master guest list.

267
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,418
The plan was they were gonna
just send them out directly.

268
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,670
Well, d-don't you think --

269
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,214
Never assume.
It's the first rule of business.

270
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,259
You saw the sales girl.
She looked stoned.

271
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,805
I just -- I-I-I-I-I don't want
everyone getting them now.

272
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,683
Not now.
lt'd just be too uncomfortable.

273
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,725
Sure.

274
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,478
I gotta be somewhere
at 9:00,

275
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,898
and then the, uh --
the D.A. at 11:00.

276
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,279
The D.A.

277
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,114
-- Ben.
-- Hmm?

278
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,407
I got it.

279
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,075
You think --
Could you get over there?

280
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,244
-- No problem.
-- Thanks, Joe.

281
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,329
It's just -- it's just it --
it -- it --

282
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,123
it would just be
too uncomfortable.

283
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,336
You know, there's a drawer
at the bottom of the bureau.

284
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,339
lf you want, I could maybe
make some space for you.

285
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,508
Oh, no, no, no.
Ben, Ben, it's fine.

286
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,941
Mornin'!

287
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,862
# <i>Meet me in the morning</i> #

288
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,907
# <i>56th and Wabasha</i> #

289
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,790
# <i>Meet me in the morning</i> #

290
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,003
# <i>56th and Wabasha</i> #

291
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,847
Whoa!

292
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,433
Ray!

293
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,684
Ray, off!

294
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,645
Come on, Ray-Ray!

295
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,021
Nice kitty! Nice kitty!

296
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,689
Nice kitty!
Okay, nice kitty!

297
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,024
Sorry about that.

298
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,609
Ray likes boys.

299
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,110
a lot.

300
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,570
He gonna live?

301
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,155
He's never moved that fast
in his entire life.

302
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,407
Ray doesn't get
much company.

303
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,160
So, what can I do you for?

304
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,828
Go ahead, Ray.

305
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,455
Yeah, I, uh --

306
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,623
I, uh --

307
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,625
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

308
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,835
Um.

309
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,045
This is kind of strange,

310
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,382
but, um, I think you have
some mail here.

311
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,716
You think?

312
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,553
I mean that I'm --
that I'm looking for.

313
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,930
Anything special you had
in mind?

314
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,767
Wedding invitations.

315
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,185
You want 'em back?

316
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,354
I do.

317
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,815
What, did you forget to lick
the stamps?

318
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,570
All right.

319
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,827
Well, you coming or not?

320
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,037
Come on.

321
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:06,748
Stay.

322
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,802
You all alone here?

323
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,055
Why, what'd you have
in mind?

324
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,473
Oh, no, I --

325
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,226
District manager's been talking
since Christmas

326
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,603
he's got subs coming in.

327
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,812
I think he forgot.

328
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,106
So it's just me
and the Bettys for now.

329
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,357
They're out on route.

330
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,442
We take turns --

331
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,111
butt behind the counter,
butt behind the wheel.

332
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,197
Except everyone seems
much happier

333
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,407
when I'm not behind
the wheel, so.

334
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,868
You're not from around here.

335
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,786
Boy shortage.

336
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,705
You notice.

337
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,750
So what,
you 4-F, flunk your medical?

338
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,251
Draft dodger? What?

339
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,128
I've never been called up.

340
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,338
Really?

341
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,340
You got kind of a slouch
going there.

342
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,052
Oh, it's, uh --
it's the shoes.

343
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,263
So now what -- now that you've
blown off the wedding?

344
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,767
I'm just trying to collect
my invitations.

345
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,644
Sure.
Whatever you want.

346
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,437
But you better take 'em off.

347
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,981
I hate it when you leave
scuff marks.

348
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,320
So, did you ever see
that "Lucy" episode

349
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,322
where she's in this big vat
stomping grapes, making wine?

350
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,492
I feel like that every time
I climb in.

351
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,410
I pretend I'm in ltaly.

352
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,167
Feeling ltalian?

353
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,462
Uh, not just yet.

354
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:36,672
Give it a sec.

355
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,466
Okay, any particular color
we're looking for?

356
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,468
Uh, pink, I think.

357
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,679
Really? Your choice?

358
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,597
Scented?

359
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,016
Hey, we get 'em all in here.

360
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,273
Hello.

361
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,275
Look familiar?

362
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,659
How many?

363
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,661
75.

364
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:11,498
All right.
38 to you, rest to me.

365
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,000
You ready?

366
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,045
It's okay.

367
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,890
Oh, thank God!

368
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,725
Joe, thanks for doing this.

369
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,019
I couldn't stand
the painter up.

370
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,478
I booked him
three weeks ago.

371
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,981
Would have screwed up
his whole schedule.

372
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,275
What do you think?

373
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,276
Hmm?

374
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,028
lt -- It -- Wow.

375
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,321
Here we go.

376
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,031
Got it all worked out.

377
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,908
There's a few odds and ends
to take care of

378
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,409
before we get started.

379
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,536
I went ahead and I booked
a photo for us.

380
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,039
Deposit from the wedding
took care of the whole --

381
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,373
It's all set.

382
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,541
ready to go.

383
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,418
I just got to thinking
last night

384
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,670
maybe we're missing
an opportunity here.

385
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,506
I mean,
there's work to be done.

386
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,425
Maybe the best thing for us
at this point is just to --

387
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,761
That's my partner's --
ex-partner's desk --

388
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,096
You know,
just dive right in.

389
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,265
We had a plan.
Why not stick with it?

390
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,892
What else are we gonna do?

391
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,269
Sit around?
We'll go crazy.

392
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:18,565
Stan Michaels, the shrink --
did you meet?

393
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,276
See, he sees no problem
with it.

394
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,488
Activity --
very therapeutic.

395
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,824
So, you know, what else
are you gonna do --

396
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,493
curl up and die?

397
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:36,542
I just.wouldn't want her
to see us like -- like that.

398
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,960
Not like that.

399
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,387
Don't do it.

400
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,559
Don't do it, Ben.

401
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,894
You don't have to answer
the phone.

402
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,896
We don't need another
wet blanket dropping by.

403
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:01,817
Ohh.

404
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,361
-- Ah, the man is hopeless!
-- Hello?

405
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,947
You know, last week, he actually
apologized to somebody

406
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,949
for not picking up
until the ninth ring.

407
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,034
I just want to put
a big banner over this house

408
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,202
that says "beg off."

409
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,204
Or maybe a T-shirt?
What do you think?

410
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,664
Great.

411
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,165
We're gonna be fine.

412
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,210
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

413
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,047
Sam Swanson checking up.

414
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,048
Checking up.

415
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,300
What are you
complaining about?

416
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,843
You were livid all day

417
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,804
because the Carlsons didn't
even ask about Diana.

418
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,097
That's right.

419
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,432
Well, which is it, Jo?

420
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,809
It's both, Benjamin -- it pisses
me off when they ask about her,

421
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,311
and it pisses me off
when they don't,

422
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,979
and that is just
the way it is -- so there.

423
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,320
Don't shake your head.

424
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,197
You'd feel
the same way about it.

425
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,741
Starting tomorrow, we're all
gonna get a handle on it.

426
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,326
I made some appointments
for us.

427
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,411
I beg your pardon?

428
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,414
A stop at the bank
to close out Diana's paperwork,

429
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,501
Garfield's for the, uh,
bridesmaids' returns.

430
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,128
We're gonna get back on our
feet and come out swinging.

431
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,338
Did you have this typed up?

432
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,048
ls there an itinerary
we can follow?

433
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,549
Joe and I are gonna get
a jump on it

434
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,343
with a trip over
to Danvers in the morning.

435
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,302
-- Why?
-- Spring regional.

436
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,137
-- You're not serious.
-- Absolutely.

437
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,639
Oh, don't subject him
to that.

438
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,057
This is what?

439
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,725
Mulcahey's project is still
out there, Josephine.

440
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:17,684
lf I don't move now,

441
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,562
those Next Century
turncoat bastards will.

442
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,440
I was <i>this</i> close
to landing him before.

443
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:24,650
Lower your shoulders.

444
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,817
Oh.

445
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,444
Time to see the boys.

446
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,072
Don't.

447
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,700
We're not home!

448
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,791
Yes?

449
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,334
Joe?

450
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,169
Someone here to see you.

451
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,637
7 5.

452
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,806
You forgot one.

453
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,475
The address was on the back.
I-I thought you'd want it.

454
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,354
Hi.

455
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,647
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

456
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,857
Bertie Knox.

457
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,900
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

458
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,569
Um, Bertie, uh.

459
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,696
I sling stamps
down at the P.O.

460
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,740
We've never actually met.
I'm your route manager.

461
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,911
I helped Joe here do some bin
diving, dig up your invites.

462
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,247
Really excellent
paper selection.

463
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,249
I.

464
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,128
I'm sorry we couldn't complete
the postal cycle for you.

465
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,588
I.

466
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,342
Well,
you want this or what?

467
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,094
Oh. Thanks.

468
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,513
Yeah.
lt was nice meeting you.

469
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,807
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're not on foot, are you?

470
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:51,987
I'm dripping, Joe.

471
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,281
Oh, it's no.problem.

472
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,491
No problem for you.
It's not your car.

473
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,701
Exactly.

474
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,997
Nice people.

475
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,791
So, what, you live there?

476
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,918
No.

477
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,252
Uh, sort of.

478
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:10,297
-- You don't?
-- Y-Yeah, for now. Yeah.

479
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,548
Just the three of you?

480
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,841
Yeah.

481
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,344
lsn't that kind of weird?

482
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,138
Yeah. It is.

483
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,349
How long are you staying?

484
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,726
I don't know.

485
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,269
Do you call them Mom and Dad?

486
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,187
No.

487
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,731
-- Do they call you son?
-- Not yet.

488
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,149
What do you talk about?

489
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,485
Mostly?

490
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,612
Diana.

491
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,739
God, doesn't that
make you sad?

492
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,958
So, commercial real estate.

493
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,251
Commercial real estate.

494
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,628
What the hell
does that mean?

495
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,879
I have no idea.

496
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,048
And this
is what you want to do?

497
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,925
-- Not really.
-- Oh.

498
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,510
And what <i>do</i> you want
to do?

499
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,430
I want to figure out
what I want to do.

500
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,267
So you're kind of in escrow
at the moment.

501
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,768
Real-estate term.

502
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,311
Yeah,
I recognize that one.

503
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:07,729
Yeah.

504
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,648
Hey, you know what, Joe?

505
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,109
-- What?
-- You just passed my stop.

506
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,048
This?

507
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,466
You coming in?

508
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,343
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't.

509
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm buying.

510
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:40,888
No, really.

511
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:45,350
I've gotta get back.

512
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:48,562
Well.

513
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,606
Good luck in escrow,
Joe.

514
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,400
Good luck to you, too.

515
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,568
Bert.

516
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,751
# <i>lf I told you a secret,</i>
<i>you won't tell a soul</i> #

517
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:15,547
# <i>Will you hold it</i>
<i>and keep it alive?</i> #

518
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,549
# <i>Cause it's burning a hole</i> #

519
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,927
# <i>And I can't get to sleep</i> #

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,931

521
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,891

522
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,810
Damn it! Ohh!

# <i>Don't look da</i>-<i>da</i>-<i>da down</i> #

524
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,866
Listen, why don't you just keep
the deposit from the wedding,

525
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,785
and we'll let that
take care of it, okay?

526
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,662
That's fine, that's fine.

527
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,207
Okay, then.

528
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,542
A little tighter.

529
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,086
Okay, here, Joe,
you get up here next to me.

530
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,672
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He's not gonna sit?

531
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,966
Uh.partners stand.

532
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,593
I'm -- I'm --
I'm not so sure I can.

533
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,638
Just point yourself
right up here.

534
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,184
Wait, wait.

535
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,144
Huh? Perfect.

536
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,524
# <i>Oww!</i> #

537
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,202
ALL: Hey!

538
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,037
Aaah!

539
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,833
# <i>Friends say it's fine,</i>
<i>friends say it's good</i> #

540
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:36,753
# <i>Everybody says</i>
<i>it's just like Robin Hood</i> #

541
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,339
I think we should have
those nametags.

542
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:41,049
And that way, we could --

543
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,217
Hey. Tanner.

544
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,927
It's good to see you,
Ben.

545
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,722
I got to say, I'm glad to see
you're doing so well.

546
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,432
Oh, ready to get to it,
Tan.

547
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,100
What do you hear
about Mulcahey?

548
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,268
Uh, anything last week?

549
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,728
-- Oh, he's serious.
-- Oh?

550
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,396
Word is,
his appetite's growing.

551
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,480
Mm-hmm.

552
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,025
This thing sounds big,
whatever it is,

553
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:02,112
and from what the guys tell me,
he's liking your area --

554
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,531
demographics
or some such bullshit.

555
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,116
He was asking about you.

556
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,077
Me?
Not the turncoats?

557
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,662
You.

558
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,293
What do you think --
Greek?

559
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,379
ltalian -- Northern.

560
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:24,301
That kind of thing just
scares the hell out of me.

561
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,678
I've got a daughter myself,
her age.

562
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,889
I can't even imagine if.

563
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,266
Young man, all I can say is,

564
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:34,228
I'm just --
I'm just very, very sorry.

565
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,272
Well, Joe helped me
come to a decision.

566
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,941
lf work can give us
just one more reason

567
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,025
to get up in the morning,

568
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,027
then damned if we aren't
gonna jump in full-steam.

569
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,781
What's your, uh, what's your
interest in all this, Joe?

570
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,325
I beg your pardon?

571
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,035
This business.

572
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,621
Well, um, actually, um,

573
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,706
Ben actually
came up with the idea

574
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,959
that I would, uh,
collaborate with him

575
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,127
after we, uh --
after Diana decided

576
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,338
that we should.
come back and live.

577
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,215
lt was her idea --
<i>their</i> idea.

578
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,133
lt was <i>your</i> idea.

579
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,469
lt was <i>my</i> idea.

580
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:10,347
You study the market
in school?

581
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,267
Uh.no, ultimately.

582
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,476
Hmm.

583
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:18,313
You just feel like, uh,
this is your future, right?

584
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,900
I think so.
I hope so.

585
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,402
Um, uh.actually, sir,

586
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,029
I haven't really had
the chance to think through

587
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,991
the ramifications of a life
in commercial real estate.

588
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,159
Well, no,
I.can understand that.

589
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,413
My God, you've had your mind
on a lot of things lately.

590
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,124
Which is why
Joe and I are both anxious

591
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,251
to jump in
and roll up our sleeves.

592
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:42,671
It's time to -- to channel
all this scattered energy

593
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,716
toward something
more.positive, Mike,

594
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:49,845
like this project of yours
we keep hearing about.

595
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,680
Joe, what kind of man
do you take me for?

596
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:54,892
Prisoner of history?

597
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,518
Not on appearance.

598
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,396
Mired in -- in convention
or.

599
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,025
Uh I'm guessing "no".

600
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,068
Joe, we are brothers.

601
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,487
I'm younger than you are.

602
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,866
I'm a man of your time.

603
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:15,370
What do we brothers.
lack?

604
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,374
S-- uh, so many things.

605
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:23,170
One thing -- one --
time.

606
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,922
Hmm.

607
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,674
See, when I purchase
something at a wineshop

608
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,676
and then I get back
in my car,

609
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,304
drive one city block
to the hardware store,

610
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,849
only to find that I'm right back
behind that steering wheel,

611
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,059
scratching my ass,

612
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,812
I'm being robbed --
denied convenience.

613
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,482
My town
is now my prison.

614
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,525
The solution?

615
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,362
Be a man of the times,
not a thief of it.

616
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,571
Service my needs

617
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,366
and be gracious enough
to house them under one roof.

618
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:53,492
One roof.

619
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:57,913
One roof, one vendor,
one point of purchase --

620
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,123
an entire town's needs.

621
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,209
You're talking
all of Main Street retail.

622
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,877
Reborn.

623
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,588
See, Mom and Pop went to sleep
with the gas on.

624
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,257
They're over.
That's done.

625
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,552
To save a town like yours,
there's got to be a revolution.

626
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,304
I think
Joe understands this --

627
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,349
he <i>and</i> his brothers
on the streets.

628
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,518
Now, <i>I,</i> on the other hand,
am sitting here

629
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,229
because I can't tell those
Next Century bastards apart.

630
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,856
I don't get it.

631
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,482
We don't either.

632
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,860
But don't let me down.

633
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,946
There's a piece of it in there
for you if you're up to it.

634
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,031
The only question is,
can you deliver?

635
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,077
Now, guarantee --
they won't all fall that easy.

636
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,997
We have to do our homework --
tax rolls, comps --

637
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,833
get a pretty quick picture
of who's vulnerable.

638
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,168
Huh?

639
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,128
Plan of attack.

640
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:50,424
I never had one of these.

641
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,675
Me either.

642
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,138
-- Nice, huh?
-- Mmm.

643
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,348
Oh, God, whatever you do,
don't tell JoJo.

644
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,726
I've been on her
for years about her smoking.

645
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,687
I'd never hear the end of it.

646
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,773
This is how I had it --
in my head.

647
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,150
ln your head?

648
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:09,776
Pictures, you know --

649
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,486
son-in-law, first cigar,

650
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,822
a couple of beers
once in a while.

651
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:17,367
Sometimes, y-you just need
a little break, you know --

652
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:20,370
a new face, someone
to bounce it around with.

653
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,622
Hmm?

654
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,791
Jo and I, we don't really
socialize too much anymore.

655
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,544
It's just us,
just on each other, you know --

656
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,421
same face in your face.

657
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:33,008
Forget what the other pillow
even looks like empty.

658
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,384
And let's face it --

659
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,179
Jo, well, she's really
the more verbal one,

660
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,515
likes to.
fill the air up a bit.

661
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,558
And I like
to give her that.

662
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,851
Sure. Yeah.

663
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,144
And then
you guys come along.

664
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:49,274
I figure I finally got a shot
at someone to talk to.

665
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,201
She ever, uh.

666
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,370
she ever talk about me, Joe?

667
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,539
Diana?

668
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,749
Yeah, sure.

669
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,709
Nothing really
in particular, but.

670
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,378
I know
something wasn't right.

671
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,548
She asked me to meet her.

672
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:17,302
I was supposed to be there
at the counter.

673
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:18,637
You were --

674
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,305
She said she had to talk.

675
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,349
We really needed to talk.

676
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:23,892
I don't know, I.

677
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,686
I haven't.

678
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,188
Please don't tell JoJo this.
lt'll kill her.

679
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,568
See, I -- I was across the
street there in the office,

680
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,319
and then.
some phone call --

681
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,363
Did she say anything?

682
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,664
I just know
something wasn't right.

683
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,212
I know there was
something wrong with us.

684
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,714
Had been for a while,

685
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,384
ever since
she was a.teenager.

686
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:02,514
Please
don't tell JoJo this.

687
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,349
Please.

688
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,109
I'm glad you're here, Joe.

689
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,534
Jo?

690
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,952
Honey?

691
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:28,790
Jo?

692
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,848
Telephone, Benjamin.

693
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,440
I need help, Joe.

694
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,484
I'm blocked.
I can't write a thing. Sit.

695
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,778
Hello?

696
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,034
Now, I've been hearing so much
shit lately, so much fluff,

697
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:07,204
I've started to lose sight
of her already, and.

698
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,665
a phrase like
"filled with goodness"

699
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,875
actually passed
through my mind today.

700
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:15,045
So I need to purge,
Joe.

701
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,422
Yes, Benjamin?

702
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,383
That was Cheryl.
She's on her way over.

703
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,884
What?!
Don't look at me.

704
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,262
You're the one who promised
her some of Diana's things.

705
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,805
A mere moment of weakness.

706
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,099
I can't believe she's
coming over to collect.

707
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,767
And she's bringing friends.

708
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:29,768
Unbelievable.

709
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,520
Has she tried
to jump you yet?

710
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,355
-- Josephine!
-- What?

711
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,399
You yourself said that
you never trusted the girl.

712
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,359
The only reason that
we tolerate the little tart

713
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,111
is because somehow
Diana took pity on her.

714
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,530
Girl could do a lot of things.
She couldn't pick her friends.

715
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,532
Oh, come on.
CheryI's not that bad.

716
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,784
Okay, yeah,
she's a bit overdramatic,

717
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,412
a-a bit
socially overwhelming.

718
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,998
But you can't blame her
under the circumstances.

719
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:51,915
Oh, yes, you can.

720
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,501
Yes, you can.
She <i>is</i> a bitch, isn't she?

721
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,878
Yes!

722
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,630
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benjamin Floss.

723
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,641
The vultures have landed.

724
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,560
Oh, God.

725
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,688
Just makes you want to cry,
looking at all of these.

726
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,692
Every one just.
reminds me of.

727
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,278
God, I wouldn't know
which to take.

728
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,654
You'll manage.

729
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,115
Her jacket, I guess.

730
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,409
God, she wore this all the time.

731
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,328
We were together
when she bought it.

732
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,872
No, no, I was there.
You're thinking of the canvas.

733
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:34,416
lt was definitely the leather.
I remember exactly, Audrey.

734
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,796
Ohh! No. Not the watches.
Leave the watches.

735
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,299
Do I know you?

736
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,385
I'm Caroline.

737
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,012
Caroline who?

738
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,514
Davis.

739
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,182
You knew Diana?

740
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,560
We were on Bluejays
together.

741
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,606
Look, Cheryl,
this is very nice of you.

742
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,858
I just -- I don't want
to leave those guys --

743
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,736
Look, if you're not comfortable,
we'll go. We'll leave.

744
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,948
I just think you need
a chance to get out of there.

745
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,368
That whole house is, like,
under this black pale.

746
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,287
Can we just
keep this short?

747
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,331
# <i>Fire</i> #

748
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,416
# <i>Uh</i>-<i>uh</i> #

749
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,584
# <i>Fire</i> #

750
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,378
Hey, guys.

751
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,420
Cheryl.

752
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,630
Hey.

753
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,134
Guys.this is Joe.

754
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,678
-- Hey.
-- Hey.

755
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,848
Joe's been keeping me together
through this whole thing.

756
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,349
You guys
are so amazing.

757
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,809
Oh, yeah.

758
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,562
I don't know what I would have
done without him.

759
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,063
Would you excuse me?

760
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,274
# <i>The way you squeeze...</i> #

761
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,111
# <i>Knocks me to my knees</i> #

762
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:49,032
# <i>'Cause I'm smokin',</i>

763
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,285
# <i>Oh hoo hoo hoo</i> #

764
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,329
Aww!

765
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,237
Jesus! A girl can't even pee
without you guys --

766
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,798
# <i>When the wind blows</i> #

767
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,843
# <i>And the rain feels cold</i> #

768
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:53,347
# <i>With a head full of snow</i> #

769
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,476
# <i>With a head full of snow</i> #

770
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,438
# <i>ln the window</i> #

771
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,733
# <i>There's a face you know</i> #

772
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:08,028
# <i>Don't the night pass slow?</i> #

773
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,196
What did I do?

774
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,198
# <i>Don't the night pass slow?</i> #

775
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,659
You played my song.

776
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:20,916
# <i>The sound of strangers</i>
<i>sending nothing to my mind</i> #

777
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:28,590
# <i>Just another mad, mad day</i>
<i>on the road</i> #

778
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:34,888
# <i>I am just living</i>
<i>to be lying by your side</i> #

779
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:39,977
# <i>But I'm just about</i>
<i>a moonlight mile</i> #

780
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,355
# <i>On down the road</i> # #

781
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,524
# <i>I've got 99 years</i>
<i>of laying in the dark</i> #

782
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,193
# <i>And I'm far too young</i>
<i>to lie</i> #

783
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,404
# <i>I've got 99 ways</i>
<i>to play my guitar</i> #

784
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,156
# <i>It's gonna pay me</i>
<i>before I die</i> #

785
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,951
Ohh! Ohh! I'm sorry.

786
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,745
-- No. It's okay.
-- I should have knocked.

787
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:01,790
On the closet?

788
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,003
-- Oh, shit.
-- It's okay.

789
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,589
You're safe.
They won't find you in here.

790
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,675
What was that?

791
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,635
Old habits.

792
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,305
I'm a source of entertainment,
in case you hadn't noticed.

793
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:17,931
You, uh.

794
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:18,974
Work here.

795
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,017
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

796
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:21,185
Not in the closet.

797
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,352
-- No.
-- No.

798
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,520
Help out.

799
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:24,730
Your place?

800
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,523
Uh.a friend's.

801
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,275
You work here every night?

802
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,863
Must be a good friend.

803
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:36,158
So, did you come back
for that drink?

804
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,452
No, the dancing,
actually.

805
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,163
Hey, hey.
Well, you had your shot.

806
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,506
Well, closets tend to work
better for one, so I'll --

807
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:53,300
No. Wait.

808
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,302
Please, I-I just --
I can't --

809
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,679
I don't think
I can go back out there.

810
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,681
It's okay.
You don't have to.

811
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,768
I just -- I --
I-I can't.

812
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,436
I know.

813
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,188
That's all right.

814
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,899
Everything you're feeling,
I'm feeling, too.

815
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,489
lf I told you
something, um --

816
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,242
Bertie, we're dying out here.

817
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,827
Shit. I gotta go.

818
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,704
Snot check?

819
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,095
You can come back tomorrow
if you want.

820
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,375
Listen, Cheryl, I --

821
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:11,962
Can you believe it?

822
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,547
Now she says
the witness was drunk.

823
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,756
Uh, who said?

824
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,300
The D.A.
I just talked to her.

825
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,051
She says he's no good.
Bullshit.

826
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,761
It's bullshit
is what it is.

827
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,471
Half the people
in that joint

828
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,599
are pissed out of their hats
by noon.

829
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:25,726
Why should this guy
be any different?

830
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,686
Family restaurant --
unbelievable.

831
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:29,813
Okay, we've wasted
enough time there.

832
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:32,774
They can screw the trial up,
but they can't touch this.

833
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,610
This one's ours.

834
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:36,778
Now, if we buy out
this whole block for Mulcahey,

835
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,113
we got to find a weak spot.

836
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,407
We find the guy who's hurting
but fighting to hang on.

837
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,117
You can bet your mother
he's the one that's gonna be

838
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,995
tying up the rest
of the merchants emotionally,

839
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:47,789
killing any straight shot you
got at landing the whole block.

840
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:50,250
You got to break the spine.
You find him, you break it.

841
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,668
Sit for a second.

842
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,130
Ben, are you okay?

843
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:58,217
Now, I checked the tax rolls.
I know their debt history.

844
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,969
They got to be choking
on the mortgage by now.

845
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,763
Who?

846
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:03,847
The bar?

847
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,141
That's not a bar.
That's the ballgame.

848
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,227
We get him,
we got the whole block.

849
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,145
Ready?

850
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,314
Hey, Ben.
you know what?

851
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,316
Let me take this one.

852
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:15,817
What?

853
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:17,569
I'll handle it.
Let me handle it.

854
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,862
Yo--

855
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,447
Joe.

856
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:22,241
-- I'm serious.
-- You're gonna do this?

857
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,368
I'm gonna try.
Let me try.

858
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,663
Well, hell, what am I.
supposed to do?

859
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:28,914
Just go on back.

860
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,958
I'll.find you
back at the office.

861
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,793
You're serious?
You're sure about this?

862
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,586
Go on.

863
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,047
I'll meet you back there.

864
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,387
Good morning.

865
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,640
Good morning.

866
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:51,144
Boy, it's a.
lot quieter by day, huh?

867
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:55,566
Tends to work that way.

868
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,234
A nice space.

869
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,528
How long you had it?

870
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:00,863
Not mine.

871
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,406
Something to drink?

872
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,449
You're not.?

873
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,119
Something to drink?

874
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,288
Water's fine.

875
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,747
Bubbles?

876
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,499
Bubbles.

877
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,218
So, who's Cal?

878
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,554
Name on the door.

879
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,558
He's not around?

880
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,351
No, he is not.

881
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,729
ls he a friend of yours
or.

882
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,439
As a matter of fact.

883
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:36,857
He's in Vietnam?

884
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,318
Something
I can help you with?

885
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,986
Just curious.

886
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,905
Must have poured a lot
of himself into this place.

887
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,072
Pretty handy guy?

888
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:45,574
Mm-hmm.

889
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,367
It's a pretty
interesting selection

890
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,577
you got on the box here.

891
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,454
Nothing new, huh?

892
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,539
lf it ain't broke.

893
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:53,957
Nothing that old either.

894
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:57,002
Everything's what --
two, three years ago?

895
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,463
You didn't seem to mind
last night.

896
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,632
You got a dime?

897
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,889
Gimme a number.

898
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,225
F-8.

899
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,204
# <i>You went away and left me</i>
<i>a long time ago</i> #

900
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,832
# <i>Now you're knocking</i>
<i>on my door</i> #

901
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:39,503
# <i>I hear you knocking</i> #

902
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,005
# <i>But you can't come in</i> #

903
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,553
# <i>I hear you knocking</i> #

904
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:48,679
Afternoon.

905
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,223
Afternoon.

906
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:59,523
# <i>I begged you not to go,</i>
<i>but you said goodbye</i> #

907
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,260
Can I help you?

908
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,596
Hi, there.
Maybe you can.

909
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,099
I was wondering if you were here
when my daughter was killed.

910
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:36,018
I was trying to.

911
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,020
figure out what.

912
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:40,606
stool she was actually --

913
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:44,818
Let's see.

914
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:46,653
lf she was, uh --

915
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,199
Ben.

916
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,117
Hey, Joe.

917
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:54,786
Uh.was it here?

918
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,331
Was it this one?

919
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,458
Tell me.

920
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,668
I think it was number 6.

921
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,758
Ben, what are you doing?

922
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,053
And if he came from, uh --

923
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:17,476
Now, I know there was
a-a-a guy, a witness.

924
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,772
Must have been in the back.

925
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,106
Maybe you remember.

926
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,401
He was, uh, obviously being
served alcohol in some quantity

927
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:29,613
because, evidently, he can't
remember sitting down.

928
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:32,407
Pardon me.

929
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,159
Let's go.

930
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,291
I see your window
still needs repair.

931
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,752
That's unfortunate.

932
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:47,756
Maybe, uh.

933
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,759
tell the manager
to have it fixed.

934
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,643
<i>My wife used to have</i>

935
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:04,231
<i>a lot more enthusiasm about</i>
<i>blank than she does now.</i>

936
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,108
<i>Fill in the blank, please.</i>

937
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:10,988
Ben, wind.

938
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,035
Where are you right now?

939
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,207
You got someplace to be?

940
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,419
No. I'm -- I'm just --

941
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,212
It's only 8:00.

942
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,547
Just wiped out, I guess.

943
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,716
'Cause you don't have to
babysit us, you know.

944
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:31,800
You can go out.

945
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,136
-- Out?
-- Yeah.

946
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:39,391
Spazzy knees here.
he had a big day today.

947
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:42,436
I almost slipped,
and he broke my fall.

948
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:49,318
Yeah, I guess I'll.
head up.

949
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,323
-- Good night.
-- Good night.

950
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,703
<i>You used to have a lot</i>
<i>more enthusiasm about blank</i>

951
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,163
<i>than you do now.</i>

952
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,515
Yeah?

953
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:22,601
Joe?

954
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,978
Yeah?

955
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:27,356
Joe?

956
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,233
Di?

957
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:34,112
Joe, are you there?

958
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,783
Joe?

959
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:02,391
This okay?

960
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,726
The only place I could
think of this time of night.

961
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,228
You might want
to watch your --

962
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:09,565
Yeah.

963
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:10,649
So, what happened?

964
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:11,775
You sounded like --

965
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,610
I-I-I just --
I woke up, and I just --

966
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:15,445
I swear,
I couldn't breathe.

967
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:18,031
I couldn't stay in the room
another minute.

968
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:20,117
Did you pee?

969
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,286
-- What?
-- Pee.

970
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,955
I always pee in my pants when
that kind of thing happens.

971
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:26,540
Was it that kind of scared?

972
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:27,916
Mm, it was the worst.

973
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:31,170
I-I couldn't have peed
if I tried.

974
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,424
Sorry.

975
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,384
The Bettys.

976
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,845
Okay, so, now,
you called me.

977
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:43,265
Yeah, you know what?
I don't even know why.

978
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,184
Do you remember anything?

979
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,439
God, what do all these people
have to say to each other?

980
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:51,690
You want to read a few?

981
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,111
You don't open them,
you just --

982
00:53:56,195 --> 00:54:00,073
Oh, don't think we don't do
that shit. You know we do.

983
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:02,576
I never get any of my own,
anyway.

984
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,536
People can share.

985
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,540
So, your dream.

986
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,297
We weren't together
when she died.

987
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,673
Ohh.

988
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,550
That's so classic,
isn't it?

989
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:21,512
Were you, like,
floating apart, too?

990
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:24,389
No, we weren't together.

991
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:26,058
ln the dream.

992
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,602
No.

993
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:33,690
We.broke it off.

994
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:36,652
three days before.

995
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,615
Oh, God.
They don't know, do they?

996
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,371
Joe, you have to tell them.

997
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:48,830
I-I just got to --

998
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:51,291
Yeah, I just got to find
the right time.

999
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,293
Wow, it couldn't get a whole
lot later, could it?

1000
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,670
I know.

1001
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,088
I know.

1002
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:57,714
Then why aren't you
telling them?

1003
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:02,803
'Cause they'll hate me.

1004
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,055
And they'll say to me,
"when did you know?"

1005
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,808
And if I tell them the truth,
I'll say, "six months ago."

1006
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,184
And they'll say --

1007
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,520
Do you know how many times
I've seen them looking at me? --

1008
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,814
"lf you knew six months ago,
why didn't you tell her?

1009
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:16,692
Then she would be alive
today."

1010
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,529
lf I walked out
six months ago,

1011
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:23,365
she's not in that restaurant
waiting to tell them

1012
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,075
while I'm packing to --

1013
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,078
She's here with them now,
period.

1014
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:32,749
So <i>you</i> broke it off.

1015
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:33,834
Why?

1016
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,961
You want to know the truth?

1017
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:39,214
We were really great friends,

1018
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:41,175
and moving here
didn't change that.

1019
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:42,759
lt was supposed to?

1020
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:44,344
I hoped so.

1021
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,054
Then why are you going
into business?

1022
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:49,099
'Cause I don't know
what I want.

1023
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,436
And as long as I don't know
what I want,

1024
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,813
why not just give them this?

1025
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,073
Bertie.

1026
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,620
I lost my friend.

1027
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:31,058
Don't you miss yours?

1028
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:33,977
Who?

1029
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,440
Cal.

1030
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,736
Cal.

1031
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:47,032
He owns the bar.

1032
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:54,373
How long's he gone?

1033
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,208
Three years.

1034
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,126
He's missing.

1035
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,378
Yeah.

1036
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:00,963
So you're married?

1037
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,965
Do I look married to you?

1038
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:03,966
Engaged?

1039
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,467
See any hardware?

1040
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:06,802
Were you gonna be?

1041
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:08,595
No one bothered telling me.

1042
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,723
But you still work his store.
Why just friends?

1043
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,058
I lend a hand.

1044
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:15,936
But, well, how long
were you together?

1045
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,231
Weren't we talking
about you here?

1046
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,524
You mind?

1047
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:25,028
I don't know -- a while.

1048
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,323
A while.

1049
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:33,996
That song at the bar,
that was yours?

1050
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,500
He never actually heard it,
but.

1051
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,878
But he knew you pretty well.

1052
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:44,173
About 60%.

1053
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,886
Well, how'd you meet?

1054
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,014
He cracked my lip.

1055
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:55,767
The usual pickup game over
at Rogers Field.

1056
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:56,852
They picked, I sat out.

1057
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,854
Didn't know
what to make of me

1058
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:02,191
'cause not exactly a guy,
not exactly a girl.

1059
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:05,694
So one day I get fed up and go
plant myself behind the plate.

1060
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:07,196
First batter gets up,

1061
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,031
he's so distracted,
he swings wide,

1062
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,991
I stop the bat
with my face.

1063
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,410
I actually tattooed my chin
for a week.

1064
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:17,080
Anyway, he busted my lip up
pretty good.

1065
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,540
End of story.

1066
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:20,334
And that was Cal.

1067
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,460
That was.

1068
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,170
It's.romantic.

1069
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:25,714
You should've seen
the stitches.

1070
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,716
You can still see the scar.

1071
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,301
It's never gone away.

1072
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,302
Look.

1073
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,303
Feel.

1074
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,097
lsn't that weird?

1075
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:45,609
That's how I knew.

1076
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,781
You had four years?

1077
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,454
Five.

1078
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:07,130
He's been missing three?

1079
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,967
That's so long.

1080
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:17,474
How -- How can you --

1081
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:21,353
Because he loved me.

1082
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,363
Oh, shit, I gotta pee!

1083
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:04,188
You made this?

1084
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,440
Aw, sticks and glue.
It's a young man's game now.

1085
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,942
Arts and crafts
don't get you far,

1086
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,653
but with the right friends --

1087
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:13,447
Thank you, Don.

1088
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:15,324
You see what dinner at
the Floss home will buy you?

1089
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:17,659
Don Tippet down at the
Federal Commercial Loans --

1090
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,870
his wife hasn't stopped
calling the house for JoJo.

1091
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,289
Well, tonight, they dine
with Floss & Son.

1092
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,583
You got both parcels?

1093
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,168
Don holds the paper,

1094
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,294
and that leaves the bar.

1095
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,545
So, how you making out
over there?

1096
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:30,339
I mean, that's all
he's gonna care about.

1097
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,883
You know, Ben, this one's
gonna take some time.

1098
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:35,511
What? What do you mean time?
We got momentum now.

1099
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:37,304
What time?
What's the problem?

1100
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,306
It's complicated.

1101
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:42,059
Complicated.

1102
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:44,478
Well, maybe you're right.

1103
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,813
Be a hell of a P.R. storm
if Don forecloses on the guy

1104
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,732
while he's still overseas,
missing or not.

1105
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:51,485
And, let's face it, he's
a little more than missing.

1106
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:53,362
You know the bar, then?

1107
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,697
Uh, JoJo knew it.

1108
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,783
That stays between us.

1109
01:00:57,866 --> 01:00:58,825
We got a couple hours.

1110
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,827
Why don't we take a run
over there

1111
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:01,995
and, uh -- and rub noses?

1112
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,831
You know, Ben, I got a good
thing working, you know?

1113
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,376
A trust thing,
the one-on-one.

1114
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,795
I won't get in the way.
Just treat me like an assistant.

1115
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,505
Hey, I'm great in a crisis.

1116
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,382
You know, you always need
one of me around.

1117
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,300
Let me make the stop.

1118
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,886
You sure you don't want --

1119
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,513
-- Huh?
-- It's good.

1120
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:23,475
Hey.you're really loving
this, aren't you?

1121
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:26,395
I can tell.

1122
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,730
Will you be home in time
for the Tippets?

1123
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,482
I need my partner.

1124
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:32,401
This is a big one, Joe.

1125
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,402
Sure, Ben.

1126
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,903
Dinner's at 7:00.

1127
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:38,365
All right.

1128
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:52,796
# <i>Has anybody here</i>
<i>seen Razor Face?</i> #

1129
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:00,846
# <i>Heard he's back looking</i>
<i>for a place to lay down</i> #

1130
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:04,141
# <i>Must be getting on</i> #

1131
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:11,231
# <i>Needs a man who's young</i>
<i>to walk him around</i> #

1132
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:17,571
# <i>Needs a man who's young</i>
<i>to walk him around</i> #

1133
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,287
# <i>Oh, it must be hard for</i>
<i>the likes of you</i> #

1134
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:33,212
# <i>To get by in a world that you</i>
<i>just can't see through</i> #

1135
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:37,174
# <i>And it looks so cold</i> #

1136
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:42,137
# <i>How does it feel to know</i>
<i>you can't go home?</i> #

1137
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:48,018
Well, really,
it was lovely.

1138
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:49,436
Thank you very much.

1139
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,901
Oh. Oh, here he is.

1140
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,362
Uh, Don, Tammy,
this is Joe, our, uh --

1141
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,155
our, uh --
Diana's fiancé.

1142
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,157
Joe, uh,
Don and Tammy Tippet.

1143
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,409
Well, heard a lot
about you, Joe.

1144
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:05,577
Hi.

1145
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,454
Sorry we didn't have
more time.

1146
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:11,834
Now, you call us any time
you need to.

1147
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,337
Goddamn it,
you poor things.

1148
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:18,465
We're here, okay?

1149
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:20,509
All right, uh.

1150
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,056
You guys, uh, take care
of yourselves.

1151
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,308
Hang in.

1152
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:29,685
Bye.

1153
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,311
Bye. Good night.

1154
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:37,860
Sorry.

1155
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:39,194
Where the hell was he?

1156
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:40,320
I don't know, Ben.

1157
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:42,990
Why don't you ask him?
Where the hell were you?

1158
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,449
JoJo, I'm sorry. I-I --

1159
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:47,160
Sorry? Did you see that?
Try 98 minutes of it.

1160
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,621
Not that I'm counting,
you lucky bastard.

1161
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:52,457
Don't you ever leave me
stranded like that again.

1162
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:55,210
This is no joke.
He should've been here.

1163
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:57,421
Oh, Ben, stop acting like
he's under house arrest.

1164
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,882
I thought he was
part of the family.

1165
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,383
Obviously I'm mistaken.

1166
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:03,051
You're certainly treating him
like he is.

1167
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:04,803
What -- What -- What --
What is that supposed to mean?

1168
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:06,388
He's right here, Ben.
Talk to him.

1169
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,015
He knows how important
this was.

1170
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,224
All right, tell him.

1171
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:10,350
You tell him!

1172
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:13,061
Goddamn it, Ben!
You are doing it again!

1173
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:15,189
That thing! You always
talked <i>around</i> the girl.

1174
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,940
-- You never talked <i>to</i> her.
-- I what?

1175
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,984
You never said a straight thing
to her, Ben,

1176
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,819
from the time
she was 9 years old.

1177
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:21,987
You made me do it.

1178
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,197
That is so unfair.

1179
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:24,740
God forbid
she should grow up

1180
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,033
and then you
might have to, too.

1181
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,410
I mean, the perfect father,
as long as she was a kid.

1182
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:29,745
So unfair.

1183
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:32,414
Don't you see that
you're doing it again?!

1184
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,083
That is so unfair,
and you know it.

1185
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,002
Okay, pal, you really want
to get into it,

1186
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:39,087
then you stick around,
if not, go walk the dog

1187
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:40,297
because I'm mad at you now!

1188
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,590
Come on, Nix!

1189
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,592
And make it a long walk!

1190
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,974
Poor guy.

1191
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:54,311
With Diana gone, he's got
nobody else to catch the blast.

1192
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,688
lsn't he amazing?

1193
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:58,815
You gonna sit?

1194
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,952
Fourth one today.

1195
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,204
Ben would have a cow.

1196
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,584
Last time I snuck
a cigarette

1197
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,128
was with Diana --
bra shopping.

1198
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:25,509
Who gives a shit, anyway?

1199
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:34,601
What?

1200
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:35,978
Speak.

1201
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,481
I don't know.

1202
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:41,942
Sometimes I just -- I --

1203
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:44,653
I look at you guys,
and I --

1204
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:47,364
You wonder why the hell
we're together.

1205
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,782
Thank you.

1206
01:05:56,373 --> 01:06:00,335
When I go to bed at night,
I do four things --

1207
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:03,255
I drop my robe,
slide under the sheets,

1208
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:06,133
turn on my left side,
and stick out my ass.

1209
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:07,634
That's it.
That's the signal.

1210
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:10,470
I just --
I back it right up there

1211
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:11,847
because I know when I do,

1212
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,057
no matter how cold
the damn thing is,

1213
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:16,310
no matter how difficult
it might feel,

1214
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:19,271
no matter how desperately
we want to kill each other,

1215
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:22,232
it's gonna be met by this warm
body on the other side

1216
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,151
that's gonna hold it.

1217
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:27,863
Two arms that.wrap around,
pull me out of my head,

1218
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,699
quiet the voices,
save me from myself,

1219
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:34,828
without ever having to ask.

1220
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:39,708
Every night, 3 1 years.

1221
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:43,795
Every night there's my ass,
and every night.

1222
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,507
he never lets me down.

1223
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,678
You find your home,

1224
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:53,764
and it may not be
what you thought it --

1225
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:56,808
you know, color's off,
style's wrong --

1226
01:06:56,892 --> 01:06:58,602
but there it is, anyway,

1227
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:02,147
and to hell with you
if you can't take a joke.

1228
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,444
You find your home.

1229
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,363
Ben's mine.

1230
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:15,244
Damned if Diana didn't ask
that same thing

1231
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,954
four weeks ago.

1232
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:21,792
Saw her today.

1233
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,752
Who?

1234
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:26,880
Diana. At the Fotomat.
Girl behind the counter.

1235
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,466
Definite 8, possible 9.

1236
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,052
The chin.

1237
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,012
The eyes.

1238
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:36,390
Even had her ears.

1239
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:43,146
lt stopped my fucking heart.

1240
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:49,695
How much longer do you think
this is gonna go on?

1241
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:51,905
I mean, if that woman doesn't
come out of her coma soon,

1242
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:54,199
I'm gonna go down there
and beat her out of it.

1243
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:57,661
Can't take it much longer.

1244
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,914
You look as wiped out
as I feel,

1245
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,501
you lucky bastard.

1246
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:06,712
Don't let me keep you.

1247
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,716
Good night, Jo.

1248
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,467
Good night, Joe.

1249
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:20,058
Hey.

1250
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,687
lsn't it the tits you and I
have the same name?

1251
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,606
I know we've never
acknowledged it.

1252
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:28,483
lt is.

1253
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,819
lt certainly is.

1254
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,572
Good night.

1255
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,032
Night.

1256
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,785
Ah!

1257
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:21,203
Jesus!

1258
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:24,122
What are you, 16?

1259
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,682
# <i>I'll be your man</i> #

1260
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:48,730
# <i>I'll understand</i> #

1261
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,988
# <i>Do my best to take</i> #

1262
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,282
# <i>Good care of you</i> #

1263
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,246
# <i>Yes, I will</i> #

1264
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:08,333
# <i>You'll be my queen</i> #

1265
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:16,425
# <i>I'll be your king</i> #

1266
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:26,602
# <i>And I'll be</i>
<i>your lover, too</i> #

1267
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,356
# <i>Yes, I will</i> #

1268
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:36,987
# <i>Derry down green</i> #

1269
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:44,494
# <i>Color of my dreams</i> #

1270
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:47,873
Please let me see you.

1271
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:50,834
# <i>A dream that's daily</i> #

1272
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,169
I want to see you.

1273
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,337
# <i>Coming true</i> #

1274
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:00,093
# <i>I tell you</i> #

1275
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:03,889
# <i>When day is through</i> #

1276
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,853
# <i>I will come to you</i> #

1277
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,444
# <i>And tell you of</i> #

1278
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,531
# <i>Your many charms</i> #

1279
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:30,290
# <i>And you</i> --
<i>you'll look at me</i> #

1280
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:37,256
# <i>With eyes that see</i> #

1281
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:44,805
# <i>And melt into</i> #

1282
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:47,808
# <i>Each other's arms</i> #

1283
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:57,067
# <i>And so I come</i> #

1284
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:04,199
# <i>To be the one</i> #

1285
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:11,373
# <i>Who's always standing</i> #

1286
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,795
# <i>Next to you</i> #

1287
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,465
# <i>Ohh</i> #

1288
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:22,426
Why me?

1289
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:24,970
# <i>Reach out for me</i> #

1290
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:31,643
# <i>So I can be</i> #

1291
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,479
# <i>All right</i> #

1292
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:38,192
# <i>The one who's always</i> #

1293
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:41,195
# <i>Reaching out for you</i> #

1294
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,490
# <i>Yes, I will</i> #

1295
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:46,825
# <i>Yes, I will</i> #

1296
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:51,663
# <i>You'll be my queen</i> #

1297
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,587
# <i>I'll be your king</i> #

1298
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:08,722
# <i>And I'll be your lover, too</i> #

1299
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,731
Door's easier.

1300
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:23,111
Hope she's nice.

1301
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,030
ls she nice, Joe?

1302
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:31,703
You know what kills me?
I knew.

1303
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:34,289
I knew. I knew in my --

1304
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:37,501
I saw it in Diana's face,
and I didn't ask,

1305
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:40,671
and she couldn't tell me,
and now she's --

1306
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:43,507
And you're --

1307
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,093
lt isn't gonna happen,
is it, Joe?

1308
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,594
I mean, you two --

1309
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:50,430
You weren't gonna happen,
were you?

1310
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:53,642
Huh?

1311
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:58,438
You know, the thing is --
you know, this next part?

1312
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,190
I know that it's supposed
to happen --

1313
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:03,986
this, you know, you with
another -- you -- you know.

1314
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:06,738
But I just -- I --
I-I'm not ready.

1315
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,448
I'm just not ready.

1316
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:13,495
You're gonna be leaving
and

1317
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:14,955
Look at me.
Look at this.

1318
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,957
Oh, yeah.

1319
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:20,085
June 6, 1 966 --

1320
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:23,088
my last blast.

1321
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:25,674
Fucked that up
pretty good here, huh?

1322
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:28,510
Oh, God.

1323
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:33,932
Mm, this was the only thing
before the girl that --

1324
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:39,396
only way Ben and I survived
under one roof.

1325
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,482
Now.

1326
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:45,444
you're gonna go.

1327
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:01,210
I don't know where she is.

1328
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:04,713
Everybody says
that they do.

1329
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:09,009
But I don't know.

1330
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:12,346
And I'm scared
for my baby.

1331
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:17,976
And it's killing me 'cause
not knowing, and I --

1332
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,228
I can't.

1333
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:20,896
I just can't.

1334
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,315
I can't do anything.

1335
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:25,943
Everything was for her.

1336
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,903
Everything for her,
for her --

1337
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:30,656
the writing -- everything --
and now I don't --

1338
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:34,451
Oh, God, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1339
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:36,912
What are we gonna do, Joe?

1340
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:39,623
I don't know.

1341
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,834
Oh, God!

1342
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,919
Oh, what am I gonna do?

1343
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,282
Huh?! I'm asking you a question!

1344
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,658
Leave me alone!

1345
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:58,202
Look at me, then.

1346
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,203
Stop it!

1347
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:00,746
That's weak -- weak!

1348
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,874
We gonna go -- we gonna go
back to this every morning,

1349
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:06,043
is that it, huh?
ls that it?

1350
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,295
Huh?!

1351
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:11,256
Don't you fall apart
on me now.

1352
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,092
Not now! Please.

1353
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:17,054
lt wasn't her, Ben.

1354
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:18,180
What?

1355
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,891
lt wasn't her fault, Ben.

1356
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:25,562
She was --

1357
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,314
Ben, JoJo was upset --

1358
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:30,150
She -- She was upset
because --

1359
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:31,151
What?

1360
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:33,278
Because Diana and I
weren't --

1361
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,374
Hello?

1362
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,378
Uh-huh.

1363
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:51,171
Uh-huh.

1364
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:58,971
When?

1365
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:04,768
I got the call myself
at 6:30 this morning.

1366
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,187
First words out of her mouth
were his name.

1367
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:08,480
ls she out of her mind?

1368
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:10,983
Ben, the woman has two bullets
in her brain.

1369
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,317
What does this suggest?

1370
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,528
She's gonna testify
for the defense.

1371
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,488
She's backing up insanity.

1372
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:19,449
Claims he quit taking his meds
a week before the shooting.

1373
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:24,913
The things we do for love.

1374
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:30,043
So, at this point,
we've really got no choice

1375
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,254
but to press on.

1376
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,548
Any more delays,
they scream due process,

1377
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:38,010
and God knows we can't let 'em
slide on that bullshit.

1378
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:43,932
All of which means that
the pressure falls on you.

1379
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:49,313
Now, I can tell you.
from experience

1380
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:51,106
that seeing your faces
up there

1381
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,733
front and center
every minute,

1382
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:55,194
day in and day out,
this weighs on the judge.

1383
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,989
Whether or not he or she
will ever admit it,

1384
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:00,574
it's a simple fact.

1385
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:03,869
So I'm gonna need you
to be there.

1386
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:06,121
I'm gonna need your help.

1387
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:08,123
I'm gonna need you
to be there, all of you,

1388
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:11,460
for the duration,

1389
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:13,670
for your daughter.

1390
01:19:48,372 --> 01:19:49,915
What is wrong
with you people?!

1391
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,668
How hard is it
to fix a window?!

1392
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,795
How hard is it
to fix a window, huh?!

1393
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:57,548
Tell me!

1394
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,511
How hard --
Fix the window!

1395
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:05,848
Jesus Christ!

1396
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,724
What is wrong
with you people?!

1397
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:09,142
Fix the window!

1398
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,230
Floss & Son.

1399
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:15,357
Floss & Son.

1400
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,985
F-Floss & -- Flo--

1401
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:24,324
Well, I'm sorry your boss
and his wife couldn't make it.

1402
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:27,661
I was looking forward
to meeting the woman.

1403
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:30,622
I, uh, took the liberty of
filling a space here since we --

1404
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:31,957
Oh, there she is!

1405
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,667
Hi, sweetie.

1406
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,963
Joe, this is my daughter
Jillian.

1407
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,673
Jillian, say hello to Joe.

1408
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,049
Hello.

1409
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:42,968
Hi.

1410
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,929
That dress looks sensational.
A little gift.

1411
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:48,390
Jillian had a birthday
last week.

1412
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:49,933
ls that right?

1413
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:51,935
Yeah.

1414
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,770
When's your birthday,
Joe?

1415
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:55,814
Uh, December, actually.

1416
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:57,566
Oh, is that right?

1417
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,485
Only seven months apart.

1418
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,071
Oh.
Well, that's interesting.

1419
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:08,327
You know, Joe,
I was actually your age

1420
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,204
when I met JilI's father.

1421
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:14,041
Right. Well, stranger things
have happened.

1422
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:16,835
Oh.

1423
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,295
So, Mike, uh, tells us

1424
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:21,673
you are making your way
in the world of real estate.

1425
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,967
Oh, well,
that's being generous.

1426
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:28,931
Must keep you very busy.
You must value your free time.

1427
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:30,390
Free time?

1428
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:32,935
You know, going out,
recreation.

1429
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,102
I --

1430
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:36,563
Uh, not of late, no.

1431
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:37,856
No?

1432
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,066
Yeah.

1433
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:43,320
Lately I've been a little,
uh, preoccupied.

1434
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:45,864
Oh, I see. Other interests.

1435
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,824
My fiancé's death.

1436
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:54,873
I didn't realize you were still
involved in.that.

1437
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:57,125
Beg your pardon?

1438
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,044
Well, Mike, um --

1439
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:03,507
Mike didn't tell me
that you were --

1440
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,635
He didn't tell me that you were
still tied up in all of that.

1441
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,679
Really?

1442
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:09,763
No.

1443
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,266
Well, you know,
it was kind of a deal,

1444
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:13,392
the whole thing.

1445
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:14,893
The clean-up alone took days.

1446
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:17,604
You'd be amazed at what a mess
a high-caliber weapon can make,

1447
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:19,982
and in a restaurant,
all those little pieces of --

1448
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,818
all of -- well, anyway,
let's just say

1449
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:24,194
it was pretty time-consuming.

1450
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:26,280
Then you got the whole burial
to deal with.

1451
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:27,698
This whole coffin business --

1452
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,658
much more complicated
than people think.

1453
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:31,285
Standard sizes?
Dream on.

1454
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:33,287
Had to custom-fit
the whole deal.

1455
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,831
Had a tailor come out, do her
sizes right then and there.

1456
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:38,083
Do you know how hard it is
to have a tailor come out

1457
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,418
to do house calls?

1458
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:40,335
And on a school night?

1459
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:41,670
I mean

1460
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,839
this is pulling teeth,
you know what I'm saying?

1461
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,174
And then, you know,

1462
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:48,010
of course, you got the house
to deal with,

1463
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,804
and that's a whole other ordeal,
you know?

1464
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,515
'Cause who wants her stuff
around, right?

1465
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,518
I mean, that's a valuable room.
Why waste it?

1466
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,730
So, you slog through that
and, yeah, next thing you know,

1467
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:03,192
a couple weeks have gone by,
and you're thinking to yourself,

1468
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:06,028
"Man, oh, man, am I still
tied up with all this?

1469
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:08,363
Where did the time go?"

1470
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,881
# <i>Hey!</i> #

1471
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:27,716

What?

1475
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:52,616
Whoo!

1476
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,284
Oh!

1477
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:59,414
# <i>Hey!</i> #

01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:07,714

# <i>Uh!</i> #

1482
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:12,052
# <i>Ah!</i> #

1483
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:14,429
Can I help you?

1484
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,392
Soda.

1485
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:20,102
Sure.

1486
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:31,572
# <i>Hey!</i> #

1487
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,668
Ben?

1488
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:50,591
Ben?

1489
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,802
Have a seat.

1490
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,612
I'm.thinking
maybe some light.

1491
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,155
What do you think, Ben?

1492
01:25:13,197 --> 01:25:15,490
You want to tell me
what's going on, Joe?

1493
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:21,079
Explain to me why
I look like such an idiot,

1494
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:24,249
Mike Mu-- Mulcahey calling
to tell me how sorry he was

1495
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:27,503
the deal didn't.
make.

1496
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:29,671
What the hell did you do
over there, Joe?

1497
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,757
You were just supposed to
have dinner.

1498
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,883
I'm sorry.

1499
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:35,093
You ended it.
You killed it right there.

1500
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:37,763
You told him
the bar was off the table.

1501
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:38,805
I did.

1502
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:40,390
Without
even consulting me.

1503
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:44,436
You, who know dick,
shit about this business.

1504
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,190
You think that's the way
partners behave?

1505
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:49,733
I'm not your partner,
Ben.

1506
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:51,527
Then whose name
is on the sign?

1507
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:52,903
This isn't about business.

1508
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:54,363
Oh. Then, what was it?

1509
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:56,865
What makes you give
a red goddamn cent

1510
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:59,618
about a bar in a town
you don't even know?

1511
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,995
This isn't your home.
These aren't your people.

1512
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,540
So why do you
give a shit?

1513
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,542
I mean,
there's no reason.

1514
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:08,919
not to move the bar,
is there, Joe?

1515
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:10,212
Huh?

1516
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:13,924
This whole thing
was a mistake.

1517
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:16,009
God, yes.
I trusted you.

1518
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:17,219
I'm sorry.

1519
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:18,971
Look, you tell me
what's really going on.

1520
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:23,642
You need to help me understand
what's happening here.

1521
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:25,435
-- Huh?
-- I want.

1522
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:26,728
Sit down!

1523
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,398
You got something going
with that girl?

1524
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:30,607
Hmm?

1525
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:34,152
I-I-I wanted
to tell you before, and --

1526
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,321
Y-You tell me now.

1527
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:39,116
Please listen to me.

1528
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:43,078
Diana and I --

1529
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,246
Don't say her name.

1530
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:46,123
Diana --

1531
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,541
<i>Don't</i> say her name.

1532
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:49,626
We weren't close.

1533
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:51,128
I'm sorry, Ben.

1534
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,963
Please don't.

1535
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:54,756
That's why
she wanted to meet you.

1536
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,924
Shh, shh, shh.

1537
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,093
I'm so sorry.

1538
01:27:03,432 --> 01:27:06,268
Oh, don't, don't.

1539
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:07,306
Okay,
let's talk about this.

1540
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:09,391
We, uh.

1541
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:11,518
We're in a spot here,
Joe.

1542
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:14,855
That asshole just became
a loving husband.

1543
01:29:14,897 --> 01:29:17,357
right in front
of our eyes.

1544
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,610
And if we don't launch back
with something serious here,

1545
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:22,237
I do believe
we're screwed.

1546
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,448
And.

1547
01:29:24,531 --> 01:29:27,910
I know that's not what
you want for these people.

1548
01:29:27,993 --> 01:29:31,538
Now.
if I had one wish,

1549
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:34,082
any wish at all here,

1550
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:37,127
it would be that I could bring
Diana into that courtroom.

1551
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:40,297
Now, obviously, that's not
gonna happen, and trust me,

1552
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,467
the defense is desperate
not to have it happen.

1553
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,595
They want to keep her
as far away as possible,

1554
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:51,433
keep her from having
any dimension to that judge.

1555
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:53,769
But that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

1556
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:56,146
She's got to breathe
in there.

1557
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:59,024
He's got to see her
and know her

1558
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,278
and realize
what was taken here.

1559
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:04,905
So.

1560
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:08,200
I don't know any other way
to do this.

1561
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:13,664
I think
I need your help.

1562
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:18,293
I need you
to bring her in the room.

1563
01:30:18,377 --> 01:30:19,545
Testify?

1564
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:20,796
Mm-hmm.

1565
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:27,261
How -- How do I --

1566
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,598
What am I
supposed to say?

1567
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:35,060
Say what you felt --
your life was taken away here.

1568
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,688
This man
stole your bride.

1569
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:41,525
The judge
needs to know that.

1570
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:43,485
Can you do this?

1571
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:07,718
How dare you!

1572
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:10,179
How dare you
treat me like this!

1573
01:31:10,262 --> 01:31:12,890
I haven't let a man touch me
in three years.

1574
01:31:12,973 --> 01:31:14,016
Look at me.

1575
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:16,435
And I'm finally
right here, Joe.

1576
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,187
And what?

1577
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:19,688
Now
I'm a one-night stand?

1578
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:21,732
I have to look
into her father's eyes

1579
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:23,942
and see you haven't said
a thing about me?

1580
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:25,277
Do you know
how ashamed I am?

1581
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,321
It's so complicated
right now.

1582
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:28,864
So that means you hide?

1583
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,199
This can't be you.

1584
01:31:30,282 --> 01:31:31,867
I can't be
both these things.

1585
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:32,993
Well, try being one.

1586
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:34,286
I c-- I can't do this.

1587
01:31:36,246 --> 01:31:38,582
I can't do this.

1588
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:40,626
You think if you just
run around fast enough,

1589
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,169
figure out
what everyone wants,

1590
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,213
no one's gonna notice
what a coward you are?

1591
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:46,048
Are you that scared?

1592
01:31:46,131 --> 01:31:47,925
You sleep in that house,
you eat their food,

1593
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:50,052
you act like every day's
just another Sunday,

1594
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:51,678
you think
if you just keep it up,

1595
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:54,431
these people won't notice
their daughter's missing?

1596
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:56,600
What are we doing
that's so different?

1597
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,393
Lend a hand, Bertie.

1598
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,937
There's not a body
in that bar

1599
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,397
that thinks that Cal McGinnis
is ever coming home.

1600
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:04,191
You think I don't know
that you're never gonna

1601
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:06,610
make room in your life for
someone who wants to know you

1602
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,612
better than 60 lousy percent?

1603
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:13,575
It's the last 40
that counts.

1604
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,995
Where'd you go, Joe?

1605
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,417
I'm.

1606
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:27,339
.right here.

1607
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:18,307
Joseph Nast.

1608
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,809
N-A-S-T.

1609
01:33:20,893 --> 01:33:23,228
Please be seated.

1610
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:24,730
Mr. Nast --

1611
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:27,357
May I call you "Joe"?

1612
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:30,485
Joe? Uh, yes.

1613
01:33:30,569 --> 01:33:33,322
Joe, you knew the victim,
Diana Floss, did you not?

1614
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:34,865
Yes.

1615
01:33:34,948 --> 01:33:37,492
Would you please describe the
nature of your relationship?

1616
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:39,828
I -- uh.

1617
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,747
We were engaged.

1618
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,166
Engaged to be married?

1619
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:45,167
Yes.

1620
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:47,753
How long
were you together?

1621
01:33:54,051 --> 01:33:57,471
Uh, three years -- uh, clo--
uh, close to three years.

1622
01:33:57,513 --> 01:34:00,599
That's a long time.

1623
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:01,725
Yes.

1624
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:04,144
What were your plans
for afterwards?

1625
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:09,858
After the wedding,
I mean.

1626
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:12,945
Honeymoon?

1627
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:15,864
No, the -- the future.

1628
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:18,242
We, uh, we'd been.

1629
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,786
we'd been planning
to stay in town,

1630
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:23,789
and, uh.I was planning
to go into business with Ben.

1631
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:30,254
Uh, uh, with, uh, her.
with her father.

1632
01:34:30,337 --> 01:34:34,550
And that would be a.
commercial-realty business?

1633
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:36,426
Yes.

1634
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:38,053
Have you always
had this interest

1635
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:39,304
in commercial real estate?

1636
01:34:39,388 --> 01:34:40,305
No.

1637
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:42,432
Then why would you do it?

1638
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:44,726
lt was.
what they needed.

1639
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:46,061
Who?

1640
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:48,730
Ben and Diana.

1641
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:51,066
Well,
that's quite a commitment.

1642
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:53,110
You must have cared for her
a great deal

1643
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:56,029
to make
that kind of sacrifice.

1644
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:57,865
Didn't you, Joe?

1645
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:01,076
Stop it.

1646
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:03,245
You're gonna blow
this whole thing right now.

1647
01:35:03,328 --> 01:35:05,873
Look at me.

1648
01:35:05,956 --> 01:35:08,625
Joe, when Diana was killed,

1649
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:11,336
how far away were you
from the actual wedding date?

1650
01:35:14,506 --> 01:35:17,050
When was the wedding
scheduled for, Joe?

1651
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:20,637
Joe?

1652
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:23,307
Joe?

1653
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,391
What?

1654
01:35:24,474 --> 01:35:25,934
-- The wedding.
-- What wedding?

1655
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:27,436
-- Your wedding.
-- My wedding?

1656
01:35:27,477 --> 01:35:30,439
Uh, it -- it was, uh.

1657
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:34,443
I-I'm -- I'm sorry.
I can't -- I can't do this.

1658
01:35:34,484 --> 01:35:36,445
I can't -- I didn't --
it didn't happen.

1659
01:35:36,486 --> 01:35:38,322
W-We loved each other,
we broke it off.

1660
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,991
Jesus, if I don't
say this now, it'll nev--

1661
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,910
She'll never be a part of this.

1662
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:44,578
What are we --
What are we doing here?

1663
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,955
I don't even --
I don't even know this guy.

1664
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:48,874
She -- She didn't even
know this guy.

1665
01:35:48,957 --> 01:35:50,459
What's he got to do
with her? I do--

1666
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,377
Look, you asked me
to bring her in the room,

1667
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:53,837
and she's not here --
she's not.

1668
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:55,088
And whatever happens here,

1669
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,216
whatever happens to this guy,
she's not here.

1670
01:35:57,299 --> 01:36:00,260
And the only way that
you're gonna bring her in here

1671
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:02,304
is with the truth.

1672
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:04,431
I don't know --
I don't know what else to say.

1673
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:06,642
You just tell me what to say,
I swear I'll try,

1674
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:08,810
but if you want her,
you got to keep it honest.

1675
01:36:08,894 --> 01:36:11,188
You have to understand
that Diana had this thing,

1676
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:13,357
this way of bringing out
the real in people,

1677
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,901
not just the best,
you know -- their honesty.

1678
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:18,111
And I guess she's doing it again
now, 'cause there's no way

1679
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:20,030
that I would be sitting here
saying these things

1680
01:36:20,113 --> 01:36:21,740
I can't believe
are coming out of my mouth.

1681
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:24,493
lt was Diana
who finally had the courage.

1682
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,578
<i>She</i> was the one
who told <i>me</i>

1683
01:36:26,662 --> 01:36:29,331
that I didn't want
to go through with it.

1684
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:32,167
And I guess she's --
she's doing it again,

1685
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:34,294
cause all this --
all of this

1686
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:37,422
is everything
that she wouldn't want.

1687
01:36:37,506 --> 01:36:40,759
She wasn't a bride-to-be.
She wasn't a victim.

1688
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:44,304
She was strong and real
and messed up

1689
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:48,559
and wickedly honest,
just like her mother.

1690
01:36:48,642 --> 01:36:51,562
And if I sit here trying to
paint it any other way, I.

1691
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:54,565
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I just -- I thought --

1692
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:58,277
I thought
that if I could just.

1693
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,362
I thought
that if I could just.

1694
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:03,490
paint the pictures that
you needed, you know, that.

1695
01:37:03,574 --> 01:37:05,659
that somehow.

1696
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:09,079
that somehow you'd bring these
people some peace, finally,

1697
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:11,582
and they'd have
their daughter back, or.

1698
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:16,211
But, uh.

1699
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:18,755
that's not
how she'd want to be.

1700
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:26,096
The truth is hard.

1701
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:28,265
Sometimes it looks so wrong,
you know --

1702
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:31,393
the color's off, the style's
wrong, but I guess it --

1703
01:37:35,063 --> 01:37:37,900
I guess it's where
the good ones live.

1704
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:52,706
<i>Bachelorette number two.</i>

1705
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:54,249
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

1706
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,876
<i>And number three.</i>

1707
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,450
<i>Dear Bertie...</i>

1708
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:32,037
<i>you asked me before</i>
<i>where I went.</i>

1709
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,456
<i>And I want to tell you.</i>

1710
01:38:38,627 --> 01:38:41,922
<i>I went to a place</i>
<i>where nothing's right,</i>

1711
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:45,926
<i>where every word hurts,</i>
<i>every moment's backwards,</i>

1712
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:49,429
<i>every sky's without color,</i>
<i>without hope.</i>

1713
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:55,519
<i>I tried to come back, Bertie.</i>

1714
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:57,479
<i>But I got lost.</i>

1715
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:06,989
# <i>The summer had inhaled</i>
<i>and held its breath too long</i> #

1716
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:09,741
<i>And while I was gone,</i>
<i>I met you.</i>

1717
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:12,870
# <i>The winter looked the same</i>
<i>as if it never had gone</i> #

1718
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:15,789
<i>And I didn't even have the</i>
<i>courage to realize I was home.</i>

1719
01:39:15,831 --> 01:39:19,084
# <i>And through an open window</i>
<i>where no curtain hung</i> #

1720
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,754
<i>A wise friend of mine told me,</i>
<i>"We all have our homes. "</i>

1721
01:39:22,838 --> 01:39:24,673
<i>And now I know it's true.</i>

1722
01:39:24,756 --> 01:39:26,425
# <i>I saw you</i> #

1723
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:29,386
<i>I hope you get this letter,</i>
<i>Bertie.</i>

1724
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:31,346
# <i>I saw you</i> #

1725
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:34,641
<i>I figure I got 7 5 chances.</i>

1726
01:39:34,683 --> 01:39:37,561
# <i>Comin' back to me</i> #

1727
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:39,771
<i>'Cause if you do,</i>
<i>you'll know that in the end,</i>

1728
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:41,773
<i>that's where I was.</i>

1729
01:39:41,857 --> 01:39:45,819
# <i>Small things like reasons</i>
<i>are put in a jar</i> #

1730
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:47,738
<i>I found home, Bertie.</i>

1731
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:51,825
# <i>Whatever happened to wishes</i>
<i>wished on a star?</i> #

1732
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:55,078
<i>I found you.</i>

1733
01:39:55,162 --> 01:39:57,998
# <i>Was it just something</i>
<i>that I made up for fun?</i> #

1734
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,417
<i>I hope</i>
<i>you can find yours soon.</i>

1735
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:04,463
# <i>I saw you</i> #

1736
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:08,133
<i>Get there</i> --
<i>as fast as you can.</i>

1737
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:10,677
# <i>I saw you</i> #

1738
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,972
<i>And write me when you do.</i>

1739
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:16,517
# <i>Comin' back to me</i> #

1740
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,395
<i>Love, Joe.</i>

1741
01:40:31,323 --> 01:40:33,325
# <i>Mm</i>-<i>hmm</i> #

1742
01:40:45,754 --> 01:40:48,757
lf I'm making too much noise,
tough shit.

1743
01:40:54,555 --> 01:40:55,764
Can you believe it?

1744
01:40:55,848 --> 01:40:58,183
It's really good to see,
JoJo.

1745
01:40:58,267 --> 01:41:01,770
Woke up at 5:00, and the
weirdest thing happened --

1746
01:41:01,854 --> 01:41:05,274
I had this.
this image.

1747
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:07,276
this.thought.

1748
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:10,404
and I was actually able
to hold on to it.

1749
01:41:10,445 --> 01:41:13,115
Hold on to it --
do you know how long --

1750
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:15,659
I mean, God knows
how long it's been.

1751
01:41:15,742 --> 01:41:17,953
The specifics are back,
Joe.

1752
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:21,331
So I'm --
I'm doing an accounting,

1753
01:41:21,415 --> 01:41:23,959
the real her,
the Diana facts.

1754
01:41:26,879 --> 01:41:28,547
"Number 92 --

1755
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:32,301
laughed like a pig,
full-throated, nasal snorts."

1756
01:41:32,342 --> 01:41:36,388
Huh? I mean, this is the stuff.
<i>This</i> is the stuff.

1757
01:41:36,471 --> 01:41:39,308
Fuck the perfume.
Give me the warts.

1758
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,309
You.

1759
01:41:41,518 --> 01:41:44,563
Ew, those really ratty sandals
she always loved to wear.

1760
01:41:44,646 --> 01:41:46,607
They always made
this incredible farting sound

1761
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:48,525
every time she moved.

1762
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:50,652
Oh, yes.

1763
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:53,030
Ohh.

1764
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:54,740
Ohh. 

1765
01:41:56,742 --> 01:41:59,244
Yeah.

1766
01:41:59,328 --> 01:42:02,456
You did such a good thing,
Joe Bob.

1767
01:42:02,497 --> 01:42:07,836
You gave us all.
a real big truth enema --

1768
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,422
little Roto-Rooter
for the head

1769
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:13,467
and a hell of a show
of.

1770
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:19,223
So.what excuse have I got
not to go back to work, huh?

1771
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:23,060
Screw the verdict,
whatever it is.

1772
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,103
I'm back in action.

1773
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:32,819
I love you, Joseph.

1774
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:52,756
# <i>Buckets of rain,</i>
<i>buckets of tears</i> #

1775
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,509
# <i>Got all them buckets</i>

1776
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:57,845
# <i>Buckets of moonbeams...</i> #

1777
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:00,889
Morning.

1778
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:02,015
Morning.

1779
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:04,518
# <i>You got all the love,</i>
<i>honey baby, I can stand</i> #

1780
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,687
Morning.

1781
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:08,313
Morning.

1782
01:43:08,397 --> 01:43:10,482
Uh, two vanilla cones.

1783
01:43:10,566 --> 01:43:13,402
And pack 'em tight.

1784
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:18,115
Sir, it's, uh.
it's only 90 cents.

1785
01:43:18,198 --> 01:43:19,116
That's right.

1786
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,701
Now,
you take that 90 cents,

1787
01:43:20,784 --> 01:43:24,454
and with the rest of the change,
buy yourself a new window.

1788
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:26,498
My treat.

1789
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:28,792
# <i>I've seen pretty people</i>

1790
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:30,294
# <i>Friends will arrive</i> #

1791
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:32,296
# <i>Friends will disappear</i> #

1792
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:38,093
# <i>lf you want me,</i>
<i>honey baby, I'll be here</i> #

1793
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:49,646
Hey, Joe.

1794
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,273
Hey.

1795
01:43:55,694 --> 01:43:58,488
Wow. So much
for arts and crafts, huh?

1796
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:01,575
You're welcome to keep that
as a souvenir.

1797
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:03,952
Oh, please,
who was I kidding?

1798
01:44:04,036 --> 01:44:06,288
He was never
gonna cut me in.

1799
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,749
I may be naive,
but I'm not an idiot.

1800
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,417
Did you see this?

1801
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:13,712
Deal was already in place
four counties over.

1802
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:16,673
The turncoats.
ride again.

1803
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:20,219
Oh, I don't know, Joe.

1804
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:23,555
lf I helped Mulcahey
carve this town up,

1805
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:27,476
it'd only be so I wouldn't
have to see it look the same.

1806
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,478
I mean, how.

1807
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:31,855
how <i>can</i> it now
without her?

1808
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,025
Then you get to thinking --

1809
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:37,819
who the hell wants to buy milk
and tube socks

1810
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:38,987
on the same aisle?

1811
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:41,907
What is this, Russia?
We're Americans, damn it.

1812
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:44,535
I <i>like</i> getting in my car
to drive 30 feet.

1813
01:44:44,618 --> 01:44:47,871
To hell with them.

1814
01:44:49,706 --> 01:44:52,501
lt was fun being partners
for a while, wasn't it?

1815
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:56,839
You figure out your next
venture, I'm available.

1816
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,715
-- Hmm?
-- Yeah.

1817
01:45:00,175 --> 01:45:01,802
I'm great in a crisis.

1818
01:45:01,844 --> 01:45:03,262
You're closing up?

1819
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:07,140
Oh.trust me, you should
have seen JoJo's face.

1820
01:45:07,182 --> 01:45:10,602
I think <i>I</i> was more surprised
than <i>she</i> was.

1821
01:45:10,686 --> 01:45:13,438
I think
that's why I'm doing it.

1822
01:45:29,955 --> 01:45:32,332
When Diana was too young
to remember.

1823
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:38,172
she used to come in here
every Tuesday.

1824
01:45:38,213 --> 01:45:42,676
and spill a cone from that
wonderful place over there

1825
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:45,762
and spin in this chair
for hours.

1826
01:45:47,514 --> 01:45:49,558
That was it.

1827
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:51,935
That was Dad to her.

1828
01:45:55,939 --> 01:46:00,402
I wish I could say that
that changed when she got older.

1829
01:46:03,989 --> 01:46:05,991
But I don't think
I let it.

1830
01:46:08,702 --> 01:46:10,913
She knew me here.

1831
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:18,879
So somehow,
when all this crap happened.

1832
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:21,131
the thought
of <i>not</i> being here,

1833
01:46:21,215 --> 01:46:23,592
not working,
not  having you --

1834
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:27,846
how else
is she going to know me?

1835
01:46:30,307 --> 01:46:32,434
But then
you get to thinking.

1836
01:46:32,518 --> 01:46:36,104
maybe that's just
another one of the ways

1837
01:46:36,188 --> 01:46:39,650
they tell you
you have to avoid things,

1838
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:42,277
you know,
like those, uh --

1839
01:46:42,361 --> 01:46:43,695
Oh, thank you.

1840
01:46:43,779 --> 01:46:48,534
You know, those damn books
that JoJo loves to barbecue.

1841
01:46:53,872 --> 01:46:55,791
I can't keep her here.

1842
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:58,043
It's not what she needs.

1843
01:47:00,087 --> 01:47:02,172
Won't change the ending.

1844
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:04,424
I can't keep you either.

1845
01:47:06,718 --> 01:47:08,846
Maybe if it's okay,
I can say to you

1846
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:11,515
something I didn't get
a chance to say to her.

1847
01:47:14,017 --> 01:47:15,644
Okay.

1848
01:47:25,904 --> 01:47:27,656
Go.

1849
01:47:32,703 --> 01:47:34,496
Go.

1850
01:48:16,246 --> 01:48:19,208
# <i>And I will stroll</i>
<i>the merry way</i> #

1851
01:48:19,249 --> 01:48:21,043
# <i>And jump the hedges first</i> #

1852
01:48:23,462 --> 01:48:26,423
# <i>And I will drink</i>
<i>the clear, clean water</i> #

1853
01:48:26,507 --> 01:48:28,759
# <i>For to quench my thirst</i> #

1854
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:34,932
# <i>And I shall watch</i>
<i>the ferryboats</i> #

1855
01:48:35,015 --> 01:48:38,519
# <i>And then I'll get high</i> #

1856
01:48:41,647 --> 01:48:46,860
# <i>On a bluer ocean</i>
<i>against tomorrow's sky</i> #

1857
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:53,575
# <i>And I will never grow</i>
<i>so old again</i> #

1858
01:48:57,955 --> 01:49:02,793
# <i>And I will walk and talk</i>
<i>in gardens all wet with rain</i> #

1859
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:10,259
# <i>Oh, whoa</i> #

1860
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:14,763
# <i>Sweet thing,</i>
<i>you sweet thing</i> #

1861
01:49:14,847 --> 01:49:17,474
# <i>Hey, yeah</i> #

1862
01:49:17,558 --> 01:49:21,812
# <i>Sweet thing, yeah, yeah</i> #

1863
01:49:21,895 --> 01:49:25,649
# <i>Ohhhhh,</i>
<i>baby, baby, baby, baby</i> #

1864
01:49:25,732 --> 01:49:27,776
# <i>You sweet thing</i> #

1865
01:49:30,821 --> 01:49:36,660
# <i>And I shall drive my chariot</i>
<i>down your streets and cry</i> #

1866
01:49:39,162 --> 01:49:45,002
# <i>"Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite</i>
<i>and I don't know why"</i> #

1867
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:53,802
# <i>And you shall take me</i>
<i>strongly in your arms again</i> #

1868
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,976
# <i>And I will not remember</i>
<i>that I ever felt the pain</i> #

1869
01:50:03,937 --> 01:50:07,691
# <i>We shall walk and talk</i>
<i>in gardens all misty wet</i> #

1870
01:50:07,774 --> 01:50:12,696
# <i>All misty wet</i>
<i>with rain down</i> #

1871
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:19,786
# <i>And I will never, never,</i>
<i>never grow so old again</i> #

1872
01:50:19,828 --> 01:50:23,081
# <i>Oh, whoa, whoa</i> #

1873
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:26,710
# <i>You sweet thing</i> #

1874
01:50:26,793 --> 01:50:28,545
# <i>Hah</i> #

1875
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:31,340
# <i>Oh, whoa, whoa</i> #

1876

# <i>You sweet thing,</i>

<i>m</i>-<i>my, my, my, my, my</i> #

1878
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:52,236
# <i>And I will raise my hand</i>
<i>up into the nighttime sky</i> #

1879
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:00,369
# <i>And count the stars</i>
<i>that's shining in your eye</i> #

1880
01:51:01,995 --> 01:51:05,249
# <i>And just to dig it all</i>
<i>and not to wonder</i> #

1881
01:51:05,332 --> 01:51:07,626
# <i>That's just right</i> #

1882
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:12,673
# <i>And I'll be satisfied</i> #

1883
01:51:12,756 --> 01:51:16,218
# <i>Not to read</i>
<i>in between the lines</i> #

1884
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:23,225
# <i>And I will walk and talk</i>
<i>in gardens all wet with rain</i> #

1885
